      <P>Under new EC arrangements, calves and adult cattle which pass certain animal disease tests may now be imported from Britain without having to go through quarantine. The possibility of relaxing the test requirements for certain types of calves <Col N="580" /> is being examined but any change contemplated would have to be balanced against the danger of importing disease into the national herd.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> Is the Minister aware that the importation of calves from the United Kingdom would cause great danger to our national herd as far as our disease-free status is concerned, particularly in regard to foot and mouth?  Is the Minister further aware that if sanction was given by his Department it would, to a large extent, affect the sale of calves in this country, especially by dairy farmers?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>Cattle and calves imported from the UK without quarantine must have passed stringent tests for certain diseases, tuberculosis, brucellosis, leukosis, rhinotracheitis and johnnes disease.  In the case of leukosis, we demand herd freedom for three years on all adult animals and in the case of IBR we require herd freedom for six months and a 30 day test for individual animals.  These stringent rules must be complied with but I agree that the possibility of endangering the national herd is real and something we must guard against.</P>

      <P>It arose from an article in the <i>Irish Independent</i> on 10 January.

      <P>Government policy on the food industry has been set out in the national economic plan presented in <i>Building on Reality</i> and in the White Paper on Industrial Policy. The strategy as elaborated in these documents is to encourage the industry, including Siúicre Éireann, to seek out and exploit opportunities for the production of consumer-type products especially for export.  Essential features of the strategy are that all concerned learn the lessons of past commercial failures, that development is based on identified market needs and that activities operate on the principle of commercial viability.</P>

      <P>Is there a specific Government policy in relation to the Irish Sugar Company, in particular Erin Foods which has virtually been dismantled? Does the Minister consider that dismantling an existing vegetable processing industry is self-defeating because of his stated intention to establish a food processing industry in this State?</P>

      <P>The mandate which the Government have given to the Sugar Company is that they must operate on a commercial basis.  There are very generous grants available to private enterprise to become involved in the food industry. Indeed these grants can be as much as 50 per cent when one takes the contribution by the IDA and FEOGA into account. If the Sugar Company or any other semi-State commercial bodies think that they can make a go of such a project, the Government will give them their full blessing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it fair to criticise the Sugar Company in this regard.  Their methods of operation had <Col N="583" /> gone out of date and they found it impossible to reinvest to get the type of operation going which was needed to compete with other enterprises.  It has been obvious for a long time that their methods were very much out of date and that they could not hope to compete on an open market.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister satisfied with the Government's approach to the development of the food processing industry, especially in regard to vegetables, as the acreage is in decline and has been for a number of years?  The one remaining Erin Food factory in Thurles is now obliged to import the product they require for packaging in order to remain open.  Does the Minister not see that the Irish Sugar Company, which was established by the State, is the ideal vehicle for leading the development of the food processing industry?  Does the Minister agree that the Government have an obligation to invest the money required to develop that industry?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be true if the company could attain commercial viability. The food processing industry generally in this country has moved ahead in leaps and bounds in recent years.  We tend to think of food processing as consisting only of vegetables but the meat and milk processing businesses have advanced substantially.  The vegetable processing industry is particularly difficult because of the small domestic market and the tendency is for joint conglomerates in Britain and on the Continent to unload their excess production on to the <Col N="584" /> markets here, making it extremely difficult for native industries to compete. That is the real difficulty and it would take an exceptionally efficient and streamlined operation to offset those imports.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that when that company should have been making great strides in the food industry, that was the time when we imported most food products?  Now we are expecting private enterprise to take over where this company has failed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have answered that question. The fact is that their machinery and methods of operation were very out of date, particularly in recent years, and they could not hope to compete on the open market.  Quite a few new enterprises have entered that area with great success.  Two or three years ago the Department identified areas where products which were being imported could be produced and processed at home.  This meant there has been tremendous stimulus in the food processing industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister <Col N="585" /> for Agriculture if he is aware of the Donegal seed potato growers' difficulties; and the steps he proposes to take to assist them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>The adverse weather in 1985 created difficulties for seed potato growers in County Donegal.  The scheme now being introduced to provide a 5 per cent subsidy on loans for tillage farmers affected by bad weather includes potato growers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. J. Leonard Mr. J. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that this is one aspect of farming which presents a great opportunity for developing an export market?  Would he also agree that down the years the Department have been very slack because they have not pursued the export of seed potatoes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a commercial operation and I am not sure it is completely the Department's function, although it may be partially their function.  I paid a visit to Donegal two weeks ago particularly to view the seed potato industry at first hand and I am very concerned as a result of what I learned on that visit.  This business has been in serious decline for approximately 20 years.  Donegal used to export something like 70,000 to 80,000 tons of seed potatoes per annum, and their exports are now as low as 12,000 tons per annum.  There are a number of contributory factors for that, one being that the new varieties being produced in continental countries in particular are selling much better than the varieties produced at home.  We have only produced one variety of significance in recent times, known as Cara.  An Foras Talúntais, at the research station in Oakpark, Carlow, are trying very hard to produce new varieties but I believe it takes 14 years to develop a new strain of seed potatoes.  As Deputies can see, it is an enormous task to produce good new varieties and they are making encouraging progress.  I hope this will lead to a revitalisation of the seed potato industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. J. Leonard Mr. J. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister <Col N="586" /> not agree that that is an indictment of An Foras and the Department because in the late fifties and sixties when I was involved in this area there was a very remunerative export market, but over the following ten years nothing has been done about producing the new varieties which anybody could see were necessary to ensure a continuity of that market abroad?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully agree and alluded to that in my reply.  For many years not enough was done in this area and European producers of seed potatoes have taken over the market we once had.  This is very serious and we are entitled to be concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to put on record our appreciation of the Minister's visit to the Donegal farmers in the last two weeks because both side benefited.  In view of the information the Minister gathered when he visited the farmers and saw their plight at first hand, is he satisfied that the steps which have been taken are sufficient to meet the disastrous situation?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>The real problem lies with the lack of variety of new seed potatoes, and the fact that we are dependent on one variety is not good enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied that the enterprise of the Potato Marketing Board is sufficient to lift the potato industry, which is now on the floor, to the position it was in 20 years ago?  In the figures given in an earlier reply, the Minister told us about the money flow to Donegal farmers in recent years but that flow has disappeared, through no fault of theirs.  In my view, it is not sufficient to leave responsibility to the Potato Marketing Board alone; the Department must <Col N="587" /> step in and assist these people at this very vital time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>At some of the meetings I attended in Donegal, dissatisfaction with the operation of the board was expressed, but I am not sure that that criticism was justified.  I have made some inquiries and find that the board are doing their utmost to help.  However, I will be taking continued interest in this matter, as will my Minister of State, Deputy Hegarty, because we are seeing a serious reduction in the output of seed potatoes which was a major industry in Donegal.</P>

        <i>(Limerick West):</i> Would the Minister ensure that ways and means are found to see if the scheme could be extended beyond the disadvantaged areas because our national herd is at an all-time low?

    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy realises, the greater percentage of the suckler cow herd is in the disadvantaged areas.  I understand there are about 280,000 out of a total of 388,000, almost 70 per cent, in the disadvantaged areas. The Government have decided that it is most important to boost and increase as dramatically as possible the beef cow herd, and the place to start is obviously in the disadvantaged areas where the greater part of the herd is placed. Because of EC restrictions, no other member state has been allowed to extend this scheme outside the disadvantaged areas and if this scheme were extended across the country financial constraints would be involved.  This is something on which the Commission has always been very strong, as every member state knows to its cost.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there was a certain confusion in the Deputy's supplementary question.  I am talking here about the fodder scheme as distinct from the feed scheme.  Under the fodder scheme the number of applications was 58,000 and under the feed scheme the number of applications was 90,000 of which 78,000 were successful.  The Deputy may be mixing up the two schemes.  The number of applicants for the nitrogen and the silage schemes was in excess of anything <Col N="590" /> we anticipated.  When the silage scheme first operated some 8,000 applications were received and this was at a time when agriculture was at a less developed stage. On this occasion there were 34,000 applications and the Deputy will appreciate the enormity of the task of vetting all the applications.  I am glad to say that the scheme has been most successful and has done much good where there were problems with regard to fodder.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>While the two schemes are separate an anomaly has appeared recently.  Up to now the criterion used with regard to the feed scheme was quantity but now when they want to use the silage people find that the quality of the grass is bad because additives may not have been used and it is practically useless.  These people have been denied feed vouchers because the farm development officers are interested only in quantity, not quality.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if his attention has been drawn to a recent article (details supplied) which indicated that the provision of waste disposal facilities would be eligible for grant-aid; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that the recently introduced Community structural policy permits aid to be given in certain limited circumstances for poultry investments necessitated by official requirements in regard to the protection of the environment.  The new investment aid scheme to replace the farm modernisation scheme is at present being finalised. <Col N="593" /> It is not possible at this stage to indicate whether provision for aid for poultry waste facilities will be included in the scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that a serious situation has arisen in County Monaghan, which is an intensive poultry production area, especially after last year which was a bad year, with regard to the disposal of waste which is used for the fertilisation of land, as a compost for mushrooms and for animal feed.  At the moment poultry stores and yards are required to hold this material during the winter period when it is not being used.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of this matter and I am keeping it under examination, as well as other problems relating to effluent disposal and so on.  We will have to await the announcement of the new scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the planning authorities are very concerned about the matter?  At present one operator in Monaghan purchases all the waste material and sells it to different agencies.  Planning authorities had been concerned because the waste was left outside and caused pollution.  From now on it is essential that stores or yards be made available but it is not possible for the people in business to do this out of their own resources.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. D. Gallagher Mr. D. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if he is aware that the delay in payment to compensate farmers for the loss of hay and fodder is now forcing farmers to sell their stocks at a huge loss; and if he will ensure that there is no further delay with payment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11, 13 and 14 together.</P>
      <P>Feed vouchers have been issued to some 78,000 farmers in the past ten days or so and they will make a substantial contribution to alleviating the hardship caused by the bad weather conditions of last summer and autumn.</P>
      <P>There is no evidence that farmers are being forced to sell cattle because of insufficient fodder.  Indeed, cattle slaughterings since the beginning of the year are running well below the levels for the corresponding period in 1985 and this suggests that the feed voucher scheme and the other relief measures undertaken by the Government have been successful in helping farmers to overwinter stock.</P>
      <P>The suggested increase in headage payments in the disadvantaged areas would mean providing aid for a substantial number of farmers with little or no fodder problems and would cost some £28 million which, in the current Exchequer situation, it would not be possible to provide.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. D. Gallagher Mr. D. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the scheme has turned out to <Col N="596" /> be farcical in regard to the way in which payments are being made?  I am sure that all Deputies have had representations in this regard.  Would the Minister regard as acceptable a situation in which a farmer was refused payment, having bought hay, but finds that the full amount of the grant was paid to the farmer who sold the hay?  That case has been brought to my attention.  It is the result of the scheme the Minister has introduced.  Is he honest in saying that the cost of the increased headage grant would be £28 million to the State?  Does he not agree with the statement made by the IFA that the Government would only have to spend £7 million on this scheme because the farmers would be contributing £7 million while £14 million would be available from the EC?  Would that not have been a far better and much more acceptable scheme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with the Deputy's argument.  The Government would have to spend £28 million on such a scheme.  In a year's time we would be entitled to recoup half that amount from the EC but the initial outlay would be £28 million.  The Deputy asserts that this system of payment would be the most equitable way of assisting farmers.  On the contrary, that type of blanket payment would mean paying money to people irrespective of whether they had fodder problems.  The scheme I introduced is working very well.  Obviously, there will be hiccups and there will be individuals who will have grievances. They may be justified in that but it is difficult to devise a scheme involving 78,000 people that would operate in a totally uniform way.  However, if Deputies have evidence of cases in which there apear to be discrepancies they should bring these to my notice so that I might endeavour to resolve the problems involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. D. Gallagher Mr. D. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not accept that all farmers were subject to the bad weather conditions of last year and that they all experienced difficulty in providing fodder for their stocks?  By <Col N="597" /> what he has said now, is the Minister accepting that the scheme has not operated equitably and would he not reconsider the proposals of the main farming organisation to bring about a scheme that would ensure justice in terms of compensation for farmers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that the whole country was affected badly by the weather conditions of last year but some people were very well equipped to make silage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>A considerable number of people, even in the disadvantaged areas, provided for their fodder needs and I have no intention of paying out money to those who have not experienced problems in this matter.  I have stated that on numerous occasions and there is no question of my changing my mind.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to a point raised by Deputy Kirk and which I postponed answering when replying to the previous question.  The Deputy referred to late applicants, but the scheme was extended by ten days to allow late applicants to apply.  That put back accordingly the implementation of the scheme.  Also, we delayed the scheme for several weeks because we omitted straw from the equation in the calculation, as Deputy Leonard will recall from an earlier reply to him.  At a further date, we omitted from the equation bad quality hay.  Those two changes were greatly appreciated and have resulted in the more smooth operation of the scheme.  We will consider the situation at the end of the day from the point of view of what money is available and if there are cases of hardship we will examine them, even if the applications were late.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> I am amazed at the Minister.  Is he not aware that because of the very bad weather conditions even those farmers who had sophisticated equipment for the harvesting of silage were not able to gain access to their fields?  Would the Minister not <Col N="598" /> accept that they are in as much difficulty as is any farmer who did not have that equipment?  Is the Minister aware also that officials of his Department, not in all cases but in some cases, are placing more emphasis on quantity than on quality?  I brought this matter to the attention of the Minister of State, Deputy Hegarty, before Christmas and he promised to give it attention.  In terms of animal feed, quality is far more important than quantity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding the first part of the question, I did not say that merely because of having sophisticated equipment the farmers concerned would be excluded from the scheme.  What I said was that the availability of this equipment made it possible for the people concerned to make silage or hay.  Any farmer who does not have good quality hay or silage is entitled to apply for inclusion in the scheme.  They are not excluded by reason of having good quality equipment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister be prepared to examine carefully the position in regard to late applications because, despite the scheme having been well advertised, some people for one reason or another were late in applying?

Can the Minister inform us how much money has been paid to date under the feed voucher scheme and also under the Shannon Valley scheme?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I have not decided to extend it.  I visited that locality as a result of points raised by the Deputy some months ago.  I found that the flooding was not static, as in the Shannon Basin.  The problem was flash flooding which disappeared in a matter of days or hours.  I undertook to look at the basic problem which created the flooding, that is the clearing of the banks of the river and the river bed itself.</P>

      <P>I am interested in this scheme because I represent a constituency through which the great North road runs.  My constituents have been in touch with me on numerous occasions <Col N="600" /> about the virtual convoy of hay going north during the autumn.  On behalf of my constituents who are paying for this scheme through taxation, I would ask in what way does the Minister define eligibility for the fodder scheme?  To what extent, if any, can the people who exported the hay be excluded from or benefit from this scheme?</P>

I thought the Deputy was going to complain about flooding in his Dublin North-West constituency by literature from other Members of the Dáil.  The Deputy is very strong in his own right in that area.  The Deputy might have constituents who qualify for this scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12 and 28 together.  It is not correct to state that the EC intervention system for farm products is being dismantled or phased out.  A paper on the beef market organisation which the EC Commission put before the Council of Ministers suggests, among other things, that intervention for beef be used as a last resort and limited severely with effect from late 1987.  However, this paper should be seen as the initial thinking of the Commission. I would expect that the Commission will shortly be presenting detailed proposals to the Council on the operation of the beef regime.  If these proposals provide for the abolition of intervention for beef, I will be opposing them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards diversification, of course I support efforts by beef farmers to improve the efficiency of their production. The ACOT training and advisory services are geared to this end.  Moreover, the assistance of my Department <Col N="604" /> and the IDA is available for developments which expand downstream processing and make beef products more lucrative and marketable.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>We were never less in the hands of the EC.  Our beef markets abroad have expanded enormously in recent years.  A favourite theme of the Deputy's party was to call for the cessation of the exportation of cattle on the hoof.  I might point out that when we entered the EC, 70 per cent of the beef we exported was live cattle on the hoof. Nowadays that figure is as low as 10 per cent or 15 per cent.  Therefore we are making tremendous progress in that area and are depending less and less on intervention as time goes past.</P>

      <P>The general ideas on adjustment of the CAP contained in the Commission's Green Paper of last July <Col N="606" /> have been the subject of several discussions at the Council of Agricultural Ministers in the latter half of 1985.  Following these discussions as well as consultations on the Green Paper with the sectors concerned, the Commission submitted to the Council last month a communication setting out a series of guidelines for the future of European agriculture.  The Communication emphasised the need for adjustment of production in surplus sectors, including diversification of production and stressed also the income needs of small farmers, environmental requirements and the possible role of agriculture in contributing to the development of new industrial technology in the Community.  The communication was supplemented by memoranda which outlined the Commission's ideas on adjustment to the beef and cereal market organisations.</P>
      <P>At a meeting of the Council of Ministers on 20/21 January &mdash; incidentally attended by Minister of State, Deputy Hegarty &mdash; it was indicated that the Commission intended to submit concrete proposals concerning adjustments of the market organisation for cereals and beef in the first week of February together with price proposals for 1986/87.

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West)</i> asked the Minister for Agriculture the prospects he envisages for defeating the current proposals for the importation of live cattle and beef into the European Community at this time when aspects of the beef intervention system are under threat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>The several special regimes for the importation of cattle and beef into the European Community are tied to international agreements.  I have always been opposed to these imports because of the displacement effect on the EC market and I will be raising the matter again in the Council of Ministers in the context of forthcoming discussions on the future of the beef market organisation.</P>
      <P>The decision taken in the Council last week envisages a decrease in such imports in 1986 but even the reduced level was opposed by this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick West) Mr. Noonan (Limerick West)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West)</i>): Even the reduced level is still significant.  Could the Minister indicate if he will be following this positively and vigorously in the proposed agricultural price review?  After all it is very wrong that member states and producers of member states should suffer because of this agreement.  It is imperative that the Minister ensure that this system is brought to an end.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>The bulk of these products, especially the beef products, are imported into the EC under GATT agreements.  GATT agreements are internationally binding.  They are legally binding internationally.  You cannot terminate them even if you wish to.  It is the same type of agreement by which New Zealand lamb comes into the Community. It is a GATT agreement.  The best we can hope to do is by bilateral negotiations to get agreement on a reduction of the level of importation.  That type of reduction was agreed upon after a great <Col N="610" /> deal of discussion at last week's meeting of the Council of Ministers.  We are always vigilant and always lobbying to see that the level of imports of beef, both processed and live, into the EC from third countries is reduced.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if he is aware of the numerous farmers who on his advice and on the advice of the lending institutions and creameries, became involved in milk production in 1981, 1982, 1983 and who in 1983 had a very low level of production and therefore a very low quota; and the proposals he has to accommodate such farmers to achieve viability and escape bankruptcy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have sought to accommodate some of these farmers within the limited degree of flexibility available to me under the Community regulations.  In July last I established a special reserve to give additional quotas to new entrants who began milk deliveries between January 1983 and May 1984 and whose existing quotas were low.  Many of the farmers referred to are also entitled to priority in the distribution of any &ldquo;flexi-milk&rdquo; available in their areas.</P>
      <P>It should be borne in mind, however, that under the quota system any arrangement to provide extra quotas for a particular class of producers must involve making reductions in the quotas of other suppliers and clearly there must be a limit to the extent to which this can be done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  We have had several meetings with the farmers' associations and with the growers themselves.  Yes, part of it is piecemeal in that we had to start somewhere and we started in an area that was most likely to succeed, that was in the Dublin meat area.  Already we have seen some progress in Wexford, Cork and other areas and it is hoped to have an overall umbrella group and eventually that this operation, which is proving so successful in Dublin meat, will spread out into other areas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>Potato and vegetable <Col N="612" /> imports are on the downward trend and have been so since we took action, especially with regard to potatoes.  We have also set up a national potato co-operative. This started out as a producer group who found that they had marketing problems, and they have come together with a group of people on the marketing side and formed a marketing arm for this.  It is hoped that they will work in conjunction with the vegetable co-operatives to do exactly as the Deputy says.  We are having a good deal of success in the areas of ordinary vegetables.  Our biggest problem is to spread our wings in those areas of production where we are not very proficient, that is in the production of lettuce, carrots and such crops on an all the year round basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to seek guidance in regard to this motion.  There is a time-honoured tradition, and I think a Standing Order, whereby budget statements by Ministers of Finance are not allowed to be taken outside the House until the Minister had concluded.  Last year that precedent was broken because television viewers could see a Minister with the Budget Statement before him while the Minister for Finance had not concluded his statement in the House. The Opposition, particularly, are at a serious disadvantage in this regard.  It would appear to be a violation of the Standing Order and a long standing tradition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be replying to the Budget Statement tomorrow and that is why I wanted to hear what the Minister of State said in regard to this motion.  If Members are waiting to hear what the Minister will be saying tomorrow, including members of the Cabinet, is it not totally out of order for other Ministers to be presenting publicly on television programmes their interpretation of the Budget Statement before it has been delivered here?  If that is allowed, a tradition of the House is being undermined and totally ignored.  I do not think this is a matter for further consideration: it should be determined now.  Last year, <Col N="720" /> two Ministers were seen by television viewers to have copies of the Budget Statement on a public affairs programme while the Minister for Finance was delivering his speech in the House.  We should have clarification of that now.</P>

      <P>In the interest of the order of the House and the role of the House, while we are hearing the Minister for Finance reading his statement page by page, members of the Government are making statements on the budget outside the House on matters that have not been reached in the House.  In that situation what is the relevance of the House?  Last year, immediately after I left the House I was told that the whole Budget Statement had been cleared long before the Minister stood up in the House.  We must have clarification of this because otherwise we could have Ministers tomorrow doing what they did last year.  We must have agreement that there will not be statements outside on the Budget Statement.</P>

      <P>We must look at the tradition here which is time honoured. With the arrival of the broadcasting of the budget it seems irrelevant not to be allowed to take copies of the statement <Col N="721" /> out of the House.  A TV public affairs programme will come on at 3.45 p.m. and it will be very difficult for Opposition Members to go on that programme to give an analysis of the budget though it is being broadcast live from the Chamber. It is time to update our thinking on the procedure here in that respect.</P>

      <P>On the basis of precedent, you or one of your predecessors not very long ago handed down a very stringent decision &mdash; it may have been by agreement, but it was given by the Chair &mdash; that copies of the Minister's Budget Statement would be given to certain Members of the House as a concession or privilege, and in no circumstances should copies of the statement be taken outside the House before the Minister had concluded. We are putting two aspects of that before you.  Last year, two Ministers, probably without bad motives, took their copies of the statement out to RTE and they had those copies before them and were discussing them in detail before the Minister for Finance concluded his speech here.  Second, is it any longer realistic to insist on copies of the statement being kept in the House until the Minister has concluded when what the Minister is saying is going out page by page to the public over the radio?  There is an anomaly there and my colleagues would wish you to look at it.</P>

        <i>(Dún Laoghaire):</i> I suggest that the Deputies check with RTE, because that is what happens.  They are supplied with a page of the script as the Minister makes the announcement so there is no debate on matters that have not already been stated in the House. The Opposition are quite entitled to raise objections to any Member or Minister going outside debating an item that has not already been announced by the Minister.  What were debated on television and radio programmes were matters already announced by the Minister in the course of the statement.  There is nothing wrong with that.  That is what happens in the press gallery and on RTE television.  It is the only way to have a television programme.  The RTE radio programme goes live from here so one can debate a matter announced by the <Col N="723" /> Minister ten seconds after it has been announced without breaching privilege. In fairness to the Members of the House I agree that statements should not be removed from this House until the Minister has made the statement.  To afford facilities to the press one must give them copies as the Minister is making the announcement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This Bill marks another step in the implementation of the programme which the Government adopted on taking office.  That programme stated that an effective independent complaints procedure would be established to safeguard both the public and the Garda, who are often the subject of false allegations.  It also stated that, linked to that reform, legislation would be introduced to strengthen the criminal law.  The Criminal Justice Act is now on the Statute Book and I am pleased today to deliver on the second part of the undertaking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When introducing the Criminal Justice Bill the Government gave a commitment that the provisions giving increased powers to the Garda would not be brought into operation until new procedures for the handling of complaints against gardaí were in operation.  That commitment was later written into the Bill.  The Government thought it proper that there should be no question of new powers being given to the Garda without the added safeguard &mdash; both for the public and the Garda themselves &mdash; of a proper complaints procedure.  While therefore this Bill brings important reforms in its own right, it also has a significant secondary effect which is to fulfil one of the two requirements necessary before bringing into force the remaining provisions of the Criminal Justice Act.  The other requirement is to make comprehensive regulations for the <Col N="729" /> treatment of persons in custody in Garda stations.</P>
    <P>Before dealing with the provisions of the Bill.  I should like to make some general points.  The main objective of any legislation establishing a procedure for dealing with complaints against police is to secure that the handling of complaints should be just, and be seen to be just, both to the complainant and to the police.</P>
    <P>It must be a system in which the public have confidence &mdash; confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the investigation of complaints and of the subsequent adjudication on them.  The Garda themselves are conscious of the need to have public confidence in this aspect of their operations and of the importance it has in fostering good relations between themselves and the community in general.</P>
    <P>The fact is that gardaí, unlike the great majority of other public servants, are frequently brought into serious confrontation with members of the public in the course of their normal duties.  In the case of arrests or detention, complainants have an interest in making exaggerated or unfounded complaints with the object of having incriminating statements made by them declared inadmissible.  Inevitably, gardaí are regularly exposed to criticisms and complaints.  Some of the complaints may be justified.  Others may be unjustified, irresponsible or malicious, As far as possible a complaints procedure should ensure that all complaints, whether justified or not, are dealt with properly and in a manner fair to all concerned.</P>
    <P>There is a further and fundamental consideration which cannot be lost sight of in any alternation of the present system of dealing with complaints from the public.  That is that any new system, while ensuring an effective outside scrutiny of complaints, must not undermine the responsibility of the Commissioner as chief officer of a disciplined force for maintaining discipline and morale among its members.  Any system that would separate the Commissioner from involvement in the investigation and adjudication of complaints against members of <Col N="730" /> his force would seriously undermine his authority and have adverse effects on the maintenance of discipline and morale.  Of course the introduction of any independent element into a complaints procedure must imply some weakening of the Commissioner's role in this respect but the objective must be to try to strike the right balance between the need for an effective independent input and the need to safeguard to the greatest possible extent the Commissioner's position as head of a disciplined force.</P>
    <P>Another feature of any effective complaints procedure must be its capacity to distinguish at a very early stage between serious complaints and those that are minor or trivial.  Otherwise a disproportionate amount of time and energy will be devoted to dealing with complaints that ought to be disposed of promptly by a simple explanation or apology or some other informal means.</P>
    <P>The fact is that traditionally complaints against police are investigated in a detailed formal fashion, always with the prospect that the matter, even if relatively trivial, could become the subject of an inquiry or perhaps of proceedings before the appeal board.  Some degree of formality cannot be avoided if the procedure is to be seen as fair to those concerned, especially when a garda's prospects or, in a serious case, his job may be at risk.  But the aim must be to reserve the full formalities for serious complaints while providing less formal or informal procedures for the others.</P>
    <P>It needs to be said also that quite apart from any formal complaints procedure the conduct of gardaí is subject to the operation both of the general civil and criminal law enforced by the courts and also of the internal discipline code of the force.</P>
    <P>First of all, a garda, like anyone else, is amenable to the criminal law.  Where he commits a criminal offence, such as an unjustified assault, he can &mdash; and must be &mdash; charged with that offence whether it arises out of his official duty or whether it relates to something done while he is off duty.  The conduct for which he is convicted is also a breach of discipline. <Col N="731" /> A garda's conduct may also affect the outcome of criminal proceedings taken against accused persons.  For example, if a garda has not made a lawful arrest, a charge of assaulting him in the execution of his duty will not succeed.  And there are many other examples where the conduct of the Garda is subject to detailed scrutiny by the criminal courts as being relevant to the outcome of the proceedings. Frequently, allegations are made by a suspect who has made a confession and later regretted it and who alleges at the trial that pressures were put on him by the Garda or that they are telling lies or have fabricated evidence against him.  In such cases the verdict at the trial may imply that the evidence given by the Garda has not been accepted or that there has been some misconduct or impropriety by individual gardaí. Sometimes the court may criticise gardaí expressly.</P>
    <P>There is also the control exercised by the civil law.  Anyone who is aggrieved by some action of the Garda may bring civil proceedings for damages for assault, false imprisonment, where it is alleged that an arrest was unlawful, or malicious prosecution.  The legality of a police search of premises or of the detention of property can be challenged.</P>
    <P>These external sanctions on police misconduct are not mere &ldquo;paper tigers&rdquo; as has been demonstrated on many occasions in recent years and they will of course continue to operate in the normal way.</P>
    <P>In addition, apart from the sanctions of the criminal law and civil law there is the existing disciplinary code embodied in the discipline regulations of 1971. These cover not only internal breaches of discipline but also those breaches which come to light as a result of complaints by members of the public.  Seventeen breaches of discipline are listed.  Most of them relate to matters of internal discipline, such as disobedience of orders, misconduct towards a member of the force and so on.  Some are specifically related to situations involving members of the public.  For example, the breach <Col N="732" /> described as abuse of authority is defined as making an arrest without good and sufficient cause; using unnecessary violence toward a prisoner or any other person with whom the garda is brought into contact in the execution of his duty; or failing to behave with due courtesy towards a member of the public.</P>
    <P>Finally, it should perhaps be emphasised that gardaí are not a group of people separate and distinct from the rest of the community but persons who remain part of the community while exercising, when necessary, powers conferred by the community and to be used on its behalf.  It follows that gardaí should enjoy the same rights and privileges as other members of the community.  If a complaint against them alleges a criminal offence, then they are entitled to the same rights and safeguards as any other suspects.  If the complaint concerns a purely disciplinary matter, they are entitled to have it handled properly and fairly.</P>
    <P>These are some of the general considerations which arise in connection with any system of handling complaints against the police.  They have been taken into account in the preparation of the Bill and account has also been taken of the complaints systems in operation in other jurisdictions.</P>
    <P>Before finalising the text I brought to the Government's attention the views that had been expressed in this House and the Seanad about complaints procedures during the concluding stages of the Criminal Justice Bill.  Much stress was laid on the need for the complaints board to be independent.  Some speakers envisaged the board as having no connection whatsoever with the Garda Síochána, whether in relation to the investigation or the adjudication of complaints.  I believe that investigation by a fully independent body is unrealistic.</P>
    <P>For one thing, it would be necessary to appoint a large number of independent investigators &mdash; in effect a second, though naturally very much smaller, police force to handle the work &mdash; and it is by no means clear where persons with the requisite skills and experience for this could be found, bearing in mind that it <Col N="733" /> would often involve investigating complaints alleging criminal offences &mdash; assaults and the like.  Former or retired gardaí would, presumably, be unacceptable as not being manifestly independent. Moreover, even if there were no recruitment difficulties, neither the scale nor seriousness of the problem in this country could be said to warrant such an extreme solution which would be far more costly than the solution proposed.</P>
    <P>Even if independent investigation were free of the difficulties mentioned, there is the fact that many occurrences giving rise to complaints are seldom witnessed by independent third parties and, consequently, there is frequently a conflict of evidence between the complainant on the one hand and the garda on the other without any corroboration of the complainant's allegations.  In these cases supervision of the investigation by an independent board is likely to be just as effective as investigation by a fully independent person.  The credibility of the parties is what has to determine the outcome and, if in the end there is a doubt, the deciding authority &mdash; whether it be a board, tribunal or court &mdash; must give the benefit of it to the garda as the person being accused.</P>
    <P>The main Opposition spokesman, while advocating an independent complaints commission, envisaged &mdash; in line with the proposals in the Bill &mdash; substantial Garda involvement in the handling of complaints.  He advocated a scheme under which, in general, complaints would be investigated by the Garda Síochána who would operate under the supervision or direction of a complaints commission.  However, he disagreed in regard to two aspects of the scheme then being proposed: the presence of the Commissioner or his representative on the complaints board and the exclusion of ranks above chief superintendent from the arrangements proposed for the investigation and adjudication of complaints.</P>
    <P>As regards the second point, the Bill now proposes to include all ranks in the Garda Síochána other than the Commissioner himself.  However, the Government remain of the view that the <Col N="734" /> Commissioner or his representative must be a member of the complaints board and participate in the adjudication of complaints and in the determination of any disciplinary action to be taken.  As I have said, maintenance of discipline is an important part of the Commissioner's operational responsibility.  He is chief disciplinary officer of the force and it is essential that any changes in the existing procedures for handling complaints should not undermine his position in this respect and weaken his command of the force.  To exclude him entirely from the disciplinary process would be bound to undermine his authority and be detrimental to the force's morale.  In my view, it would also tend to give rise to unnecessary friction between Garda management and complaints board.  By giving the Commissioner representation on the board and the adjudication tribunal his position is being preserved to the maximum extent consistent with introducing a decisive independent voice into the complaints procedure.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes to set up a board, which will be independent in the exercise of their functions, to supervise the investigation by the Garda of complaints from members of the public.  An important feature is that the board are being authorised to give directions to Garda investigating officers, subject to the prior consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions in criminal cases, and these officers will be under a duty to comply with any directions given to them by the board.  The board may also prescribe general principles to be observed in appointing investigating officers.  These officers are being required to send an interim report in writing to the chief executive of the board if unable to complete an investigation within 30 days and, after completion of the investigation, to furnish, if requested, a supplementary report in writing to the chief executive.</P>
    <P>The chief executive is required to submit written comments on each report and a recommendation as to what action, if any, the board might appropriately take in relation to the complaint concerned. All these provisions should ensure that <Col N="735" /> there is no avoidable delay in investigating complaints and that the investigation is properly carried out.  But if the board consider that the public interest so requires or that the Garda investigation has not been or is not being properly carried out, they may have a complaint investigated by their chief executive or another person.</P>
    <P>There will be seven members on the complaints board and they will be appointed by the Government for a five year term.  The chairman and at least two of the ordinary members must be practising barristers or solicitors of at least ten years' standing and one of them will be the Garda Commissioner or a deputy or assistant commissioner nominated by him.</P>
    <P>Membership of the board will be part time, but the board will have their own full time staff and an office in Dublin. Complaints which a member of the public wishes to have considered by the board may be made either in person or by letter to their office and there is provision also for such complaints to be made to the Garda themselves, either at a Garda station or, elsewhere, to a member above the rank of chief superintendent.  The latter provision is mainly to cover letters addressed to the Commissioner at Garda Headquarters.  In the case of complaints made directly to the Garda, I propose to make it clear that all complaints will go to the board unless the complainant requests in writing that the complaint be dealt with by the Garda themselves.  Each of the complaints must be recorded forthwith and an acknowledgment in writing given to the complainant.  Where a complaint is made to the Garda, the chief executive of the board must be notified of it as soon as may be after it has been received.  He must be sent a copy of the complaint or, where it was made orally, a copy of the record of it.</P>
    <P>The chief executive will then decide whether the complaint is, on the face of it, admissible.  To be admissible the following conditions must be satisfied. The complainant must be a member of the public, that is, not a member of the Garda Síochána.  Any complaint by a <Col N="736" /> member about another member is a matter for the Garda discipline regulations. The complainant must have been directly affected by or have witnessed the conduct alleged in the complaint.  The conduct must constitute either a criminal offence or a breach of discipline.  A &ldquo;breach of discipline&rdquo; is defined as one of the breaches specified for the time being in the discipline regulations.  These include, for example, conduct likely to bring discredit on the force or failing to behave with due courtesy towards a member of the public.  It also includes non-compliance by a member of the force with a requirement of an investigating officer under section 7 (9) (b) of the Bill to answer a question, furnish information or produce a document or thing.  Moreover, the conduct complained of must have occurred on or after the date on which the complaints procedure comes into operation and within six months before the date on which the complaint was made.  Also the application of the Bill to the conduct must not be excluded under section 14 by reason of the fact that at the time the complaint was made a person had already been appointed to hold an inquiry into the conduct under the 1971 discipline regulations or section 12 of the Dublin Police Act, 1924.  Finally, the complaint must not be frivolous or vexatious.</P>
    <P>This screening process, to be carried out by the chief executive, is intended to ensure that clearly inadmissible complaints are detected at the earliest possible stage and that no further time is spent by the board in dealing with them. The chief executive is required to tell the complainant the reasons for not admitting the complaint and there is provision for a review of the chief executive's decision. This is the effect of paragraph (c) of section 4 (3), which makes it clear that the board may subsequently decide to admit a complaint that the chief executive had found to be inadmissible.</P>
    <P>Once the Commissioner has been notified that a complaint is admissible he must tell the member concerned the nature of the complaint and who made it <Col N="737" /> but he may delay doing so, in an appropriate case, if it appears to him to be necessary or expedient to take measures for obtaining or preserving evidence about the subject matter of the complaint. Indeed any member who becomes aware of a complaint may take any of those protective measures.  Incidentally, this provision does not, as has been suggested, give the Commissioner <i>carte blanche</i> in the kind of protective measures he may take.  It does not authorise him to break the existing law.  He would be doing only what the Garda must often do when they get a report of a suspected offence, that is, delay approaching a suspect if they think that by doing so some evidence may be interfered with or destroyed.  But in case the draft is not sufficiently clear on this point I shall have it looked at again. Subsection (6) of section 4 makes it clear that, once a complaint has been made under the Bill against a garda, he may not be charged with an offence relating to the complaint except by or with the consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions.</P>
    <P>Even after the chief executive has filtered out frivolous or vexatious or other inadmissible complaints, there will be inevitably a category of minor complaints which it would be in everyone's interest not to have subjected to the full investigation and adjudication machinery. There will, for example, be cases where a garda's actions were both lawful and reasonable and a full explanation is all that is called for.  In other cases an explanation or apology will be sufficient to dispose of the matter satisfactorily.</P>
    <P>Clearly, it is important to ensure that both the complainant and the member complained of would have genuinely agreed to have the complaint dealt with informally.  Accordingly, section 5, which sets out the procedure for informally resolving complaints, gives the board power to prescribe procedures to be observed in this connection and also power to reopen a complaint and have it formally investigated if they are of opinion that the complaint is or was not suitable for informal resolution.  As a corollary, it is provided that any statements made by <Col N="738" /> the complaint or by the member concerned in connection with or for the purpose of informally resolving a complaint is not to be admissible in evidence in any proceedings whatsoever.</P>
    <P>These provisions about informal resolution of complaints are key elements in the Bill.  Ideally, they should enable most minor complaints to be disposed of reasonably quickly and in a manner that satisfies the parties concerned, while leaving the serious complaints to the formal procedures provided for in subsequent sections.  Obviously, the board will give close attention to the extent to which the informal procedure is operated and I would expect them to make particular reference to this aspect in their annual reports and, in particular, in the triennial report they are obliged to make to the Minister for Justice under section 12.</P>
    <P>Section 6 details the procedure for the formal investigation of complaints that have been declared by the chief executive to be admissible.  As I have said, complaints will normally be investigated by investigating officers appointed by the Commissioner but the investigation will be subject to close supervision by the board, acting through their chief executive, and the investigating officers must comply with any directions given by the board in relation to a particular investigation. Even after the investigating officer has submitted a final report, the chief executive may request him to furnish a supplementary report and he would do this if there were any aspects of the investigation that were not satisfactory.</P>
    <P>The chief executive is also required to submit written comments on each report and a recommendation as to what action, if any, the board might appropriately take in relation to the complaint concerned. He may also be requested to investigate a complaint, or cause it to be investigated, if the board consider that the public interest requires that the complaint should be so investigated or that the investigation of the complaint has not been, or is not being, properly carried out.</P>
    <P>Subsection (8) of section 6 deals with a problem that can arise in relation to the <Col N="739" /> investigation of some complaints, that is, the protection of information affecting State security or of information that would be liable to constitute a serious and unjustifiable infringement of the rights of third parties.  For example, disclosure of the identity of an informant could place him or her at risk &mdash; in some cases the mere disclosure that there was an informant could have equally serious consequences.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that any kind of blanket exemption of such information from the scope of the complaints procedure could be criticised as being too easily open to abuse.  Accordingly, the subsection envisages that in such cases the investigating officer would refer the matter to the Commissioner who, having made any necessary inquiries, would, if he agreed with the investigating officer, report the matter to the Minister for Justice.  It would be a matter for the Minister, if and in so far as he agreed that the matter came within the category mentioned, to direct that the information should not be included in the investigating officer's report to the board.  Non-disclosure would be permitted therefore only where, and to the extent that, the investigating officer, the Commissioner and the Minister were all of opinion that disclosure would affect State security or seriously and unjustifiably infringe the rights of third parties.</P>
    <P>Provision is made for the possibility that the Minister, having given a direction, could authorise additional information to be given to the board about the matter to assist them in considering the complaint.  The subsection also envisages that other arrangements could be made between the board and the Commissioner whereby, in a particular case or more generally, a matter of this kind could be dealt with by some other procedure.  For example, it might be possible in a particular case for the Commissioner to give confidential information to the chairman of the board on a personal basis.</P>
    <P>Section 7 sets out the functions of the board on the completion of the investigation. If the board are of opinion that <Col N="740" /> the complaint may constitute an offence committed by the member concerned, they must refer the matter to the DPP. If the conduct has no criminal aspect, the board will deal with it in one of three ways: by taking no further action, by referring it to the Commissioner to deal with informally by way of advice, admonition or warning to the member concerned, or by referring the matter to a tribunal for adjudication.  They would take no further action where they thought that neither an offence nor a breach of discipline had been disclosed or that the complaint was otherwise not admissible. They would refer it to the Commissioner where they thought that there had been a breach of discipline by the member but that it was of a minor nature and could be appropriately dealt with informally by the Commissioner by way of advice, admonition or warning.  In such a case the member concerned would be given an opportunity to make representations to the board before the reference to the Commissioner was made.  The third option &mdash; that of referring the matter to a tribunal &mdash; would arise where the board were of opinion that a breach of discipline on the part of the member concerned &mdash; other than a minor breach just referred to &mdash; might be disclosed.</P>
    <P>Subsection (7) of section 7 sets out the rule against double jeopardy, that is, that a member of the force who has been convicted or acquitted of an offence is not to be liable to disciplinary proceedings if the board consider that the breach of discipline is in substance the same as the offence of which he has been convicted or acquitted.  This does not apply to a breach of discipline which consists of conduct constituting an offence in respect of which there has been a conviction by a court.  This provision gives statutory recognition to an existing concept.  However, the concept does not extend to a case where the DPP has decided that proceedings for a criminal offence should not be instituted in respect of a complaint. Subsection (8) of the section gives the board discretion in such a case either to refer it to the Commissioner to be dealt <Col N="741" /> with informally or to refer it to a tribunal or to take no further action.</P>
    <P>Subsection (9) of section 7 has come in for criticism by the Garda representative associations.  It deals with a case where, in the course of the investigation, the member concerned has refused to answer a question put by the investigating officer or to furnish information or produce a document or thing relevant to the investigation and where the conduct complained of either does not constitute a criminal offence or it does and the DPP has decided that proceedings should not be instituted.</P>
    <P>In such a case, the board are being authorised to give a direction to an investigating officer to investigate the complaint further.  Where this happens, the investigating officer may, in the course of the further investigation, require a member to furnish any relevant information and it will be the duty of the member to comply with the requirement.  If he does, the information furnished will not be admissible in evidence against the member or his spouse in any proceedings whatsoever other than any disciplinary proceedings against the member concerned. If he does Lot, his non-compliance will constitute a breach of discipline, provided that the investigating officer has told the member that he is acting in accordance with a direction under subsection (9) and has brought the substance of the relevant provisions to the member's notice.  Similar provisions are being incorporated in the 1971 Regulations. That is being done by paragraph (h) of subsection (9).  A further &mdash; consequential &mdash; amendment is being made in the regulations by deleting the requirement that an officer investigating a complaint of non-criminal conduct must caution the member concerned that he is not required to make any statement relating to the matter.  That is the effect of section 14 (6).</P>
    <P>These provisions do no more than place the gardaí in the same position as those in other occupations.  If, for example, a member of the public complains about the conduct of a public servant employed at, say, an inquiry desk, that <Col N="742" /> person's superior will ask him or her for an explanation.  There is no obligation to give an explanation but any refusal to do so would leave the person concerned open to disciplinary action, probably immediate suspension.  Normally, of course, an explanation is given and the employer decides whether or not to accept the explanation and what, if any, action should be taken.  It would be the same with employees in the private sector.</P>
    <P>Contrast this with the position of gardaí who, as I have said, must be specifically informed in writing that they are not required to say anything when a complaint against them is being investigated, even where the complaint concerns a minor breach of discipline.  Of course, if the conduct complained of constitutes an offence, the usual caution must be given. But it is surely not right that members of a disciplined force should be under no obligation to give an explanation of their conduct when such an obligation is the norm in every other employment.  The Bill makes it clear that any information given in reply to a requirement under this provision may not be used in any proceedings other than disciplinary proceedings so that there is no question of any member having to incriminate himself or herself.</P>
    <P>When I met representatives of the Garda associations before the Bill was published I made it clear that, in the discussions that were to take place on this and other matters connected with the Bill and also in relation to a review of the 1971 Discipline Regulations, I would be prepared to look at any alternative formula that might be proposed and, if necessary, to table a suitable amendment on Committee Stage, so long as the principle of the provision was not affected. Discussions have taken place and are continuing between my officials and the associations representing chief superintendent, superintendent and Garda ranks on the Bill and also in relation to a review of the discipline regulations.  The Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors withdrew from the discussions at an early stage.  As a result of the discussions, I <Col N="743" /> announced on 18 November my intention to confine the requirement to furnish information under section 7 (9) to matters arising out of a member's performance of his official duties and to move an amendment to this effect on Committee Stage.  The amendment will meet a major concern expressed by the associations, that a requirement to furnish information arising from a complaint could result in an intrusion into a Garda's private and family life.</P>
    <P>This brings me to sections 8 and 9 and the Second Schedule.  These provisions deal with the operation of the disciplinary tribunals that may be established by the board to inquire into complaints where, in the opinion of the board, a breach of discipline may be disclosed.  Each tribunal will consist of three members of the board.  One of the members at least must be a practising barrister or solicitor of not less than ten years standing.  One must be the Commissioner or his representative on the board.  It will be the function of a tribunal to adjudicate on the complaint, that is to say, to decide that the member has, or has not, been in breach of discipline, either the breach alleged or some other less serious breach.  It will have power to determine what disciplinary action should be taken, ranging from a simple caution at one extreme to dismissal from the force at the other.  Decisions of a tribunal must be implemented by the Commissioner or, in the case of dismissals of members above the rank of inspector, by the Government.</P>
    <P>The procedure of a tribunal will be determined by rules made by the complaints board with the consent of the Minister for Justice.  The kind of matters to be provided for in the rules are indicated in paragraph 12 of the Second Schedule.  In particular the rules must provide for enabling the member concerned to present his case to the tribunal in person or through another member or a legal representative.  This is the existing position under the discipline regulations.</P>
    <P>In practice, most gardaí appearing before disciplinary inquiries either are not represented or are represented by <Col N="744" /> another member of the force, usually one who is skilled in such matters.  I accept that there will be cases under the procedure where, in the particular circumstances including the seriousness of the alleged breach of discipline, it would be unreasonable to expect the member to conduct the case by himself or through another member and where it would be appropriate to pay the costs of legal representation from public funds.</P>
    <P>I have agreed to set up a group consisting of official side and Garda side representatives under a neutral chairman to decide on applications for legal assistance in advance of a hearing before a tribunal or the appeal board.  Details of this arrangement have not been fully worked out and discussions about it are continuing. Here I should emphasise that a tribunal is concerned with purely disciplinary matters.  Its decisions can have only disciplinary consequences.  True, these consequences can be serious in so far as they may involve dismissal or an impairment of career prospects; but in other occupations there are fewer safeguards, or less obvious safeguards, against unfair treatment than in the existing or proposed complaints procedure.</P>
    <P>The final plank in the structure of the new complaints procedure is the appeal board which will consider appeals by members of the Garda Síochána from decisions of tribunals.  The appeal board will consist of three members, appointed by the Government for a term of three years.  The chairman will be a judge of the Circuit Court and at least one of the ordinary members will be a practising barrister or a practising solicitor of at least ten years' standing.  The appeal board will have power to affirm, vary or set aside decisions of tribunals &mdash; both findings of breaches of discipline and decisions that disciplinary action should be taken.  Appeals will be based on the record of the tribunal's proceedings, on such other evidence as the appeal board think fit and on any observations of the tribunal which the appeal board may request the tribunal to furnish in relation to any matter arising on that record.  As in the case of tribunals, there is power <Col N="745" /> to require withnesses to attend and also power to make procedural rules with the consent of the Minister for Justice.  These provisions are in sections 10 and 11 and the Third Schedule.</P>
    <P>Section 12 is an important provision in that it requires the board to make an annual report to the Minister for Justice and authorises them to include in the report information and comment in relation to any matters coming to their notice to which they consider that his attention should be drawn.  The board are also obliged to keep under review the working of the system of investigation and adjudication of complaints and to make a report to the Minister not later than three years after the new procedure comes into operation and at least once in every subsequent three-year period.  The Minister may also require the board to report to him on such general matters relating to their functions as the Minister may specify and a copy of every report received by the Minister under the section must be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Section 13 is a standard provision applicable to State boards, disqualifying Deputies, Senators and MEPs from becoming, or being, members of the complaints board or the appeal board.</P>
    <P>Section 14 contains a number of technical provisions which are designed to avoid any overlapping between the Bill and the existing enactments for dealing with complaints against the gardaí, that is, the 1971 Discipline Regulations and section 12 of the Dublin Police Act, 1924.  Subsection (1) provides that the Bill will not apply in relation to conduct alleged in a complaint if, before the date on which the complaint is received, either the Commissioner had appointed a member or members of the Garda Síochána to hold an inquiry under the 1971 regulations into the conduct or a person had been nominated by the Minister for Justice under section 12 of the 1924 Act to hold an inquiry into the matter.  If, however, by the time a complaint is made under the Bill an investigation is proceeding under the regulations but the stage of holding an inquiry has not been reached, then the complaint will be investigated under the <Col N="746" /> Bill and provision is made in subsection (2) to deem the investigation and any statements made in connection with it to have been made under and for the purposes of the Bill.  Subsection (1) (b) preserves the power the Commissioner has to dismiss a member not above the rank of inspector and his power to suspend from duty, notwithstanding that an admissible complaint has been made. There is also a saver for the powers of the Government in relation to removal from office &mdash; in the case of a deputy or assistant commissioner &mdash; and dismissal or reduction in rank in the case of chief superintendents and superintendents.</P>
    <P>Section 15 is a technical amendment of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984.  It is consequential on the inclusion in the complaints procedure of all members of the Garda Síochána other than the Commissioner. When the Bill of that Act was being debated the intention was that the procedure would apply only to ranks up to and including chief superintendent.</P>
    <P>I have already referred in passing to the discussions which are taking place with the Garda associations &mdash; other than the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors &mdash; on the Bill.  The discussions are proving to be very useful in identifying areas where the Bill can be improved in ways which, I believe, will find general acceptance.  I should like to mention some of the points that have come up in the discussions, that is, in addition to the matters I have already referred to.</P>
    <P>The associations suggested that the Bill should provide that the making of a malicious or vindictive complaint would be an offence.  I am not persuaded that it would be right to create a specific offence for complaints of this kind against the gardaí. I do appreciate that gardaí, in common with members of police forces the world over, are peculiarly vulnerable to having false complaints made against them.  The reason for doing so may be a desire for revenge arising from a successful prosecution or an attempt to have a confession declared inadmissible.  However, the arguments against creating a special offence are in my view more compelling. The effect of such an offence might well <Col N="747" /> be to discourage persons who have genuine complaints from going to the board because of a fear &mdash; unjustified though it would be &mdash; that they might be prosecuted if they were mistaken or if the complaint could not be substantiated for lack of evidence.  There is also the fact that existing civil and criminal remedies may be available to a member who is the subject of a false or malicious complaint and that in the majority of cases such complaints would be made without publicity and disproved without damage to the member concerned.</P>
    <P>These considerations have led me to come down against the inclusion of a special offence in the Bill.  I do not believe that the association's fears in this regard will prove to be justified.  However, in deference to their views I have agreed to use the procedure under section 12 (2) and request the complaints board to report to me on the question of creating a special offence on the lines suggested in the light of their experience of such complaints. I will be asking the board also to consider including a reference in the complaint form to a complainant's possible liability under the civil and criminal law in the event of his having made a false complaint.</P>
    <P>In the discussions the associations also adverted to the fact that members of a disciplinary tribunal of the board who will adjudicate on a complaint may have been involved already in the decision to refer that complaint to the tribunal.  They suggested that this could be unfair to the garda concerned and would be contrary to the principles of natural justice.</P>
    <P>As a tribunal would be dealing only with purely disciplinary matters there is no analogy with the conduct of criminal proceedings and so no breach of the recognised rules of natural justice is involved.  Moreover, the board merely decide whether a breach of discipline may be disclosed whereas a tribunal, after hearing the oral evidence, decide whether breach has, in fact, occurred.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, I have been impressed <Col N="748" /> by the case put forward by the associations and, subject to any views the House may have on the matter, I would be disposed to consider whether their concern should be met by a suitable amendment on Committee Stage.  One possibility would be to provide that the membership of the tribunals would be drawn from a panel completely independent of the board.  Another would be to enlarge the board's membership to enable the two functions of supervising investigations and adjudicating complaints to be performed by different persons. The acceptance of either option would tend to complicate further a structure which is arguably already elaborate enough for what is essentially a disciplinary procedure.</P>
    <P>Another matter discussed with the associations was the period within which a complaint must be made.  The associations have suggested that the six months period provided by section 4(3) is too long.  I would welcome also the views of the House about this.  It may be that it would be better to have a period of three months with the possibility of an extension to six months in exceptional circumstances.</P>
    <P>Arising from the discussions, I have agreed to propose that the breaches of discipline which the public can complain about should be spelt out in a schedule to the Bill rather than be specified, as the text now stands, only by reference to the breaches designated in the 1971 regulations. This will make for ease of reference and will allow the exclusion of some breaches, such as disobedience of orders, which are appropriate only to internal discipline within the force.</P>
    <P>As I have said earlier, discussions are also taking place with the Garda associations &mdash; other than the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors &mdash; on the 1971 regulations.  My intention is to replace these regulations with a new updated version.  This will enable sections 14 (6) and 7 (9) (h) to be deleted and the matters to which they refer to be dealt with in the new regulations.</P>
    <P>I should like now to mention the two remaining steps being taken for the <Col N="749" /> improvement of our criminal law and procedure. These are the draft regulations for the treatment of persons in Garda custody and the provision of facilities for the electronic recording of Garda questioning. The regulations will come before the Government for approval in principle within the next few weeks.  Details will then be published so as to enable interested parties to submit comments before the regulations are made in draft form, as required by the Criminal Justice Act, and submitted to the Dáil and Seanad for approval.  The commencement of field trials of electronic recording equipment is dependent on the coming into operation of the detention provisions of the Act, and that in turn depends on the enactment of the present Bill and the making of the treatment regulations.  I can assure the House that as soon as this Bill has been passed there will be no delay in setting up the complaints board.  The necessary preparatory work in relation to the acquisition of premises and so on is proceeding to the maximum extent possible so as to avoid delay not only in establishing the complaints machinery but also in bringing into operation the provisions which the Garda need to help them in the investigation of serious crime.</P>
    <P>Apart from the underlying principles, there is a lot of detail involved in the Bill because I considered it was better to spell out the detailed procedure for making complaints and for dealing with them in the Bill itself rather than in regulations made subsequently so that the House would have an opportunity of seeing the whole picture now.  There will be an opportunity for detailed examination of these provisions when we are in Committee but if Deputies have any questions about them I shall try to answer them when replying and, in any case, I shall give consideration to them between now and the Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I believe there is a general consensus in the House on the need for an independent complaints procedure which will have the confidence of the public, preserve to the greatest possible extent the responsibility and accountability of the <Col N="750" /> Commissioner as head of a disciplined force, be sufficiently flexible to ensure that disproportionate effort is not devoted to trivial or minor complaints and ensure that justice is done, and is seen to be done, to both complainants and gardaí without unnecessary delays.  I am confident that the Bill will be approached on that basis and I look forward to a constructive debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The main reason for the Minister for Justice bringing this Bill before the House now is to enable him to exercise through the Garda Síochána the new powers of arrest and detention embodied in the Criminal Justice Act, 1983.  That Act provides for the arrest and detention in Garda Stations of persons, without being charged, for periods of six, 12 or 20 hours.  This is a totally new departure in Irish law, with the exception of the emergency powers and of the Offences Against the State Act which is confined to subversive activities.</P>
      <P>These new powers, already contained in the Criminal Justice Act, will mean that a citizen can be arrested on the suspicion of a member of the Garda Síochána and subsequently detained for up to 20 hours in a Garda station.</P>
      <P>Originally the Minister proposed to apply these powers to any child from the age of seven upwards.  However, in the course of the Dáil debates the Minister accepted my amendment that all children under the age of 12 be excluded.  It is essential that the House and the public at large understand that the Criminal Justice Act provides for the first time since the foundation of the State, other than in emergency legislation, for the power of police arrest of any citizen on mere suspicion and imprisonment in a Garda station for the purpose of questioning.</P>

    <P>Section 1 (2) of the Criminal Justice Act provides that an order shall not be made in respect of sections 4 to 6, 8 to 10, 15, 16, 18 and 19 until legislation is enacted relating to the investigation of complaints from the public against members of the Garda.  The powers we are talking of here are in section 4 which <Col N="751" /> deals with detention after arrest, section 6 which deals with the powers of the Garda in relation to a detained person, section 8 which deals with the destruction of records, section 9 which deals with the application to persons in custody under section 30 of the Offences Against the State Act, 1939, section 10 which concerns re-arrest under the powers of this Act, section 15 which deals with the withholding of information regarding firearms or ammunition, section 16 which deals with the withholding of information regarding stolen property and so on and section 18 which deals with inferences from a failure or a refusal to account for objects, marks and so on.  Involved also is section 19 which deals with inferences drawn from an accused person's presence in a certain place.</P>
    <P>These sections of the Criminal Justice Act are frozen, as it were, and will not be brought into operation until a satisfactory complaints procedure has been introduced and until the regulations regarding the treatment of people in custody have been introduced also.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil, reluctantly but inevitably, accepted the need for these new powers in the light of the necessity for tackling the present high level of crime.  However, because the new powers of arrest and imprisonment marked a fundamental new departure in our law we were convinced that these powers must be accompanied by two major provisions.  The first was a Garda Síochána Complaints Commission and the second was the provision of minimum safeguards for persons in custody.  The Minister acknowledged in the course of the debate the need for these measures and agreed to implement them before adopting the new powers.</P>
    <P>While that Bill was being discussed we put forward our proposals for a Garda Síochána Complaints Commission.  It was amendment No. 48 to the Criminal Justice Bill, 1983.  We set out in general terms the functions and the independence of this commission.  In the draft which we put before the House at that time we differed somewhat from the Minister's <Col N="752" /> initial proposals but perhaps differ less from his proposals at this stage.</P>
    <P>One may ask why there should be a Garda Síochána complaints procedure since there is already in existence an internal disciplinary procedure governed by the Gárda Síochána (Discipline) Regulations, 1971.  These regulations are quite extensive and in many respects they are effective.  Recent events have indicated that something more substantial is needed.</P>
    <P>Experience during the seventies which culminated with the Ó Briain report, and other more recent events, have pointed the way towards the additional need for an independent complaints procedure. For example, in the Shercock case, a man died in Garda custody and notwithstanding that, an internal Garda investigation failed to lead to any satisfactory outcome. In the Bunratty case, a man died following an incident in respect of which there were allegations of Garda involvement, and of some kind of cover-up.  Many questions were still left unanswered following an internal Garda investigation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>In the Kerry Babies case, yet again, an internal investigation failed to allay public fears and apprehension. A full scale, time-consuming, expensive and at times harrowing judicial inquiry became necessary.  This could have been avoided and expense spared if there had been available a commission or board that was clearly independent and which could be seen by the public to be an independent body for the investigation of complaints and allegations against the Garda Síochána.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Yet again most recently a private individual was subjected to physical assault, and abuse by a member of the Garda Síochána in Malahide Garda station, where he was punched and hit with a baton and held for 15 minutes without charges being preferred against him.  He was subsequently awarded £85,000 by a jury, reflecting their horror at the treatment he received.  This is an indication of <Col N="753" /> how people feel when they are confronted with these matters.</P>
    <P>No one has been given more delegated power within the community than the Garda Síochána.  This is a necessary concomitant for the maintenance of law and order in a free society.  But members of the force must carry out their delegated powers in a controlled, equitable and responsible way.  By and large we in Ireland have a police force which have given, and continues to give, excellent service, with exceptional dedication and skill in implementing in a balanced and impartial way the laws of the land.  But as we have seen, we also have examples of serious complaints and allegations of harassment and physical and psychological abuse of persons in custody, which are alien to the force itself, and unacceptable to the community.</P>
    <P>The public representative finds himself or herself caught between two fires.  One is the desire to back up and support the Garda in their difficult task.  The other is to ensure that equity, fair play and freedom from abuse will prevail.  Here the community and the media who comment on these events must decide whether they are in favour of law and order, and supportive of the Garda in their work, or just giving lip service to them.  We know only too well that some elements engaged in crime or subversion will use every snare and ruse to bring odium on the force.  The Minister has referred to this.  To apprehend and detain hardened criminals can be a very difficult physical task and can lead to necessary rough play in the heat of the moment. On the other hand, when a detained or arrested person is under control it is quite a different matter.</P>
    <P>Support for the Garda in executing their duties does not, however, extend to supporting conduct that is oppressive, irregular or otherwise unacceptable. Hence it is that we need a system of dealing with complaints against members of the force which is independent, fair and practicable.  The complaints procedure should not impede the normal working of the Garda.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="754" /> It should complement their work; support their onerous position within the community and act as a brake and a preventative influence on the would-be errant Garda.</P>
    <P>It was with this in mind and with the proposed introduction of new and extended powers for the Garda that we in Fianna Fáil proposed that the Criminal Justice Bill of 1983 be amended by the addition of an amending section (amendment No. 48) entitled: &ldquo;The Garda Síochána Complaints Commission&rdquo;.  In our amendment we described our proposed body as &ldquo;an independent commission for supervising and investigating complaints against the Garda Síochána and related criminal or disciplinary charges&rdquo;.  Suffice it to say that we set out the composition, functions and method of operation of such an independent body.  But the Minister refused even to consider our proposals then in the context of the Criminal Justice Bill, or to bring in his own proposals in parallel with the debate which preceded the passing of the Criminal Justice Bill at the end of 1984.</P>
    <P>The Minister, through his obstinacy and unco-operative approach, contributed to two wasted years in the battle against crime.  We also submitted to the Minister our proposals for safeguards for people in custody.  These are on the record of the House.  Again, the Minister refused to adopt them or to introduce his own at that time.  Indeed, he has yet to bring them before the House.  Thus, in all, it is probable that three years will have been wasted before the new powers will be available to the Garda.  This constitutes an extraordinary delay on the part of a Minister who, when the new powers were being requested in the course of the debate on the 1983 Criminal Justice Bill, stressed the urgency of having the new powers immediately to help the Garda fight the high levels of crime.  This is even more inexplicable when one considers that Fianna Fáil put draft proposals before the House at that time.  At last we have the Minister's proposals before us in this Bill.  It is significant that while we described our body as an independent <Col N="755" /> commission for supervising and investigating complaints the Minister has dropped the word &ldquo;independent&rdquo; from the Bill, describing it as a system for investigation and adjudication of complaints.</P>
    <P>Our principal criticisms of the Minister's proposals are as follows: first, the proposed Garda Sióchána complaints board is not independent of the Garda. In his remarks the Minister suggested that there is a conflict between the existence of an independent Garda complaints board and the position and status of the Garda Commissioner.  In my view this is a contrived argument calculated to throw a smokescreen over the fact that the proposed complaints board will not be fully independent.  The Minister has told the House that the new complaints board should assist in maintaining public confidence in the Garda.  Since this can best be achieved by having a fully independent board, surely such independence can only assist the Commissioner in maintaining discipline and morale among its members?</P>
    <P>The Minister has provided in this Bill that of the proposed seven members of this complaints board one will be the Commissioner or his deputy or an assistant commissioner.  In our view this is neither desirable nor acceptable.  We proposed that no serving member of the force should be a member of the board. That remains our position and we will propose an amendment to that effect on Committee Stage.  If the Commissioner or his deputy is a member of the board then the board will not be seen by the public to be acting independently of the force.</P>
    <P>The Commissioner is the head of the Garda Sióchána and, as such, his office must protect and promote the interests and the image of the force.  He has a healthy, vested interest in the management of the force and, rightly or wrongly, will be seen as being naturally biased in its favour.  The Minister would serve both the Garda Sióchána and the public better if he provided a board which would be seen to be independent.  Decisions of the <Col N="756" /> board would be more readily accepted if that were the case.</P>
    <P>If one carries one's mind forward to some future event, such as the allegations made in the Kerry Babies case, or some other allegations, and if one has to come to the House to tell people that the allegations will be considered by a board which the Minister would contend is there for investigating such complaints &mdash; and the House would like to be able to say to those members of the public that this will be an independent board &mdash; it should be remembered that it will not be independent of the chief of the board, the Commissioner. In those circumstances how can one expect people to accept their findings as being those of an independent body or of one acting with independent powers, as the Minister contends?  That kind of situation inevitably will recur in the future.  Experience of such tribunals has shown that difficulties can arise subsequently in getting people on all sides to accept that such a tribunal has acted totally independently, that their findings are, if you like, the last word.  Then if such a matter is to be referred to a board which have among their membership the Commissioner of the Gárda Sióchána, from a purely public administration point of view, I would expect that, rightly or wrongly, the board will be seen to be biased in favour of the Garda Sióchána or in favour of the Commissioner and his function within the force.</P>
    <P>This has nothing to do with the standing, status or excellence of any given Commissioner.  It is a question of public administration.  How does one devise a system which will operate &mdash; and be seen to operate &mdash; independently and fairly, whose findings will be taken as the final word on the matter so that one can then say to people: &ldquo;It has been referred to an independent board and that is it.  You may not like the findings but they are those of an independent board.&rdquo;  Very often that has to be said afterwards to different sides in an argument.</P>
    <P>From the point of view of the public administrative arrangements we make in this House, the Minister well knew that that was the principal weakness of his <Col N="757" /> proposals.  That was why at the beginning of his remarks he emphasised that this House:</P>
    <P>... must not undermine the responsibility of the Commissioner as chief officer of a disciplined force for maintaining discipline and morale among its members.  Any system that would separate the Commissioner from involvement in the investigation and adjudication of complaints against members of his Force would seriously undermine his authority and have adverse effects on the maintenance of discipline and morale.</P>
    <P>We are agreed that the most practical method of investigation or adjudication, with some exceptions, is through the police themselves.  But in our view those findings should then be referred to a board independent of the Garda.</P>
    <P>The Minister has uttered severe warnings about the great dangers there might be if we do not accept his proposal here. We are looking at the matter from the long term point of view, from the point of view of the success of the board the Minister is proposing.  We believe that if there is sufficient independence on the part of that board, and it is clearly seen to be independent, then it will be acceptable to all sides and will commence on the right footing.  What the Minister suggests here is an overstatement of the position, the extent to which he sees the Commissioner's position being eroded were he not to be a member of the board.  One could argue the other way around, that the position of the Commissioner would be strengthened were he not a member of the board because, while he would be in charge of discipline generally and while there are internal disciplinary arrangements, he would then have an independent body to which complaints on the part of the public could be referred.  I believe that would be of great assistance to the Commissioner, that he could refer such matters to this body knowing he was doing so on the grounds that it would be clearly seen to be an independent body. In addition, members of the force would be able to see the board as separate from <Col N="758" /> their management.  That is another aspect: that the Garda themselves would be able to see the board as one which would adjudicate on allegations made and see that board as being separate from their management.</P>
    <P>The Garda associations have sought the right to nominate a member to the board.  If management are represented then why should they not be represented too?  This would be the normal argument. If management are to be represented, then should the staff not be represented also? This highlights the fact that for the board to be seen to be independent neither staff nor management should be on the board in this instance.  When the Ombudsman investigates complaints against a Government Department the Secretary of the Department has no control over the Office of Ombudsman.</P>
    <P>The Ombudsman Act, 1980 provides that &ldquo;The Ombudsman shall be independent in the performance of his functions.&rdquo; Nobody will be at his shoulder keeping an eye on what he is doing or feeding in the inside thinking in relation to the particular Departments.  He is to be independent in the performance of his functions.  In that Act the Departments of State and other persons subject to investigation include the Department of the Taoiseach, the Department of Justice, Land Registry and, of course, the Departments of Social Welfare and Health and various other Departments. The Ombudsman is independent in his actions and in his adjudication on such cases.  Why not have a similar arrangement in the case of the Garda Síochána complaints board where members of the public will be making complaints?  This is a question of being relevant and acceptable to the public at large.</P>
    <P>The Minister emphasises the internal disciplinary control which the Commissioner must exert within the force.  I accept that.  They are a disciplined force and the Commissioner has that function, but we are looking here at them as a body and our principal interest here is to provide a mechanism whereby members of the public can bring their complaints and allegations before a board who are <Col N="759" /> clearly to be seen as independent.  In the case of the Garda complaints board it is essential that there be close dialogue between the board and the Garda Commissioner or his nominee on matters of Garda procedures.  There is no question about that.  There would have to be close dialogue and understanding of the procedures and processes involved, but, of course, that would be the case in other areas also.</P>
    <P>When you come to a person's rights under all the mountains of social welfare legislation, of course the Ombudsman would have to be advised and kept informed by the Secretary of the Department of Social Welfare, or by somebody nominated by him, about these rights and given a clear understanding of how they operate and what the procedures are.  Of course, the Garda Commissioner or his nominee would have to be in close dialogue over such matters.  Nevertheless, the ultimate decisions of the board should not be a matter for consultation or negotiation with the Commissioner nor should they be seen to be so.  This is the only way in which the behaviour of the Garda in the performance of their duties can ultimately be placed above public suspicion.  This in turn will strengthen public confidence in the Garda and facilitate the effectiveness of the force in the performance of their duties.  Therefore, contrary to what the Minister has suggested, we believe that to have the board truly independent would in effect strengthen general public confidence in the Garda and through their operation would put an end to many of the complaints which are made and show that they are dealt with fairly, generally speaking.</P>
    <P>The second criticism I have is that the Minister has not provided specifically for medical, vocational and community interests on the board.  The Minister's Bill provides that the membership of the board shall comprise a chairman and six ordinary members and that at least two persons each of whom is a practising barrister, or a practising solicitor, of not <Col N="760" /> less than ten years' standing shall be ordinary members of the board.  That is similar to the provision we had in our proposals and we agree entirely with the Minister in that respect.  We say that because of the experience that Governments and administrations have had in the past.  Such a board having at least two members on it who have long experience as barristers or solicitors would constitute a valuable input into the operation and work of the board. A similar provision was included in our proposals but in contrast to the Minister's proposals for the remaining positions we suggested that one must be a member of the medical profession and that the other ordinary members should include representatives of vocational and community interests.  The Minister's proposals ignore these important provisions and he has reserved entirely to himself or to his successors as the case may be&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and the Government &mdash; the free choice of the remaining ordinary members excluding the Commissioner. Does the Minister intend to appoint further members or former members of the Garda Síochána?  Does he intend to appoint a member from the Department of Justice or is he planning to appoint political cronies who may have nothing in particular to offer?  Why does he not accept our proposals from which he has deliberately and knowingly departed?  We will press the Minister further on this matter on Committee Stage because we want this board to be relevant and independent.  We believe that a member of the medical profession is essential to this board.  Experience both in Ireland and elsewhere has shown that an understanding of the medical and psychological aspects of treatment of persons in custody is very valuable and even essential.  In addition, if we want the board to be relevant to the community, then why should we not appoint members from the general community and vocational areas?  We are not suggesting that <Col N="761" /> there should be any pre-selection; we are not trying to put any restriction on the Minister or the Government as to the people who are appointed, but we have proposed that they should be selected from particular areas and that the community and vocational areas should be represented in the other appointments.</P>
      <P>This is the age of community policing and neighbourhood watch.  In these days the Minister quite often has talked to us about the need for neighbourhood watch and the involvement of the community within the whole process.  He is conscious, as are other Members of the House, of the need to bring more closely together the functioning of the Garda and the community and to get the kind of detailed support in the community that the Garda need to do a more effective job.  We should be encouraging community involvement and the respect of the community at large.  If we are to win the war against crime we must involve the community.  Why not make a commitment now by including that provision in the Bill?  We are not asking the Minister to commit the Government to any particular people or to sectional interests of any sort but to ensure that when the appointments are made and whatever Government are making the appointments, the Government of the day in making the appointments will represent on the board community and vocational areas and interests and also the medical profession.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many cases which have occurred over the years have indicated the desirability of having a medical understanding and for a medical input into consideration of allegations in matters like this.  We can all be amazed and stunned by the effects which particular kinds of treatment can have.  I am not going to go into any individual cases, but I could cite cases which have been presented where a certain kind of psychological abuse has taken place. The ordinary man in the street might not readily recognise the impact of this kind of abuse but the medical person would have a much better understanding of it. Since cases might involve injuries or psychological abuse of one kind or <Col N="762" /> another, we felt it wise to have at least one member representing the medical profession.  We stress that we would leave it to the Government to pick that person, but we ask that they commit themselves to having someone on this board from that background.  It would be very helpful and valuable to the board in their work. When this matter comes before the Cabinet there will be different members of the Government putting forward their own suggestions and proposals, and some particularly strong member may want somebody represented on that board and may get that view across at Cabinet level.</P>
    <P>The Minister's proposals for the informal resolution of complaints are overcentralised, bureaucratic and wasteful. We agree that there should be a simple method of dealing with routine complaints in an informal way and put that forward in our original proposals.  This is very important because in practice quite a sizeable number of complaints would come into this category.  The public do not hear about many such complaints, the more exceptional ones coming to their notice.  Many complaints can be dealt with satisfactorily by the Garda Síochána at present in the normal course of their duties.</P>
    <P>We emphasised in section 14 of our proposals the position of the superintendent in this area of informal resolution of complaints.  Most public representatives find that the local superintendent will deal satisfactorily with the less serious complaints and with the resolution of misunderstandings at local level.  We included such a provision in our proposals. We proposed that such complaints be dealt with by the superintendent and that a note of the number and nature of the complaints would be given to the board and their executive.  By contrast, the Minister proposes that all complaints be processed through the Commissioner. This would appear to bog down the Commissioner and his office with routine complaints which will be informally resolved. It should be sufficient for the Commissioner to have a note of these and be free, as head of the force, to examine the files at local level at any time.  The Minister's <Col N="763" /> proposal will create a wasteful administrative nightmare.</P>
    <P>According to a report on the complaints procedure in Britain, a very large proportion of the complaints there are of a more minor nature which could be suitable for informal resolution.  The Police Complaints Board in July 1985 published a final review covering the period 1977 to 1985, which set out much information relevant to this debate.  They give the number and categories of complaints dealt with by the board between 1978 and 1984.  Of the total figure for 1984 of 17,245 complaints, 14,372 required no action; charges were preferred in 194 cases; an officer received advice in 1,425 cases and dispensations were granted in 1,253 cases.  The sizeable proportion of these complaints which resulted in no action being taken is very significant.  One could say that perhaps the system was not responding in a proper manner and that more action should have been taken, but it indicates that a very substantial body of complaints presumably required explanation and understanding of the circumstances in which any member of the Garda Síochána can find himself or herself.</P>
    <P>The types of complaint have been broken down in the report and include 140 cases of corruption.  There were 3,380 cases of oppressive conduct or harassment. There were 2,446 cases of incivility, 3,318 complaints about assault, 2,253 cases of irregularities in procedure.  The other big one was neglect of duty, 2,082 complaints.  In 1984, after the complaints had been dealt with, a massive proportion did not require disciplinary action.  As the Minister said, such complaints could have been dealt with by a suitable apology or a letter of explanation.</P>
    <P>The number of complaints was similar in 1978.  Out of 13,000, 10,700 required no further action; in 1979, 11,000 out of 14,000 complaints did not require further action; in 1980 the figure was 11,552 out of 14,900; in 1981, 13,900 out of 16,700; in 1982, 13,729 out of 17,000; in 1983, <Col N="764" /> 12,800 out of 16,000.  There was a consistent pattern of cases in which no action was required.</P>
    <P>That would coincide with the experience which Members of the House have, including me.  When a query arises locally, I usually refer it to the local superintendent and that would be the end of the matter.  People are satisfied with that procedure.  In some cases complaints are much more serious and further action may be necessary.  The Minister will have a sizeable number for informal resolution.</P>
    <P>The Minister said it would be necessary to have all complaints processed through the Garda Commissioner.  I would ask him to reconsider this.  The Commissioner and his office are fairly busy in any event and the Minister's proposal will just centralise a big volume of business in the Commissioner's office because many cases could be dealt with informally and locally.  The Minister should be seeking maximum delegation instead of centralised thinking.  He must learn how to manage and to trust his superintendents, who are experienced and competent, capable of resolving informal complaints.</P>
    <P>Another criticism I have is that the Minister has dropped our proposals aimed at protecting persons who supply information to the board.  We included a section in our proposals entitled &ldquo;Disclosure of Information&rdquo;.  The Minister was fully aware of this and yet he dropped that section.  We would like to know why and at whose instigation he did this.  We proposed that no information received by the board in connection with any complaint shall be disclosed by any person who is or has been a member, officer or servant of the board, except:</P>
    <P>(i)  To the Minister or to a member, officer or servant of the board, or so far as may be necessary for the proper discharge of the functions of the board, to other persons,</P>
    <P>(ii)  For the purpose of civil, criminal or disciplinary proceedings, or</P>
    <P>(iii)  In the form of a summary or other general statement made by the <Col N="765" /> board which does not identify the person from whom the information was received or any persons to whom it relates.  We also included stiff penalties of up to £5,000 or five years' imprisonment or both for breaches of this section.</P>
    <P>We believe that such confidentiality and trust are essential for the satisfactory operation of the complaints procedure. Both the private citizen and the member of the Garda Síochána should be protected from unnecessary or even malicious disclosure of information in connection with complaints.</P>
    <P>The report of the Ombudsman deals with this subject.  The Ombudsman Act, 1980, section 9, states that information or a document or a thing obtained by the Ombudsman or his officers in the course of or for the purposes of a preliminary examination or investigation shall not be disclosed except for the purposes of the examination or investigation of any statement, report or notification made thereon, or any proceedings in respect of an offence under the Official Secrets Act, 1963, alleged to have been committed.</P>
    <P>That section deals with complaints by the public against Departments, including the Department of Justice.  It deals with the secrecy of the information supplied. Fianna Fáil felt that this would be desirable in respect of the complaints board and we should like the Minister to tell us why he has not gone along with our suggestion.</P>
    <P>The Minister has created unnecessary conflict with the Garda by section 7 (9) and in my view he will have to amend it. He dealt at length with this in his speech. Apparently at the last minute he introduced an extra element into the Bill. Under section 7 (9) the Garda have felt that their traditional right to silence was infringed and this has led to public controversy and a loss of morale.  This matter must be cleared up as soon as possible.  The Garda must enjoy the same rights as ordinary citizens in relation to criminal charges.  They should also be prepared to answer to the board for <Col N="766" /> actions committed in the course of duty, or in the exercise of their powers.</P>
    <P>It is important that their internal disciplinary procedures should be separate from the board's activities.  It should be made clear that our concern in this Bill is with allegations concerning the behaviour of gardaí in the course of their duty or in the exercise of their powers.  The Minister today emphasised the need for information but pointed out that he was prepared to reconsider the matter.</P>
    <P>Section 7 (9) has come in for criticism by the Garda representative associations and the Minister refers to that matter in his speech and deals with it at some length.  Later on in his speech the Minister says he would be prepared to look at any formula that might be proposed and if necessary to table a suitable amendment on Committee Stage so long as the principle provision was not affected.  The Minister said that as a result of discussions he intends to confine the requirement to furnish information under section 7 (9) to matters arising out of a member's performance of his official duties and to move an amendment to this effect on Committee Stage.  What strikes me about that is that gardaí should be prepared to answer to the board for actions committed in the course of duty. I have added to that &ldquo;or in the exercise of their powers as gardaí&rdquo;.  That matter can be dealt with on Committee Stage.  I recognise that the Minister is open to an amendment which deals with the problem.</P>
    <P>It is important that internal disciplinary procedures should be separate from the board's activities.  Our concern in this Bill is with allegations concerning the behaviour of gardaí in the course of their duty or in the exercise of their powers.  The Minister has emphasised that by saying he would go along with some amendment as long as the principle is maintained.</P>
    <P>My eighth criticism is that a complaint can only be lodged by a person affected by or who witnessed the conduct complained of, or by his solicitor, or, if the <Col N="767" /> person is under 17, by a parent or guardian. In many towns the public find difficulty in getting one solicitor to sue another in the same area.  The same might happen in relation to a complaint against a garda.  The category of individual who may complain should be wide enough to embrace persons of standing in the community other than solicitors, such as officers of legal aid offices, ministers of religion, doctors, teachers, trade union officials and so on.  The Minister should consider broadening the category of person who can accompany a complainant in this situation.  In the difficult circumstances of a complaint being made against a garda the aggrieved party might be more at ease with some such person rather than a solicitor who may be too expensive or too remote.</P>
    <P>The UK have had a complaints board in operation for some time.  The UK Government's reply to the fourth report of the Home Affairs Committee &mdash; session 1981-1982, HC 9081, command report 8681 &mdash; in the annex dealing with the Government's proposals for handling complaints against the police, stated, <i>inter alia,</i> that a complaint would be lodged either by a complainant or by any person on his behalf orally or in writing, thus it would be open to a complainant to go, for example, to a citizens' advice bureau or a community relations officer and for them to forward the complaint to the police.  The UK Government consider a change necessary to enable any person to make a complaint in the UK.  In the event, they had already been thinking along the lines of some specialised people such as community relations officers, and the recommendation was to extend it to any person.</P>
    <P>The ninth criticism relates to the need for early action on complaints.  The Bill does not take into account that the hours after the receipt of a complaint may be vital since evidence may have to be obtained which might be unavailable later.  Immediate searches or observations may be necessary.  Both the complainant and the garda in an alleged assault case would need to be medically <Col N="768" /> examined.  It is essential that the need to lodge a complaint with either the Garda or the board should not delay any necessary preliminary investigations and that there will be a clear duty on the Commissioner and the board to make provision for the taking of the necessary preliminary steps to obtain or preserve evidence.  A system will have to be devised to ensure that the investigative machinery can be set in motion by either the board or the member of the Garda Síochána who receives the complaint or by the local superintendent.</P>
    <P>Section 6 confers authority on the Commissioner to appoint an investigating officer and subsection (3) (a) gives the board the right to supervise that investigating officer.  Allowing for the question of urgency which could occur, is there any scope for having an immediate preliminary investigation machinery to carry out a holding operation pending the full scale appointment by the Commissioner? Section 9 (5) imposes a duty on the Commissioner to do what appears to him necessary or expedient for the purposes of obtaining or preserving evidence. That subsection comes into operation only on receipt of notification of complaint by him.  There could be prolonged delay between the time of the complaint and any such action.  In that event the board or the garda to whom the complaint is made should have a duty and a power to obtain or preserve evidence or procedure its preservation in the interim between the complaint and the Commissioner being notified.  This whole area will need to be looked at again. Many of the cases could be settled informally.  Dealing with some matters informally on a localised basis would lead to the speedier resolution of some matters. Whether the Minister goes for a more centralised system of dealing with informal complaints or adopts our suggestion he will need to make some provision for immediate preliminary investigative machinery before the notification of complaints is received by the Commissioner.</P>
    <P>The investigation process is broadly similar to what we suggested.  We support <Col N="769" /> the Minister in that regard.  The Bill also provides for an exception.  The Minister had made it clear that if the board consider it necessary to have an investigation carried out in a certain way in an exceptional case &mdash; presumably there will be exceptional cases &mdash; the board, through the chief executive, will be empowered to carry out such an investigation.  We consider that to be a healthy and wise arrangement which provides the normal investigative process and caters for situations where that process might not be adequate.  The number of cases where that will occur will be few and far between but in this legislation we must recognise that this can happen.  The power should exist to enable an independent investigation to be carried out.  The need for the investigative process outlined in the Bill is contained in many studies and reports. The <i>New Law Journal</i> of 8 January 1981 contained an article by Alex Samuel about complaints against the police and the need for an independent investigatory body.  We accept that such an arrangement is satisfactory provided that there is an alternative measure available to the board, as is suggested by the Minister.</P>
    <P>We welcome the fact that all members of the Garda Síochána, excluding the Commissioner, will be subjected to the complaints procedures, a change from an earlier proposal.  We proposed such a move earlier and we are happy that the Minister adopted our approach.  In the course of his speech the Minister said:</P>
    <P>The main Opposition spokesman, while advocating an independent complaints commission, envisaged &mdash; in line with the proposals in the Bill &mdash; substantial Garda involvement in the handling of complaints.</P>
    <P>The Minister is correct in that statement. For practical reasons we see that as the most workable solution.  However, we were suggesting that procedure if the board could be seen by the public to be independent.  That procedure is fine where there is an independent board but if the Commissioner is to be appointed to the board I do not think it would be a good arrangement.  The board should be <Col N="770" /> truly independent in their operations particularly when a section within the Garda will deal with the investigation of complaints.</P>
    <P>The Minister also said:</P>
    <P>But if the board considers that the public interest so requires or that the Garda investigation has not been or is not being properly carried out, it may have a complaint investigated by its chief executive or another person.</P>
    <P>We included a similar provision initially because we considered it important.  I am happy that the Minister has included it and I am sure this will arise only in exceptional cases.</P>
    <P>I recognise that the Minister has provided an internal tribunal and appeals procedure.  In doing that I recognise that he is trying to be objective in regard to the appeals system.  The Third Schedule states:</P>
    <P>1.  (1) The Appeal Board shall consist of a chairman and two ordinary members.</P>
    <P>(2)  The members of the Appeal Board shall be appointed from time to time as occasion requires by the Government and, subject to the provisions of this Schedule, shall hold office upon such terms and conditions as the Government may determine.</P>
    <P>(3)  The term of office of a member of the Appeal Board shall be three years and, subject to the provisions of this Schedule, a member of the Appeal Board shall be eligible for re-appointment as such member.</P>
    <P>(4)  (a) The chairman of the Appeal Board shall be a judge of the Circuit Court and at least one of the ordinary members of the Appeal Board shall be a practising barrister, or a practising solicitor, of at least ten years standing.</P>
    <P>The Minister, through the appeal board, is attempting to arrange a system of appeal within the system but, again, that is for exceptional cases.  As we see it the weakness is in the board itself.  The Minister is attempting to overcome that <Col N="771" /> weakness by the provision of an appeals board but the complaints board will be the body that the public will be concerned with.  It is that body that people will look to in the first instance.  That board should be seen to be independent.  The Minister mentioned the limitation on submissions of complaints of six months which is about the shortest period that should be permitted.</P>
    <P>We will examine the Bill in greater detail before Committee Stage taking the comments of the Minister and other Members into consideration.  We will then put forward the amendments which we consider necessary.  It is our objective that the complaints procedure should be effective and widely accepted by the Garda and the community.  When enacted it will be an important advance and, accordingly, we have pleasure in supporting Second Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be very brief.  I know how long the passage of the Criminal Justice Bill took and I commend the Minister and the Opposition spokesman for their patience in dealing with this protracted matter.  It is very difficult to get a balance between the rights of an individual and the reasonable efforts that have to be made by the Garda to bring people to justice and to make sure that the administration of justice and the crime detection system operate properly.</P>
      <P>I should not like the complaints board to become a quango and there is evidence to suggest that this has happened in Britain. We do not want a repeat of the huge expense involved in judicial and other inquiries which has been the case in Britain. I hope that the new procedure will be a simple and an expeditious way of getting fair play in regard to grievances which people have against the Garda. I should like the Minister to consider appointing the Ombudsman as one of the seven members of the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to deal with section 7 (9) and section 14 (6) and the extent to which the regulations relating to the right of silence of the Garda are at variance with regulation 9 of the code of discipline <Col N="772" /> within the Garda, particularly subsection (c) of those regulations which says:</P>
    <P>....the member concerned is not required to make any statement relating to the matter but if he wishes to make such a statement he may make it in writing and any statement made under (c) may be used in any inquiry under the regulations relating to the matter.</P>
    <P>As the Minister is aware, it is not the rank and file gardaí who are upset about this section, it is superintendents, inspectors and sergeants who are concerned.  I respect their opinion because there are rotten apples in every barrel and a tiny minority of the force tend to abuse their position from time to time.  I criticise superintendents, inspectors and sergeants for withdrawing from discussions with the Minister.  We must not put members of the force into a situation where they may incriminate themselves and are subject to penalties for breaches of dicipline which might lead to their dismissal.  I welcome the Minister's comments in that regard and I hope discussions can be initiated because it is a very difficult aspect of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister said also that when a complaint is made against a garda he may incur costs in trying to protect himself. This is a matter for further discussion and perhaps the tribunal could decide on the course to be taken.  I hope that a reasonable attitude will be taken and that gardaí will be reimbursed, certainly in cases where they are cleared of any wrongdoing. I should like clarification regarding vexatious complaints because, in family disputes and, indeed, in others there could be many vexatious complaints against members of the force.  At present there is nothing to stop people from making repeated complaints against a member of the force and from victimising him.  As Deputy Woods said, all this will be costly to administer and time consuming but it is necessary.  The figures in the UK clearly indicate that there is an element of frivolous or vexatious complaints which can be dealt with quickly.</P>
    <P>The Ombudsman is seen to be fair <Col N="773" /> and that is why he should be appointed to the tribunal.  If a member of the complaints board is involved in deciding whether a case goes to a tribunal he or she should not be allowed to sit on the tribunal.  The Minister should ensure that this cannot happen.  In relation to section 4 (1) regarding the time limit of a complaint, six months is too long, two months would be reasonable.  There should be a deadline in terms of concluding a complaint because there could be a cloud hanging over a garda's head for a long time.  A case should be concluded in perhaps a year or so.</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods spoke about informal resolution of cases and he said that they would prefer to utilise the procedure of the superintendent to deal with minor complaints.  I see a difficult problem concerning informal resoultion, that the guidelines laid down in section 5 (6) (b) are too restrictive.  This means that when the Garda are making an informal presentation in an amicable way with the person making the complaint and the member of the force that in such cases any statements made may be admissible subsequently in any other proceedings. This means that there will be a restrictive interpretation on this and the Minister should give consideration to deleting this paragraph to allow the greatest flexibility possible so that cases can be dealt with informally.  It might be a matter of an apology or explanation only which can be easily dealt with.</P>
    <P>In relation to penalties, some account should be taken in regard to a senior member of the force who may have been found guilty in the case of a complaint brought against him.  Recognition should be given for years of service and a good record and, conversely if people committed misdemeanours before that should also taken into account.  There should be some procedure whereby there can be a mitigating factor for those who have a good record and who have never had a complaint against them.  There should be an element of discretion in those cases in terms of the sort of punishment which would be meted out eventually.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill, but until such time <Col N="774" /> as there is an independent authority, we will not reach the position where there will be complete satisfaction with the police.  Many years ago Fine Gael promised an independent police authority and, in my view, it is important for the morale of the force, and for the working of the force, that this be set out as a clear objective.  Perhaps the Minister would tell me if anonymous complaints will not be permissible, because in my view that would not be fair.</P>
    <P>I disagree with Deputy Woods's main objection, which is that the Commissioner will be a member of the board.  It is scandalous that that criticism should be made because it means that internal Garda discipline is not impartial and that the Garda have no confidence in internal disciplinary procedures.  In fairness it must be said that no Commissioner worth his salt would not have respect for his own credibility and his insistence that justice be done, and be seen to be done. There is no way he would wish to give comfort to gardaí who are not behaving properly.  Therefore it is only reasonable that the Commissioner be a member of the board.  I agree with the point made by Deputy Woods that a medical person should be a member of the board.  I hope when the Minister is making these appointments that he will consider that suggestion.</P>
    <P>We must keep a balance between, on the one hand, Garda morale, the professionalism with which they must be imbued to do a good job, and the pressures they are under and, on the other hand, make sure that the administration of justice is fair.  There is a need for this Bill and for an independent complaints authority, but I ask the Minister on Committee Stage to take the sting out of certain minor aspects of this Bill so that all sides will be free to support it and that the Garda can look forward to fair play.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the publication of the Garda Complaints Bill, 1985, and am pleased to have the opportunity of contributing to this debate.  The publication of this Bill has been awaited for a considerable time.  In this House, Fianna <Col N="775" /> Fáil have been pressing for the Minister to bring before the House the Bill we are debating this evening.</P>
      <P>The implementation of this Bill is crucial to the full enforcement of the new provisions of the Criminal Justice Act, which was debated at length in this House some time ago.  I am sure this Bill will receive the same careful and meticulous consideration as was given in both Houses to the Criminal Justice Act.  I hold the view that the debate on the Criminal Justice Bill was one of the finest ever to take place in this House.  That debate and the debate so far today reflect the anxiety and the concern of the general public about deterioration in law and order.</P>
      <P>We all acknowledge the extremely difficult task faced by the Garda in dealing with crime.  I feel certain that there is a willingness on the part of Members on all sides to strengthen their hand and to support them in the difficult changing social scene in which they operate while at the same time endeavouring to protect the rights of the citizen.  This is a difficult task but one which this Bill, when it becomes law, will have succeeded in achieving, so far as legislators can achieve the kind of balance which is necessary and desirable in this very sensitive area.</P>
      <P>I have no desire to make a political point at this stage but I am sure the Minister and the Members opposite will acknowledge that the contributions from this side of the House, particularly the contribution of Deputy Woods, resulted in major changes in the original Criminal Justice Bill as circulated.  In this debate the Minister will receive from us the same level of co-operation and constructive approach he received during the debate on the Criminal Justice Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As our spokesman, Deputy Woods, said, we are all alarmed at the escalation in crime and violence, particularly in recent years.  We need to bring about as quickly as possible a situation where crime can at least be contained.  We cannot afford to be complacent.  I believe that the economic environment in which <Col N="776" /> we live, with the growing level of unemployment and all the accompanying social issues, is a major contributory factor to the present very serious situation.  In previous debates I referred to the relationship between the economic conditions prevailing in the country at any given time and the state of law and order.  I say that particularly in relation to unemployment and all the social evils which are associated with that great national tragedy.</P>
    <P>Members will be alarmed at the growing increase in urbanised crime, particularly drugs and armed robberies.  It behoves all of us to take whatever action is necessary to secure and strengthen the hands of the Garda in dealing with crime and protecting society from its worst effects.</P>
    <P>The public debate which has surrounded the publication of this Bill has been helpful &mdash; some of it was predictable, all of it worthy of the fullest consideration of this House.  It is inevitable that the most forceful views have come from the representatives of the Garda associations.  To the extent that the Bill is of direct relevance to the force and the performance of their members, this is to be expected and their views are deserving of our most serious consideration.  I wish to acknowledge the willingness of the Garda associations in accepting the principle of an independent complaints tribunal. Here may I endorse what Deputy Woods said: I regret that the Minister's proposal does not have the degree of independence which we had hoped.  From the point of view of the credibility of the Bill and of the eventual tribunal, and from the public and the Garda viewpoint, it would be far more desirable if this tribunal were completely independent of Garda representation.</P>
    <P>I hope that on Committee Stage the Minister will keep our views in mind.  I have no doubt that Deputy Woods will be tabling amendments because I know from discussions with members of the Garda Síochána that they are anxious that the new body will be seen as independent. Therefore, from the point of view of the public and of the Garda force the <Col N="777" /> term &ldquo;independent&rdquo; is crucial to this entire debate.  The decision of the Garda representative bodies to accept the principle of an independent complaints tribunal was good judgment on their part. That is why I make the point as strongly as I can that the Minister should give serious consideration to this aspect on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>It is desirable to put on record that some of the incidents that have tended to mar the image of the Garda force and which strangely enough happened to coincide with the drafting of this and previous Bills, are not representative of the overall performance of the force. However, the fact that these incidents occurred, and perhaps are likely to happen again, justifies our decision to set up a procedure for the investigation of any form of misconduct within the force. This is desirable not only from a public viewpoint but even more so from the viewpoint of the Garda Síochána.  However, it would be wrong if I did not put on record the fact that the number of such incidents is very insignificant in relation to the total strength of the force.  In fact, it is somewhere in the region of half of 1 per cent and, in itself, that is sufficient proof of the very high status and standards of our Garda.</P>
    <P>I say to the Commissioner and the force generally that never in the history of the State was there such a need for the widest possible acceptance of the credibility and the performance of our gardaí. Never was there a greater need for closer public co-operation with the force.  With suitable amendments this Bill will strengthen that link.  I hope the Minister will be receptive towards accepting amendments tabled by us on Committee Stage for that purpose.</P>
    <P>I should like to see greater co-operation between the Garda and the community. If that co-operation is not forthcoming the Garda will not achieve a very high success rate in law enforcement and in the detection of serious crime.  I have always held the view &mdash; I have no reason to change my mind now &mdash; that the departure from community policing in the true meaning of that concept was <Col N="778" /> a mistake.  By that I mean the position where gardaí were known to the community and where there was a common bond and a common goal.  As a result of this Bill that kind of co-operation from the public will be forthcoming.  They will feel confident that if they have a complaint against an individual garda it will be investigated independently and fairly. I know that is the intention of the Minister and I can assure him and the House that it is also the intention of Members on this side.  We want to see a fair and independent tribunal set up, one that is seen to be independent and that will do justice to the public and the Garda.</P>
    <P>The existence of a body like that proposed will create a greater awareness on the part of individual gardaí that their performance must always be to the standard expected of the force and that if they are in serious breach of that acknowledged ethical code they will have to answer for their conduct.  I do not think that is an unreasonable assumption.  It is a view that will be shared by the vast majority of the force with whom we are proud to be associated.</P>
    <P>If I were to interpret the spirit of general Garda reaction to this Bill, I would say gardaí are extremely concerned about their individual positions in relation to some aspects.  Therefore, again I make the point that at the end of the day this Bill must be amended in a number of crucial areas.  It is fair to say that this House and the public have no desire to reach a point where gardaí are not free and happy to pursue their work of law enforcement to the limit.  There is a greater need than ever before for more in-depth training and in-service training, particularly for Garda recruits.  Apart from training in practical police duties, gardaí of the future will need a greater and more precise knowledge of every detail of the law.  It is a fact that far too often the professional criminal has a knowledge of the law that enables him to manipulate the system to his own advantage and which often places our gardaí at a serious disadvantage.  From my discussions with individual members of the <Col N="779" /> force, I know they have become disillusioned and disenchanted with their efforts in apprehending criminals.  Sometimes this ends in the criminals being released on a technicality, or because of the inadequacy of our courts or places of detention.  Far too often gardaí see the criminals back on the streets.</P>
    <P>The task of the Garda Síochána is getting tougher and more dangerous.  We have a duty to give them adequate powers to enforce all the provisions in relation to the Criminal Justice Act.  It is true that the greater power and freedom conferred on the force in legislation, the greater the risk of abuse.  As far as the public are concerned, the Bill with suitable amendments will adequately protect the public interest.  It has been suggested to me that if this Bill became law in its present form it would create a situation where the Garda would not fully perform their duties as police officers.  I do not believe this will be so.  I say that 99 per cent of the gardaí are professional and dedicated law enforcement officers and will not shirk performing their duties under any circumstances.  However, we must ensure that we do not make their task more difficult as a result of our deliberations in this House.</P>
    <P>At this stage I will confine my contribution to the broad principles of the Bill as circulated.  There will be ample opportunity on Committee Stage to deal in detail with all sections of the Bill with a view to having it amended suitably.</P>
    <P>Like all other pieces of legislation, the Bill contains references and phraseology that are not understood readily by the lay person, and like other legislation, too, it probably provides ample scope for legal argument and interpretation.  Therefore, for the moment I will confine myself to trying to determine as a layman whether the Bill seems to have the potential of achieving what we had in mind for it.  The need for the legislation arises from the provision of the additional powers contained in the Criminal Justice Act.  In relation to that Act, it is worth recalling that the Garda, for their own good reasons, considered they needed greater <Col N="780" /> powers.  Organisations representing various areas of citizens' rights campaigned strongly on the grounds that the provisions in that Act were too far-reaching. This House in its collective wisdom tried to strike a balance by giving the Garda more power in respect of certain areas of their operations while agreeing to delay the implementation of these provisions until an independent complaints procedure had been set up.  The broad principles of that procedure are before us today.</P>
    <P>It is worth noting, too, that within the force there has been in operation a disciplinary code which was updated in 1971 and which is regarded by many members of the Garda as being weighted heavily against individual members of the force. Whatever about that viewpoint, there is ample evidence that the system exists. We do not have to search far to find the evidence of that.  Members of the Garda were always conscious of the existence of that procedure.  They feared its sanctions. It is no harm to remind the House that this Bill is before us in the wake of an unprecedented number of serious breaches of discipline, all of which, in a very short period, made an impression on the public mind and which could be taken out of context easily in relation to the overall performance of the force.  I made that point earlier when I indicated the very low incidence of any serious breach of discipline within the Garda. Consequently, it is very important that, in fairness to the overall body of the Garda, reference to that kind of behaviour should not be taken out of context. This House condemns any such activity on behalf of the Garda but we must acknowledge that such behaviour is not tolerated or condoned within the force.</P>
    <P>What surprises me about the Bill is that a Minister who was reluctant in regard to the concept of a complaints Bill has now gone overboard in bringing before the House measures which are extreme and regressive and which raise serious questions in relation to the rights of members of the Garda not only in the performance of their duties but also in regard to their rights as private citizens.  I trust that <Col N="781" /> during this debate, and especially on Committee Stage, the Minister will keep an open mind and that what will emerge at the end of the day will be a Bill that will be acceptable both to the Garda and to the public.</P>
    <P>I agree with the general format and structure of the procedure proposed. With some modifications of a technical nature, and which I shall raise with Deputy Woods in the context of amendments on Committee Stage, the procedure provides an acceptable forum for the public in making complaints against the Garda and in having those complaints investigated.  That development is welcome. It provides a facility to which the public are entitled and one which democracy of its very essence demands.</P>
    <P>The Garda, too, are entitled to have their views considered in the context of this Bill.  It is to their credit that they have welcomed the concept of an independent complaints body.  All of us will have heard the individual views of members of the force in relation to certain sections of the Bill.  The Garda have been constructive and reasonable in their comments.  They are anxious to pursue the difficult job with which they have been entrusted on behalf of the nation.  They have been embarrassed by some of the undesirable events that have tended to mar the otherwise credible image of the force.  The words used by one garda to me in relation to the legislation were, &ldquo;Give us the same degree of protection as that afforded to the criminal.&rdquo;  That statement speaks for itself.</P>
    <P>There could develop an unreal air about this debate because in the final analysis the question will be one of trust as between the Garda and the community and trust cannot be legislated for.  There is a real danger that if we lock our gardaí in a chain of disciplinary regulations, some of which may be unclear and confusing, we may well be tying the hands of the people on whom we depend to protect the lives and property of our citizens.  I do not think that would be the intention of the House because that would be a dangerous and wrong line to take bearing <Col N="782" /> in mind the increasing level of crime and lawlessness generally.</P>
    <P>If I were to try to reflect the views of the people, I would say that they are telling us to grant to the Garda by way of legislation the freedom they require to enable them to deal with the thugs, the robbers, the car thieves, the drug pushers and the rapists who are rampant in society and who very often are ahead of our Garda in the organised way in which they operate.  In any legislation that might be proposed to deal with the matter of discipline within the force it is of paramount importance that the proposals are seen to be fair and acceptable to the force generally and to its individual members. In the national interest such legislation must be of a nature also that will deter individual members of the Garda in regard to the full implementation of their duty.  It is shameful that following the passing in this House more than two years ago of the Criminal Justice Act, we have had to wait all this time for the Minister to bring before us a Bill to allow for the full implementation of that Act.  Now that the Bill is before the House it is regrettable to some extent that it lacks the air of independence which all of us had hoped would have surrounded it.</P>
    <P>During the debate on the Criminal Justice Bill we sought safeguards for people in custody but there is no reference to that here and no provision to enable that deficiency in the system to be adequately catered for.  If we are talking about strengthening the hands of the Garda and introducing an independent complaints tribunal in relation to Garda performance, it is also vitally important that we should protect the public to the maximum extent possible.</P>

      <P>It is not my intention to repeat what I said on this Bill last week, other than to say that we on this side of the House are disappointed that the Minister does not appear to be able to implement the proposals which we are making.  Among the greatest contributory factors to the high crime wave which we have been experiencing for the past ten years has been the ease of getting rid of stolen property and drug abuse.  If property could not be so easily got rid of it would be a waste of time for robbers repeatedly to break into houses.  There is a need of much heavier sentencing for receivers of stolen property.  I hope the Minister will keep his promise to bring in an amendment to the Criminal Justice Act which will allow a sentence for handling. This is a new offence and one which should carry as heavy a sentence as that borne by those who receive goods.</P>
      <P>One of the contributory factors to the increasing growth in crime is container traffic.  I have heard that when sports bicycles, in particular, are stolen they are collected and sent by container to the Continent.  If this is true it leaves a lot to be desired.  There are many means of checking traffic and there should be no container in this country whose whereabouts are not known at a particular time. The companies who own them should be held at least partly responsible if they are being used to ship stolen goods out of the country.  In the past various types of contraband have been found in containers. The customs officials do a very good job but there should be more knowledge on the part of the shipping companies and their agents about what is going into their containers.  The Department of Justice might consider this point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We live in the age of the computer and there is no reason why people should not give the number of their television set when renewing their licence.  This could assist considerably in the identification and recovery of that set.  People very <Col N="784" /> often do not write down the serial numbers of their equipment or if theydo so they forget where they have kept the record.  There is no reason why these numbers could not be put into a computer bank for reference.</P>
    <P>Crime against the elderly has come to the fore again.  These are the most vulnerable people in our community since they cannot defend themselves against attack.  Very often intruders enter their houses and take away their property while they are helpless to do anything about it.  During a speech in this House on 5 May 1982 I referred to an attack on two brothers in their late seventies who were terrorised by cudgel-wielding thugs who raided their farmhouse and left them tied up in the dark.  That is still going on today.</P>
    <P>In the Crumlin area of my constituency 70 per cent of the houses have been robbed several times, some as many as five times.  It is a thieves' paradise.  Who are the people receiving these stolen goods?  The Garda know who the robbers are but they are constrained from arresting people they may suspect of receiving stolen goods because of insufficient force of law.  It is something the Minister must tighten up.  Criminals when they are caught should be made to pay their victims. If somebody steals a television set, he should be made pay either by deductions from his wages or by a deduction from social welfare payments.  People are entitled to be compensated for their losses.  We tend to speak a lot about the crime wave but we always appear to be hidebound when it comes to the implementation of the law.  I want to see the Department of Justice come up with legislation.  It should not be that difficult for them.  They are the experts.  I know the Minister says there is a backlog of legislation but an amendment of the existing legislation to render the receivers and the handlers of stolen property more accessible to the forces of law and order is most important.</P>
    <P>I read in the paper that Deputy Skelly had been fined £5 for driving in a bus lane.  That can happen to anyone but why should a garda spend his day in court on <Col N="785" /> a case like that?  There must be some way in which the law could be amended to allow an inspector or somebody else to take these small traffic offences and maintain gardaí where they belong, within the community.  Surely that is not too much to ask.  There tends to be a lethargic approach.  I often wonder do such people know what it is like to live in daily fear of having one's house broken into, knowing that one will never see one's property again, wondering when such burglars will come again.  People are afraid to leave their homes.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to deal with this whole problem with greater urgency. To a large extent he has trivialised a genuine effort on the part of our spokesman and his back-up team to come to grips with the problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L.T. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I might compliment the Opposition on their intent in this Bill.  It behoves all of us to show commitment and resolve to continuing to give our assistance in the campaign to combat crime.  A very large number of robberies have occurred in the past few years.  We public representatives are only too well aware of the many people who have approached us, how many of our friends have reported to us that their houses have been burgled or how many of their friends, in turn, have been victims of the serious crime which continues to obtain.</P>
      <P>Strenuous efforts are being undertaken by the Minister, in conjunction with the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána, the members of the force and the public. It should be remembered that this problem will not be resolved without the commitment, resolve and determination of all of us and that includes Government and Opposition alike.  It is encouraging to note that there has been some slight improvement.  However, it is not much consolation to tell somebody whose house has just been burgled that there has been an improvement, that there were fewer larceny offences committed last year than the year before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must all show commitment in tackling this problem.  I would be hopeful that <Col N="786" /> the introduction of this Bill, the work put into its preparation on the part of the Opposition spokesman, his advisers and junior spokesman, now present, will maintain the pressure on the Minister, his departmental officials and the other officials whose job it is to bring forward such legislation.  While it is appreciated that there are many demanding priorities the pressure should be maintained on them to introduce either an alternative Bill or amendments to the present one.</P>
    <P>It should be pointed out that the Criminal Justice Act, 1984, went some way towards tackling the problem.  However, it is unfortunate that we still await the implementation of some of its provisions. Hopefully the Garda Síochána (Complaints) Bill, now in the course of Second Reading, will go some way down that road and that it will be passed somewhat quicker than the Criminal Justice Act.  I say that with respect to some Members of the House who appeared to indulge in a sort of academic dialogue with the Minister over many weeks and months. It is important that we keep our priorities in order and do not become tangled up in the legislative process.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the Opposition have brought this Bill before the House. One section of the Bill is particularly important, that is the one dealing with the whole question of the handling, fencing and trading in stolen goods.  If some progress can be made in that respect then the crime rate will be reduced further.  It is evident that the crime statistics will be reduced only through concerted action on the part of everybody.  Bearing in mind that probably the crime problem is greatest in the Dublin area, it is heartening to hear the number of people who say they notice regular Garda patrols in their areas, or the fact that when they call on them they arrive with the minimum of delay.  It is important that there be continued public support given to the Garda. It should be remembered that there are only so many gardaí, that they cannot be everywhere at all times and that they are dependent on public support.  I hope the message will go out from this Chamber that the public should consult, support <Col N="787" /> and talk to the Garda.  It is important that gardaí get to know the people in their neighbourhood, that they get to know them, perhaps, even on first name terms. In that way the public benefit from the knowledge that there are patrols in their areas.</P>
    <P>It is important to mention the progress made in the neighbourhood watch programme which has developed in recent times.  Though it may have had a slow start it is heartening that residents' associations report an almost total interest and commitment to the operation of such a system within their housing estates. No matter what legislation is enacted if the Garda do not have the support of the public &mdash; who can act as their eyes and ears &mdash; further progress will not be made in the reduction of crime statistics.</P>
    <P>Despite the high figures recorded, some progress has been made.  I quote briefly from the <i>Report on Crime 1984</i> in which the Garda Commissioner said to the Minister for Justice in a letter on page 1:</P>
    <P>I am pleased to report that there was an overall decrease in indictable crime of 2.6% in comparison with the figure for 1983.  This was the first reduction in crime since 1978 and is a very welcome development.  The total number of indictable offences recorded for 1984 was 99,727.  Despite the reduction the incidence of crime remains at a very high level.</P>
    <P>We are only too well aware of that. Despite the progress, we in this House are only too well aware that it remains at a very high level, that the number of robberies taking place is still far too high.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note from that report that nearly one in five crimes consists of interference with property left in unattended vehicles.  This indicates the awareness that must be aroused in the general public in relation to goods which can easily be taken through a broken car window and subsequently disposed of. The public must have a certain response to this, which I think they are making; <Col N="788" /> but at times we are all inclined to leave in the back of our cars goods of a certain value which can be stolen and disposed of.</P>
    <P>We must ensure an increasing awareness in the general public in relation to crime prevention.  The Garda on &ldquo;Garda Patrol&rdquo;, speaking to communities in various areas, addressing residents' associations and through their crime prevention service are gradually getting the message across.  This must be extended to crime prevention in the home.  We must encourage the realisation that people must not only look after their own house but must develop a certain nosy neighbour syndrome about what is happening next door or down the road.  At times only a 999 call can assure that one criminal fewer is out and about.  The progress that has been made in the development of the neighbourhood watch system and the whole area of crime and prevention and commitment by the public to supporting and helping the police must be maintained and every effort must be made to base the neighbourhood watch and support system in pretty well every housing estate in the country.  Only by this can we ensure that the criminal is beaten.</P>
    <P>Even though the Minister has pointed out some possible defects in this Bill or areas where it might be well to wait a while and develop a more substantial Bill, I hope that the fact that this Bill has been brought before the House will ensure that pressure is kept upon the Department and their officials in this regard.  It is easy when things go wrong to shout at the Minister and call for his resignation.  Then when major developments have been made by the Garda authorities, the silence is interesting.  Last weekend we did not hear too many people shouting about what the Minister had not done.  It is all too easy to blame one man at the end of the day while he is in the hot seat, but any Department or organisation depend on the satisfactory working of all their units.  There is no point in people coming in here and shouting and calling for the Minister to resign or for condemnation of him when probably some of the <Col N="789" /> events which have occurred are rightly the responsibility of some other individual.</P>
    <P>That said, we need to be aware of the difficulties and problems that arise.  It is all too easy to come in here being critical when we might be more helpful if we came up with proper support and with suggestions which would solve problems and tackle difficulties that arise.  I hope that later in the year the Minister can come forward with this Bill, possibly amended to strengthen his hand further in the handling of offences.  He has emphasised that quite an amount of legislation is on stream at the moment.  The Garda Complaints Bill has come to the House recently.  The Department are involved in preparing legislation on the abolition of juries, amendment to the liquor licensing laws, domicile and telephone tapping regulations.  It is important that such legislation comes on stream also, but we must not lessen the resolve to bring forward legislation along the lines suggested in this Bill and particularly to get at the criminals who are doing the cleaner work and possibly making the more money, people who are handling stolen goods.  It is likely that the person who is surprised on a robbery, leaving the scene of a robbery or on his way to a robbery is caught while the godfathers are likely to escape.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned section 4 of the Vagrancy Act, 1824.  The three month sentence which applies in this case is unsatisfactory and should be amended forthwith.  The time of day at which a person is caught in possession of stolen goods should be irrelevant.  I think progress has been made on this both in the 1976 Act and in the 1984 Act recently passed.</P>
    <P>It is clear that some of the increase in the number of robberies is due to people having a drug habit which is expensive. People who are not in the whole of their health are going out with the intention of getting goods to sell in order to pay for their drugs and it is important that a continuous effort be made in this area.  If <Col N="790" /> we tackle the drugs problem with continued commitment, the number of larcenies will be reduced.</P>
    <P>It is also important to make inroads into tackling the whole question of robberies because of the resulting high cost of insurance.  We are only too well aware that the cost of insurance of household goods has doubled and trebled because of so many houses being burgled.  I hope that there will be a more complete Bill later in the year to deal with the whole question of handling stolen property. Section 4 states:</P>
    <P>The Principal Act is hereby amended by the substitution of the following sections for section 33:</P>
    <P>33.&mdash;(1) A person handles stolen property if (otherwise than in the course of the stealing) knowing or believing it to be stolen property he dishonestly receives the property, or dishonestly undertakes or assists in its retention, removal, disposal or realisation by or for the benefit of another person, or if he arranges to do so.</P>
    <P>There could be certain difficulties with regard to the onus of proof in relation to belief.  We must be careful not to rush through a Bill which people will be able to use as a means of avoiding being convicted.</P>
    <P>We must examine the whole question of bail.  One individual in my constituency who has been up on 50 or 60 charges is still out on bail.  It has been touted in the past that perhaps a constitutional change is needed, but it is an area which must be looked at because it is scandalous that people are continuing to commit larcenies while out on bail.  I hope that the provision in the 1984 Bill of an extra offence for crimes committed while on bail and the introduction of the consecutive rather than the concurrent sentence in such cases will make it less rosy for some of the criminals to carry on their robberies while on bail.</P>
    <P>It is clear that the Government have made a certain amount of progress in this area.  The need for public support and the <Col N="791" /> support of Members of this House and of community and residents' associations cannot be overstated.  Gardaí cannot be everywhere and they depend on public support, public awareness and public co-operation in their efforts to tackle crime. Crime is going to be reduced, not by the passage of this Bill through the House but by concerted effort and general support of the action being taken by the Government, supported by the Opposition who, I must say, are only too well aware of the problem.  This Bill in its present form may not go through the House, but I hope that it will impress on the Minister, on the Government and, in particular, on those who can quicken up or, perhaps not through their own fault, slow down the introduction of legislation, that this area must be kept under constant review.</P>
    <P>We must consider the cases in which goods are marked and come up for sale and introduce systems of marking goods so that there will not be the same attraction towards handling and processing stolen property.  We must look further than is envisaged in this Bill.  However, it is important that the Opposition have brought this Bill forward in Private Members' Time and are devoting two periods over roughly a fortnight to discussions. This emphasises their awareness of the present problem and the awareness of the Members in general.</P>
    <P>There are grave economic problems to be faced, but the reality is that when people are attacked in their homes, or return home to find that their property has been taken or their homes interfered with, there is a common response and a common commitment to tackling this ongoing serious problem.  While progress has been made, many people still come to us because of so many robberies being carried out and we cannot sit back.  We can show that we are going in the right direction, but we must have a continued commitment towards ensuring further progress.  The policing policy and the increase in the number of convictions over the past while show that positive action has been taken.  I hope that further <Col N="792" /> measures will be taken and further support given to the Garda to ensure that the number of crimes is further reduced and that this year's and next year's figures will be an improvement.</P>
    <P>Despite the fact that this Bill put forward by the Opposition may not get through in its present form, it has brought the matter to the forefront and I hope will ensure that the message goes out from this House that greater measures will be taken and more charges will result in convictions against those who are up for handling stolen goods.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. L. Fitzgerald Mr. L. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to respond to a few comments made by Deputy Cosgrave. I am sorry that I missed the beginning of his contribution, but I was very interested in and listened with great attention to what I heard.  His approach to this whole area was very positive.  I am reasonably certain from his contribution that he has had ongoing representations from residents with regard to the problem of burglaries, thefts, receivers and handlers and all related operators in this field. He showed a very clear understanding of the level of the problem which obtains in our community.  I was impressed by his honest acknowledgement of the importance of a Bill of this kind being brought before the House, and he was not prepared to say that it was wrong or unnecessary or unworkable.  He acknowledged the importance of a Bill of this kind and he was not prepared to say outright that the Bill as drafted by Deputy Woods was not a good one.</P>
      <P>I am sure there is no Member of the House, particularly in urban constituencies, who has not had visits from constituents on a weekly or daily basis expressing fear for their safety or that of their property.  They also express annoyance and frustration and outrage at their properties being burgled and that the perpetrators in many cases were immune from prosecution, or walking free from the courts because of the inability of the Garda to get sufficient evidence to have them indicated.  This comes across repeatedly, particularly to Deputy Cosgrave and other urban Deputies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="793" /> In recent times one of the most significant developments in urban communities is a sense of hopelessness and demoralisation and a growing loss of confidence in the ability of this House and the forces of law and order to come to grips effectively with the enormous spate of house burglaries and thefts.  I have become most concerned in the past four or five years, and I have expressed it in the House on the few occasions I have spoken on the issue of law and order, about the growing cynicism among the public, particularly in urban areas, who are anxious to get on with their daily lives.  They are anxious to look after their own affairs without constant harassment because of an epidemic of house breakings and thefts. Their sense of frustration, which they express to us, has become so grave and deep-seated that individuals and groups have banded together, and in some instances exploit every possible legitimate means of taking on the problem and playing their part in their communities to combat the crime wave and to restore some degree of peace and comfort and wellbeing in their homes and among their neighbours.</P>
    <P>Sometimes, out of this sheer sense of frustration and cynicism and hopelessness, they resort to illegal methods. Though I do not condone any community, group or individual resorting to illegal methods, I can understand why they have found themselves in such an extreme state and why they resort to extreme methods.</P>
    <P>In the last few years we have seen the development of neighbourhood patrols and vigilante groups throughout Dublin. They are taking to the streets because of an inadequate response from this House and from the Minister, who is responsible for the overall preservation of law and order.  Having spoken at length and expressed their fears and anxieties, their grievances and sense of outrage to the Garda and their public representatives and, I am sure, in many instances to the Minister, they eventually came to the conclusion that the Garda are not adequately equipped with resources and <Col N="794" /> powers to deal effectively with this pervasive evil in their community.  It is a serious blow to democracy that this development has come about, because the public have trusted us legislators to give adequate powers and resources to the professional forces of law and order.</P>
    <P>A siege mentality exists in the north side of Dublin, and Deputy Birmingham sitting opposite me must have come across it in many parts of his constituency. Residents and community associations have to trade the convenience of pedestrian ways through estates for ugly concrete walls.  Through roads have been blocked off, once beautiful open spaces between houses have been walled in and the once friendly knock on the door from the visiting neighbour is now treated with caution and suspicion.</P>
    <P>Apart from unemployment and tax reform, crime, lawlessness and vandalism are the very next topic of concern among the public.  We have all heard, I am sure, grievance after grievance from the taxpayer, complaining that he is footing the bill for this wanton lawlessness.  We have all heard of the phenomenal increase in insurance premiums for houses and their contents because of the crime wave.  At the same time, not alone insurance companies but indeed security firms are having a field day installing burglar alarms and security locks in all our communities.</P>
    <P>Such extreme measures are referred to by some as panic and unnecessary, bordering on paranoia.  It has been stated by the Minister on a number of occasions that he has room to take comfort out of slight reductions in the overall level of indictable crime over the last few years.  He has never once acknowledged that the problem is a very serious one and that resources deployed to it in terms of legislation, personnel and equipment are anything but adequate.</P>
    <P>A look at the figures for 1984 is very revealing.  That year, the level of total indictable crime was almost 98,000 and of that figure, burglary, larceny and robbery accounted for more than 94,000 or 93 per cent of these crimes.  To say, therefore, that communities are not justified <Col N="795" /> in their deep-seated concern and anxiety, given the evidence, is to misrepresent the situation and is a failure to face up to the facts.  Such cynicism on the part of the Minister in the face of this breakdown of law and order must breed further cynicism in the public who are being consistently called upon to assist the Garda Síochána in carrying out their duties.  The co-operation link between the public and the Garda has dwindled rapidly and must as rapidly be rebuilt because without that link we cannot keep crime within limited proportions.  There is no such thing as an acceptable level of crime.  Without this link a sense of security will not return.</P>
    <P>The incidence of crime of the type referred to gives rise to serious concern. In 1984 over £34 million worth of property was stolen as against £10 million worth in 1978.  In 1984 only between 7 per cent and 8 per cent of goods stolen were recovered.  This gives rise for concern and is totally unacceptable.  Nowadays it is property other than cash which is stolen in house burglaries except when they are the houses of senior citizens. For the most part robberies affect new technology amusement equipment, such as stereos and videos, jewellery and other valuable items.  These valuables are doing the rounds in an illegal market at an enormous rate.  The fact that most of these thefts are undetected is tending to make crime more respectable.  Burglars and receivers are walking the streets with increased immunity from the law.</P>
    <P>Only yesterday I had a phone call from a secretary of a local residents' association informing me that the previous night there had been six house burglaries despite the existence of a neighbourhood watch which had been actively operating for the previous four or five months.  I am not knocking the neighbourhood watch. This person stated that well over 100 burglaries had been reported to her over the last few months and that they had been reported to the local gardaí.  A series of meetings between the neighbourhood watch and the Garda had highlighted the existence of a network of receivers and purchasers and the ongoing frustration <Col N="796" /> experienced by the Garda due to inadequate legislation to enable them to address the problem to the satisfaction of the community.  New legislation is urgently needed to address this problem and enable the Garda to carry out their duties effectively and win the confidence of the community so that they will co-operate with them in the restoration of peace and security.</P>
    <P>The Bill before the House, introduced by Deputy Woods, is a positive instrument in addressing the problem.  It is intended to get to the core of the problem referred to.  Theft is the most pervasive crime in urban and rural areas.  I commend Deputy Woods on the work and commitment he put into drafting this legislation.  In Opposition it is not easy to collect the expertise, the research and the resources that must be co-ordinated in drafting any legislation.  I specially commend Deputy Woods for introducing this positive amending legislation.</P>
    <P>If the Minister is serious in his efforts to tackle crime, lawlessness and vandalism and in his calls for co-operation with the forces of law and order, he is setting a very bad example by his refusal to co-operate in the passage of this Bill.  There might be certain aspects of the Bill with which the Government would have difficulty and they may have wished to put down amendments, but I am sure Deputy Woods would have been open to any reasonable suggestions.  The Deputy's mind was not closed when he came before the House with very urgently required legislation which would make a substantial contribution towards combating crime.  Despite our positive approach in addressing this problem the Minister is refusing to co-operate.  The Government have refused to co-operate.</P>
    <P>All too often in the past, amid jeers and sneers, we have been asked what we would come up with and we have been accused of opposition for opposition's sake.  The Minister and the Government have chosen to be very negative in this case.  The Minister realises that he has been caught offside.  The speedy introduction of the Garda (Complaints) Bill, <Col N="797" /> while urgent and necessary, seems coincidential. Does it not reflect an attempt by the Minister to deflect from the merits of this Bill and give him the excuse for delay in the introduction of some similar type of legislation which he vaguely referred to last week?  If the Minister listened to Deputy Cosgrave and others, he would find that there is general acceptance that this type of Bill is urgently required.  If the Minister is using his Bill as a convenient ploy, his attitude must be condemned. Anybody willing to look seriously at the statistics I quoted will agree that the steps proposed here if adopted will have a significant major impact on the current spate of crime and vandalism throughout the country.</P>
    <P>What we have to look at immediately is the legislation governing the crime of receiving stolen goods and match that against the evidence we are getting from the Garda Síochána in relation to their difficulties in the use of that legislation to reduce and contain the crime rate in this area.  Time and again we hear of cases where the Garda have identified the culprits, brought the cases to court and had them thrown out.  They have stated that this is because of the archaic and inadequate legislation dealing with this type of crime to enable them to successfully prosecute cases in court.  What is happening in the meantime?  With their frustration and public cynicism criminals are roaming our streets day and night victoriously and most defiantly.</P>
    <P>The Larceny Act, 1916 is the law which governs this type of crime and, indeed, many people involved in the area of crime detection and prosecution, those involved in the judicial system itself, have highlighted sections of the Act as being very inadequate.  The greatest bone of contention relates to section 33 which refers to receiving.  If we look at some of the deficiencies which have been allowed to linger on in this Act, it is easy to see why the law has fallen into disrepute and is referred to so derisively by the community and criminals alike.</P>
    <P>One such area is where a person is detected or apprehended in a house or <Col N="798" /> building with the obvious intent of committing a crime.  That person can be accused of an offence only if he is detected at night time.  Given the number of robberies, daylight robberies, that are so prevalent throughout the week and, indeed, at weekends, it must surely render this provision totally inadequate and almost irrelevant.  The passage or handling of stolen goods goes on just as much in broad daylight in defiance of the law of the land as it does in darkness.</P>
    <P>Again, of course, the handling or receiving of stolen goods is only an offence if it is the actual stolen property that is in question.  In most cases such property can be disposed of very quickly because of a wide circle.  It can be exchanged for other goods, or, indeed, sold.  Invariably a fairly wide circle of people are involved in this area of illegal activity.</P>
    <P>Another rather curious distinction still in the Act is between knowing and believing that goods have been stolen.  In other words, one can receive stolen goods but if one only believes them to be likely to have been stolen one can be immune from prosecution.  One must know with certainty that they have been stolen.  It is about time, given the emergency we have been living through for the past few years, the extent of arrogance of the culprits concerned, and the sophisticated backup of alibis, that this aspect was addressed with determination and a commitment given to enable the Garda to go about their business seriously.</P>
    <P>Another very contentious area is the onus of proof that is on the prosecution. During the course of my many discussions with members of the Garda Síochána at senior and rank and file level, regarding the reasons why it is so difficult to prepare a case for prosecution arising out of burglary or theft, I have heard consistently of the frustrations felt by the force in establishing that a person found in possession of stolen property knew at the time he received the property that it was stolen.  They find this extremely difficult to prove and refer to it as a major area needing immediate attention.  There is also the difficulty where a garda must prove that the stolen property was <Col N="799" /> received by the receiver, the accused, into his possession and this aspect too has given rise to many cases being thrown out.  All will agree that the Garda under existing legislation have to go to great lengths, sometimes unsuccessfully, when dealing with offences involving the disposal of stolen property.  Is it any wonder therefore, that such a small proportion of these cases are successfully prosecuted?</P>
    <P>Let us look at the text of the Bill and see how it proposes to address these difficulties, these very contentious areas. Everybody will agree that it is most unacceptable that any person who receives stolen property or handles it and knows or believes it to be stolen property should get away scot-free or should be immune from apprehension and prosecution by the Garda Síochána.  Since the Bill brings within its terms of reference an accused person who believed as distinct from who knew, and as well as who knew, that property found in his possession was stolen, it is a very positive step that must be commended by the House.</P>
    <P>I should say at this juncture that in a general sense the onus of proving guilt lying on the prosecution as opposed to the onus of establishing innocence resting with the defence is one that has to be commended and, indeed, supported in a general way.  However, while preserving that principle in a general sense, it must also be stated that exceptions have to be made in extreme circumstances.  We are dealing with extreme circumstances here. We are dealing with the most prevalent area of crime throughout our cities and rural areas.  Given the enormous difficulties brought to our attention again and again by the Garda and the Judiciary, it was with interest that I looked at the Oglesby case of 1966 as analysed by Deputy Woods.  This is interesting from a number of points of view, particularly in relation to the general acceptance up to then that people found in possession of recently stolen goods had the onus on them to advance a lawful excuse for possession.  The ruling in this case when it went to the Court of Criminal Appeal brought to an end the reliance on the <Col N="800" /> adoption of recent possession as a prosecution weapon in the fight against crime. In this context I must commend section 33 (2) (a) of our Bill which puts forward three elements, namely, the property recently stolen, (b) found in the accused possession and (c) without satisfactory explanation, as a method to constitute sufficient evidence that an accused person knew or believed the property that he had handled, or was in his possession was stolen.  Anybody who looks reasonably at this will accept that the provisions make sense because on the law of averages, if a person is in possession of or handling recently stolen goods, the onus should be on that person to come up with a satisfactory explanation as to why he or she is in possession of the property.  A very commendable aspect to this is the overwhelming extent of community acceptability it would have, and for any law to be a good law it must have a general degree of acceptability among the public.</P>
    <P>There are many other provisions in the Bill which are welcome and cause me to be baffled at the Minister's refusal to accept the Bill as a necessary and urgent piece of legislation.  For example, it is heartening to find that, regardless of what time of day it is, a person who is found to have his face disguised or concealed in order to facilitate or evade the consequences of a robbery or burglary can be found to be guilty of an offence under the Bill.  Indeed, the Bill also takes into account all sorts of sophisticated and modern equipment used not only in house break-ins and robberies but also intended to be used for other illegal activities.</P>
    <P>In a related area, the proposed amendment to section 40 of the Principal Act is by the substitution of the following subsection for subsection (3):</P>
    <P>Any number of persons may be charged on one indictment, with reference to the same act of stealing, with having at different times or at the same time handled all or any part of the stolen property, and the persons so charged may be tried together.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="801" /> This provision takes account of one of the more recent developments in crime whereby there can be a considerable number of people involved with the commital of any single offence.  It has always been there to one degree or another but in recent times it has become more sophisticated with a circle of receivers and handlers.  Because of the need to avoid detection there is usually a ring or circle of people involved, all of whom may be used in various ways to conceal or put out of circulation the burgled property and, who, through their co-operative efforts make the work of the Garda for detection and prosecution purposes far more difficult.  From time to time, one or more individuals may be apprehended but it was not easy under the existing Act to effectively break the circle and bring the culprits to justice.  This provision is a very realistic and positive attempt to address the problem.  In this connection also, the definition of stolen property has been looked at and if we take section 33 (b) of the proposed amendments we find that it extends the limits to which stolen property may be traced.  Subsection (2) (a) refers to:</P>
    <P>Any other property which directly or indirectly represents or has at any time represented the stolen property in the hands of the thief...</P>
    <P>I should like to call on the Minister to reconsider his position in regard to this matter.  It is less than responsible for any Minister to put forward what would appear to be spurious arguments to deflect attention from the Bill rather than being positive about it and give it his full support.</P>

      <P>If one were to look through the Official Reports of the proceedings of the House during the lifetime of this Dáil one would find that no subject, on the basis of the volume of column inches, has received as much attention as the subject of crime.  If I am right about that supposition it is entirely appropriate because no subject exercises <Col N="802" /> the public mind more than the incidence of crime.  Deputy Fitzgerald spoke very effectively of the extent to which the crime problem impacts on local communities and the extent to which it is capable of destroying the lifestyle of a local community.  If that is so, it is appropriate to consider the whole area of crime from a number of different approaches because there is no single answer.  We have to see to what extent the various approaches we have suggested to date have been successful and what additional responses are required.</P>
      <P>We start with the knowledge that the most recent figures available have shown a decline, for the first time in many years, in the number of indictable offences.  We take only limited comfort from that because the level of crime remains very high.  We are all aware of the extent to which someone faced with a crime finds it extraordinarily destructive of their self-confidence. That is very easy to understand when one is talking in terms of violent crime such as mugging but even when one is dealing with an offence which does not have that element of personal violence, the extent to which people feel themselves violated by an offence against their property, more particularly against their dwelling, which leaves them nervous and ill at ease for months or years afterwards, must concern us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This problem will not be resolved without addressing the root causes of crime.  That is not to make excuses for those who engage in crime or, as some people suggest, to say that crime can be put down to high levels of unemployment, poor recreational facilities and so on.  However, social problems affect the crime rate and there is a responsibility on us to address ourselves to those problems. In the last month or so, the other House has had an opportunity to consider the report of the Whitaker Committee on the prison system.  I sat in for that debate, representing the Minister for Justice, and, reading that report and listening to the contributions from Members, I was struck by how strongly that report has come out in terms of recognising the <Col N="803" /> youth service as a very important method of preventing crime.</P>
    <P>I am sure none of us would dissent from the view that prevention is more important than subsequent cure.  That is why I was very pleased before the turn of the year to publish a White Paper on the future development of the youth service which would see to it that for the first time the country would have a national youth service, but not a youth service that was nationalised, because it would continue to draw on the individual enthusiasm, flair and commitment which is so much a part of the voluntary service. It would be national in the sense that it would reach out to young people around the country and would be comprehensive in two senses, in that it would reach out to all young people and that it would comprehend the various needs which arise.  I am pleased that the Government were determined that it would not be simply a question of stringing a number of platitudes together and that they were prepared to put their money where their mouth is.  They did so by very substantially increasing funds available for the youth service at a time when the Government were properly concerned about controlling the growth of public expenditure. I see that whole area as a very important part of our response to the problem of crime, particularly to the problem of crime in urban areas.  It is certainly possible to pinpoint areas which have acquired enhanced recreational facilities, to chart the crime rate before and after and to see the improvement.  I regard that as a very real response.  Of course, it is also necessary to bring immediate relief from the symptoms and there are a number of ways in which that must be and is being done.  It is done first of all by ensuring that the Garda force are at their optimum strength, that the force are deployed to the maximum effect and in ensuring that they are equipped to the highest possible level.</P>
    <P>There are also other ways and one is in addressing the terms of criminal procedure, another is in terms of addressing the substantive criminal law.  Within the <Col N="804" /> lifetime of this Dáil we have already had a significant response in terms of criminal procedure.  We have seen the Dáil debate at extraordinary length and with great care the Criminal Justice Act proposing to substantially extend the powers available to the Garda in terms of their right to question, detain, fingerprint and so on.  There are also important ancillary provisions in this Bill, those dealing with offences committed while on bail.  Earlier we heard Deputy Cosgrave relating instances from his constituency and a high suspicion that multiple offences had been committed by people on bail and I am sure that Deputy Fitzgerald and other Members could tell similar tales even if they are unable to prove them.</P>
    <P>There is a provision in this Bill dealing with successive sentences when offences are committed on bail which are important. There is a real need to amend the substantive law in this area.  If you look at the principal criminal statutes, you will find that they are of some considerable antiquity.  The Offences Against the Person Act dates from around 1860, the Larceny Act goes back to 1916, the Forgery Act and so on were all passed a long time ago.  There is a case for updating and modernising our substantive criminal law and towards that end there is also a case for considering whether it might be appropriate to have a specific criminal law reform group as distinct from the Law Reform Commission whose remit covers the whole legal system, criminal and civil.  In the nature of things, social conditions have changed very dramatically with increased urbanisation and it is unreal to believe that legislative provisions enacted in the main in the last century or in the early years of this century will suffice in, for example, the area of fraud.  The opportunities for fraud which have arisen from our present methods of doing business in an increasingly cashless society could not have been anticipated by those who drafted our anti-fraud laws.</P>
    <P>From what I have said, it is clear that I regard it as appropriate that the House should be discussing its response to crime.  It will also be clear that there is an urgent requirement for reform of the <Col N="805" /> substantive criminal law.  I do not believe, however, that the Opposition used their time very wisely.  It is not for me to lecture them on how they should best use their time but perhaps I can make some suggestions. Looking at the way in which Private Members' Business has been used one can see that it has been used sometimes when a Bill was being drafted to put an issue on an agenda because, for one reason or another, the Government did not want to talk about it.  One thinks of the attempts right through the seventies in relation to the contraception controversy and the various attempts relating to building land and so on.  That is one use.  The second use is where a problem is identified, which is obviously fairly straightforward, but which for some reason is not seizing the attention of the Government and so it is possible to put it through.  There was legislation put through in the area of water pollution under Private Members' Business by the now Senator, then Deputy Luke Belton.</P>
    <P>In this instance what we are about is something quite different.  We are not talking about a simple measure which does not have implications for other areas of our legal system.  What we are about is a very complex area of criminal law &mdash; the area of offences against property, which is already the subject matter of a number of statutes and literally hundreds of reported cases, all putting a gloss on the different sections and subsections of the various statutes.  In my view this does not lend itself to an attempt by the Opposition to legislate.</P>
    <P>The question then has to be asked: why are they doing it?  Perhaps a hint of why was given by Deputy Fitzgerald when he said that Governments tend to say to an Opposition &ldquo;Why do you not come up with ideas?  Where are your policies?&rdquo;  I accept that that has happened, but I think the Opposition are being a little sensitive and what we are now seeing is an exercise in fast food draftsmanship and fast food legislation.  One wandering the corridors will see eager young lawyers, fresh from the law library or elsewhere, brandishing well thumbed copies of Archbold making their way to the fifth floor.</P>

      <P>In their enthusiasm to produce a Bill a week, they seem to have produced some rather curious Bills.  Their first attempt was the legislation on domicile.  There the very bright and determined advisers decided to take the lazy man's way out.  They got hold of the Law Reform Commission's report and cogged it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>That would not be too bad except that they failed to take account of various decisions and developments which had taken place subsequent to publication which rendered that approach entirely inappropriate.  In this instance, if I might say so, they have done something less venial, coming from the republican draftsman of a republican party.  What they have engaged in is a rather blatant piece of plagiarism.  They simply got hold of the British legislation and decided to cog it, lock, stock and barrel.  That would have been, perhaps, a venial sin if they had got it right; but in their anxiety to get something published, they have made more than a little &ldquo;hames&rdquo; of it and this measure does not bring us very much further along the road.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In their own defence to the charge of plagiarism they would probably say that they have not done anything that has not been already attempted in the 1976 criminal law jurisdiction legislation &mdash; and they would have something going for them because it is true that that Act inserts, holus bolus into the 1916 legislation, some sections which are borrowed from the British Theft Act, 1968.  But what that did not do, and what this measure certainly does not do, is address the <Col N="807" /> central question of our definition of stealing.</P>
    <P>The basic structure of our offences against property legislation is that we have an offence of stealing under section 1 of the Larceny Act which is defined as, if my memory serves me right, a person steals who, fraudulently and without acclaim of right made in good faith, takes and carries away property belonging to another with the intention at the time of such taking, permanently to deprive the owner thereof.  The very length of the definition will give some indication of the complexity of the offence.  After that there are a number of other offences, all of which have as one of their elements the element of stealing.</P>
    <P>For example, burglary, robbery and receiving all relate in one sense or another to the offence of stealing.  In the case of burglary and robbery, those offences are committed by someone who steals and does nothing more.  In the case of receiving the element of stealing arises in that the offence of receiving is committed by someone who does various things to goods which were stolen.  From that it follows that, if there are complexities, complications and inadequacies in the definition of stealing, then any attempt to tinker with any other offence in the Larceny Act will be less than successful. While some progress has undoubtedly been achieved by the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act, 1976, in relation to the offences it deals with, it is not the complete progress one might have wished for because we failed to update the offence of stealing under section 2.</P>
    <P>What is this Bill all about?  Ordinarily one would look to the Long Title of a Bill to get an idea of what it is all about.  The Long Title to this Bill says:</P>
    <P>An Act to extend the criminal law with regard to dishonest handling of stolen property, to reform the law in relation to the carrying out of robbery, burglary and other such offences and, in particular, the commission of these offences in daytime, to increase the penalties applicable to certain crimes <Col N="808" /> of dishonesty and to provide for related matters.</P>
    <P>There are three things we are going to learn about from this Bill.  In fairness, this Bill purports to say something about dishonest handling.  I agree with the draftsman of this measure that that is an area which requires attention.  I have no doubt that the draftsman &mdash; in this context I do not refer to Deputy Woods &mdash; will be well aware of the prevailing maxim in legal circles that so complex is our law in this area and to such an extent does the law fail to give a fair crack of the whip to the prosecution that someone competently defended ought not, except in the rarest circumstances, be convicted.</P>
    <P>The Bill relates to robbery, burglary and other offences and, in particular, the commission of these offences in daytime. Search as I do I find nothing of these offences in the Bill.  I wonder, therefore, how this managed to get into the Long Title.  It is not really surprising that I do not find anything about them in this measure because, while the great bulk of our criminal law dates back to the early years of this century or the last century, the offences of robbery and burglary were modernised in the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act, 1976.  That modernisation took the form of taking account of developments in both Britain and Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>I have already said that in at least one respect attempts at modernisation failed because of the failure to come to grips with the component offence of stealing. That confusion seems to have continued throughout the debate, and Deputy Fitzgerald waxed eloquently about the complications of whether various things happened in the daytime or at night.  If he refers to the definition of robbery, burglary, aggravated robbery and aggravated burglary, which are to be found in the 1976 Act, he will find that all those complexities went out the window at that stage.  Equally, the very technical decisions in relation to what constituted and what did not constitute break-in went out the window on that occasion.</P>
    <P>I can only assume that what happened <Col N="809" /> is that the draftsman of this measure must have suffered long and hard at some stage in the Halls of Academia on these points and when he sat down to draft the Bill it did not occur to him to consider whether changes might have taken place since he had occasion to study these matters and as a result we have all this about offences which are committed in the daytime. Now we come to the offence of receiving.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamSkelly" hpid="Mr. Skelly Mr. Skelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the Chair for giving me the opportunity to raise this matter on the Adjournment.  It was not considered urgent enough to raise it today on the Order of Business.</P>
      <P>Deputy Gregory was fined £150 and, by order of the District Court, was bound over to keep the peace for six months.  It is important to note that Deputy Gregory went to prison on a point of principle, namely, the right to protest peacefully alongside and on behalf of his constituents. He does not think he should have been bound over because it prevents him from doing something which he considers in conscience he must do.</P>
      <P>In his own statement Deputy Gregory said he represented some of the poorest people who had no option but to protest to achieve their civil rights.  One can contrast this with the power, money and influence of the City Centre Traders' Association and Irish Life in whose name a case has been taken to prevent traditional street traders taking up an option that was already granted by the city to trade in the cul-de-sac leading to the centre, and one could be forgiven for concluding that an injustice is taking place or that at least a call for protest and support on behalf of the people concerned is necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This case began in the Circuit Court. It went to the Supreme Court by way of case stated.  Because the Circuit Court judge in question retired and Irish Life deliberately delayed the action by not <Col N="810" /> putting it to the Supreme Court in time, the case has now to return to the Circuit Court.  That process has been going on for two years.</P>
    <P>I believe that it is sometimes necessary to accept even prison rather than to compromise one's principles although I should imagine that in this most conservative of Houses that would be frowned upon in the extreme.  In my experience this Chamber is comprised of some of the most cowardly people when it comes to matters of principle or justice.  Although they seem to think they are very humane, caring and just, I have found that not to be true.  The opposite is the case.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gregory's constituents who depend on him to a great extent and some of my own constituents are unfairly disadvantaged.  They live in areas where as few as 1 per cent of the population receive any kind of third level education and they make up about 25 per cent of the population of St. Patrick's Institution and Mountjoy Prison.  In advantaged areas the percentage receiving third level education is 30 per cent to 40 per cent. People in such areas know how to take advantage of the system and to come out on top.</P>
    <P>In a dissertation on civil disobedience Thoreau said, &ldquo;The only obligation which I have a right to assume is to do at any time what I think right.  To be right is more honourable than law abiding.&rdquo;  I find it regrettable to have to call on the Minister to release an honourable and responsible Member of this House.  The Minister should have done this without persuasion as he is empowered to do under section 23 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1951.  It was once considered by two former Taoisigh that Deputy Gregory was important enough to be courted for his support.  I ask the question if he would be left incarcerated if that occasion were to arise now.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gregory is not a common criminal, neither is he a wild nor dangerous person.  His constituents are calling for his release because they want him among them.  As the Minister is well aware, people involved in more serious <Col N="811" /> cases have been released.  What is involved is a principle I stand over.  Gandhi said that if you have an idea or a principle, not to practise it is dishonest.  He asked how can one believe in a moral or religious precept and not live it.  He also said that the only protection the underprivileged have are the morals of those who are privileged.  Therefore, I call on the Minister to release Deputy Gregory.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Skelly for giving me some of his time to debate the matter that we unsuccessfully raised today.  I also thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing this important matter to be discussed.  It appears once again that our Standing Orders are outdated.  This important matter has received considerable attention.  The fact that somebody &mdash; in this case a Member of this House &mdash; is behind the bars of a jail has been ruled out because it is said there is no degree of urgency even though tomorrow is one of the key days in the parliamentary calendar.  Today I asked that Deputy Gregory be allowed to attend here in the national Parliament.  The Deputy concerned made the same call and said he would return to jail.  This happens in the case of many prisoners.  In the area that Deputy Gregory and I represent many people have been charged and sentenced but they have never spent a night in Mountjoy Prison.  The Minister and his officials are aware of that.  In many cases Deputy Gregory has made representations on behalf of his constituents and they have been released.  On this occasion neither he nor his colleagues can do this. Last night at a meeting of the premier local authority in the country, Dublin City Council, speakers on all sides &mdash; Deputy Doyle, the leader of the Fine Gael group, I as the leader of the Fianna Fáil group and Independent members &mdash; all called for the release of Deputy Gregory to allow him to continue with his duties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept that people cannot be allowed to break the law and that they will have to pay fines but what happened in this case was unreasonable.  Although this <Col N="812" /> matter has received much publicity, the point has been missed, namely, why Deputy Gregory decided to go to jail. The question of illegal trading, legal traders and those who operate in shanty huts in the city centre has been ongoing for 30 years but the legality or otherwise of the traders has never been clarified in law by the city council.  Because of developments such as that carried out by Irish Life these people have been removed from sites where their families have traded for generations.  There may have been agreements in law but the people concerned did not understand them. They have sold shoes and other items for generations.  People who know the area of Moore Street and Henry Street know about this.  Some of the traders are legal, others are illegal and more operate from shanty huts where it is questionable whether they are illegal or legal.  In the past nine months a final decision has been reached about who can remain and at what location.  Families who have been traditional traders have pressed very strongly to be included in what is classified as legal traders.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with all of Deputy Gregory's view on this matter.  I believe that the traditional illegal traders have some rights but people who have come on the scene in the past few years have not got those rights.  Deputy Gregory refused to sign a bond that he would not protest for the next six months.  This matter that has been debated for the last 30 years will be solved in the next two months and thus Deputy Gregory would not have been able to speak on a matter about which he has lobbied for many years, long before he has elected to Dublin Corporation in 1979 or to this House in 1982.  That is why he did not sign the bond.</P>
    <P>The final report of the management of Dublin Corporation is to be before the city council in a matter of days.  That was decided last week when the Deputy set out his position.  He is anxious to be in a position to protest and to fight legitimately for the right at issue, and that is a very complicated issue.  There are differences about the legalities involved <Col N="813" /> but it is because the matter is so complicated that it has been an issue for 35 years.  It has been through the courts and has cost Irish Life, who are a very rich State agency, a bomb in trying to beat some of the people concerned.  Irish Life would have had the best possible legal advice available to them, so we are not talking about a simple issue or merely about people sitting on the streets.  I would not be protesting on behalf of Deputy Gregory if he had not assured me that the allegation that he had kicked a policeman is totally unfounded.  I must accept his word on that so I willingly accept that assurance.</P>
    <P>The position is that a Deputy who protested on an issue about which he has very strong views and which was part of his platform in being elected to this House is being asked to sign a bond to the effect that he will not again become involved in that protest.  I do not believe anyone in this House should be asked to sign such a bond.  I do not understand the legal implications but I understand why Deputy Gregory would not sign such a bond.  I believe he is right in what he is doing.</P>
    <P>On numbers of occasions people who have been serving time in prison for fairly serious crimes have been paroled or released early for various reasons.  Surely the law has made the point in this instance that a Deputy can be put behind bars and that consequently the Deputy concerned can be released to enable him to be here tomorrow to play his part on what is one of the most important days in the parliamentary calendar year.  Therefore, I urge the Minister to release Deputy Gregory this evening and not to continue this matter further.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> I have received a number of requests for either temporary or full release for Deputy Tony Gregory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The facts of this case are very simple. <Col N="814" /> Deputy Gregory is in prison because of his refusal to pay a fine of £150 imposed on him by the District Court and to sign a bond to be of good behaviour and keep the peace for a period of six months.  The Deputy did not choose to appeal against the decision of the District Court and he has indicated that he has deliberately decided not to comply with the order of the District Court in his case.  His imprisonment is an inevitable consequence of those decisions by him.</P>
    <P>The Deputy was, of course, quite entitled to make those decisions; but I cannot see, in those circumstances, why I should be called on to alleviate consequences which must have been quite clear to the Deputy when he took those decisions.</P>
    <P>In particular, no grounds have been put forward which would justify my interfering in any way with the decision of the District Court and, accordingly, there can be no question of any form of early release for the Deputy.</P>
    <P>It is a matter of regret that the Deputy is not free to attend the Dáil but that situation has been brought about entirely by his own actions.  More importantly, it is entirely within his own power to end that situation by complying, even at this late stage, with the order of the District Court.</P>
    <P>On a general point I think the House will accept that it is difficult to expect members of the public to obey and respect the law and the courts if Members of this House do not do so.</P>
    <P>On the point of principle raised by Deputy Skelly, that is, the right to protest, I would have thought that Deputy Gregory or any other Deputy has a unique forum at his disposal to register his protest, namely, this House.  This would be the proper and democratic way of dealing with his problem.</P>

      <P>Fuel oil is the most widely used source of energy in the horticultural industry.  Price movements have rendered it less economic for the more energy-demanding crops such as early tomatoes but it is still favoured for crops which have lower heating energy requirements such as mushrooms, lettuce and main-season tomatoes.  A preliminary survey carried out by Bord Gáis in consultation with the glasshouse industry indicated that the current costs and price of natural gas would not have a significant cost attraction for growers.  The position could be examined again if the gas distribution grid is extended to the main glasshouse area on the east coast.</P>
      <P>At present prices, solid fuel, particularly coal, can give substantial savings in operating costs compared with fuel oil. The major obstacle is the capital cost of converting the existing heating system but last year a special grant scheme for this purpose was introduced and a number of growers have already availed of it.  A project using heat from an ESB generating station to heat glasshouses located nearby has been operating on an experimental basis but the results to date do not indicate significant commercial possibilities from similar units.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Deasy) Austin Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Deasy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The development of Irish agriculture will be greatly influenced by the decisions taken by the European Community on the future of CAP.  The general outlook in the years ahead is one of cautious but not completely restrictive prices based on a Community policy that gives an assurance of reasonable returns to producers and fair prices to consumers for a given level of production but which is less supportive above that level.  Thus, there must be a continuous adaption at producer and processor level towards a more market-orientated operation, with particular regard to the development of new and higher quality products and a reduction in our dependence on intervention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some of the underlying economic factors are, of course, more favourable now than they were at the start of this decade. Our inflation rate is now down to the average Community level and seems likely to remain relatively low.  Interest rates fell during 1985 and it is hoped that the recent rise will be short-lived.  I believe that these factors, together with the substantial national and EC financed supports, will help Irish farmers to adjust <Col N="618" /> to domestic and external realities and that there are sound long term prospects for progressive and development orientated farmers in all areas of our agriculture.</P>
    <P>It should also be noted that producer prices here for cattle are only about 65 per cent of the guide price and those for milk only about 75 per cent of the target price.  This shows that irrespective of price changes at EC level there is very considerable scope for improving farmers' returns for cattle and milk.  This is a matter which rests largely in the hands of the industry itself.</P>

      <P>Farmers' contributions to the disease eradication schemes by way of levies for the years from their introduction in 1979 up to and including 1985 were as follows: 1979, £1.6 million; 1980, £11.1 million; 1981, £1.8 million; 1982, £0.030 million; 1983, £0.016 million; 1984, £5.872 million; 1985, £13.080 million.</P>
      <P>When either TB or brucellosis occurs, the herdowner is also liable to incur some financial loss.

The grants available are, of course, designed to compensate the herdowners concerned as far as possible.  Herdowners also bear the cost of pre-movement testing. The question of costs must be seen in the context of the substantial Exchequer contribution to the schemes since their inception &mdash; some £280 million &mdash; and to the adverse consequences, in the absence of the schemes, for our exports of cattle, beef, milk and milk products, estimated at £1.19 billion in 1985.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. J. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 41, 42, 43, 44, 47 and 48 together.  In their role as supervisory authority of insurance companies, my Department monitored the affairs of the PMPA Insurance Company Limited very closely over the years since they were first authorised.  In addition, several consultancy reports were commissioned by my Department from independent experts on aspects of PMPA's business.</P>
      <P>The published accounts and statutory returns to my Department, as certified by both their directors and auditors, showed that the liabilities of the PMPA did not at any stage exceed the value of their assets and that the company at all times met the statutory solvency requirements for an insurance company.  There was no evidence to the contrary until the result of a specially commissioned consultancy study was received in August 1983 and confirmed by a second expert opinion received in October 1983.  This was followed immediately by the appointment of an administrator to the company.</P>
      <P>A detailed investigation by the administrator into all the records of the company resulted, <i>inter alia,</i> in an adjustment of £146 million to the outstanding claims provision and the disclosure of a net asset deficiency at 31 December 1982 in the statutory returns for the company furnished by the administrator for the year 1983.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The statement issued in October 1975 in relation to the PMPA took account of all the available information, including <Col N="624" /> the accounts and other data submitted by the company and the result of the Department's examinations.  There is no evidence, even now, that the claims provisions in the 1974 accounts, dealt with in the article referred to, were inadequate.</P>
    <P>The statement of 5 July 1982 which was based on the facts then known was issued following a press report which could have seriously damaged confidence in the company and hence put the interests of policyholders and claimants at risk.  This statement dealt solely with the PMPA and did not refer to the PMPS.</P>
    <P>The general problem of unsupervised deposit taking activities by industrial and provident societies came to public attention in 1974.  The Government's concern about the activities of these societies was demonstrated by the enactment of the Industrial and Provident Societies Act, 1978, the main aim of which was to wind down the activities of deposit taking societies. The constitutionality of the 1978 Act was immediately challenged by PMPS and another person.  In 1981, the High Court found in favour of the Minister and the Act.  The Supreme Court confirmed the decision on appeal in May 1983.  The dangers associated with this type of society were spelt out in the course of the court cases as they had been when the legislation was being promoted. The Supreme Court in its judgment drew attention to the High Court finding in 1981 that the reason for the prohibition in the 1978 Act was because the societies were operating a substantial banking business outside the control of the Central Bank without regard to the principle of sound banking practice and because the general public who placed money on deposit with them were at risk.  These statements made in the Oireachtas and the courts would have been of more direct relevance to depositors in the PMPS than any statements referring solely to the PMPA and depositors and would-be depositors should have noted these statements.</P>
    <P>The legislation to deal with unsupervised deposit taking sought to have such activity terminated within five years and to deal with a variety of problem societies <Col N="625" /> engaged in such activity.  For that reason, the 1978 Act gave the Registrar of Friendly Societies various discretionary powers, to be exercised according to the circumstances of each society as the Registrar considered appropriate.</P>
    <P>In the case of the PMPS, apart from ceasing to advertise as a result of pressure by the Registrar, the management of the society sought to continue its activities undiminished throughout the period of its constitutional challenge to the legislation. The existence of this challenge, which was finally decided in May 1983, and the desirability of achieving an orderly winding down of the society's activities over a period were among the factors which the Registrar had to take into account in his dealings with the society.  The Registrar was made aware of the financial difficulties of the PMPA when the Department received the relevant information from the consultancy studies in 1983.</P>
    <P>In so far as responsibility is concerned for the situation which arose in the PMPA and PMPS, it is clear that primary responsibility lies with the directors and officers of the bodies concerned.  Auditors also have an important responsibility in reporting on the financial position of such bodies.  The functions exercised by the State in relation to the supervision of such bodies cannot be expected to substitute for failures on the part of directors, officers or auditors.  It would be inappropriate for me to comment further on this aspect because of pending legal actions by the administrator of the insurance company.</P>
    <P>In so far as a meeting with the PMPS Protection Group is concerned, I do not see that such a meeting would be productive at this stage as matters are now fully in the hands of the liquidator of the society.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism if he will reconsider his decision to increase the casual trading licence fee and reduce it to £100 again since the recent increase endangers the livelihood <Col N="626" /> of many traditional traders whose families have traded in the Cornmarket Street and Coal Quay area of Cork for generations; and whose incomes do not justify such a hefty licence fee.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. J. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>The original fee of £100 was prescribed in section 4 (1) of the Casual Trading Act, 1980.  That fee was increased, by regulation, to £175 with effect from 7 January 1985.  In fact, that increase was less than would have been justified by reference to the intervening level of inflation. Accordingly, I consider that the present fee should stand.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism the action he proposes to take to curb the escalating cost of motor cycle insurance, in view of the fact that many young people use this mode of transport to travel to work; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. J. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>As with other types of insurance cover, increases in premium rates for motor cycle insurance reflect the continuing and substantial level of losses incurred by insurers providing this particular insurance. The Deputy will also realise that the accident rates for motor cycles are much higher than for cars and this has a bearing on the cost of such cover.  These factors are outside my direct and immediate control.  Motor cyclists themselves can of course help by safer driving and reducing the claims giving rise to these costs.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if he will state in respect of each local authority area: (1) the total population of traveller families; (2) the number residing in local authority dwellings; (3) the number residing in special housing; (4) the number residing in caravans <Col N="627" /> on approved sites; and (5) the number residing in caravans in unapproved locations; and the present plans to provide for the needs of each of these families not yet housed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Kavanagh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The statement following provides the information requested and is based on the national count of travelling families carried out on 27 November 1984, the latest date for which comprehensive figures are available.  Primary responsibility for the housing needs of traveller families rests with the local authority in whose area they reside.  My Department's function is concerned with the development of policy, the monitoring of progress and ensuring that local authorities have the necessary financial support to provide the required services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fully subsidisable capital is available <Col N="628" /> for the construction of both housing and residential caravan sites for travellers.  In line with the Government's policy statement of 20 July 1984 in relation to travelling people local authorities have been requested by my Department to ensure that travellers get due priority when local authority dwellings are being allocated and to provide residential caravan sites for travellers who do not wish to live in houses.  A circular letter issued by my Department on 13 September 1984 indicated that it was essential that local authorities should adopt a systematic approach to the housing needs of travellers as part of their ordinary housing operations, asked the authorities to review their letting schemes to ensure that they catered equitably for travellers, and set out a number of specific suggestions designed to ensure that the housing needs of travellers would be dealt with expeditiously and fairly.</P>

      <P>It is a condition of the award of contracts for the carrying out of construction works for public authorities that a contractor must produce a tax clearance certificate or a C2 certificate from the Revenue Commissioners.  In addition to enforcing the tax clearance certification procedures, local authorities have been requested to carry out regular site inspections to ensure that appropriate rates of wages, hours of labour and conditions of employment (including membership of the construction federation pension-sick pay scheme) are being implemented in all building and civil engineering contracts in which they are either directly or indirectly involved.</P>

      <P>The Farm Tax Act, 1985, provides for the supply to local authorities of lists prepared by the farm tax commissioner setting out details of farms classified by him.  The classification is in progress.  On receipt of these lists local authorities are required to assess individual farmers' liability to farm tax and, having publicised the fact that the assessments have been made, to demand payment.  My Department will be in touch with local authorities in the near future, regarding the detailed procedures.</P>

      <P>The estimated total revenue collected by all licensing authorities in 1985 by way of motor tax, driver licence fees, etc., was £117 million.  Information on the amount collected by each authority is not yet available in my Department.  I will forward the information to the Deputy as soon as it is available.</P>
      <P>I have no proposals to reconstitute the road fund.  The amount of State expenditure on roads is determined mainly by reference to road needs and overall Exchequer resources.  In 1985, State expenditure on road works, at £153.5 million, exceeded the revenue which would have been assigned to the road fund if it had still been in existence.</P>

      <P>I would refer the Deputy to my reply to his Question No. 582 of 21 May 1985 which contained details of the local authority service charges collections for 1983 and 1984.  The collection figures up to 30 September 1985 (the latest full return available) are listed in the following tabular statement.  These figures relate to domestic water charges in urban areas, domestic refuse and sewerage charges and, in some cases, library charges, in so far as the figures have been separately supplied in local authority returns.  It is estimated that at 30 September 1985, the amount outstanding expressed as a percentage of the total amount <Col N="640" /> due in respect of the years 1983 to 1985 was 51 per cent.</P>

      <P>Details of the 1985 rate support grant payments and 1986 allocations for county councils are listed in reply to Parliamentary Question No. 108 of 22 January 1986.  The remaining information requested by the Deputy is contained in the following tabular statement.  In regard to the figures for the two years and the percentage change, it must be borne in mind that the figures are not directly comparable; as indicated in the footnote, the 1986 estimated figures have been reduced to allow for the removal with effect from January 1986 from local authorities of liability for payments in respect of supplementary welfare allowances.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 78 and 81 together, referring as they do to complementary clauses of the 1983 Public Service Pay Agreement.  Clause 4.2 (b) allowed for the processing of claims which had arisen under paragraph 3.1 of the amendments to the 1981 Public Service Pay Agreement; clause 4.2 (c) allowed for the payment of retrospection in January 1986 in respect of these claims.</P>
      <P>Paragraph 3.1 of the amendments to the 1981 Public Service Pay Agreement had specified that &ldquo;40 per cent of the relevant increase may be paid from 1 October 1983&rdquo; and paragraph 4A provided that &ldquo;the balance of the increases at 3.1 will subsequently be paid in full from the effective date&rdquo;.  Clauses 4.2 (b) and 4.2 (c) of the 1983 PSPA spelt out in detail how this was to be done.  The following are particulars of the awards covered by clauses 4.2 (b) and (c):</P>

      <P>Arbitration Board Report of 25 July 1968</P>
      <P>This report recommended salary increases ranging from just under 22 per cent to just over 23 per cent for local authority engineers with effect from 1 April 1968.  Eventually increases of just under 11 per cent with effect from the same date were implemented.</P>

      <P>Arbitration Board Report of 28 January 1982</P>
      <P>This report recommended increases for school attendance officers which gave them a salary scale equivalent to that of welfare officer in the Department of Justice with effect from 1 April 1981.  Following a series of discussions between the management and union sides a package was agreed which gave an increase of 24 per cent from the earlier effective date of 1 January 1979.</P>

      <Col N="656" /> 1982 &mdash; Subvention £96 million (Estimates provision), Actual outturn £109.4 million;</P>

    <P>1984&mdash;Subvention £104 million (Estimates provision), Actual outturn £104.9 million;</P>
    <P>1985&mdash;Subvention £104 million (Estimates provision), Actual outturn £104 million.</P>
    <P>Since 1984 the Exchequer has taken on responsibility for interest payments on DART.  This involves payments of £8 million in each year 1984, 1985 and 1986. In addition, since, 1985 the Exchequer is committed to an annual payment of £3 million for ten years for short term borrowing incurred by CIE.</P>
    <P>Since 1984 the subvention has been calculated on the basis of the formula which determines the subvention as either one third of the board's expenditure or one half of its revenue, whichever is the lesser, with the expenditure for 1983 as the base year and taking into account the expenditure limits imposed on the main CIE sectors by the Government. The allocation of the subvention to the various activities of CIE is a matter for the board subject to the EC restrictions on the scope of subventible activities.</P>
    <P>A breakdown of the subvention payment over the full range of CIE activities is included in the board's annual report.  The reports for 1983 and 1984 have been published and that for 1985 will be published in the course of the next few months.</P>
    <P>The subvention formula is being applied in 1986 and the projected subvention is £104.5 million.  A special payment of £1.25 million interest subsidy on advance purchase of buses in 1985 is also reckonable for payment in respect of 1986 will be made before end January 1987.</P>

    <P>The total number of taxpaying units for each year includes an estimated 3,000 units effectively liable to tax under Schedule E, other than through the PAYE system, in respect of employments. As regards the amount of tax paid in each band the only relevant statistics are those compiled for all taxpayers.  The latest available statistics are those showing the yield by range of taxable income in respect of the income tax year 1982-83 and these are contained in Table 87 of the annual report of the Revenue Commissioners for the year ended 31 December 1983, a copy of which is available in the Library.</P>

A cheque in settlement will be issued as soon as possible.  The taxpayer ceased employment on 4 October 1985 and subsequently submitted to the inspector of taxes a claim for repayment of tax on the grounds <Col N="660" /> of unemployment.

      <P>Funds allocated for arterial drainage construction works in the Vote for public works and buildings in 1986 will be spent on the Boyne, Maigue, Corrib-Mask-Robe schemes which are due for completion during the year and on the Boyle, Bonet and Blackwater (Monaghan) schemes, which will continue for some years. Work on the design of a drainage scheme for the Owenmore catchment, of which the Arrow river forms part, has been suspended following a Government decision to halt arterial drainage planning pending the outcome of a review of arterial drainage policy.  The review, which has been completed by the Commissioners of Public Works, will be submitted to Government as quickly as possible.  At this stage, I cannot say when a scheme for the Owenmore catchment might commence.</P>

      <P>I have had inquiries made of the hospital authorities concerned and I understand that the person referred to has had corrective surgery carried out and is on the waiting list for a secondary correction which is of a non-urgent nature.  The criterion used in selecting patients for an operation is medical need and not ability to pay.  The waiting list is assessed regularly by the consultants involved who take into consideration each patient's condition. The person in question will have his operation at the earliest possible date.</P>

      <P>An application for a domiciliary care allowance from the person in question was rejected by the Eastern Health Board on medical grounds on 15 November 1984 and an appeal against the decision was rejected on 1 October 1985. The allowance is payable only in respect of handicapped children who require a degree of care and attention which is substantially in excess of that normally required by a child of the same age.  The applicant's child is not considered to meet these criteria.  Each application is examined individually and the fact that the applicant is already receiving a domiciliary care allowance in respect of two other children has no bearing on her eligibility in respect of her third child.</P>

This exceeded the rate of unemployment assistance payable to him and his claim was, accordingly, disallowed from that date.</P>
      <P>According to the Department's records, the person concerned did not appeal against the amount of the means assessed against him.  If he wishes to appeal, a form for this purpose may be obtained at his local office.  He has not signed at his local office since 10 September 1985.</P>
