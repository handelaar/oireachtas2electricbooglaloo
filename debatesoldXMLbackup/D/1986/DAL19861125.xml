      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister acknowledge that the slight drop in the numbers unemployed is due to emigration?  What action, if any, does the Minister or the <Col N="219" /> Government intend to take on the matter of the 74,000 young people under the age of 25 registered as unemployed and the 47,000 people on various schemes with very few jobs at the end of them?  Will the Minister acknowledge that the situation warrants emergency action?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a very long question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The question relates to statistics and the information is as I have given it to Deputy Lyons.  The 72,423 on the live register at 31 October 1986 represents a decrease of 1,589 on the September figure and that is the second successive month during which there has been a decrease in the youth unemployment total.  I recognise that many young people have left the country.  But the Deputy's comment on that is a separate question and it is a much broader question than can be answered here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the Minister has acknowledge that the drop in the figure could be attributed to emigration, what action, if any, does he or the Government propose to take to improve the situation with regard to young unemployed people?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say that the drop was specifically related to the numbers of young people who have left the country for whatever reason.  The action the Government are taking is evident first from the vast number of such schemes for training and placement in employment which are available &mdash; and I have details of those for the Deputy if he wishes. The question of an attempt to provide employment for all our young people is naturally a question of critical national importance and is one for Cabinet decisions and for everybody in the country to work towards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister acknowledge that these figures indicate clearly that we are in a crisis with regard to employment generally but particularly <Col N="220" /> for young people?  What proposals do the Government have to deal with that crisis?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a separate question of a much broader nature than the Deputy asked here.  The Deputy asked for statistics and numbers and I have given him those to the best of my ability.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Labour if his Department have carried out any investigation into the circumstances in which a Teamwork grant was approved for the Ranelagh Village Council, Dublin, without an application for a grant having been agreed by the members or officer board of the council; the outcome of any such investigations; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>An application from Ranelagh Village Council for assistance under Teamwork was received on 29 April 1985.  The application was signed on behalf of the organisation by the treasurer and a committee member.</P>
      <P>The proposal fulfilled the criteria for grant aid under Teamwork and a grant was approved in October 1985, to enable the employment of five workers and a supervisor for 52 weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="221" /> I understand that, subsequent to this approval, a disagreement arose among constituent members of Ranelagh Village Council regarding the operation of the project.  It would not, however, be appropriate for my Department to involve itself in an internal dispute among members of the council.</P>
    <P>The project is monitored by the National Manpower Service.  The question of the productivity of participants is at present the subject of discussion between the service and the organisers who have been asked to forward a comprehensive report on the project.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister of State aware that while his Department received an application in April 1985, as has been reported to me, the Ranelagh Village Council were not aware of such an application until a meeting in October 1985, at the end of which it was announced by the chairperson that a present had been given by the Department of Labour to the council?  That was on 14 October and it was the first the council had heard about such an application?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The application was received on 29th April and was discussed in detail with the treasurer of the organisation. The application was held at that time pending a decision about additional funding for the Teamwork scheme.  When this became available approval issued on 10 October 1985.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister of State satisfied that it is an appropriate use of the scheme for a Labour Party candidate to run an advice centre under a scheme administered by the Department of Labour and to fund the publication of a local news letter?  Will he investigate that aspect of it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of the details of what the Deputy is referring to but I can tell him that several articles have been written about this project.  It has been visited twice by the National Manpower Service officer and he has <Col N="222" /> asked the organisers to submit a comprehensive list of the details with regard to the project.  I trust that when that is submitted and examined all details will be in accordance with the regulations governing Teamwork.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me ask the Minister of State to refer to my questions. Does he consider it an appropriate use of the scheme for political parties to run their party political advice centres or clinics under that scheme?  If that is acceptable to the Department that is fine, but is it acceptable?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>That seems to be a separate question.  This application was received in the Department and examined initially.  It was held pending further funding of the Teamwork scheme and was approved in the normal way on 10 October 1985.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister of State saying he is quite happy that the regulations are being upheld in this case or is he saying that an investigation is going on to see if the regulations are being adhered to?  Which answer is he giving?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>It is fair to say that the NMS officer has visited this project on two occasions and a certain degree of dissatisfaction has been expressed regarding the productivity of the participants in the scheme.  It is to do with that aspect of the query that the comprehensive report is requested in the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>That clarifies what Deputy De Rossa was trying to get, that a major comprehensive investigation is going on into the working of the Teamwork scheme in this area.  When that report is available to the Minister &mdash; it might be available already&mdash;can we get it?  As Opposition spokesman on Labour <Col N="223" /> I would like to see that comprehensive report.  The truth is that that manpower officer might be investigating other Teamwork schemes in the same area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I must ask the Minister again if he will indicate to me whether he considers it appropriate for these schemes to be used for the purpose of setting up political advice centres.  I am asking a simple question.  Is that the case?  Is the publication of, let us say, quasi-local newsletters part of the purpose of the scheme?  If not, could he indicate if investigations regarding the misuse of the scheme are in progress in relation to that kind of use or abuse?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Labour if he will undertake a full assessment of the special requirements of Scoil Bhríde, Shantalla, Galway, in view of the fact that the school has two classes for deaf children, one class for traveller children and several classes for slow learners and in view of the fact that the school has a majority of its pupils from a disadvantaged background; and if, as a result of this assessment, he finds the necessity for the appointment of care-taker and secretary, he will make special arrangements for such appointments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Two caretakers and a secretary have been employed under two social employment scheme projects in Scoil Bhríde, Shantalla, Galway.  The projects finished in June and July 1986, and subsequently the sponsors made an application for the renewal of these projects. The application was considered by <Col N="224" /> the SES Monitoring Committee at their meeting on 30 October 1986 and the continuation of the projects, for a further year, has now been agreed.  The National Manpower Service in Galway will be able to advise Scoil Bhríde when recruitment for the positions in question may commence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>There have been difficulties regarding statutory redundancy and minimum notice claims made by the employees of Cork Marts-IMP plant at Leixlip and my Department have been pursuing these claims.  I now understand that, following negotiations between union and management, a settlement formula has emerged and that pickets have been withdrawn from the plant.  In the light of this new development, which I welcome, I hope that any outstanding difficulties in regard to the statutory entitlements of the former employees can now be resolved quickly.  My Department will be available to give any possible assistance in that regard.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that certain former employees who attended the Employment Appeals Tribunal in September of this year received a decision on 5 November that they were entitled to six weeks' notice which in money terms would amount to £1,421? Is he aware that both the IMP and the Department of Labour have informed some of these people that they will not be paid?

      <P>With regard to the question of the employees' entitlements the tribunal made awards ranging from £1,584 to £2,946 in favour of nine former employees of Irish Meat Producers Limited. As these awards have not been paid the Chief State Solicitor was asked on 11 November 1986 to consider the possibility of instituting proceedings.</P>

What steps is he taking to ensure that this miserable amount of £1,400 or £1,500 for their ten. 20 or 30 years' service is to be paid?  Can he assure us that it will be paid&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister informed the employees of this?  A constituent of mine has just contacted me to say that as late as 20 November he was in touch with Mr. McElroy of the employers who said he was not paying out any money and instructed the person concerned to contact the conditions of employment section of the Department of Labour.  Is the Minister of State aware that when the conditions of employment section were contacted on 20 November they said the money was not being paid out because Irish Meat Producers Limited were not in liquidation?  Is the fact <Col N="226" /> that Irish Meat Producers Limited were not in liquidation providing or constituting some type of legal barrier to the Department in forcing them to pay out this money?

If the employees have not been informed of the present position I will arrange through the Department that they be brought up to date.

      <P>Teamwork is the only temporary youth employment scheme under the aegis of my Department.  The scheme provides temporary employment for young persons on local community projects for up to a maximum of 52 weeks.

      <P>Teamwork is the only temporary employment programme.  The social employment scheme caters for those over 25.  The work experience scheme, although the placement rate runs at 66 per cent, is not regarded as an employment programme as such.  Under the National Manpower Service, the number of participants up to 30 September last in the employment incentive scheme was 5,250 with an expenditure of £3.78 million.  The enterprise allowance scheme catered for 1,105 participants in the youth element of it with an expenditure of £1.535 million up to 30 September last.  Under the Youth Employment Agency the community enterprise programme has had 264 participants involving an expenditure of £1.255 million up to 30 September last. Under the scientist and technologist employment programme, expenditure to date has been £123,000.  Under the scheme for the marketplace there have been 57 participants involving an expenditure of £182,000.  Under the national co-op farm relief services, there were 22 participants involving an expenditure of £122,000.  Under the European orientation programme there were 29 participants involving an expenditure of £77,000.  Under the financial graduates employment programme there were six participants with an expenditure of £12,000.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Labour if any surveys are being carried out on the present employment status of young people who have participated in work experience programmes or AnCO training programmes in recent years; and if he will give details of results of each surveys.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Two sample surveys on the work experience programme were carried out by the Youth Employment Agency in June-July 1985 and in January 1986.  In each case the young people surveyed had left the programme at least six months prior to the time of the survey.</P>
      <P>In the first survey, 996 participants were contacted and there was an 82 per cent response rate.  This survey showed that 43 per cent of participants have been retained by their sponsors and 33 per cent were employed elsewhere.</P>
      <P>In the second survey 440 participants were contacted.  There was a 71 per cent response.  At the time of this survey 37 per cent had been retained by their sponsors and 29 per cent were employed elsewhere.</P>
      <P>The National Manpower Service also produce an annual statistical analysis of the programme.  The 1985 analysis shows that of the 8,930 young people who completed programmes 48 per cent were retained by sponsors and 17 per cent were employed elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>AnCo records the employment status of trainees immediately after the completion of training.  In 1985, 14,727 young people under 25 participated in mainline skills and enterprise training courses, <Col N="231" /> excluding apprenticeships.  Of these 75 per cent were placed in employment on completion of their courses.</P>
    <P>With regard to apprentices, 2,412 completed their training in the same year and 77 per cent of these were placed in employment.</P>
    <P>During the same year 2,554 young people participated in community response programmes with a placement rate of 47 per cent.  Just over 61 per cent of the 1,058 participants on the skills foundation programme were placed on completion of the programme.  Four thousand, nine hundred and sixty four young people participated in the community youth training programme and 2,624 in the community training workshops. Placement rates on completion of these programmes were 29 per cent and 32 per cent respectively.  Approximately 800 young people were involved in a range of other special programmes with a placement rate of about 30 per cent.</P>
    <P>I should point out, however, that one of the objectives of these community type courses is to equip trainees to participate in mainline courses.  Placement rates are not therefore the main criteria of success.</P>
    <P>AnCO also carries out limited sample surveys four months after the completion of training.  As soon as the surveys at present being conducted have been finalised, I shall let the Deputy have the results.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The person in question has applied to my Department under the Protection of Employees (Employers' Insolvency) Act, 1984, for payment of an <Col N="233" /> award of £278.92 under the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act, 1973, also for payment of arrears of wages amounting to £4,630.45 and arrears of holiday pay amounting to £278.92.</P>
      <P>The problem is that the company concerned appears to have ceased trading but has not been formally put into liquidation or receivership.  Consequently, the employer cannot be regarded as insolvent under section 1 of the 1984 Act.</P>
      <P>However, there is provision in the Act whereby the Minister may, be regulations, provide that employers may in certain circumstances be deemed to be insolvent for the purpose of the Act so that payments may be made to the employees of such employers.  The making of such regulations has been under active consideration but this has given rise to substantial legal and administrative problems.  I hope that these can soon be resolved but in advance of the making of regulations it would not be possible for me to say that they would apply in the circumstances of the case referred to in the question.  The case has, however, been noted in the Department and it will be considered as quickly as possible when the proposed regulations are made.</P>

      <P>This individual is very temperate and I am sure the Minister will agree that it is unconscionable and socially unjust that he should be left without much needed money since February 1984.  Surely the Minister can tell the House how soon the resolution of this problem will come about and when the regulations will be introduced?  Will they be introduced before or after Christmas or are we talking about Christmas 1987 or 1988?  When can this individual expect his entitlement which is all he is looking for?  Can the Minister put the company concerned into liquidation as a matter of urgency to give him &mdash; and others in the same position &mdash; justice?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like the regulations <Col N="234" /> to be drafted at a very early date which would allow payment to be made to the individual concerned.  However, the whole area of insolvency is very complicated and particular difficulties have arisen in formulating regulations to cover the whole range of matters which might arise.  There could be major legal implications in designating individual employers as insolvent, even for the limited purposes of the 1984 Act.  These complications are being examined and I hope the regulations will be drafted at an early date but I cannot give a specific assurance on that point.</P>

      <P>The Act allows for the Minister to make payment by declaring particular companies to be insolvent.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The first projects under the social employment scheme commenced operation in April 1985.  Up to December 1985 £7.253 million was paid to project sponsors in respect of work undertaken under the scheme.</P>
      <P>The latest details of expenditure for SES cover the period 1 January 1986 to 30 October 1986.  During this period £30.688 million has been paid to project sponsors in respect of SES operations.  The entire budget of £42.73 million for the scheme in 1986 has been allocated.</P>
      <P>This figure relates only to the Department of Labour Estimates.  It does not take account of the consequential reduction in social welfare payments. This saving is estimated at approximately 30 per cent of gross expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. J. Leonard Mr. J. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that Monaghan County Council were notified of a £3.3 million allocation?  To date they have taken up £1.1 million, one-third of the total.  That is partly due to the restrictions which were put on the National Manpower Service in allowing further recruitment.  There was a ceiling put on recruitment.  Will this scheme be continued and will the council have an opportunity to have a full take-up?  It is not their problem that they were restricted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>When this scheme was announced, 35 per cent of the allocation was for supervision and materials and 65 per cent for labour.  To ensure the take-up of the scheme for the figure which was mentioned, £3.3 million, instead of 10,000 employees 30,000 employees would be required.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The savings in terms of social welfare payments is estimated at approximately 30 per cent of gross expenditure. This year there was a total allocation of £42.733 million under the Department of Labour Estimate for the scheme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that it is not costing very much more to have people on the social employment scheme, why is there an embargo on taking on further people?  I do not know how many people are interested in going on the scheme but if there is very little cost, surely there is a case for upping the figure which was laid down?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is aware that 10,000 was the target figure for which budgetary allocations were allowed by <Col N="239" /> the Cabinet.  I am sure the question of either an expansion of the scheme or some other alternative is being examined by them in that context.  The allocation for all of this year, £42 million, has been allocated under the scheme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The situation regarding the social employment scheme is that the ambitious target of 10,000 participants contained in the Government's plan <i>Building on Reality</i> was surpassed in June 1986.  In order to remain within the 1986 budget it is necessary to restrict the numbers of new participants entering the scheme.  Accordingly, recruitment may only occur where sufficient persons have terminated their period of employment under the SES.  I am confident that projects approved under the social employment <Col N="240" /> scheme in County Donegal will be cleared to commence over the coming months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. J. Leonard Mr. J. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that there are many people who have not had the opportunity to participate in the scheme, even though they are on the National Manpower Service list as being eligible?  Would it not be a good idea to have an advance policy for the coming years so that people will know in January, February or March whether they will have an opportunity of participating in the scheme?  They have been waiting all year to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>That would depend upon the amount of budgetary allocation made to the scheme and the ceiling to be set in terms of participants by the Cabinet.  I am sure that once those figures emerge the various regional offices will be notified of these allocations and they can then plan accordingly.</P>

      <P>Is there widespread concern in the Minister's Department about the preliminary review which has been carried out?  The youth employment levy as it was sold to the trade unions a number of years ago has been a massive failure. The money generated to create jobs has been used for training and retraining and short-term employment programmes. The fact is little or no employment has been gained from the youth employment levy.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister confirm that in the new legislation on manpower the youth element has been dropped?  It is now going to be called the employment levy so that the money can be spent on the over 25s.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason for the change is that the bulge in the population of young people is moving upwards beyond the 25 year age limit.  It will allow greater flexibility for the new manpower authority to allocate funds for young people who do not stand still either in terms of age.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to reduce the qualifying period of 13 weeks in receipt of unemployment assistance or benefit under the enterprise allowance scheme.</P>
      <P>The enterprise allowance scheme is aimed primarily at persons who have a proven record of unemployment and who are dependent on unemployment payments. To meet this objective and also to ensure that the operation of the scheme is cost-effective it is essential that an adequate minimum qualifying period of unemployment payments is laid down in the entry conditions.  I consider 13 weeks to be a reasonable period.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that a proportion of those who lose their jobs are always able to place themselves quickly in employment because of their particular skills.  It would lead to dead-weight effects in the scheme if it were to cater for people immediately they become unemployed.

These who are unfortunately out of work for that period are eligible under the terms of the scheme.</P>

      <P>I would refer the Deputy to my reply to a similar question asked by him on 4 February, 1986 &mdash; Volume 363, No. 7 of the Dáil Official Report &mdash; when I explained the arrangements to help such apprentices and indicated my satisfaction with them in the context of AnCO's limited resources.</P>
      <P>As I explained there is a statutory obligation for an employer to notify AnCO one month in advance of a decision to terminate the employment of an apprentice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>AnCO then make every effort to enable the apprentice to continue the apprenticeship, by taking one or more of <Col N="245" /> the following measures, subject to the on-going availability of finance:</P>
    <P> (i)  Endeavour through AnCO Training Advisory Service, NMS, IDA, YEA to have the apprentice re-employed in a company to complete his-her apprenticeship.</P>
    <P>(ii)  Accommodate the apprentice on a block release course of eight to 11 weeks duration where this is practical and possible.</P>
    <P>(iii)  Accommodate the apprentice on a CYTP or a training centre updating of skills course depending on the apprentice trade category.</P>
    <P>(iv)  Accommodate the apprentice on an AnCO approved external course, i.e. ESB, CIE, and Lapple. </P>
    <P>The apprentice is then credited with the time spent on any of the above courses.  It should be pointed out that in respect of (ii), (iii) and (iv) the apprentice has to be out of employment for three months before going on one of these courses.</P>
    <P>All unemployed and redundant apprentices who are notified to AnCO are issued with a brochure giving advice and details of procedures for unemployed apprentices.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>How successful are these schemes?  In effect they do not operate.  There is a substantial number of apprentices who have served perhaps one year with AnCO and another year elsewhere before being let go, without having any opportunity to complete the third and fourth years of their apprenticeship. Some statistics have been circulated by the craft unions.  The matter continues to be a source of great annoyance to parents because these young people are unable to serve their trade.  Can anything be done?  The schemes which exist were drawn up when times were good economically and they do not work now.</P>

      <P>I agree that there has been a change in attitude towards apprentices and the method of training.  AnCO at present support about 806 redundant or unemployed apprentices on a variety of specifically designed programmes.  In <Col N="246" /> 1985 AnCO supported 3,191 apprentices, while in 1984 the figure was 3,450.  They supported approximately 2,500 in 1985.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Labour if he is satisfied with the operation of the Safety in Industry Act, 1980; if he is satisfied that there is sufficient staffing in the inspectorate to ensure enforcement of the Act; if he will consider amending the Act so that employers would be obliged to act upon recommendations of safety committees rather than just consider them as at present; if he will comment on the view of many safety committees that this Act is just a toothless watchdog; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The Safety in Industry Act, 1980, together with the Factories Act, 1955, which it amends substantially, and the regulations made under both Acts, provide a framework for the protection of persons employed in the industrial sector.  However, there are a number of deficiencies in our occupational safety and health system which were identified by the Barrington Commission of Inquiry on Safety, Health and Welfare at Work. These include the relatively limited scope of the present law, the lack of a comprehensive overall preventive approach to safety and health and an excessive reliance on specific provisions relating to specific hazards or risks.  Accordingly, I am having a Bill prepared for early introduction in the Oireachtas giving effect to the main recommendations of the Barrington commission which will apply to all employers, all employees and the selfemployed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are increased demands on my Department's industrial inspectorate due to the enforcement of domestic safety legislation and the development, <Col N="247" /> implementation and enforcement of relevant EC Council Directives.  I have provided for some extra posts, for which recruitment is proceeding and the inspectorate is reorganising its workload to give more attention to priority areas such as occupational hygiene, noise, radiation hazards, mining, ergonomics, electrical equipment, fire prevention, major hazard risks and the conveyance of dangerous substances.</P>
    <P>The present safety committee system has, I believe, helped to develop a greater awareness in workers of the hazards and possible risks to which they may be exposed at work.  My proposals for new legislation will include new mechanisms for the involvement of employees along lines advocated by the Barrington commission. These will give the Oireachtas an opportunity to debate and decide on such provisions as would appear most effective in the future.</P>

      <P>In regard to the question of the tendency to award compensation rather than re-instatement, I am sure the Deputy will agree that there are many instances where re-instatement would not be in the best interests of either party when it follows, as many of these cases do, a period of difficult relationship.  The issues raised by the Deputy in the latter part of his question have been examined in the course of a review of the operation of the Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977, which was recently completed by my Department. I hope to obtain Government approval shortly for an amending Bill.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Labour if he is aware that his decision to terminate the Social Employment Scheme is having a very serious effect on the operations of the Centre for the Unemployed at Bonnybrook, Coolock, Dublin 5; if he is prepared to give a commitment to this centre that it will have its full complement of staff in accordance with the commitment given to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions in this regard; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>No decision to terminate the social employment scheme has been taken.  The situation is that the ambitious target of 10,000 participants set for this scheme in the Government's plan <i>Building on Reality</i> was surpassed in June 1986. In order to remain within the 1986 budget, it is necessary to restrict the numbers of new participants entering the scheme at any time.  Accordingly, recruitment may only occur where sufficient persons have terminated their period of employment under the SES.</P>
      <P>Bonnybrook unemployment action, who are running a centre for the unemployed, originally made application for a grant to employ 12 workers and a supervisor. Because of the recruitment restrictions which I have mentioned, it has not been possible to employ a full complement of staff for the group at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because of the nature of the work <Col N="250" /> involved, the National Manpower Service in Dublin consider the commencement of this project to be a priority and, accordingly, recruited persons to enable the project to commence in September 1985.  Since then, a further four persons and a supervisor have been added to the SES staff complement at the unemployment centre as vacancies arose within the recruitment quota for the region.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Dáil that the participation levels of the project will be kept under constant review by the National Manpower Service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The question is whether the Minister will give a commitment that the full complement will be employed in 1987.  These schemes usually start off with three or four people, even though their complement is 12.  Surely they are entitled to build up to their complement. It seems very unreasonable to send out a letter three months later saying that they cannot now have the complement because it was not taken up immediately. That has happened in this case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I mention again these other schemes where a letter of approval was issued but a subsequent letter stated that as they did not take up their full complement it could not be approved. Which letter stands?  Surely it is the letter which allows a supervisor and a certain number of workers.  It is unreasonable to say that for 1987 they cannot go back to their original letter.  It affects all the employment schemes they had planned before they submitted their case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The complement of workers and staff under any of the schemes would be determined by the overall quota of places for each region. In this case, it would be regarded as a <Col N="251" /> priority.  Hopefully a full complement can be provided.  With regard to the Deputy's comments on the letter, I assume that under the regulations if an organisation or a centre were allocated a specific staff complement, that letter should stand depending on the other factors of budgetary allocation and overall placement figures for that region.</P>

      <P>My question was obviously in before the Bill was circulated today.  I want to ask one very important question.  It appears that Fianna Fáil's request that CERT would remain outside the manpower agency is being denied, because from reading the Bill it appears that CERT as such is being abolished and will be part of the manpower authority. CERT is a commercial training agency and is a fundamental part of our tourist industry, it has been very successful especially in job placements.  It seems totally inappropriate to the Fianna Fáil Party that it should be brought in to the area of training, retraining, co-operative <Col N="252" /> and short term work schemes.  CERT does not come under the manpower Bill. Will the Minister confirm that my reading is correct?</P>

      <P>Earlier this year I published proposals for the reform of trade dispute and industrial relations legislation. The main elements of these proposals were first, the replacement of the present immunities based system of trade dispute law by a system that would give workers a positive right to strike; secondly, that trade unions would be required to have a provision in their rule books to provide for a secret ballot before strike or other industrial action was taken; thirdly, that there be reform of the existing industrial relations institutions, including the establishment of a labour relations commission; fourthly, that there be and, a change in the arrangements governing the granting of injunctions; fifthly, that there be additional measures to facilitate trade union amalgamations. I met representatives of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions earlier this month and discussions on the details of the proposals are being held with the ICTU on Thursday.  It is my intention also to have further discussions with the FUE in the near future.</P>

      <P>The <i>M. V. Kowloon Bridge</i> put into Bantry Bay on Tuesday 18 November having sustained damage from heavy seas on a voyage from Canada to the United Kingdom.  A marine surveyor from my Department travelled immediately to Bantry, boarded and inspected the vessel on the following day.  On Thursday the vessel was also inspected by representatives of Lloyds Register of Shipping, London, and by a surveyor of the United Kingdom Department of Transport acting on behalf of the authorities of Hong Kong where the ship is registered.</P>
      <P>Following inspection the Department's surveyor, on Friday, agreed certain temporary repairs with the Lloyds representatives as necessary to make the ship seaworthy.  He then instructed the master that the vessel must not put to sea until all the deficiencies had been rectified. The ship remained at Bantry Bay until Saturday 22 November, I understand that, on that day, while within Bantry Bay, the master reported that the ship had lost her anchor.  It appears that, in this situation, the master decided, for safety reasons, to steam out of the bay under the vessel's own power.  I understand this was done with the approval of Lloyds Register whose representative informed my Department surveyor accordingly on Saturday night.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On my instructions a preliminary inquiry has been instituted into the circumstances surrounding the casualty.

      <P>The power I have in relation to ordering the detention of ships is quite different in the case of what is called <i>force majeure</i>, in other words ships that are forced by virtue of the weather alone into a port of a country.  The powers in relation to such ships are very limited compared with ships that are destined for a port of the State.  That was the circumstance in this case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising from the Minister's reply, has he or his Department authority to forbid the ship leaving the port until such time as repairs are carried out?  If so, how is that authority carried out?  Am I right in assuming that in this case it was not put into effect?  What action follows from that?  Is legal action of any form against the master of the ship or otherwise a possibility?  What kind of implication is there to the Minister saying that the ship could be so forbidden?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be helpful if <Col N="263" /> I explained to the House that the surveying of ships is a very frequent occurrence. Where faults are found on the ship which would deem it risky to take it to sea, the surveyors require that those repairs are done before it takes to sea.  In almost every single case in the history of my Department that request was followed. Detention orders are very rare indeed.  However, the circumstances in this case are even rarer because this was not a case of a ship coming to a port of the State.  It was a case of <i>force majeure</i> where a ship was forced into the territory of the State by the fact of the weather. This is covered by section 6 of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1906.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister elaborate a little on the detention order which he referred to which he possibly could have issued in this case?  Was that a possibility and, if so, was consideration given to it?  If consideration was given to it, why was it decided not to do so in this case?  The order would forbid the ship from going on the high seas regardless of the reasons, the rationale or the arbitrary decision of the captain of the ship to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I will repeat what I said.  The surveyor of my Department acted with great promptitude.  By 9.30 a.m. on Wednesday morning he had informed Lloyds Register in London and also the UK Department of Transport who were acting on behalf of the Hong Kong authorities.  Their representatives arrived in Bantry on Wednesday afternoon. The surveyor was in Bantry principally to deal with the <i>Capo Emma</i>, a ship which is still there and which was of much greater risk to the coastline than the ship in question because it was laden with oil.  The surveyor was mainly preoccupied with the danger of the <i>Capo Emma</i> but nonetheless he acted with great promptitude in this case.  He visited the ship on Wednesday and told the captain that it should not take to sea until there had been an inspection.  An inspection took place and a further inspection <Col N="264" /> took place on Thursday in conjunction with the representatives of the UK Department of Transport and Lloyds Register.  On Friday it was agreed that certain repairs should be done before the ship went to sea.  Unfortunately, on Saturday, in what I understand was extremely inclement weather, this ship broke anchor.  The master of the ship made a judgement that it was safer to take the ship to sea.  He made this decision in conjunction and with the approval of the representative of Lloyds Register.  Their representative so informed the surveyor of my Department.</P>
      <P>As I said in reply to previous questions, the issuing of detention orders are extremely rare.  In the memory of the chief surveyor of my Department who has served there 30 years, only two such detention orders have ever been issued. Ships do not take to sea without undertaking repairs that are requested of them. In this case the repairs were requested of them.  It seems the master of the ship made reasonable endeavours to have those repairs undertaken until he lost anchor.</P>

      <P>In view of what the Minister has said so far in relation to this question, can he indicate that he or his Department were not aware that the ship was moving out of Bantry Bay?  Lloyds were told that his Ministry was not informed.  If that is the case, and I suspect it is, was the master of the ship acting in breach of Irish law in taking a ship which was unsafe out to sea, particularly in view of the fact that it was acknowledged that accurate weather forecsts were available which indicated that it would be far more dangerous at sea than in Bantry Bay?</P>

      <P>It would be wrong to say that there had been no discussions with my Department.  The captain adverted to his problems during Saturday and the surveyor in my Department told him that as far as he was concerned the order to have the repairs carried out still stood.  The captain intimated that he might have to take to sea as the lesser of two evils.  The surveyor in my Department <Col N="265" /> indicated that while the captain would have to make this decision himself he reiterated the ruling of the Department and suggested that the captain should not make the decision to go to sea unless it was a last resort.  He again reiterated the view of the Department that repairs should be done before going to sea.</P>

      <P>Can I ask the Minister whether the provisions of the Brussels Convention of 1969, the international convention relating to oil pollution on the high seas, were scrutinised to see what powers the State possessed to take remedial action?  Can the Minister say, when the ship was unmanned, rudderless and abandoned almost 20 miles from our coast, whether the precedent offered by British action in relation to the <i>Torrey Canyon</i> in 1969 was studied?  The Minister will recall that the British authorities destroyed that vessel in 1969 pleading necessity.  When this ship was 20 miles off our shore, was the destruction of the vessel and its sinking considered?  Its sinking would have afforded no damage to the local environment at that stage.</P>

Will he also agree that his surveyor, who only had experience of two detention orders in 30 years, now agrees that the shipping scene has changed considerably, with larger ships, smaller crews and without the laws and regulations that obtain for Irish sailors and Irish ships? Will he state furthermore what he is doing now to protect the economic and the amenity interests in that area?</P>

I am quite sure that everybody in these circumstances were being as helpful as they could be.  I do not think there is any sense in us rushing to judgment on that or any other aspect of this case.  When incidents like this arise of course we will consider whether the existing law is adequate or not to cover these circumstances or whether a change in the law is called for.  I will give this matter my attention as soon as the immediate crisis is over.</P>

    <P>In relation to the economic consequences of this action my Department, in the course of Sunday morning, telegraphed the owners indicating that all costs, economic, tourist, ecological, <Col N="267" /> environmental and administrative, that would arise as a result of this casualty would fall on them.

The ship under discussion was seen by the Minister's officials to be damaged and they stated that it should not go out to sea.  What is the Minister, and the Government, doing in that area for the protection of our interests?  I am not referring to the sending of telegrams. What do the Government intend to do with regard to the structural deficiencies of this type of ship built by a specific firm in the north east of England particularly when one of these ships sank with two Irish citizens on board in the South China Sea?  No satisfaction has been given by the British Government with regard to that ship up to now.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Boland) Minister for the Environment (Mr. Boland)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the arrival of the <i>Kowloon Bridge</i> in Bantry Bay on Tuesday, 18 November, Cork County Council have continuously monitored developments and initiated contingency arrangements to deal with any oil leakage from the vessel or from the <i>Capo Emma</i> which is still in the bay.</P>
      <P>My Department have also been concerned about an possible leakage and has liaised closely with the council's pollution office during the course of the incident, in addition to conducting aerial surveillance of the area.  A senior inspector from my Department, who is also the director of the national response team for major oil pollution incidents &mdash; the operations group &mdash; visited the area on Wednesday last and has been present there on a fulltime basis since Friday.  Given the double threat of oil pollution, the operations group, which includes experts from the Departments of Communications, Tourism, Fisheries and Forestry, Defence, the Naval Service, and local and harbour authorities, was placed on alert by my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of the seriously increased threat of oil pollution following the abandonment of the <i>Kowloon Bridge</i> by its <Col N="269" /> crew, the intervention of the operations group was formally requested by the Cork County Manager on Sunday last. The group has established an operations centre in Skibbereen and is working with local officials in the determination and implementation of pollution control measures.  Expertise available from the EC Commission has been drawn on for this purpose.  A contingency plan has been prepared to protect areas of high priority to the east and west of the grounding point of the <i>Kowloon Bridge</i> at the Stags Rocks.  Priority areas include Lough Hyne and other agriculture areas to the east.  The views of fisheries experts have been taken into account in determining the priority areas to be protected. Boom will be used to deflect oil from some of these areas.</P>
    <P>The operations group has decided not to use dispersants as these would be ineffective on the heavy fuel oil aboard the vessel.  Local authority personnel are on standby to deal with any oil that may come ashore.</P>
    <P>I am informed that the oil leakage which commenced yesterday morning is from two tanks which are estimated to contain a total of 500 tonnes of heavy fuel oil.  I understand that sea conditions in the area have assisted in the dissipation of the oil.  However, a small amount of oil has now come ashore at Owenahincha and Cork County Council personnel are being deployed to collect this.</P>
    <P>Some concern has also been expressed about the possible environmental and ecological implications in the event of the cargo of iron are being released to the sea.  Analytical data on the chemical composition of the iron ore has been obtained and examined by the Departments concerned and advice has also been obtained under the EC information system for sea pollution incidents involving oil or other possible harmful substances.  I am advised that the ore does not pose a threat of any significance to the environment or to marine life.</P>
    <P>The condition of the ship is being closely monitored by the operations group and I am keeping in close touch with the situation.  I can assure the House <Col N="270" /> that, in so far as it lies within my area of responsibility, all possible steps will be taken and all necessary resources will be deployed to protect marine life and the environment from any damage arising from the grounding of the <i>Kowloon Bridge.</i></P>

      <P>I should like to thank the Minister for his detailed reply. Will he indicate if any steps are being taken, or if any is possible, to prevent the further break up of the ship?  Have the Department any say in regard to that or have they taken any steps to try to prevent it?  Will the Minister indicate if he has any method of recouping any costs that may arise in the clean-up of the pollution?  Is he aware if the insurers or the owners will be liable for the cost of that clean-up?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the Deputy's several questions I should like to state that the possibility of any salvage operations being attempted is, I gather, being explored by the relevant authorities.  I visited the scene of the accident this morning and I noted that a tug at the scene had a line aboard the ship.  Whether it will be possible to move the ship from the site is something about which I would not care to speculate at this time.  On the question of an estimate of the cost of containing damage through pollution I should like to say that I do not consider that to be important now.  The important thing is to ensure that all possible steps are taken to minimise any effect of pollution. The cost can be obtained afterwards and should not become a factor in ensuring that every possible step is taken to minimise the threat or danger of pollution or the steps taken to deal with pollution as it occurs.  In so far as any possible liability is concerned in regard to the insurers or the owners I should like to point out that that is a matter that will have to be established subsequently.  I would not like to say anything which might prejudice that.</P>

      <P>Officers from my Department, and from the operations group, have been on the site since last Wednesday and all possible steps are being taken. Some of the areas which are of the greatest concern to marine life have already been boomed.  The Deputy, and the House, may take it that no expense will be spared, whether by Cork County Council or by the State, in ensuring that all possible measures to minimise the risk of pollution or the effect of any pollution that may occur are put into place.  I should mention that the local authority concerned, because of other factors, are probably the best fitted local authority with the greatest experience and expertise to deal with matters of marine pollution.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>I am proud to be a member of that local authority.  I am the only member of that authority in the House and I acknowledge the Minister's appreciation of what Cork County Council have to do and have done on other occasions.  In view of the fact that a harbour board for Bantry was set up during the term of office of the Government but has not yet a secretary, an office or a typewriter, will the Government acknowledge that the authority for Bantry Harbour should be Cork County Council? I ask the Minister to ensure that this authority, to which the Minister has so graciously paid tribute, should now be made the authority for Bantry Harbour. This is relevant.</P>

      <P>The Minister indicated that his main concern is to prevent pollution.  That is the concern of all of us in this instance.  In what way are his Department involved with the prevention of that pollution, apart from dealing with it if it occurs?  In what way are the Department trying to prevent that pollution?  Are they involved with the salvage tug that is alongside?  Are steps being taken to try to drain the fuel oil from the ship or is there some other way in which this pollution can be prevented?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the situation as it obtains, obviously the best possible way if weather conditions abated would be to have the ship reboarded and her bunker oil pumped out or removed to another vessel.  That is a matter for evaluation by the experts.  I visited the site this morning and there is a ship of the Naval Service, together with helicopters from the Air Corps and a tug with a line on board standing by the ship.  There must be an evaluation made of the effects of attempting to move the ship from the precarious position in which she is now, but it would be presumptuous of me or any other Deputy in the House to decide what ought to be done when there are experts on the site.  In addition, the House should be alive to the fact that the Government have a dual concern in this regard.  A further ship containing 80,000 tonnes of crude oil is at present at anchor in Bantry Bay, and every care must be taken to ensure that that situation is attended to with the removal of any threat of pollution in that case also.</P>

      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the terms of the Treaty on Extradition between Ireland and the United States of America signed in Washington on 13th July, 1983.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Negotiation of an extradition treaty between Ireland and the United States began in the mid-seventies with a view to widening the extent of our extradition arrangements which, in effect, had until then been confined to Europe.  It was the <Col N="360" /> first bilateral extradition treaty negotiated by the State.</P>
    <P>Following agreement on a text acceptable to both parties, the treaty was concluded by the exchange of instruments of ratification on 15 November 1984 following a Government decision authorising ratification on 17 April 1984.  On 20 November 1984 the Government made an order under section 8 of the Extradition Act, 1965, applying Part 2 of the Extradition Act to the United States of America from 15 December 1984. Copies of the order, incorporating the terms of the treaty, were laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas on 20 November 1984.  The treaty was again laid before the Dáil on 24 October 1986.</P>
    <P>Following the entry into force of the treaty, five persons wanted for prosecution for a variety of serious offences in the United States were then the subject of requests for extradition by the United States.  In accordance with the procedures laid down in the treaty and in our Extradition Act, 1965, two of these persons were subsequently extradited, depsite challanges in the courts on various grounds.</P>
    <P>The challenge by James Gilliland whose extradition was sought by the United States authorities succeeded on the ground that the treaty involved a charge on public funds and since its terms had not been approved by the Dáil, as required by Article 29.5.2 of the Constitution, the treaty was not validly in force in Ireland.  Article 17 of the treaty deals with expenses and the Supreme Court decided that the expenses in question &mdash; that is those arising out of translation of documents, court proceedings and transportation of persons &mdash; constituted a charge within the meaning of Article 29 of the Constitution.  The terms of the treaty, therefore, require Dáil approval before the State can be bound and be in a positon to implement them. In accordance with that Supreme Court decision, I am now asking the Dáil to approve the terms of the treaty.</P>
    <P>The lack of an effective extradition arrangement with the United States was a very obvious gap in relation to our <Col N="361" /> extradition commitments which were limited to those European countries which are parties to the European Convention on Extradition.  The object of this treaty is to ensure more effective cooperation between our two countries in combating crime and in bringing to justice suspected criminals who seek to avoid prosecution by leaving the jurisdiction where the crime has been committed.</P>
    <P>In negotiating the terms of the treaty, care was taken to ensure that its terms complied with the requirements of the Extradition Act, 1965.  The terms of the treaty are before the House.  In accordance with Article 2 the offences for which extradition may be granted will be offences which are punishable in both countries by imprisonment for a period of more than one year.  This meets the requirements of section 10 of the Act.</P>
    <P>I have already stated that Article 17 deals with expenses.  It was this provision which was held by the Supreme Court in the Gilliland case to bring the treaty within the terms of Article 29.5.2 of the Constitution so that, before the State could be bound by the terms of the treaty, it was necessary that they be approved by this House.  To enable the State to comply with the obligation it has entered into with the United States by virtue of this treaty, I therefore request the Dáil to approve its terms.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>This motion, which we as a party will approve of here today, deals specifically with criminal matters and matters relating to the USA.  It is regrettable that on the same day on which the Minister, after practically three years' delay, brings this matter before the House, he publishes the Extradition (European Convention on the Supression of Terrorism) Bill, 1986, which can only cause confusion in the minds of the public, the media and the Members of the House.  There is a marked distinction between these two.  The other major Bill which is presented today deals with political offences and the definition of a political offence, wheras this American treaty is, relatively speaking, a very <Col N="362" /> simple, straightforward matter dealing with criminal affairs only and specifically excluding matters relating to a political offence or an offence connected with a political offence.  For this reason it is regrettable that the Minister has chosen to bring the two together on the one day here in the House, one, of course, being published outside the House today and the other is before the House for consideration today.  Naturally, it will lead to some confusion about these matters.</P>
      <P>Dealing with the motion before us today, I have to say, &ldquo;Here we go again&rdquo;. Dáil Éireann is being asked today to bail out this pathetic Coalition Government from international commitments which they have supposedly made on behalf of the Irish people but whose unauthorised procedures were in contravention of the Irish Constitution.  We are confronted with the scenario of the Government once again belatedly showing respect for the constitutional rights of the people and coming back to the Dáil for the necessary ratification, having already committed this country to international agreements and having failed in their attempt to implement them.  This type of political strategy is both ignorant and disrespectful. It places the country at serious risk of embarrassment at international level.</P>
      <P>Worse still, it is an insult to the people of this land for whom the Constitution was placed in position to protect inviolable rights.  Indeed, it must strike one that bringing out the second Bill on the same day as the Minister presents this motion in the House could help to avoid some of the embarrassement the Minister must feel today on having to come to the House with this measure, not having done so over the past three years.  Dáil Éireann is being asked to approve of this motion today three years and four months after the signing of the treaty by Peter Sutherland, the then Attorney General, and two years after its ratification by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Peter Barry, because of the bungling and incompetence of the Coalition Government and of the Ministers for Justice and Foreign Affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="363" /> The treaty, despite the fanfares, was not in Irish law worth the paper it was written on.  The ink had not long dried on the signatures when the courts struck it down on the grounds that it was unconstitutionl because the Coalition failed to seek the necessary approval from Dáil Éireann in accordance with Article 29 of the Constitution.  This debacle has been extremely embarrassing for the Government since it is yet another example of failure through the mishandling of extradition, this time with the USA and on a matter which surely must have been regarded as relatively straightforward.</P>
    <P>Extraditon is based on the joint principles that it is in the interests of all civilised communities that an offender should not be allowed to escape justice by reason only of crossing national frontiers and that States should assist one another in bringing such fugitives to justice. Extradition is an essential part of the crimnal justice process as in any democratic judicial system it is also essential that the due process of law is accompanied by adequate safeguards for the individual.  To provide judicial safeguards for our citizens we may have to consider introducing in appropriate cases a requirement that the extraditing State should produce sufficient evidence to show that there is a <i>prima facie</i> case for requiring the person concerned to stand trial on the charges set out in the extradition warrant.</P>
    <P>After all, our citizens cannot be sent for trial before our own courts unless the prosecution can establish in the first instance the existence of a <i>prima facie</i> case in the District Court.  If the service of a book of evidence which discloses a <i>prima facie</i> case is a prerequisite to a person being required to stand trial on a criminal charge in this country, it is not unduly onerous to require an extraditing State to provide that a book of evidence disclosing a <i>prima facie</i> case, be produced before the Irish court which is being asked to send a citizen out of the jurisdiction to face trial.  This is a procedure which would be well worth considering. It is consistent with the administration <Col N="364" /> of justice, would attract greater public confidence in the extradition process which has been undermined by the bungling of the Coalition Government in a number of cases and, at the same time, it would strengthen the process by which wanted criminals are brought to trial.</P>
    <P>The process of extradition is one of the most sensitive acts in which a government can be involved.  It involves the surrendering by the State under an extradition treaty or agreement of persons wanted in another for prosecution or punishment. Accordingly there is a heavy onus on those directly concerned with the arrangements for the extradition to ensure that great attention is given to the detailed requirements for extradition, both in the preparation of the treaties and agreements and in their execution.</P>
    <P>The ordinary citizen must be able to have every confidence that the due process of the law will be fully recognised and strictly adhered to in relation to any case of extradition.  There should not be short cuts or political expediency in the extradition process.  It must be carried out in accordance with the due process of law and the principles of constitutional justice.  Fortunately our courts, with their constitutional independence, have zealously guarded the citizen's rights in relation to extradition but the record of this Coalition in the area of extradition has been slipshod and careless and this is just another example of that approach. They have not applied the high standards needed to ensure the continuing smooth operation of the extradition process.</P>
    <P>For example, in the McGlinchey case last year the Government decided not to pursue charges in this jurisdiction. Instead, the Attorney General, Mr. Peter Sutherland, on the Government's behalf adopted a very high political profile in ensuring that the McGlinchey extradition was rushed through the courts even though he was not a party to the proceedings. In due course McGlinchey was returned to stand trial here, and is now serving a sentence.  In that case the State declined to accept an order of the High Court adjourning the application for McGlinchey's extradition in order to <Col N="365" /> allow his lawyers to place certain legal and constitutional arguments before the court.  Instead, this order was appealed against peremptorily and the Supreme Court was required to sit on St. Patrick's Day so that McGlinchey could be dispatched across the Border in unseemly haste without due consideration having been given by the State to the serious charges which should have been brought against him here.</P>
    <P>In the Glenholmes fiasco earlier this year, the whole process of the law was brought into disrepute.  Although that debacle was initiated by the incompetence of the British requesting authority, and their apparent contempt for the rule of law in Irish courts, it was compounded by the failure of the authorities here, acting under the general supervision of the Minister for Justice, to scrutinise properly the defective warrants before presenting them to the court.  Following repeated bungling by the administration, the court ordered that Miss Glenholmes be freed and the extradition attempt failed totally, to the national and international embarrassment of the Government.</P>
    <P>One of the most clearcut examples of the Government's failure to handle extradition competently was the case of Robert Trimboli.  Trimboli was described as the most wanted man in Australia.  His extradition was sought so that he could face charges there for drug trafficking, murder and forgery.  The Government failure to handle his extradition successfully and Trimboli's release and subsequent disappearance held our legal process up to ridicule and shook the confidence of the ordinary citizen.  It caused a major embarrassment in Australia. People here do not realise how major that embarrassment was in Australia.  If people have contact with emigrants they will be told just how badly that man was wanted in Australia and how badly let down they felt when the Government mishandled the situation.</P>
    <P>Only two people have been extradited to the USA since 1982 and both were extradited in 1984.  Over the same period 140 persons were extradited to the UK.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="366" /> This year attempts to extradite two more to the US have failed.  As the Minister mentioned James Gilliland who is wanted in America in connection with a $9 million fraud, and Michael O'Shea who is wanted there for murder, were both released in July of this year on the direction of the Supreme Court.  The Government had got it wrong once again and Ireland was seen abroad as a haven for fugitives from justice.  These cases did not involve the overtones or complexities of political offences.  They are straightforward criminal charges.  We must have effective means of dealing with them and of meeting our international obligations in that regard.</P>
    <P>It is somewhat disturbing that on the day on which this matter is being debated in the House, a further Bill which brings in the political offence is published and will be discussed in the media.  It is interesting when we look at the 140 persons who were extradited to the UK over the last few years, to find that in 1982, 45 persons were extradited to Great Britain, in 1983, 26 persons were extradited, in 1984, there were 26 extraditions, in 1985 there were only five extraditions and up to 31 October 1986 there were only three extraditions to Great Britain.  The reality of the extraditions is very different from the impression given by the Government as to their performance in this area.  They give the impression that they are busily concerned about extradition and about doing a job that has to be done when in reality we find that again and again they are bungling extradition cases and only a very few people have been extradited this year.  The motion to approve the terms of the American extradition treaty comes before Dáil Éireann because the courts have held that this treaty constitutes a charge or a potential charge on public funds and it therefore comes within the terms of Article 29.5.2 of the Constitution which provides that:</P>
    <P>The State shall not be bound by any international agreement involving a charge upon public funds unless the terms of the agreement shall have been approved by Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="367" /> Article 29.5.3 provides that section 5 of Article 29:</P>
    <P>...shall not apply to agreements or conventions of a technical and administrative character.</P>
    <P>This in effect means that such an agreement need not even be laid before the Dáil.  Of course being laid before the Dáil does not involve being approved by the Dáil.  This present extradition agreement is not merely technical and administrative. Clearly, as the courts have held, it involves a charge upon public funds. The Government laid great emphasis at the time of making the agreement with the US on this country not being used as a haven for gangsters, drug traffickers and murderers, which indeed it must not be.  Yet, even so apparently obvious a step has having the agreement approved by the Dáil was not taken.</P>
    <P>The Minister should explain his incompetence in relation to this procedure.  Are we to take it this agreement was cobbled together by the Government with the same incompetence and carelessness for which they have become justifiably famous and which was probably best exemplified by the chaotic, confused and undignified frenzy which resulted in Australia's most wanted man being set free?  Alternatively, are we seeing a more sinister development whereby the Government hope to prevent the Dáil giving proper consideration to this country's extradition arrangements with other States?  Perhaps the Government felt that Dáil Éireann was not to be trusted with this kind of legislation?  If that is the case, the sooner the Coalition resign and return the country to parliamentary democracy the better.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister will indicate how many treaties and arrangements regarding extradition are in existence which have neither been approved by the Dáil nor laid before it.  What are Ireland's obligations regarding the vitally important matter of extradition?  If the Government had their way, Dáil Éireann would not even have had an opportunity to discuss and consider our obligations under <Col N="368" /> this treaty.  As it is, we are only now considering a treaty on such an important matter as extradition which was signed by the Government in July 1983, over three years ago.  How many times will the Government have to come back to the House to approve extradition arrangements with other countries?</P>
    <P>In the light of the decision of the Supreme Court in regard to the American extradition treaty, are we to take it that Ireland no longer has enforceable extradition arrangements or agreements with anyone?  Where does the current debacle over these two US extradition requests leave Ireland's international image?  It appears the practical implications of the Government's failure to do their job as the Constitution directs are that many of our extraditon treaties may be invalid.  The Minister must reassure the House on that point.  He should also tell us the position at present in regard to the Australian treaty.</P>
    <P>Can the Minister also tell us the position in regard to the extradition order in relation to Spain?  The difficulty with treaties and arrangements made by Governments is that if we are dealing with legislation which will affect citizens here we have an opportunity in the House to suggest safeguards and protection for them.  These matters are discussed comprehensively, we have an opportunity to question the Minister and to ensure that the legislation is the best possible given our knowledge at the time.  What safeguards are in the American treaty for citizens of this country who are taken to the United States and who are in custody there?  Fairly recently we introduced safeguards to protect people in custody or awaiting trial.  These are very clear and stringent regulations and I should like to have the position clarified in regard to our citizens in other countries.  What is the position in Spain in relation to prisoners under extradition arrangements? Will they be accorded the protections which we believe necessary while in custody and awaiting trial?  We should give great attention to these very serious matters. It will not do to discover some time in the future that someone is not being <Col N="369" /> treated properly because we were not prepared to give consideration to the preparation of these treaties.  That is why it is so important that measures which look routine, as is the case with an arrangement with the US, should come before the House for discussion.  It is regrettable that the Government decided earlier not to bring these matters before the House as they would have been supported without question but the wisdom of its Members could have been brought to bear on these proposals.</P>
    <P>No other State can be sure that the Government are capable of negotiating and validly implementing any of their agreements because they cannot be relied on to comply with their own domestic, legal and constitutional requirements. When a treaty is negotiated those on the other side with whom you are dealing have a right to expect that you know what you are doing in respect of constitutional and legal domestic requirements and not to be subsequently disappointed in that regard.  The present debacle indicates that the Government could not be relied on to have their homework done and to be clear, precise and effective in relation to our requirements.  It is not the first time that the Government appear not to know their domestic legal requirements. Can we trust the Government's judgement regarding the constitutionality of the Single European Act?  Ireland's image internationally is badly damaged yet again by the Government's lack of attention to essential details.  Ireland is made to look as if it is difficult to negotiate with because the Government do not understand the limits of their powers and, consequently, are likely to bungle the arrangements.  By not laying all international agreements before the House, as directed by the Constitution, the Government blatantly flout the Constitution and contribute towards the undermining of parliamentary democracy.</P>
    <P>Having registered my personal and political objections to the Government's clumsy mishandling of this important issue, I will revert to the legislative decision before us.  Taking everything <Col N="370" /> into consideration and in the respectful interests of the welfare and safety of our people, Fianna Fáil support the motion and approve of the treaty on extradition between Ireland and the United States. This treaty relates to non-political offences and comes within the provisions of the 1965 Extradition Act.  The Government have our full support in arrangements entered into to ensure that criminals such as drug traffickers, murderers and gangsters will not find a hiding place here.  However, we are uneasy at the way in which this important and sensitive matter has been mishandled by the Government.</P>
    <P>We want assurances that proper procedures will be followed and that the other existing extradition arrangements are in order.  It must be noted that this latest Government smokescreen &mdash; when it has blown over &mdash; will leave behind a scene of bungled legislative manoeuvring which does nothing to encourage public or political confidence in them.  As I said, this measure deals specifically with criminal matters and it can be disposed of very quickly by the House.  It is extraordinary that when the Government considered the matter three years ago they did not put it before the House if they had any doubts about it.  They should have asked the House to support them in these measures.  They should have asked the House to offer suggestions to improve and protect the rights of individual citizens.</P>
    <P>The details of the treaty which has been laid on the table of the House spell out a number of very interesting areas which could stand a great deal of discussion and, perhaps, improvement.  That concerns me because the Government left lacunae in the agreement which should have been covered.  They were left without detailed consideration.  The Supreme Court even suggests that it might be preferable before the Government finally sign and ratify such agreements they have the views of the House.  Therefore, they would develop agreements which we could all stand over in the future and they would be spared the embarrassment which they obviously must feel when a <Col N="371" /> treaty is set aside by the Supreme Court and when they fail in attempts to extradite people, in this case to the United States.  When one looks at the record and history in recent times of failures in relation to extradition one wonders if the Government give any detailed attention to these matters, or whether they are more concerned with the upfront high profile political elements which are obviously media grabbing and which receive great attention but behind the scenes they are not giving the attention which is required in matters such as these. However, having made these comments we are happy to support the motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>In contributing to this debate I should like, first of all, to draw the attention of the House to the increasing number of occasions on which legislation introduced by the Government has been declared unconstitutional by our courts for one reason or another.  The frequency and seriousness of some of these mistakes make one feel grateful for the level of protection which our Constitution provides for the citizen and also <Col N="372" /> for the dedication of our courts in upholding and safeguarding that protection on behalf of the citizen.</P>
      <P>The number of incidents of Government action and decisions which have been deemed by our courts as unconstitutional range from the decision, for example, to deprive the underprivileged in our society of their entitlements under the social welfare code to the present debacle in handling serious criminal matters between neighbouring States such as the motion we are discussing today.  I feel strongly that it is a serious reflection on this House and on our capacity to legislate within the framework of our Constitution that our citizens feel it necessary with increasing frequency to resort to our courts for justice and to challenge the unfairness and the unconstitutionality of some of those decisions.  More disturbing still is the fact that more and more of these cases are now being successfully challenged.  This raises serious doubts about the Government's capacity to legislate even within the law not to mention the social desirability of doing so within the framework of our Constitution.</P>
      <P>It is important at all times that we acknowledge the citizen's right to resort to the courts under constitutional rights but it is also sad that they have to do so with such frequency.  One cannot ignore either the prohibitive cost to the citizen in seeking justice in our courts or the cost to the State which in many cases is prohibitive and enormous.  We need to take a serious look at our structures and the system under which we operate if our courts are now to be perceived as an alternative to Government as would now seem to be the case in an increasing number of cases.  The unconstitutionality of Government decisions is bad enough when they relate to internal domestic matters but when they affect, as they do on this occasion, our relationships with neighbouring States and Governments then our credibility to govern and to manage our own affairs is in serious doubt and for this the Government must take the blame.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There can be no doubt that the controversy over the treaty of extradition <Col N="373" /> between Ireland and the United States of America is an embarrassment and raises serious doubts about our capacity and willingness to come to grips with international crime.  The House and the people should understand that on this occasion the court decision did not relate to legislation which was introduced and debated in this House but to a Government order in an area of national and international law which is certainly sensitive and very often controversial.  The process of extradition always has been and will continue to be one of the most sensitive areas in which any Government can become involved.  It does not help the process and the credibility of such decisions when the matter is handled and bungled by the Government in such an irresponsible way as this has been bungled by the Government.</P>
    <P>The treaty of extradition which is the subject matter of this motion is one, as has already been indicated by our spokesman, Deputy Woods, which has the full backing and the full support of the Fianna Fáil Party.  We as a party are anxious to co-operate with the Government and with neighbouring Governments and States, in particular the United States of America, in bringing to justice offenders which have been in serious breach of criminal law and who up to now have successfully evaded justice by crossing national frontiers.  It is of the utmost importance in dealing with international terrorism and crime that an effective and fair system of extradition should operate and be seen and recognised as operating in particular by those who operate in the criminal world.</P>
    <P>It is to be regretted that over three years after the signing of this treaty two people charged with the most grievous serious crimes have literally driven a coach and four through the terms of the treaty because of our failure in this House to comply with Article 29 of the Constitution. To say that it is an embarrassment is putting it mildly.  Our reputation has been seriously damaged and our law is seen by terrorists as a pass to a safer haven where they can evade the <Col N="374" /> administration of justice in the countries where they committed their crimes in the first instance.  It is unfortunate and damaging at a time when it is increasingly important that we should establish ourselves as a progressive nation at international level that such incidents should occur.  Those who observe our performance at international level will interpret our handling of this situation as incompetent and amateurish.</P>
    <P>For our people at home it has not helped that international criminals could use our courts to establish their rights and to remain in exile here for the purpose of evading justice.  This is no help for those people in society who have been living in fear because of the steady increase in crime.  Criminals are freely circulating in society who should have been brought to justice in other countries as well as here. Our international image has been seriously damaged as a result of the way this proposal has been handled.  We give our full support to the motion today and hope that it will enable the authorities to come to grips with international terrorism.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The terms of the Irish-American Extradition Treaty have been brought before the House for approval more by chance than be design.  When the treaty was originally made, it was thought it could be given the force of law in this country by a mere order of the Government published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil.</i> That was erroneous.  It was only when this treaty was challenged in the courts that it was generally realised that the treaty which involved a charge on public funds had not merely to be laid before the Dáil but actually to be approved by the Dáil.  When one reads the terms of the treaty it is perfectly evident that there is a charge on public funds under Article 17.  It is potentially quite a substantial charge in certain circumstances.  How this error was made by the Ministers for Foreign Affairs and Justice and, presumably, those advising them I do not know.  Perhaps they did not make an error.  Perhaps they thought it better not to bring this treaty before the Dáil.  The necessity to bring it before the Dáil arises because <Col N="375" /> Article 29.5.1º.2º of the Constitution provides:</P>
      <P>1º Every international agreement to which the State becomes a party shall be laid before Dáil Éireann.</P>
      <P>2º The State shall not be bound by any international agreement involving a charge upon public funds unless the terms of the agreement shall have been approved by Dáil Éireann.</P>
      <P>When the treaty was successfully challenged in the High Court, the State appealed to the Supreme Court, which divided three-two on the issue as to whether the &ldquo;one judgment&rdquo; rule in Article 34.4.5º applied to its verdict on the validity of the treaty.  The majority held that the treaty was &ldquo;a law&rdquo; for the purpose of that Article and accordingly only one judgment was given on its validity. The Supreme Court then ruled that the treaty was not properly part of our law.  As it involved a charge on public funds, it had to be approved by Dáil Éireann and not merely laid before this House.  It is an ironic reflection that such an apparently technical reason should oblige the Government to seek the approval of this House for the treaty which the Supreme Court acknowledged as part of our law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many regulations are made which have the force of law and yet do not have the express approval of this House. However, few non-statutory regulations can have such potentially far-reaching effects as an extradition agreement.  For, by its nature, an extradition agreement involves a great curtailment of the liberty and disruption of the life of the person extradited.  To be sent in custody to America for an Irishman is no small administrative matter.  Nor is the equivalent experience a small matter for an American extradited here.  This treaty is not confined in its operation to fugitive offenders; on the contrary, it applies equally to Irish citizens and others alike. The decision which this House faces tonight is to alter the law for everyone in this State.  By way of example, the treaty would render liable to extradition an Irish <Col N="376" /> citizen accused, say, of theft or assault alleged to have been committed while visiting the US as a tourist.  So although the reason for this debate is ostensibly technical and was not foreseen by those who made the treaty, still the result is that this House must today deliberate on a measure which has far-reaching implications for those who may be affected by it and which potentially affects the civil rights and liberties of all.</P>
    <P>It seems to me to be desirable that all extradition treaties should have to be approved expressly by Dáil Éireann.  I was somewhat amazed that the Minister in his rather flimsy, less than two-page opening speech referred to this treaty as the first bilateral extradition treaty negotiated by the State outside the context of the European Convention on Extradition of 1957.  That surprises me.  Even though it is by chance that it comes before the House, it is only right that all such treaties should come before the House from now on.  If the issues involved include fundamental issues of liberty and standards of justice, it hardly seems right that the Dáil's approval should be dispensed with; still less that it should be required only by reason of a peripheral issue involved, namely a charge on public funds.  In the United States, for example, all international treaties have to be approved by the Senate.  It is interesting that one of the treaties considered in the past 12 months by the US Senate was the supplemental treaty of extradition between the United States and the United Kingdom.  It was signed on behalf of the two Governments in Washington on 25 June 1985 but was not finally ratified by the foreign relations committee of the Senate until 12 June 1986, almost 12 months later.  It was ratified by the committee and subsequently by the whole Senate with a number of significant amendments, as a result of the views of Senators of Irish extraction or dissent being expressed rather forcefully in the debates of the committees and of the Senate itself.  I will return to this aspect later.</P>
    <P>In the near future this House will have an opportunity to review and amend the <Col N="377" /> law of extradition and it seems to me that one basic safeguard which must be introduced into our extradition laws is the requirement of express Dáil approval for extradition treaties or agreements. This is no technical matter; section 22 of the Extradition Act of 1965 sets out a framework for requiring the requesting state to produce evidence if required to justify the extradition.  However, the section has no mandatory effect and recent treaties, including this one, have contained no requirement whatsoever to provide any evidence in support of the charges being made against the person to be extradited from Ireland.</P>
    <P>There appears to be a policy here of foregoing any evidential safeguards to the citizen whose extradition is sought. While that may be administratively convenient, it is not an adequate protection for the individual whose life is radically changed and damaged by being surrendered in custody to await trial in a foreign country.</P>
    <P>No Irish man or woman can be obliged to face in this country a trial for a serious offence unless the prosecutor has satisfied a court that he has evidence, which if believed, would be likely to result in the conviction of that person.  The thinking behind this law is that no citizen should be compelled to submit to serious criminal process unless there is a <i>prima facie</i> case against him.  Apart from being kept in custody pending trial the law seeks to protect the citizen from the worry, strain, anxiety and possible infarmy of being publicly arranged and tried unless there is a case for him to meet.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that these principles which we regard as basic in our domestic criminal procedure, must surely be reflected in our legal procedures to compel our citizens to be surrendered in custody to face trial in a foreign state.  It is my belief that there is need, for safeguards in this area and, even if the law of extradition need not correspond exactly with the domestic law of preliminary examination, there is nonetheless a total absence of such safeguards here.  Indeed, what is more alarming, this treaty envisages a reprehensible discrimination <Col N="378" /> between the rights of Irish people whose extradition is sought to the United States and the rights of Americans whose extradition is sought by Ireland.</P>
    <P>Article VII.4.(c) of this treaty contains a provision which is quite surprising and somewhat alarming.  Where Ireland seeks the extradition of a person from America, evidence in a sworn form of affidavit setting our reasonable grounds for believing that the person sought to be extradited is guilty of the offence is needed.  However reasonable this provision may be in the eyes of the United States Senate and the United States courts, the fact remains that nobody in Ireland whose extradition is sought has any such protection.  It seems safe to conclude that the safeguards applying to extradition from America were included at the insistence of the United States Government or Senate.</P>
    <P>One can equally safely conclude that the Irish Government thought that such safeguards for their own citizens could be an irksome interference in a process of extradition which, in some perverted logic, is seen as most desirable when automatic, unreviewable and unstoppable.</P>
    <P>This treaty, accordingly, on a basic question of civil liberties, lacks a mutuality which one might expect.  There should be a sense of shame that the two-tiered standards embodied in the treaty flow from a want of care and a dismissive attitude to civil rights on the part of the Irish Government.  While it is true that Article IX provides for the requested state to seek further information or evidence, that right does not extend to the person to be affected by the order, nor can any Irish court ask for its production.</P>
    <P>The bottom line of this treaty is that an American whose extradition to Ireland is sought has the right to insist that sworn evidence as to the existence of a case against him and as to the substance of that case be produced in court in written form.  The Irish Government have apparently wantonly surrendered a similar protection for their own citizens.</P>
    <P>The recent supplementary treaty between the United States and the United Kingdom made provision to <Col N="379" /> permit the individual whose extradition was sought from the United States to present evidence on the issue as to whether there was &ldquo;probable cause&rdquo; for the extradition.  Probable cause is defined in that treaty as &ldquo;sufficient evidence to warrant a man of reasonable caution in the belief that the person arrested ... is the person sought and ... that an offence has been committed by the accused.&rdquo;  It appears clear that the United States Government are not prepared to reduce extradition to an administrative formality with judicial trappings.  The evidence suggests that both the Irish and British Governments share an attitude to extradition which gives the rights of the person affected a low priority indeed.</P>
    <P>This is a very serious matter.  It betokens a profoundly depressing forelock tugging attitude in our standards and principles of justice, in our respect for the rights of our own citizens and in our respect for our own international standing. This utterly wrong imbalance in this treaty is not justified by any practical considerations.  One is forced to the conclusion that this Government, in the matter of extradition law, are disposed to defer only to <i>raison d'etat</i> and are utterly blind to the civil liberation implications of what they are about.  The same issues and problems may arise in one form or another in connection with the forthcoming legislation published today on the European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism.  What is unacceptable here must surely be unacceptable in that context as well.</P>
    <P>I wish to conclude by reminding the Government that while extradition law is of fundamental importance, especially in this world of easy travel, international crime and international terrorism, and while domestic safeguards for the lives, liberties and bodily intergrity of the citizens are increasingly devalued, if national borders provide safe havens for murderes, kidnappers, extortionists, drug dealers and other wrongdoers, it equally remains the case that extradition law reforms part of domestic law and should <Col N="380" /> reflect the values, principles and safeguards which are enshrined in domestic law.</P>
    <P>I call upon this House, therefore, to decline to condone a double standard in these matters.  I call for the amendment of a treaty which is manifestly and unjustly lacking in mutuality, and which, for reasons of state, unjustifiably abandons safeguards which the United States insist upon for their own citizens.  This amendment I propose can easily be done by simply deleting the words, &ldquo;in the case of a request emanating from Ireland&rdquo;, from Artical VIII.4.(c) of the treaty.  Subject to this deletion, it is important that our procedures for extradition between the United States and Ireland should be ratified and put into effect on a basis of mutuality so that we would not have a repetition of the appalling situation we had within the past few years where a number of people wanted on extremely serious crimes were not extradited from Ireland, due to the incompetence of the Government in the drawing up of this treaty.</P>
    <P>It is well for us to cast our minds back to the time when this treaty was originally signed &mdash; in Washington, on 13 July 1983 by Mr. Sutherland, the then Attorney General.  The whole panoply of the Coalition's media manipulation system was produced, and we know how capable that is.  Mr. Sutherland, almost at the stroke of his pen, was ridding this country of all kinds of dubious Americans who were hiding as figitives from justice.  Today, we are reatifying this treaty not a week or two later but three and a half years later. The Government came here today and although in his opening statement the Minister made no reference to their errors, tried to surreptitiously get this through as if it were a minor technical amendment caused by some petty point raised by a backroom lawyer.  I would love to see the reality, which is what we are facing today three and a half years later, given the same fanfare as the event in Washington was given in July 1983.</P>
    <P>So far as these extradition treaties are concerned the House would be well advised to be very careful, to try to insist, <Col N="381" /> as I have, that all of them should be brought here.  The circumstance in which the extradition treaty with Australia was made recently were quite appalling by the standards of any civilised society.  We had no treaty with Australia.  A man was discovered to be in this country.  He was arrested under section 30 of the Offences Against the State Act, 1939, which has nothing to do with frauds in Australia.  He was held in custody for 48 hours improperly under the Act, as the court subsequently found.  While he was in custody the Government cobbled together a treaty with Australia in order to cover him.  No such treaty existed at the time of his original arrest but it did, apparently, at the end of the 48 hours.  That kind of thing may be good enough in parts of Central or South America but it is not good enough here.  This House should make it very clear that it is not good enough here.  That is why we should look, if we care, with greater care at this treaty, three and a half years late before us, because the Government botched it up in the way to which we have become so used in recent years.</P>
    <P>I have suggested a small amendment, small in terms of words, just deleting one line from this treaty in order to restore mutuality to it.  No self-respecting, independent country would have it otherwise. Under the Standing Orders of this House I can find no way in which I can put down an amendment to the treaty.  That is completely unsatisfactory because &mdash; as I have already said &mdash; the Foreign Relations Committee of the United States Senate were able to amend the supplementary treaty between the United States and the United Kingdom. It was open to the United States Senate to do so, it was open to the House of Commons in Britain and, so far as this treaty is concerned, it should be open to this House.  It was open to the United States Senate to amend it if they thought it necessary or fit which, as far as I know, they did not.  Therefore, they concede our right to amend it.  I do not deny the United States Senate their right to amend this treaty if they saw fit.  I am sure they <Col N="382" /> do not deny us our right to do so.  Our procedures should reflect that right.</P>
    <P>Having made the point clear I propose to put down such an amendment at least, to ask the Government to accept it; to ask the House, if they do not accept it, to vote on the matter because it is a matter of importance.  It is quite unsatisfactory that we have to take a treaty that is otherwise necessary with this major flaw even three and a half years after its original signature.  It is a major flaw that there should be that lack of mutuality, that Irish citizens should be treated in one way while American citizens are treated in a way that safeguards them to a far greater degree.  I seek your guidance.  Sir, on how that amendment could be made.  It could not be regarded by the House as satisfactory that this or any other treaty, or a document of that kind that comes before us, is immune from amendment in this House.  I do not want to reject the treaty outright.  I totally agree with all of it, except for the one line.  I remain suspicious of the circumstances through the continual messing with which the Government have gone on in respect of this and other extradition treaties.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. G. Birmingham)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to begin by thanking those Deputies who have contributed.  Some of those Deputies, enjoying your tolerant guidance.  Sir, felt free to wander far and wide way beyond the terms of the motion.  It is worth reminding the House at this stage just what the motion is.  It is a simple one confined to one specific issue. That did not stop Deputy Woods, for example, from regarding himself as free, because of the mention of the word extradition to raise every extradition issue that has arisen anywhere in the Law Reports or anywhere on the globe in recent years. None of those is relevant.  Neither did he feel obliged to stick to the facts.  For example, he spoke about a three year delay.  There has been no three year delay.  This matter was decided by the Supreme Court in July of this year only.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Equally Deputy O'Malley suggested <Col N="383" /> that the Government came in sheepishly. Let me say that nobody is in the remotest bit sheepish about this.  The factual situation is that the treaty was concluded, a treaty which has objectives to which every Member of this House and indeed every citizen should subscribe.  It is worth recalling that central to what this debate is all about is the belief that those who have perpetrated serious crimes should not be able to seek refuge in this State but should be obliged to stand trial, or indeed those whom we require to see standing trial in this State should not be able to seek refuge in the United States. That is the core of what this treaty and indeed this debate are all about.</P>
    <P>The treaty comes to this House because of the conclusions reached by the Supreme Court with regard to the relevance of Article 29.5.2 of the Constitution. Let me remind the House that this was the first occasion on which the Supreme Court came to consider that provision.  Deputy O'Malley suggested &mdash; with high indignation &mdash; that a cursory glance at the treaty would have made it obvious to everybody that a substantial charge on public funds was involved.  Let me remind him that this Article was considered in the High Court by Mr. Justice Egan in the Mac Caud case and he reached a very different conclusion.  He saw nothing obvious about it whatever and did not regard it as a matter that should properly have been brought before the Dáil.  Equally in his contribution, he referred to the fact that, in their judgement, the Supreme Court considered the question about the number of judgements they were in a position to deliver.</P>
    <P>While I suppose we should not be speculating as to what was in the minds of the members of the Supreme Court, one might think it was unlikely that they would have felt obliged to engage in that exercise if they had all been of one mind in relation to this aspect.  Therefore, there was nothing obvious about what has now transpired.  What has transpired was a point of some novelty, presented with some ingenuity by the counsel <Col N="384" /> engaged in the case, so be it.  It now falls on the Government to consider what action to take and the Government have done so.  They have done the obvious thing, which is to bring the matter before the Dáil and seek its approval for the terms of the treaty.</P>
    <P>The complaint has been made by Deputy O'Malley that there is a want of mutuality.  It is true that different procedures are contemplated but those differences arise from our respective domestic laws.  The requirements of the United States are stipulated because of their obligations under United States domestic law.  The requirements we provide are done by reason of the terms of the Extradition Act.  There is nothing sinister about that; nothing slipshod about that; nothing improper about that. A treaty was negotiated.  The terms of the treaty were available for all to see and no protest on the substance of its terms was raised in any quarter.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley wanted to know why there was not an earlier opportunity to have a look at all of this.  There was an earlier opportunity to have a look at all of this when, as was required by the Extradition Act, the terms of the treaty were laid before the Dáil.  Deputy O'Malley, Deputy Woods or no other Member of this House exercised their rights to put down in a motion seeking to annul it&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>We have no rights.  We can put down a motion but it will not be discussed.  The Minister knows that well. The Government will not allow time for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. G. Birmingham Mr. G. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>But my recollection at that stage was that the Deputy was sitting somewhere else in the House and that, as a Member of the Opposition, he would have been in a position to ensure time for the debate. Be that as it may, wherever he was sitting, neither he nor any other Members of the House felt there was anything inappropriate, unbalanced, or anything to cause concern in the terms of the motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="385" /> What has transpired is that a procedural question has arisen, the question of the lack of prior ratification by the Dáil.  The treaty therefore comes to the Dáil on that simple fact of righting the point of procedure.  That is the only issue of concern to the House today.  It would be an extraordinary breach of faith on the part of Members of this House if at this stage they were to decline to give their approval to this treaty.  It would be a breach of faith that the public would find hard to understand.</P>
    <P>It was suggested that the terms of the treaty indicate a certain lack of concern about civil liberties.  It was suggested in particular that this could lead to the view that we were less concerned than the people of the United States.  Members of this House are far more familar than I am with extradition practice throughout this Continent.  They will all agree that the trend over many years has been that the requirement of a <i>prima facie</i> case does not have a place between neighbouring countries and countries with a common set of values.  However, there will be an opportunity to debate some of those points in the not too distant future when they will be directly relevant to the instruments before the House.  Today we have a much simpler task.  We are simply righting a point of procedure and I invite the House to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>

      <P>I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="387" /> That Dáil Éireann approves the following Regulations in draft:</P>
    <P>Agricultural Produce (Fresh Meat) Act, 1930 (Exporter's Licences) (Fees) (Amendment) Regulations, 1986, and Pigs and Bacon Act, 1935 (Part II) (No. 12) Regulations, 1986, copies of which were laid in draft before the Dáil on the 13th day of November, 1986.</P>
    <P>These regulations would temporarily reduce from 75p to 50p the fees payable in respect of pigs presented for veterinary inspection under the Pigs and Bacon Acts and the Fresh Meat Acts.  Subject to the approval of the House, I would hope to have these reduced fees made effective in the period from 1 July 1986 until the implementation of proposed legislation on local slaughterhouses but, in any event, not later than 30 June 1987.  The slaughterhouse legislation referred to is aimed at harmonising inspection standards and charges as between domestic pork and other slaughterhouses and export plants, thereby removing competitive anomolies between both types of premises.  I hope to have the necessary draft Bill introduced in the near future.</P>
    <P>The matter of veterinary inspection fees on pigs has for some time now been a matter of concern for my Department. This fee is a statutory charge for a service provided by my Department's staff at approved export pig slaughtering plants. Between 1982 and 1985 the majority of curers had been refusing to pay these fees, resulting in arrears of almost £5 million being built up in that period.  The reasons given by the plants for their nonpayment were, first, that they claimed the fees were too high and, secondly, that they suffered a competitive disadvantage on the home market since domestic slaughterers were not subject to the same inspection charges and standards.  Following lengthy negotiations between my Department and the Irish Bacon Curers Society Limited, last year and mindful of the market difficulties being experienced by the industry, I agreed to a reduction of the fees from their then level of £1.10 <Col N="388" /> to 75p per pig and also to update legislation on domestic slaughterhouses.  The pigmeat plants, for their part, agreed to commence payment of the new fees.  I am sorry to have to report that following an initial resumption of fee payment the majority of curers have now once again discounted payment, leaving an amount of £ 1.3 million outstanding since April 1985.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that the pigmeat industry has been going through a difficult time. Increasing competition being experienced on home and export markets has lead to severe cash flow problems for many firms.  Many other industries in our economy are, however, facing similar problems, but they are facing up to their obligations.  So must the pigmeat industry.</P>
    <P>Deputies will, I think, appreciate that the reduction I am now proposing which, coupled with the previous reduction, amounts to a total reduction of over 50 per cent since April 1985, represents a very significant gesture on my part. However, I can go no further than this. The amount charged falls far short of the cost of the service provided.  The industry must now act responsibly and honour its agreement on this matter.  Hopefully, it will do so voluntarily.  I must now indicate very clearly, however, that if it does not do so I will have no hesitation in taking very firm action against defaulters, action which could result in firms losing their export licences.</P>
    <P>In an attempt to help the industry in its present difficulties, I have already taken a number of initiatives designed to alleviate problems.  These include the extension to pig producers of the scope of the recent exchange rate guarantee scheme for short term working capital for farmers and, indeed, the lifting of the ceiling to £50,000 for pig producers.  The proposal by the EC Commission to extend to the rest of the country the 50 per cent FEOGA grants currently available to pigmeat projects in the disadvantaged areas &mdash; at present the rate of grant is 25 per cent outside disadvantaged areas &mdash; will also help.  I have already mentioned the planned legislation on domestic <Col N="389" /> slaughterhouses.  The proposed reduction in fees, now before the House, is a further and indeed very tangible measure of aid.</P>
    <P>The pigmeat industry must now get on with the job of tackling its major structural and organisational weakness if it is to face the future with confidence.  I have for some time been emphasising the need for rationalisation of pig slaughtering plants and modernisation of processing premises.  While there are some hopeful signs of developments on this front, much more needs to be done. Generous grant aid is available to suitable applicants for this purpose.  If firms can modernise their plants to the highest standards, new markets will be open to them, for example, the US market from which they are presently excluded.  Firms also need to place much more emphasis on developing their range of products and marketing them agressively.  Product quality and consistency are, of course, also very important if we are to compete effectively.  In recognition of this, my Department are working towards having the recently agreed EC pig grading scheme introduced here as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I hope that all sides of the House will support the draft regulations and also support me in calling on all those involved in the pigmeat sector to tackle the urgent tasks now facing the industry so as to ensure it retains its valuable place in the Irish economy in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>I should like to welcome the recent developments in the north west and in the south in regard to FEOGA applications. At long last our co-operatives are moving towards expansion and I hope that expansion which we all welcome will take place in the not too distant future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> I should like to support the Minister's call on those involved in the pigmeat sector to tackle the urgent tasks now facing the industry so as to ensure that it retains its valuable place in the Irish economy in the years ahead.  The Minister has the full support of our party in his efforts in regard to that.  There should be more positive action from the Department and there is <Col N="390" /> a need for the pig industry to be given leadership.  I agree that the industry must face up to its responsibilities but the Minister, and his Department, must ensure that the industry is helped in every way. In the course of my contribution I intend to suggest ways the Minister and the industry can live up to their responsibilities. The Minister told us that the pigmeat plants agreed to commence payment of the new fees and added that he was sorry to have to report that following an initial resumption of fee payment the majority of curers have now once again discontinued payment, leaving an amount of £1.3 million outstanding since April 1985.  I hope the Minister will tell us how this has arisen.  What action does he intend taking to ensure that there will be a resumption of the payment of fees? It may be that this has arisen because, as the Minister said, legislation is needed to modernise the pig industry with particular emphasis on slaughtering.  I hope the Minister will deal with that point in his reply.</P>
      <P>I appreeciate the contribution by the Minister, and the Department, in helping the industry in this difficult period.  The Minister said:</P>
      <P>Deputies will, I think, appreciate that the reduction I am now proposing which, coupled with the previous reduction, amounts to a total reduction of over 50 per cent since April 1985, represents a very significant gesture on my part.</P>
      <P>It was a significant gesture.  The Minister added that the industry must now act responsibly and honour its agreement on this matter.  He hoped it would be done voluntarily.  He said that he will have no hesitation in taking very firm action against defaulters, action which could result in firms losing their export licences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister should spell out clearly what action he has in mind to deal with defaulters.  Will the Minister say if the whole industry is in default or if we are concerned with the majority of those in it?  Is there a concerted effort by the industry not to make a contribution?  If that is the case how will the Minister deal <Col N="391" /> with those defaulters?  How many are involved?  I accept that the extension to pig producers of the scope of the recent exchange rate guarantee scheme for short term working capital for farmers and, indeed, the lifting of the ceiling £50,000 for pig producers goes some way to relieving the position but it is not sufficient. I should like to commend the Minister on negotiating the extension to the rest of the country of the 50 per cent FEOGA grants currently available to pigmeat projects in the disadvantaged areas.  The Minister, and the Department, deserve our praise for negotiating that deal.</P>
    <P>The necessary financial incentives are now available but one must ask why they have not proved attractive enough to the industry.  Some weeks ago I pointed out to the Minister that a Limerick processing firm had to import bacon from Denmark in order to meet an export commitment to the USA because we do not have a processing plant that is up to the standards of the US Department of Agriculture. That is a sad reflection on our industry.  We need leadership in that area from the Minister and his Department.</P>
    <P>Time and again the Minister told us of the planned legislation on domestic slaughterhouses.  We have heard about this many times.  Is the delay caused by a legal problem or is it a lack of willingness on the part of the Department to bring slaughterhouse legislation up to date? How seen can we expect this legislation?</P>
    <P>I expect that if firms modernise their plants to a higher standard new markets will be open to them.  The US market is closed to us at the moment because our processing plants are not up to the standard required by the Department of Agriculture in the United States.  Firms need to place more emphasis on developing their range of products and marketing them aggressively.  There is little point in having a good product unless we are in a position to market it.</P>
    <P>There is also a need to meet the changing demands of the consumer.  In this area we have fallen down very badly.  Product quality and consistency are important if <Col N="392" /> we are to compete effectively.  I hope the Department are working towards having the recently agreed EC pig grading scheme introduced here as soon as possible. This will certainly help the industry and the effectiveness of the product on the domestic and export markets.  How soon can we expect to have this scheme implemented?</P>
    <P>While the aids the Minister has given are welcome, they are all very small, although together they can be recognised as something tangible.  But in addition we need a pig grading scheme and perhaps the Minister would outline what is involved, what it will mean to the producer and what it will contribute to our competitiveness in the market.</P>
    <P>I am happy to have the opportunity to agree to this resolution now before the House.  We would welcome the speedy implementation of these new regulations. The reduced rate of fees for veterinary examinations will be at the rate of 50p per pig, and will be effective from 1 July this year and will continue until the end of July 1987.</P>
    <P>The pig industry has been going through a very difficult period in recent times.  The scheme now proposed will give some relief to the industry and to the factories processing the pigs.  It is important that this relief is passed on to the producer, as the Minister intends, because this area is badly hit at present. As the relief is effective since the beginning of July there should be a build up of a small reserve to enable processing factories to encourage processors at home on whom they depend for their raw material.</P>
    <P>The pig industry has been going through a bad time, particularly at producer level.  The processing sector have also experienced some serious difficulties. Here I join with the Minister in congratulating everybody concerned in the rationalisation of the industry in the west.  This is a step in the right direction. I hope the project will be a huge success and that it will be copied throughout the country.</P>
    <P>The pig industry must be built up.  Pig rearing has changed remarkably since we <Col N="393" /> joined the EC.  The small sow units of the past have been replaced by very large and specialised rearing units.  Practically the whole of the pig rearing industry is now concentrated in the hands of a very small number of producers who have made very heavy investments in their business. This is all the more reason the industry should get special attention from the Department.</P>
    <P>We are also at a disadvantage here in that feed costs for pigs tend to be higher than elsewhere.  This impedes the competitiveness of the industry and our ability not only to maintain supplies for the home market but, above all, to increase our export trade.</P>
    <P>We must look very carefully at the pig processing industry.  Our pig producers have deservedly got a reputation, in recent years, for being very efficient.  Unfortunately developments in the processing sector have fallen very far behind.  I do not at this stage wish to analyse why this is so except to say that a certain artificiality was maintained in that sector for some years and that did not help the industry.  That artificiality cost the taxpayers some millions of pounds a few years ago in connection with the Pigs and Bacon Commission, but that is post, over and done with and we hope there will be no repetition of it.</P>
    <P>There is now great and urgent need for the retionalisation of the industry and for the building as soon as possible of a small number of factories which will be up to international standards.  The Minister in reply to a parliamentary question I put to him in the past week said there was some hope of progress.  I encourage the Minister and the industry to do everything possible to speed up that progress.</P>
    <P>One could say that the pigmeat industry here is at risk.  We must face up to that fact.  We all know that about four fifths or more of the output is sold on the home market.  There is as yet no great evidence of imports making inroads but indeed it would be a sad day for the whole industry if that should begin to happen. Therefore, the quality of the finished <Col N="394" /> product for the consumer is all-important. We have been for four or five years a very prominent food display centre in the centre of the city of Dublin using certain quantities of pigmeat imported from the northern part of this country.</P>
    <P>As with all other agricultural products, everybody from the producer to the processor must keep the ultimate consumer. in mind.  I am not going to deviate into the milk industry, but let me give as an example the fact that in the past year or so we had in the milk industry evidence of the power of the consumer within our country.  The Minister knows well that there has been a remarkable change in the amount of butter consumed on the domestic market.  There has been a fall of some 20 or 25 per cent in that regard in the past 12 months, and the Minister knows that the gap has been filled by spreads which, unfortunately, use a considerable amount of imported raw material.  I give this example to outline and indicate the power of the consumer and how necessary it is for concerns processing agricultural products to keep the interest of the consumer in mind.  I would be very concerned indeed if imports began to take over any part of our markets. Already we have far too many imported foodstuffs of various kinds.  A few years ago we began to depend on imports for a considerable portion of our flour for bread making.  We had large imports of potatoes, mainly in the form of frozen chips, carrying in some cases brand names indicating that they have some Irish connection which, of course, we all know they have not.  All of this is very worrying, especially when one thinks of the amount of foreign exchange which must have been spent on these imports and above all the amount of employment which is being lost to the country.</P>
    <P>In the pigmeat industry income generated through agricultural production here and through the processing of that production can do nothing but benefit the economy.  No black hole in our economy can be created by agriculture.  This is a message which, with great emphasis, I <Col N="395" /> would like to place firmly on the record of this House.</P>
    <P>I was somewhat upset in recent times when I learned from a food processing concern in my county of Limerick that they were unable to find within our country pigmeat suitable for export to the US market.  The food processing concern in question, which I have visited and inspected, has built up very good contacts and has the possibility of exporting to the US but find that we have not one pigmeat processing factory acceptable to the US Department of Agriculture.  What are we going to do about it?  What are the plans in the Department of Agriculture to remedy that?  Must we continue to import bacon from another country in order to meet the market commitments of this firm and their export trade to the US?</P>
    <P>The Minister in his reply to the question I have just referred to stated that perhaps in the next year this deficiency will be made up.  That is a ray of hope. He might outline and elucidate in detail where he can see this ray of hope developing. It would be very welcome news particularly to the industry.  I hope that the Minister in his reply will allay any fears there may be about this and that this firm in my county will have the opportunity of using bacon produced and processed in this country, from animals slaughtered here, in some of the modern factories we hope will be built.  Maybe that is where the Minister sees the ray of hope, so I ask him to outline more clearly what he has in mind.</P>
    <P>A country which falls down in maintaining a high standard for its exports leaves itself wide open to imports, and again I emphasise the importance of having regard to the consumer.  The consumer is all important.  Maybe in the pigmeat industry as with other agricultural products we do not take into consideration the changing needs of the consumer. We should recognise that consumer needs change daily and that we are not producing the product required. Research and development is needed in this area.  I appeal to An Foras Talúntais to initiate that research and I hope there <Col N="396" /> will be no further cutbacks in funding to An Foras Talúntais.</P>
    <P>The cost of foodstuffs is a problem in pig production.  There have been substantial benefits to the industry recenty from the milk sector but the milk sector is now facing major difficulties and there is a crisis in that area.  The Minister should do his utmost to ensure that the benefit, to pig producers from the dairy sector are maintained.  We should ensure that we have a high quality product from pig production to meet the needs of consumers. Along with investment in new processing. Machinery form pigmeat the IDA and the Department of Agriculture should ensure that factories who benefit from the grants are marketing their products properly so as to provide the home market with a high class product and to supply the export trade.  Our marketing of pigmeat in Britain has not been as good as it should have been.  Irish bacon was constantly discribed on the British market by comparison with Danish bacon and the artificiality to which I referred a few minutes ago had this something to do with that.  I hope this will never happen again.  We should turn out a first class product capable of competing with the best.  At the moment some producers seem to have possibilities, through better management, of reducing costs in pig production.  In the processing sector there is a scope for improvement as there is in the marketing sector.  The industry has a good future but it is up to the people involved to make the fortune that can be made from pig production.  The State can help and the motion before us is evidence of that but greater that the IDA and FEOGA grants are the efforts of the people in the industry.  I welcome the motion and I wish the industry the success it deserves.  This is a traditional industry which has provided worthwhile income to the members of the farming community down through the years.  Now there are changes in pig production, from the smaller to the bigger units, but the industry can be further developed so as to produce a better quality product for the consumer.  This motion helps in some small way towards that end.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. J. Leonard Mr. J. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the reduction.  These levies have come in for a lot of discussion over the last year in my area as we had two factories in difficulties where 100 people were out of work for some months.  At that time we compared the levies here with the levies on our competitors.</P>
      <P>I pay tribute to those two industries who are now going full steam ahead and who hope to extend their workforce.  We are very often critical of governmental Departments, but on this occasion I congratulate the Department for their efforts to ensure that these two factories went back into production.  In any other constituency where there were 100 people out of work there would have been a scuttle for redundancy payments but these people are back at work and the factory is in full production.  Credit is due to them.  Until these factories came into production we had been producing almost entirely for the domestic market but one of those factories exported 95 per cent of its product.  It was regrettable over the years that we did not move into the export markets because if you do not sell aggressively you will not continue in business.  Those factories exported 95 per cent of their produce on the Japanese market.</P>
      <P>Many producers here have the capacity to make an impact on the American market.  The Minister said that legislation in regard to slaughtering is aimed at harmonising inspection standards and charges between domestic pork and other slaughterhouses and export plants, thereby removing the competitive anomalies. Certainly those anomalies were very serious and the reason for so much frustration and apathy in the industry.  Some people were operating within very rigid guidelines while others were not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We cannot over-emphasise the importance of pig production and, fortunately, rationalisation will solve the problems in western slaughtering and processing plants.  Pig production played a very important role in small farming.  In my constituency, before the war and immediately after 50 per cent of farmers were <Col N="398" /> producing pigs and were totally dependent on that line of production.  That has now changed greatly &mdash; there are about 100 producers in County Monaghan at present &mdash; but there are compensations because of the number of jobs provided in slaughtering and processing plants.  Value added products have been mentioned, an area in which there is room for major development.  It is accepted that pork meat is a very good product.</P>
    <P>A German factory in Monaghan has gone into production and the base for their food is pigmeat.  It would be a great pity if the industry suffered any setbacks. We should be in a position to compete with the US market.  It is unfortunate that a firm here purchase products outside the country to fulfil their contracts in the US. Over the last few years, the exchange rate was fairly favourable and we could have taken advantage of it to produce products which would have sold well over there.</P>
    <P>There has been great development in pig breeding and in the feeding system. We can compete with any EC country so far as production is concerned.  Imports have been mentioned.  At the end of last year we were allowed to import pork and bacon products.  Serious fears were expressed in that regard but, thankfully, there have not been any serious repercussions. Commonsense prevailed and many producers stayed with the home produced article.  The customer is very important and good quality products will always sell.  For a long time we depended on the Japanese market although we knew that it would not last forever.  It was accepted that if we were in a position to meet the strict American standards in relation to processing we would capture that market.</P>
    <P>We welcome the exchange rate guarantee scheme which raises the ceiling to £50 for pig producers.  The Minister said that the pig industry must now get on with the job of tackling the major structural organisational weaknesses if they are to survive.  That area must be tackled without delay.  If structural weaknesses are faced we will be in a position to benefit because there is a great input from other <Col N="399" /> areas.  If pig production failed it would be a very serious matter.</P>
    <P>There has been talk of reducing acreage in regard to cereal production.  Now that there are problems in beef production we will be depending more and more on cereals to be utilised for pigfeed. There is certainly an opportunity for an increase in this area as it has been the backbone of the small farmer in the Connacht-Ulster area over the years.  While they are not directly involved now, as I said, in the production end, the job potential is there, for example, in producing pigmeat and processing the product. Pigmeat is ideal for processing.  It compares with the broiler and the turkey. On almost a daily basis new products are being developed and they are being utilised in other areas such as prepared foods, cooked foods and so on.</P>
    <P>The future for this country lies in producing a quality article.  The first step is to get to grips with the American market, and we now have the opportunity to do so.  The public look for quality and will pay an additional price for it.  There are opportunities in the European market for pigmeat and other products.  I welcome the reduction and I ask the Minister to bring in regulations with all possible haste with regard to slaughterhouses and to impress on the various slaughterhouses the need to have their premises in a position from which they will be able to compete in all available markets.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>It is particularly appropriate for a representative from my county and constituency to talk on draft regulations reducing fees on pigs being slaughtered at pork and bacon factories. The House knows very well that in many areas of the country, particularly in my own county, the economy for many decades stretching back into the 19th century has to a great extent depended on small farmer production of pigs and pigmeat. We have an indigenous industry in the county which has been established for a long time.  McCarron &amp; Co. Limited are one such firm.  They still represent direct <Col N="400" /> employment in our county town.  In political clinics in that town I have had occasion to reflect on how important the factory is for the town and the great disaster it would be if it could not be sustained as a profitable processing factory.</P>
      <P>I have strong views about the products and about the way in which the industry has been going.  I would like to make a few suggestions while speaking on these draft regulations.  The industry has changed to a great extent, and Deputy Leonard referred to this.  We have reached the era of large production units. I am not saying the hands of the clock should be put back but it is a considerable wrench to our local economy.  There is a tendency in most places, as exemplified for example in the corner shop making way for the big supermarket, to concentrate on larger units nowadays.  I have no doubt that the wheel will come full circle in many areas of the economy, be they the supermarket or factory areas, when people will begin to reflect on other economic factors other than the economy of scale.  In my own constituency many small farmers still breed bonhams and sell them either to larger fattening units or to individuals who want to fatten them from the eight to ten-week old stage onwards.  That was the old method.  Due to certain trends and tendencies in farming and in the production of food which are apparent at present that small scale effort &mdash; admittedly it will have to be at a premium price &mdash; will be able to make a comeback.  I refer in particular to the big drive for natural foods and organically grown foods.  This transfers to certain types of livestock and, in particular, it would transfer to the pork and bacon area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think it would be successful if it were simply the small farmer producing pork and bacon using the methods of the big farmer.  There is a future if, for example, the small unit rely on their own barley to feed a small number of pigs. This will reflect on the quality of the product.  I have no doubt at all about that.  I remember saying years ago when mass production of eggs was beginning to develop that the time would come when <Col N="401" /> the children of the country would not know the real taste of an egg.  Admittedly, the big battalions will come down on top of me for talking like this but that egg cannot compare in flavour with the free range egg.  There is a market and there will be a developed market for pig and pork products in the future.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated in his speech that he is introducing this reduction to operate from 1 July 1986 to not later than 30 June 1987.  In so far as it is a help to pig producers I would like to support him.  I do not know what kind of impact it will have and how much of a help it will be but I know that people who are producing pigs in my own county and to whom I have spoken recently are saying that the profit margins are exceptionally low and, consequently, the business is in a perilous state.  I hope the margins will improve and that the producers, whether on a large or small scale, will be able to survive. To go to another point, from the point of view of value for money in the shop, pork has been for a considerable period away ahead of anything else that is being offered to the housewife.  She can obtain for her money an amount of pork which is larger than she can get for the same money in beef and, especially, lamb.  As the House knows, pork is a very fine food.  I would like the position to be maintained where a reasonable margin could be achieved by the producer and in the market the same kind of good value would be available to the housewife.</P>
    <P>There has been controversy and difficulty in my own area with regard to the factories and the rationalisation programme which is under way.  This would cover a large area of production, partly in the west and partly in south Ulster or the north midlands.  I am sure the Minister has the interests of the industry at heart.  In his part of County Cork productivity is not as great as in south west Cork.  West Limerick was traditionally an area where this industry flourished.  I lived in Donegal for a number of years and there they never went in very much for breeding.  They went to other areas, particularly to my native county, to purchase at the bonham stage for fattening. <Col N="402" /> I am afraid to use the word &ldquo;fattening&rdquo; nowadays for fear of doing damage to the industry.  It is a dirty word in those areas.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately I did not get here in time for the Minister's speech and the debate.  I am sure the House will support whatever measures are to be taken to sustain the pork and bacon industry.  We in Fianna Fáil, led by our spokesman, are putting together a policy in this regard.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputies for their helpful contributions. Of course the Department will help, as they have always done, to meet the challenges. The Department of Agriculture have always done so within acceptable limits.  The bacon industry must lead, not the Department.  The industry must go out and market pig meat products.</P>
      <P>We have reduced the fees to about half the 1985 level.  Our inspection fees are now among the lowest in the EC.  The pig fee is much more favourable than the fees for cattle and sheep.  Rather than spell out in detail what we have in mind, I would hope that the industry would heed my general warning.  They must pay fees like the cattle and sheep farmers.  We cannot continue as we are.</P>

      <P>On the domestic slaughterhouse legislation, we are on the verge of bringing this before the Dáil.  On pig grading, we are not obliged to bring in EC legislation before 1988.  We are urging the industry to take it very seriously and I am hoping we will have the legislation a year in advance of schedule.  It is vital that the industry should move swiftly.  Grading is based on lean meat content, which is what the consumer wants.  There is no point in producing anything else.  For far too long producers of all kinds have been producing things in the hope that the consumer would buy.</P>

      <P>We are doing a fair bit for the industry within the existing constraints. There is sufficient encouragement of all sorts and it is up to the <Col N="404" /> industry to avail of the generous grants and other aids available.  Substantial FEOGA and IDA grants are available and I would urge people to avail of them. The producer in this instance is certainly playing his part.  He has modernised and for once we cannot point the finger of blame at him.  It is also important for the industry to realise that it cannot be all give on one side and take on the other. The industry must pay the charges legally levied on them.  These charges are reasonable and this cannot be denied. The industry must face up to their legal responsibilities.</P>
      <P>The best defence against imports is to get our own standards up and ensure that we operate efficiently.  In other words, we beat exporters at their own game. This can be done given the required commitment, and we have that commitment, through slaughtering to production and marketing.</P>
      <P>The processor referred to by Deputy Noonan will be going into the United States market before mid-1987 and I hope we will have the necessary raw materials in time.  The Government are fully behind that project.  The skim milk subsidy was also referred to.  This confers substantial benefit on the pig producer.  I can assure the Deputy we will continue to press the EC to continue that subsidy because it alleviates some of the disadvantages involved in this area as well as the high cost of feed.</P>
      <P>I want to refer briefly to the speech made by Deputy Leonard.  I am delighted that Grahams of Monaghan are back in full production.  This business is almost entirely export oriented and I hope they go from strength to strength.  It is a matter of regret that we have been unable to avail of all the opportunities in the United States market in the recent past, but the important thing is that we avail of any opportunities that arise in the future.  The Deputy rightly stressed the need for diversification in products and in markets because that is the securest way forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He also referred to the purity of our food.  This is an advantage we do not make enough of.  We have a wonderful climate and we are free of acid rain.  In <Col N="405" /> this modern age when there is so much emphasis on health foods, we do not lay enough emphasis on the fact that as an island we are pollution free.  Our meat is particularly good, free of hormones and so on.</P>
    <P>Deputy Wilson referred to the change from small to large scale units.  There are some disadvantages to this but the large units have an overriding advantage.  I know from experience that the large units have brought a measure of stability to the pig industry.  There is nothing wrong with small units because the small producer can fill a niche in the market by supplying a specific product.  One of the main problems in the past was that people in the pig industry in a small way could move in and out very easily, and there were massive fluctuations.  Most of the people involved in pig production nowadays are involved in a very big way and cannot move in and out of the market quickly. Big is not always bad.</P>

    <P>This Bill arises from the widely acknowledged deficiencies that exist in <Col N="406" /> the controls exercised over the dog population. These deficiencies have led to a situation where there are dogs roaming our countryside and the streets of our towns and cities doing considerable damage to sheep flocks, causing health and environmental problems and attacking adults and children.  The existing control measures, some of which date back to 1839, are not working, and it is believed that part of the problem is that responsibility for enforcement of these measures is dispersed over several Government Departments.</P>
    <P>The Bill, which repeals all existing legislation in the matter and consolidates in one statute all matters pertaining to dog control, was introduced in the Seanad and was extensively debated there.  I was extremely heartened by the reception which the Bill received in the Seanad and some necessary amendments and modifications were made during its passage through that House.</P>
    <P>It is estimated by some people that there is one dog to every five persons in the State.  That would leave a dog population of 700,000.  There are no official statistics to corroborate this figure, but information compiled by the Economic and Social Research Institute in the course of surveys indicate that 51 per cent of households keep at least one dog, giving a minimum figure of 500,000 dogs.  The real figure probably lies somewhere between the two.  The number of dog licences taken out fell from 205,000 in 1975 to 80,000 in 1985, and that reduction is in itself a further reason why the control of dogs needs to be tightened up considerably.</P>
    <P>The problems associated with dogs do not arise entirely from numbers but also from irresponsible ownership.  This can lead and has led, to attacks on sheep, which in economic terms result in substantial losses to sheep farmers and to the national economy.  Other results of such irresponsibility can be attacks on persons and especially on children, environmental pollution through dogs fouling paths, parks and beaches, traffic accidents attributable to uncontrolled dogs <Col N="407" /> and public health hazards such as transmission of disease.  A serious health risk, especially for children playing with infected pups or coming in contact with dog excrement, is toxocara canis, which in some cases may cause eye damage or even epilepsy.  Salmonellosis and ringworm may be, and have been, picked up from dogs.  The most serious health risk comes, however, from rabies.  Fortunately this country is free of the disease and there are strict precautions on the importation of dogs and cats as a protective measure against the disease.  The westward movement of the disease in Europe increases the danger that infected animals could appear in Ireland and in turn infect uncontrolled dogs.</P>
    <P>At present primary responsibility for enforcement of dogs legislation rests with the Garda Síochána. Because of the many pressures on the force in relation to serious crime and the maintenance of the security of the State and the fact that it is inappropriate to use highly trained Garda personnel to do work which could be done equally well by other trained personnel, it is proposed to place the task of enforcement of the dog control measures in this Bill with dog wardens to be appointed for the purpose.</P>
    <P>A further obstacle to effective enforcement of the existing control measures is the diffusion of responsibility between various Departments.  The Bill, therefore, will entrust overall responsibility in the matter to the Minister for the Environment because of his involvement with local government, at which level the problems will be tackled on the ground. The major local authorities, i.e. the 27 county councils and five county borough corporations together with Dún Laoghaire Borough Corporation will administer the Act in their respective areas.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann requests the Government to arrange to have the Christmas bonus payment to Social Welfare recipients made this year on the same basis and at the same rate as it was in 1985.</P>
      <P>In recent weeks the Government, by their actions in the social welfare arena, have let slip the mask of social concern which certain of their members, not least the Leader of the Government, have worn so piously and lightly during the past four years.  They have also exposed a bewildering degree of ineptitude.  By their attitudes shall you know them.  The actions of the Government have demonstrated an arrogant and uncaring attitude to the dilemma of social welfare recipients and show that they have no comprehension of what it means to have to exist on social welfare payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The decision to cut the Christmas bonus, which Fianna Fáil seek to reverse here this evening, is just one more instance, another example of Government apathy towards the poor in our society of which we have had so much evidence in the lifetime of the present administration.  The decision to cut the Christmas bonus from 75 per cent of a full week's allowance to 64 per cent is <Col N="409" /> further evidence of Government lack of concern and of ignorance of what it means to rely for one's existence on social welfare payments.  This decision saves the Government a mere £3 million.  It reduces the cost of the Christmas bonus scheme, introduced by Fianna Fáil in 1980, from £21 million to £18 million, a mere drop in the ocean when overall Government spending is taken into account.  Yet to individual welfare families it is vital, allowing some little extras during the Christmas period, helping to bring some little cheer into what is a grinding existence for them at the best of times.  Of course Government expenditure must be controlled but not at the expense of the poor, and not at the expense of those who are unfortunate enough to have to rely on social welfare payments for their meagre existence.</P>
    <P>The Government decision to cut the Christmas bonus reflects their apathy towards social welfare recipients.  They are completely out of touch with reality. They have ensured that this Christmas will be even more of an ordeal than usual for people on social welfare payments. Their heartless and bungling approach to the equality legislation has meant a fall in the living standards of some 20,000 families over the Christmas period.  Their last minute and reluctant decision, in the face of intense pressure from their backbench supporters, to review the implementation of the EC Social Welfare Equality Directive will not do anything to help these families over the Christmas period.  There is no real commitment in this review, nothing more than an almost half empty promise to quieten and suppress a growing revolt from Labour and Fine Gael backbenchers who had been assailed by their constituents for their actions.  This half-baked attempt to push away the problem, to kick it under the counter, is little more than political deception of the lowest kind.  It will not solve the problem of those 20,000 families who last week, this week, every week between now and Christmas and into the New Year, will be short of up to £60 a week in their social welfare payments. <Col N="410" /> The Government's performance is a national scandal.</P>
    <P>The manner in which the equality directive legislation was introduced has caused dreadful confusion.  The Minister failed to clarify precisely how it would affect the different categories of social welfare claimants &mdash; the old, the unemployed, the disabled and deserted people all of whom have suffered as a result of the Minister's incompetence.  It is appalling to reflect what this Scrooge-like attitude of the Coalition will mean to thousands of families.  First, some 20,000 are to lose from £20 to £60 a week.  Then the Government slash the Christmas bonus &mdash; heaven knows it is small enough &mdash; from 75 per cent to 64 per cent of a full week's benefit.  This will cause a further loss of between £5 and £10 in the Christmas bonus for some 500,000 social welfare recipients.  The old, the sick and the unemployed are being crucified at every angle by this Government.  In the space of a week the Government have created a huge category of double victims &mdash; some 20,000 low income families &mdash; who this Christmas will see their incomes slashed by the Coalition's decisions on the equality directive and the Christmas bonus, a double blow to those families.</P>
    <P>This Government seem intent on penalising social welfare recipients, as if their plight was of their own making.  The recent NESC report &mdash;<i>A Strategy for Development 1986-1990</i>&mdash; points to the causes of the growth in our social welfare population.  The central reason for increased expenditure on social welfare is spiralling unemployment.  In the past four years, under the present administration, more than 70,000 people have joined the ranks of the unemployed. When one considers that some 50 per cent of social welfare recipients have families this represents a growth in want, deprivation and poverty of awesome proportions. In the past four years too, the cost which growing unemployment made on the total cost of social welfare expenditure is difficult to overstate.  It has escalated out of all proportions.  Therein lies the kernel of the problem of the huge costs which Minister after Minister and <Col N="411" /> the Taoiseach in this heartless and ruthless Government complain so bitterly about.  But the real truth is that the problem lies with themselves.  The problem has been Government created.  They and they alone must take responsibility for it.  The growth in unemployment related social welfare payments contributed over 31.4 per cent of the total change in social welfare expenditure costs, an increase of almost £460 million.</P>
    <P>A further appreciation of the role of unemployment in determining expenditure growth can be observed in the fact that, whereas the respective shares of old age pensions and unemployment in total social welfare expenditure were 35.8 per cent and 19.8 per cent respectively in 1980, the respective shares in 1985 were 29.3 per cent and 26.6 per cent.</P>
    <P>In 1982 there were 145,500 unemployed persons.  By 1985 that number had increased to 219,200, and in the first three years of the lifetime of the present Government.  The unemployment figure, which is rising continuously, now stands at 233,000, not to mention the 50,000 people on short time employment schemes and some 100,000 of our young people who have emigrated in the last four years.  The pattern of social welfare expenditure growth in the past four years shows that unemployment features very strongly in terms of its overall share of expenditure growth &mdash; 43.8 per cent &mdash; and in items of the impact on unemployment expenditure of an increased number of recipients.  In the case of unemployment benefit over 90 per cent of increased expenditure is attributed to a growth in recipient numbers, while the figure for the assistance scheme is 81 per cent.</P>
    <P>The Government prefer to ignore the contribution their disasterous economic policies have made to the growth in unemployment over the past four years and, consequently, to the plight of the social welfare population.  This Government have depressed confidence.  Their bungling approach to investment policy has led to the flight of Irish capital to create jobs abroad rather than at home <Col N="412" /> and to a slump in investment in manufacturing industry at home.  Their ineptitude has led to crippling high interest rates which depress economic activity. In a word, the failure of Government economic policies has increased inevitably social welfare spending.  Yet this Government have tried persistently to claw back increases in social welfare payments while claiming to protect the unemployed and the poor.  That is a charade. The increases in social welfare payments granted by the present Government in 1983 and 1984 were effective for a mere nine months in each of those two years.</P>
    <P>In 1985 and 1986 it was the same story. Let us remember that these increases were totally inadequate compensation for the 50 per cent reduction in food subsidies and the increase in VAT on clothes, fuel and footwear.  In sharp contrast Fianna Fáil have always displayed a practical concern for the vulnerable sections of Irish society.  This Government, overloaded with pseudo intellectuals, always claimed to be expert on statistics and figures.  This has been their main claim to fame since they have no knowledge of the human realities of life. Sadly, they are no good at figures either. They have consistently fiddled the figures in relation to budgetary costs of unemployment payments, in relation to projected budget deficits, and in relation to reducing the national debt.  These fiddled figures have long since been exposed for their worthlessness.  Recently they again fiddled the figures in relation to the cost of implementing the equality directive.</P>
    <P>The Ministers, Deputy Hussey, Deputy J. Bruton and Deputy Deasy have now taken up a new battle on more fiddled figures.  They have applauded themselves for granting social welfare increases of 40 per cent over the past four years which they say far exceeded inflation.  They stated that social welfare recipients were never better treated than under their regime.  The so-called 40 per cent which they are now singing about is a fallacious and untrue figure.  It is another political deception.  They are stating this figure loud and clear because they say <Col N="413" /> that is the reason they cannot pay the extra £3 million as a bonus to unfortunate people at Christmas.</P>
    <P>Normally I would not bore this House with a series of statistics but unfortunately someone has to tell the truth and bury the deceptions about these false figures.  In 1979 inflation was 13.2 per cent and Fianna Fáil granted short term social welfare increases of 12 per cent and 16 per cent for long term recipients from April.  There was a further increase of 6 per cent across the board in October 1979.  In 1980, inflation was 18.2 per cent and Fianna Fáil granted short term increases of 20 per cent and long term increases of 25 per cent from April with a 3 per cent increase across the board in October of 1980.  In 1981, inflation was 20.4 per cent and Fianna Fáil granted short term increases of 20 per cent and long term increases of 25 per cent from April of that year.  In 1982, inflation was 12.1 per cent and Fianna Fáil gave a 25 per cent increase across the board in April of that year.</P>
    <P>In 1983, we had the beginnings of the statistics which this Scrooge-like Government inflicted on the people.  Inflation was 10.4 per cent and they gave increases of 10 per cent short term and 12 per cent long term from July of that year with a 5 per cent increase for the long term unemployed in October of that year.  In 1984, inflation was 8.6 per cent and they gave short term 7 per cent and long term increases of 8 per cent from July of that year.  In 1985, inflation was 5.4 per cent and the Coalition gave increases of 6 per cent for short term and 6.5 per cent for long term from July of that year.  In 1986, our present inflation rate is 4.03 per cent and the Coalition have given increases for short term of 4 per cent and long term of 5 per cent from July of this year with no increase at all for child dependants. How could any responsible person state on examination of these figures that this Government have granted an increase of 40 per cent over a four year period?  The dishonesty of their statements on these statistics is clear and obvious.  Even though our present inflation rate is relatively low, it far exceeds that of most of <Col N="414" /> our contemporaries in Europe and one-third of it is again Government created.</P>
    <P>While the Government have presided over increasing the divide in the social standards of huge numbers of families, they have turned away from the consequences of such deprivation such as poverty, violence, emigration and many related health problems.  They have failed in their self-appointed task to create self-sustaining jobs.  They have failed to attempt to come to terms with our very complex and anomalous social welfare system which was simply not designed to cope with the present level of social welfare recipients and is buckling under the strain.</P>
    <P>They have dodged and ducked away from responding to the priorities in the report of the Commission on Social Welfare. Yet they used the commission's report for three years as an effective curtain to protect them from answering questions in relation to various problems in the social welfare area.</P>
    <P>The decisions on the implementation of the equality directive and the Christmas bonus are part of a long litany of failures by the Government on social and economic matters, reflecting their inability to appreciate the condition of the huge proportion of our population who have fallen within the poverty trap.</P>
    <P>The cuts in the Christmas bonus will gravely affect social welfare families with children, a particularly vulnerable group in society.  Christmas for the parents of such families is a nightmare.  The paraphernalia of materialism which now surrounds Christmas in this country exposes mercilessly the bleakness of their existence. They cannot afford shoes for their children, never mind toys.  The way they are forced to exist testifies to the gross inequalities in our community and, indeed, undermines the bonds of the community itself.</P>
    <P>The situation of these, the poorest in our society, is never more apparent than it is at Christmas time, a time when everyone, no matter what they do in life, no matter what their social status is, feels that this is a time of joy and happiness.</P>
    <P>The Christmas bonus introduced by <Col N="415" /> Fianna Fáil in 1980 provided a double payment for recipients of long term payments from the Departments of Health and Social Welfare, comprising some 378,000 persons and their 120,000 dependants, 498,000 persons in all.  It was introduced to provide such people with little extras during the season of goodwill. It can hardly be claimed as a major redistributionist step.  However, it provides a little extra money to certain recipients which enables them to provide a little momentary relief from their ordinary low and very basic standards of living. Their's is not a very exciting standard of living although some members of this callous Government would wish us to believe otherwise.</P>
    <P>Yet the Coalition seem unable to appreciate what this relatively minor measure can mean for half a million people.  They are now told they will receive just over half a payment as a bonus, instead of the 75 per cent which they received last year and the double payment which was available up to last year.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil, in this Private Members' motion, is giving the Government a chance to reverse their decision and give such families some little comfort at Christmas which most people feel they are entitled to.  If they fail to rescind this decision, enormous hardships will result for the old, for widows, the chronically ill, the long term unemployed and the disabled.  At the very least, the payment should be set at last year's level.</P>
    <P>On the question of the Government's ability to pay, it has been claimed that the reason for their decision to reduce the Christmas social welfare bonus was that the Cabinet were able to gather only 18 million in savings in other areas.  The Coalition should look again; the Minister should look within her own Department.</P>
    <P>The Dáil Committee of Public Accounts were informed last week, following the review of the 1984 accounts of the Minister's Department by the Comptroller and Auditor General, that savings of £130 million were made in her Department.  The committee learned that <Col N="416" /> checks by the Department on disability benefit claimants had, because of the introduction of extra medical referees succeeded in saving taxpayers more than £2.5 million per week.  It is reasonable to ask, therefore, why the Minister did not look within her own Department when searching for the money for the Christmas bonus.  If savings within her Department are anywhere near the figures reported to the Committee of Public Accounts, they would more than cover spending under the Christmas bonus scheme, not to mention the resources needed to aid families which are to lose out under the equality ruling.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister therefore, to rescind immediately her decision and to utilise that fraction of the reported savings within her Department which is necessary to restore the Christmas bonus to last year's level.  She should also give an undertaking to examine as a matter of urgency how savings within her Department might alleviate the hardships which is now affecting 20,000 low income families as a result of the equality legislation.</P>
    <P>It is not too late for the Minister to retrieve the dreadful situation she has created.  I accept the Minister is not alone in the creation of this dilemma and is not the only person responsible for what has been decided.  I accept that this has been a collective Cabinet decision and that the Minister is purely the mouthpiece for her colleagues who seem to have no interest in the old, the poor and the sick.  Has the Minister, or her colleagues, any knowledge of the needs of poor families at Christmas time?  Can they compare the standard of living of such families with the standard enjoyed by those who have jobs and are fortunate enough not to be sick or old?  Those people are fortunate to be able to buy the few extra benefits that help to make a happier Christmas. The Government seem to have lost touch with the reality that Christmas time is something different.  The Government have an obligation to provide for the most needy at Christmas.  The Government have coldly and callously failed to provide this extra money.  I appeal to the Minister <Col N="417" /> to retrieve the situation created by herself and the Government.</P>
    <P>It is possible for the Minister to use her position to ensure that no needy family suffers during the Christmas period.  The Minister has the power to decide whether it will be a happy or miserable period for thousands of welfare families and individuals. I ask the Minister to cast off the cold callous cloak of monetarism and act in the spirit of Christmas to ensure that the poorest section in our society does not suffer during the season of goodwill. I hope the Minister accepts the advice I have given her.  I recognise, following consultations with people in my constituency and with my colleagues in Fianna Fáil, that this is a matter of grave concern.  I have no doubt that the Minister is human, like the rest of us, and I accept she will respond to the advice given to her by this side of the House.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government have on numerous occasions suggested the need for cutbacks in public expenditure and the curtailment of expenditure but I cannot understand how a Government who have described themselves as a caring one can commence their cutbacks against the <Col N="418" /> weakest, the most deprived and defenceless sections of our community.  They are hitting at the 500,000 we have been told would benefit from this measure.  Many of those people live in my constituency. It is worth noting that in my constituency 12,000 people are unemployed, an increase of 3,000 in the past four years. Those people do not have any trade unions to defend them but at least they have the Fianna Fáil Party to fight on their behalf.  We will do our utmost to ensure that they get their rights and what they have been accustomed to since Fianna Fáil introduced the Christmas bonus.</P>
    <P>There was sufficient money for the ICC and Dublin Gas.  I have no doubt that if one picked up the loose change from the millions involved in those rescues one would find the £2.75 million needed to pay the less well off sections of the community the full bonus at Christmas time. Those people have been accustomed to getting that bonus and, like any other section of the community, cannot afford to take such a cut.  It must be remembered that the cut will be between 13 per cent and 14 per cent, an average of almost £5 per week.  The figure may not seem significant to those on the Government benches but it is significant to the poor people whose only income is a social welfare benefit.  A figure of £5 per week could change a hungry and lonely Christmas into a happy one for many families.  The Government should have learned from the mistake they made some weeks ago when the did not accept our amendment on the European directive.</P>
    <P>The people who will suffer as a result of the European directive are having their Christmas bonus reduced by the Government. How can families on an income of £120 per week be expected to exist on a reduction to £80 or £85 per week?  Would the Taoiseach or a Minister accept a reduction of 30 per cent in income?  There is no doubt they would not.  Why is it that the poorer sections of our community are being asked to accept a reduction of that size because of the European directive? <Col N="419" /> I have not met one person at my constituency clinics who will benefit under that directive and many of my constituents will take a drop of between £32 and £35 per week.  I wonder what the repercussions of this will be?</P>
    <P>The reduction in the Christmas bonus and the introduction of the European directive are nothing short of piracy, daylight robbery.  It amounts to robbing the poorer sections of our community to rectify some imbalances.  These cuts will hit hardest those sections who are weakest in the community.  Families have been horrified at this reduction.  Their lives have been changed from meagre subsistence to destitution.  I cannot understand how rural Deputies on the Government side can accept a reduction of 30 per cent in incomes because of the directives and a 14 per cent cut in the Christmas bonus.  If the teachers, the Garda and the Civil Service in general were faced with such reductions there would be a public outcry, and rightly so.  The community at large would be outraged and there would be open rebellion and revolt.</P>
    <P>These reductions are being made because the people affected are not in a position to protest.  Over the years, the Government have selected the poor, the weakest section of the community, for the hardest hit because they are not in a position to mount campaigns.  Those of us in the House who are in touch with reality and with our constituents who are looking forward to a sad Christmas this year will do our utmost to defend the poor and, we hope that those on the Government benches who have some humanity left in them will support the Fianna Fáil motion.</P>
    <P>This would have been severe enough if there had been a warning, but there has been no forewarning.  If the Government had forewarned when they were setting out budgetary strategy people might have been able to cushion the blow somehow, but this dastardly reduction in the run-up to Christmas is nothing short of contemptible. This is the action of a Scrooge mentality by an uncaring Government. <Col N="420" /> This Government took over the mantle of a caring Government and now we see them in their true colours.  Could they not have selected a better time of the year to reduce the meagre incomes of the poor?  At any time it would not have been acceptable, but the Government chose the worst time for the needy.  They stand indicated for their action.</P>
    <P>The Government imposed many severe measures in the past four years but this is the most heartless, the most inhumane.  Obviously, they are out of touch with reality.  Many of their backbenchers are in touch with reality but apparently they do not have an open door to Ministers to impress on them the necessity to provide sufficient assistance for the persons affected by these cuts &mdash; unmarried mothers, deserted wives, old age pensioners, pensioners on retirement, invalidity pensioners and long term unemployed.  They have suffered cutbacks in the past few years and cannot take any more.  At this time of year they must pay their water rates whether there is a waiver scheme in operation or not. They have suffered health cuts.  I can give examples of the effects of those cuts in south west Donegal.  They have no transport available and even if there was transport to take them out of the county to clinics in Derry, Sligo or Dublin they would have to pay for it.  They cannot do that and the result is that their health suffers.  They have suffered the effects of the VAT on clothes, increased VAT on fuel, the phasing out of the food subsidies, and though there was a saving of £10 million on the Estimate for Social Welfare last year, the Government could not find £2.7 million for those people.</P>
    <P>Where is the Government's social conscience? Where is the caring Government of which we have heard during the past four years?  In their dying days they are taking this terrible action.  They can find money for other purposes but not for those whom we have a duty to provide for.  Public representatives will be judged by the concern they show to those who need assistance.  Does the Minister feel that the repercussions of these cuts will go away, that there will not be political <Col N="421" /> effects?  Every household in the country will be affected.</P>
    <P>Those people want a change of Government, and on polling day we and the Government will be judged by our concern for the old, the sick, the needy and the unemployed.  The electorate expected more from this reputed caring Government, not alone from the conservative Fine Gael element but from Labour.  How can the Labour Junior Ministers go back to their constituents and say they represented this most defenceless sector in the community?</P>
    <P>Those people expected more from the Taoiseach who, when he accepted the reins of office, set out on a crusade to rid the country of hatred and bigotry.  We are now experiencing crucifixion at the hands of the Government at this most unfortunate time of the year when they are driving the final nail into the neediest people in the country.</P>

      <P>I announced last week that the Government had made available £18 million to pay in December this year a bonus to social welfare and health benefit recipients.  This is a considerable sum of money by any standards and particularly so given the great problems that Ireland faces on the public finances.  We all know about these pressures and the burden they are imposing on all the community.</P>

    <P>Let me make one thing clear at the outset &mdash; the bonus is not an item of expenditure that is provided for at the beginning of the year; it never has been. The Government, following a review of expenditure has been able to find, within the overall spending targets some £18 million to give a Christmas bonus to the <Col N="422" /> more needy sections of our community. As Minister for Social Welfare I was most anxious, as are the Government, to do the best we could for the weaker sections of the community.</P>
    <P>Let there be no doubt about it, the Government would like to have made more available but the economic facts are that the money is simply not there and these are facts that people have to be prepared to face up to.  Consequently, I believe firmly that it is incumbent on anyone who calls for additional resources to say where the resources should come from.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCarthy referred to discussions at the committee on public accounts where reference was made to savings arising as a result of increased medical control on the disability scheme. This Government have increased the number of medical referees in the disability benefits area and have taken measures to improve the controls which operate in that scheme.  These measures are bearing fruit and we can be satisfied with that fact.  However, it is not true that the savings which these measures are bringing about are available for expenditure on the Christmas bonus.  These savings were taken into account and built into the Estimate for disability benefit at the outset of the year.  Deputy McCarthy should check his facts before making such statements.</P>
    <P>It is easy to say that such and such should be done at a cost of so much &mdash; it has popular appeal.  However, when it comes to financing these measures either by reducing expenditure in other areas or by increasing taxation or borrowing, which in itself, it must be recognised, is just another form of taxation, there always seems to be a deafening silence. This Government have the courage to face up to these challenges and not to shirk their duties or obligations.  Our responsibility entails the control of spending.  To spend further beyond our capacity would have a negative impact on those already in employment and paying taxes, and ultimately on those dependent on social welfare.  The populist strategy of more spending is a short-sighted one <Col N="423" /> which erodes the very foundations on which we have to build.</P>
    <P>When considering any additional expenditure on social welfare, account must be taken of the enormous budget and the demographic and economic pressures that have driven the expenditure up over the last number of years. These factors will remain with us for the foreseeable future.  The total number of people and their dependants receiving social welfare payments of various kinds each week is now about 1.3 million or about 38 per cent of the total population. This year the Government have had to find £2.5 billion to finance the social welfare services and this is now the largest single bloc of Government expenditure, and is running at about 27 per cent of total gross current expenditure.  The overall annual spending is equivalent to almost £7 million per day for each day of the year.  There has been an increase of 50 per cent in total social welfare expenditure in the four years since the Government took office.</P>
    <P>The economic and financial pressures within which we are operating are very relevant to these calls for further expenditure. It has been said before, and we must continue to emphasise it, that we are, as a country, at a crossroads.  It is not always recognised that all public expenditure is funded at the margin by borrowing.  Due to events of the past, we are carrying on our back a huge legacy of debt.  This legacy has had, and will continue to have, for many years serious adverse effects on our ability to generate economic growth and employment.</P>
    <P>It is an inescapable fact that the increase in public expenditure generally in the last ten to 15 years &mdash; far beyond our national resources to finance it &mdash; has been a major cause of our present economic and unemployment problems. This year, interest on debt will absorb £9 out of every £10 paid in PAYE taxation.</P>
    <P>If, in the past four years, we had not had to pay interest on accumulated debt our taxes would not merely have provided enough to cover current spending, but would have left us with the best part <Col N="424" /> of £2,000 million available with which to fight unemployment, to cut taxes, to build up our country, and to tackle the many problems of disadvantage that remain unresolved.  To stop this self imposed burden growing further we must control public expenditure.  This we have done, but much more is required of us now.</P>
    <P>Each year since this Government came into office we have kept our budgets on or close to target, with the aim of ensuring that, despite the unpredictability of the external economic environment, the ultimate budget deficit would not deviate significantly from the planned level.  This we achieved, in each of the last few years, with considerable difficulty, in stark contrast to Fianna Fáil's lazy and cowardly laxity.  Fianna Fáil gave bonuses, without any budgetary provision for them, and instead of finding savings to finance them they slapped more burdens on the taxpayer, increased the deficit and increased the burden on the taxpayer.  This year, in controlling our expenditure, we have had unforeseeable problems which have thrown us slightly off course, including international financial movements which were beyond our control, and two disastrous summers for the crucial agricultural sector.  I would like to take up a point that Deputy Gallagher made about ICI.  Deputy Gallagher should know that ICI have received no taxpayers' money. The administration is being supported by the banking sector and the Central Bank, and the taxpayer and the social welfare recipient have reason to thank the Government for finding a way of dealing with this problem that does not affect their weekly income.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>In spite of all those pressures the Government have still managed to find those resources to pay a Christmas bonus to the same increased categories of social welfare recipients this year as last year and because of the seriousness of the budgetary situation and the Government's concern not to contribute any further to the debt burden it was <Col N="425" /> necessary for us to look for savings across the various Departmental Votes in order to be able to give a high level of Christmas bonus to those people who are in most need and who, on the basis of practice in previous years would naturally have been expecting it.</P>
      <P>One category which was always excluded for the Christmas bonus was the long term unemployed and last year, for the first time, the Government decided to include them.  This meant obviously a very big increase in the numbers of people who would get the bonus and it was decided to pay 75 per cent of the normal weekly payment across the board with the resources that were then available. This decision was motivated by a desire to extend some additional financial help to the long term unemployed, a group which this Government have already helped through the introduction of regular special increases in their rates of unemployment assistance since October 1983.</P>
      <P>Again last year we had statements from people saying that the bonus was being reduced but they ignored the fact that about 112,000 extra people were included.  Last year if a full week's payment had been made it would have cost £7 million in addition to the over £20 million that was made available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This year the cost of providing the bonus is £18 million.  To make a bonus payment on the same basis as last year would cost over £3 million extra.  I have certainly no desire to exclude any category previously included in order to provide a higher bonus for some categories. The only course open to us is to distribute the amount available as fairly as possible and I am particularly concerned that the long term unemployed should still be included in the categories eligible for the bonus payment.  We should look at some examples of what this would mean to the recipients.  Take the case of an elderly couple who are getting £87.55 a week. During the first week in December they will get a total payment of £144.45.  Last year in respect of the same week this couple would have received a total payment of £147.35.  In other words, their <Col N="426" /> total payment this year, including the Christmas bonus, is almost the same as last year's total.  In fact, this year's Christmas bonus of £56.90 for them is about 90 per cent of the bonus they received last year.</P>
    <P>A couple without children living on long term unemployment assistance will receive a total payment of £104.20 during the first week in December.  Their normal weekly rate would be £63.15.  This represents a bonus of £41.05.  Their total payment for the first week in December will be almost the same as they received in the same week last year.</P>
    <P>These examples illustrate the extent of this year's bonus in absolute terms and it can be seen that quite significant additional sums will be paid to some people.  Obviously, people with families &mdash; these are mentioned by Deputy McCarthy &mdash; will receive a bigger bonus &mdash; the size of bonus will depend on the size of the family.  For example, a couple living on invalidity pension and with three children will receive a bonus of £71 on the basic payment of £109.20 per week. An unemployed person, married with two children, will receive a bonus of £53.15 on a basic payment of £81.75 per week.  Of course, the bonus is payable in respect of dependants and they number more than 330,000.  Therefore, a total of half a million recipients will be receiving the bonus payment.  The amounts are substantial and I am sure they will help greatly towards the inevitable costs associated with Christmas.  It is quite clear from the example I have given that they are by no means the drastic diminutions decried by the Opposition.  The bottom line is that recipients will have very nearly the same amount of bonus in cash terms this year as last year.  I believe that the bonus is meeting the objectives of giving families who are dependent on social welfare a cash injection at a time of traditionally high expenditure.</P>
    <P>As I said, naturally I would like to have announced a higher level of bonus.  I do not believe that anybody in this House would not, but there is no point in deluding ourselves.  Any rational person <Col N="427" /> must realise that we cannot spend what is not there.</P>
    <P>When we are talking about increases like this we must take into account the increases in social welfare payments over the last few years.  Obviously, social welfare recipients who live in what is a relatively affluent society have very special needs at a time like Christmas.  All of us Deputies are very active, I am sure, at our constituency clinics and we all deal greatly with a great many social welfare recipients.  I make no apology for this Government's record, which I believe is a proud one, since 1982 in redressing some of the difficulties that these people, as we all know, have suffered.</P>
    <P>In the 1984 and 1985 budgets the special position of the long term unemployed was again recognised by the provision of higher increases than those granted to social welfare recipients generally. Again, in July 1986 when the rates were increased by 4 per cent generally the long term unemployed got an increase of 5 per cent.  These increases are ahead of the estimated inflation rate over the relevant period from July 1986 to July 1987, and this represents a real increase in payments again this year.</P>
    <P>In the period from June 1983 to July 1986 social welfare benefits have increased by 30 per cent for short term recipients, 33 per cent for long term recipients and 40 per cent for the long term unemployed.  These increases represent very considerable real improvements in benefit levels for that period. Those real increases are of the order of 6.5 per cent for short term payments, nearly 9 per cent for long term payments and 14.5 per cent for the most hard pressed group, the long term unemployed.</P>
    <P>I have no time for the type of claims made here last week and again today about Fianna Fáil Government's increases in social welfare.  When viewed in the light of the very high levels of inflation at that time those rates and increases were not at all as spectacular as has been implied.  However, I think that all Governments have tried year in and <Col N="428" /> year out to do the very best they can for social welfare recipients.</P>
    <P>I will turn to the question which has been raised also in this House during this debate, the question of the equality Directive and the difficulties in its implementation, difficulties caused not least by the complexities of the Irish social welfare system.  On Wednesday last, as all Deputies will be aware, the Government announced that they intended to review the provisions for implementing equal treatment in the course of the current discussions of the 1987 Estimates.  As people generally will be aware, the Cabinet met over the weekend to discuss those Estimates and a considerable amount of time was spent in discussing the difficulties relating to equal treatment and the best approach to deal with the problems, while conscious of the obligation on us to stay within the terms of the EC Directive which is very specific. Perhaps it would be as well if I reiterated some fundamental principles relationg to this matter.</P>
    <P>The question of equal treatment became an issue in the first instance because women were being treated less favourably than men under the social welfare code.  The inevitable consequence of equalising treatment was that most would gain, whereas a much smaller number would lose.  Obviously, our concern is for those who have suffered loss because in the nature of things there are no complaints from those 46,000 families who have gained.  Having discussed the matter at length, I can inform the House that the Government have decided to provide significant reliefs for those who have lost from the implementation of the equal treatment provision.  Payments will be made before Christmas and the cost will be borne from further savings which have been identified.</P>
    <P>Briefly, the following are the measures being taken.  The first situation relates to a married couple with the husband on social welfare benefit and his wife working and earning more than £50 per week. Under the equal treatment provisions the husband would lose the adult dependant allowance for his wife plus half the child <Col N="429" /> dependency increases.  The new measures will provide for the restoration of full child dependency increases and in addition a weekly allowance of £10 will be paid.</P>
    <P>The second broad category involved is where both husband and wife are receiving social welfare payments. This group numbers about 8,000.  In consequence of the equal treatment provisions, the husband would lose the adult dependant allowance for his wife.  Provision has already been made for a compensatory payment of £10 in these cases and a further £10 a week will now be paid for these people.  We all have been concerned about families who stood to lose significant amounts, particularly where a spouse is in low paid employment.  These measures will reduce these considerably, especially for those with larger families. I will be issuing full details of the new measures tomorrow.</P>

      <P>In closing, let me revert to the discussion which is the kernel of this debate, the question of control of Government spending.  Unless we face up to the difficult decisions across the whole spectrum of Government expenditure, then &mdash; let me emphasise what all Deputies, particularly Deputies on the other side of the House should recognise &mdash; we will do the severest harm to the very people we all have the greatest concern for.</P>

Every move to control spending or to make reductions in any area at all in spending is opposed vehemently by Fianna Fáil and The Workers' Party.  It is however a job for Government, the job we were elected to do and will be elected to do again in 1987.</P>

      <P>We are elected to decide what is right and fair.  The issue of the Christmas bonus is a case in point where in the context of enormous real increases in social welfare expenditure by the taxpayer we must make a decision which does not diminish in any substantial way the position of the social welfare recipient. No one suggests that these choices are easy but the seriousness of the situation is such that they have to be made. They are always difficult.  Is it too much to hope that Fianna Fáil could for a moment be honest on the subject and recognise the strides that have been made and take a responsible attitude in the national interest?  We hear the Opposition, particularly the leader of the Opposition, expounding to businessmen about his serious view of the national finances and his determination that we deal with them.  For as long as I have been a Minister in this Government the Opposition leader has led the cause for more and more spending.</P>

      <P>I have pleasure in supporting this motion proposed by Deputy McCarthy and I call on the Minister to rescind her decision in relation to the payment of the Christmas bonus at a reduced rate.  I was amazed to hear the Minister announce that they were increasing the benefits in the EC directive by another £10 per week.  It is obvious the Minister had to pay heed to the appeals of our Deputies and Deputies supporting <Col N="433" /> the Government.  I am satisfied that the Minister came under a great deal of pressure as a result of the meeting in Tallaght last night.  During her contribution, the Minister said that it is important to check the facts.  Had the Minister been in Tallaght last night the facts would have been made known to her.  I represent the people of Tallaght and of Clondalkin among whom there are large numbers of unemployed in receipt of social welfare benefit.  The meeting last night was attended by about 400 people who made known their frustrations and disenchantment with the Government and the Minister for Social Welfare.  During the discussion here on the EC directive some of the Deputies opposite said that no one would quibble about losing a few pounds from their weekly allowances. The people of Tallaght and Clondalkin and throughout the country will quibble when it is made known that they could lose up to £50 a week.  I am satisfied that the Minister's announcement tonight is as a result of pressure brought about by the Government Deputies who attended the meeting last night.</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil introduced the Christmas bonus.  The present Government reduced the payment of the bonus last year and have decided to reduce it further this year.  Is this not an indication of the policy pursued by Fine Gael in the past when they reduced the old age pension?  We are reaching that stage again.  This is the second year in which the Christmas bonus has been reduced.  I call on the Minister to change her mind.  If she was able to change her mind about the EC directive it is possible to change her mind about the Christmas bonus.  As Deputy McCarthy said, people should be in a position to enjoy Christmas and they should be in a position to enjoy the benefit afforded them since 1983 by the Fianna Fáil Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During a number of visits by the Taoiseach to the Tallaght area he spoke about his and his Government's care for the people of Tallaght.  Are the decisions of the past few weeks an indication of how the Government and the Taoiseach care for the people of Tallaght?  Some few <Col N="434" /> weeks ago as a result of a directive issued by the Minister for the Environment the people living in local authority houses had their weekly rents increased by a considerable sum.  There are many local authority houses in Tallaght and Clondalkin. Last week their social welfare benefits were reduced by £30 to £50. Now, as a result of the Government decision and the decision of the Minister, the Christmas bonus will be reduced this year.  We are told that in the new year repayments on loans will be increased again.  Does this indicate the Government's concern for the people of Tallaght and Clondalkin?</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the £7 million per day spent on social welfare benefits. There is one way of reducing that amount and that is by making some effort to create more employment.  Lack of employment is the cause of so many people being in receipt of social welfare benefits.  Week after week the Government's policies have resulted in more people on the dole.  The Government are largely responsible for the plight of the people of Tallaght and Clondalkin because they have made no effort to develop employment in those areas.  The numbers on the unemployment register are increasing in spite of the fact the the Taoiseach said he cared about the people in Tallaght and Clondalkin.  Is it any wonder that we had such numbers at the meeting in Tallaght last night.  They came to air their views and to vent their feelings in relation to the policies pursued by the Government and the Minister for Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>I am quite satisfied that, as a result of the views aired last night, the Minister decided to increase social welfare benefit by a further £10.  As a result of the decisions over the past few weeks in regard to rent increases, the reduction in social welfare benefits and the Christmas bonus, it will be a sad and lonely festive season for many people.  How would the Minister and members of the Government feel if their weekly salaries were reduced by £30, £40 or £50?  Someone on the Government side asked who would quibble with the reduction of a few <Col N="435" /> pounds but there is a very big difference between a few pounds and £40 or £50.</P>
    <P>I asked the Minister, even at this late stage, to rescind her decision in so far as the Christmas bonus is concerned.  She should do this before the debate ends and, if possible, she should pay a double week which was introduced by the Fianna Fáil Government in 1980 and paid again in 1981.</P>

Will these changes be substantial?  When they come into effect?  It is very difficult to debate these issues when the Minister keeps changing her line.</P>
      <P>In his excellent speech, Deputy McCarthy detailed very clearly the effect of what has happened over a long period. The Minister made a number of conflicting statements.  Deputy McCarthy has done good work in recent days explaining the changes in social welfare although it is the Minister's job to do so. Today, as Lord Mayor, I had the pleasure of turning on the Christmas lights.  People showed me letters they had received from the Department outlining devastating cuts in their welfare benefits.  Members of this House have heard how their constituents spend the small sums of money they receive and it is unbelievable to hear how they manage.  I should like to know on what these figures are based because the lowest paid seem to be hit harder than those on higher benefits.  I met two people today in almost the exact same financial circumstances and one had been cut by £38 while the other had suffered a loss of £28.  The Minister has failed to explain what is happening and it would be in everybody's interest to know the truth. From a speech made by the Minister a few weeks ago it appears that the money is not available from cutbacks in other Departments but the Committee on Public Expenditure pointed out last week that departmental inspectors had saved money on disability benefits.</P>

      <P>I accept that but a few months ago the Minister announced that she was investigating a number of areas which would yield substantial savings. The equality Act seems to be hitting the wrong people.  Possibly some people could take a slight cut in social welfare but widows, unemployed and those who are ill will be devastated.  I know inflation is low but extra expenses at this time of the year put a great strain on the household budget.  I have just come from a meeting of the Lord Mayor's coal fund and even the most hardhearted person would be depressed by reading the letters sent in.  It is quite obvious that some of them are genuine and when you go through them you quickly see which are genuine and which are not.</P>
      <P>There are other schemes where money has not been spent.  To give one example, the Department of the Environment introduced a scheme of grants last April. One of the conditions of that scheme was that the money had to be spent by 31 December.  About £500,000 to £600,000 worth of projects, that I know of from Dublin Corporation, have not even started.  Did that money go back to the Department of the Environment?  No, it did not.  They chased around looking for other schemes which had no chance of being finished by Christmas, never mind by Christmas of next year.  They reallocated the money with letters of good news going here, there and everywhere.  That is happening every day of the week in Government Departments.  We have one Minister sitting at the Cabinet table saying he is not going to pay out that money but is going to redirect it here, there and everywhere, while the Minister for Social Welfare asks if she can have £3 million&mdash;&mdash;</P>

If the Government are sincere and have any concern for the unemployed, the poor, the disabled and widows they would find that £3 million. Perhaps there is some other reason they cannot do it but I do not accept that they are concerned about U-turns at this stage.  The Minister must feel she is in about twentieth place because in recent days she has changed her mind so many times.  It takes us all our time on this side to keep up with her latest statements.</P>

      <P>I have a series of questions about equality but not having heard all of the Minister's speech I will not go into them.  It was quite clear from the Budget Statement that in 1986 the Government would maintain social welfare at the same levels which applied in 1985 with small adjustments.  If that is so, was provision made in the Estimates to pay 75 per cent as against 64 per cent?  If not, why was it not pointed out at that stage?</P>

I recall in 1982, at this time of the year, when we were being thrown out of office we were maintaining <Col N="438" /> the living standards of the poor.  The reason we lost the Private Members' vote at that time was that the Opposition wanted us to nationalise a towel factory. They were trying for force us to put about £30 million into nationalising a high quality towel factory.</P>

There has been no improvement in either budget's or benefits since 1982.  It can be argued from the figures in the Minister's statement that there has been a cutback in real terms.</P>

This is extremely hard to do because of the high levels of unemployment in the country and the bad business climate.  For the organisations who are doing so much work in the voluntary field the Christmas bonus is a major incentive because it takes some pressure off families who have to come back to them on an annual basis.  It allows the organisations to spend more money on toys.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. D. Andrews Mr. D. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ask the Minister for the Environment to bring forward as a matter of priority in the national road plan the construction of the south-east section of the motorway which would connect the end of the southern cross route at Sandyford to the Shankill by-pass and thus obviate expenditure of public moneys unnecessarily on major widening of existing local roads in the Leopardstown, Foxrock and Carrickmines area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="441" /> This is an issue of major concern in these areas and also the green route, as it is described in official circles, as well as various road widening proposals.  The cross route will be a motorway and will form part of the western ring road around Dublin.  It will link the Naas road, the Galway road, the Navan road and eventually the Belfast road and should be the major traffic route around Dublin, cutting out any need for motorists to attempt shortcuts through residential areas.</P>
    <P>People in the Leopardstown, Foxrock and Carrickmines area are seriously concerned at the present proposals as they may affect the quiet enjoyment of their homes.  The cross route as a motorway will come to a halt on the Leopardstown side of the Central Bank in Sandyford. It will then become a dual carriageway, based on a previously approved council plan, as far as the junction of Brewery Road with Leopardstown Road.</P>
    <P>In a recent letter to Dublin County Council the Department of the Environment approved the southern cross route and the green route proposals, with some general modifications, one of which was the presumption that the dual carriageway would be continued down Leopardstown Road as far as White's Cross.  We in the Fianna Fáil Party in the constituency of Dún Laoghaire are opposed to this as we believe it would completely destroy the residential character of the area.  We are concerned that all these proposals together will result in an increase in through traffic in residential areas along roads which could not hope to accommodate such traffic. For example, traffic on the southern cross in the Sandyford vicinity, near where the cross route is intended to end, is projected at 68,000 vehicle movements per day.  Where are all these vehicles going when they come off the southern cross? Many of them will continue down the proposed dual carriageway on Leopardstown Road, presumably on to side roads along the way, including the widened Ballyogan Road but where will they go after that?  Can you picture traffic winding its way down Ballyogan Road on to <Col N="442" /> Glenamuck Road and then down Cornelscourt Hill Road or Brennanstown Road or Brighton Road on to roads never intended or designed for large traffic volume or coming down Leopardstown Road with the prospect of turning off into Brewery Road down Leopardstown Avenue or on to Torquay Road, also roads not intended for such through traffic movements?</P>
    <P>We believe the solution to this traffic distribution problem is for the Government to bring forward as a priority the south-east arm motorway which would connect directly from the Sandyford end of the southern cross route across open countryside to the proposed Shankill bypass. The south-eastern motorway is not currently listed in the Department of the Environment's list of major priority road plans.  In my view, not all of this motorway is required.  It is scheduled to run from Foster's Avenue down through Kilmacud to the link area at Sandyford.  We in the constituency party do not consider this to be necessary.</P>
    <P>The southern cross route has been altered.  Under the original plan the route would have passed through mainly non-residential areas to meet the Dublin-Bray road at Loughlinstown.  Unfortunately the route proposed by the Coalition is planned to go through high density residential areas to meet the Dublin-Bray road at White's Cross.  I will outline very briefly to the House the proposed Coalition plan.  Leopardstown Road would be upgraded to take traffic to and from Dún Laoghaire port.  It would join a new major roundabout at the top of Brewery Road.  Brewery Road would be a major treeless road carrying traffic from the south city and Dún Laoghaire from the Naas road, the Galway road, the north-west and even the north.  All this traffic would pass through Leopardstown and surrounding areas.  Traffic bottlenecks in the city would be transferred to the road system radiating from White's Cross. Westminster-Torquay Road would have through traffic from Bray and the south-east heading for industrial estates in Dublin south, west and north.  The triangle of roads, Brewery, New Upper <Col N="443" /> Leopardstown, Westminster-Torquay will, according to our submission, become one of the biggest traffic systems in Dublin.  Traffic encroachment into this area will mean the possible loss of life and the possibility of serious injury to school-going children.  I would point out that 700 young children live in the Leopardstown area alone.  Other problems would be air pollution, traffic noise, lead, vibration and general visual intrusion which will harm our environment.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil in the Dún Laoghaire constituency want the original plan restored and, in common with the Fianna Fáil councillors, I will be fighting to see that this is done.  Otherwise the results of the latest plan will be catastrophic for the residents of Leopardstown, Foxrock and related areas.  I hope I have made the House aware of how serious the issue is for this area.  We will be fighting with the support of the Fianna Fáil councillors, the local residents' associations and the families in that area to have this latest plan rescinded in favour of the original one to prevent the infliction of such dire consequences on this community.</P>
    <P>On 11 November 1986 I put down a parliamentary question to the Minister for the Environment.  I asked him if he would provide traffic flow count details and projections in respect of the southern cross route and the green route at various junction points along both routes, when such projections were made and how they might compare if updated.  The Minister responded as follows:</P>
    <P>The construction of the southern cross route (including the green route) was recommended in the 1971 Dublin Transportation Study as part of the proposed Dublin Ring Road.  I understand that the board traffic flow projections, prepared in 1971, are at present being refined and updated by the local authority in conjunction with the preparation of a motorway scheme/ compulsory purchase order for the route.</P>
    <P>In raising the matter I should like to <Col N="444" /> pay particular tribute to a Fianna Fáil councillor in the area who has been leading the campaign for the withdrawal of the Coalition plan in favour of the original Fianna Fáil proposal.  The man I refer to is Councillor Edward MacDonald. Some time ago on radio Councillor MacDonald outlined in his articulate fashion his objections to the Coalition proposals for the southern cross route.  He said that if the southern cross route passes through these areas great harm will be done to the environment.  People who know the area will appreciate that Leopardstown Road takes traffic for residential areas off that thoroughfare. When the residents of Leopardstown, Foxrock.  Carrickmines and other areas were buying their homes, they did not envisage that they would be involved in the proposals which are at present contemplated.</P>
    <P>I am asking the Minister and the Government to revert to the original Fianna Fáil plan for a number of reasons: first, that the people concerned will have quiet enjoyment in their homes, second that the mothers and children in the area will have safe passage to and from the different schools and third, that the people will have peace, quiet and harmony in their day to day lives.</P>
    <P>I will quote from a meeting of the Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown district committee of 10 September 1986, Item No. 11:</P>
    <P>Southern Cross Route/Green Route</P>
    <P>
      <i>Question:</i> Councillor E. McDonald.</P>
    <P>To ask the Manager to clarify precisely what is the current position regarding the Southern Cross Route/ Green Route along the Leopardstown Road Line, particularly that section of Leopardstown Road from the Brewery Road junction down to White's Cross, noting in particular the following points:</P>
    <P> (a)  the Minister's letter to the Council some months ago,</P>
    <P>(b) the discussion at Committee meetings regarding suggestions/proposals <Col N="445" /> for widening Leopardstown Road.</P>
    <P>(c)  the Committee's agreement to seeking a meeting with the Minister to discuss the various proposals in the above matter and the bringing forward of the South-East motorway? </P>
    <P>The following report was before the Meeting on 14th May 1986:</P>
    <P> 1.  Southern Cross Route.</P>
    <P>The Council has approved proposals for the Southern Cross Route from the Tallaght Road to Sandyford Road. These proposals provide for a two by two dual carriageway with interchanges at Balrothery, Scholarstown and Ballinteer with slip lanes at Sandyford Road.  A motorway scheme under the Local Government (Roads and Motorways) Act, 1974, is being prepared and it is expected that the executive order will be made by the end of this year it is hoped that contract documents will be finalised by September 1989.</P>
    <P>2.  Green Route.</P>
    <P>In addition to the Southern Cross Route proposals the Council also approved a scheme for the Green Route from Grange Road to Leopardstown Road.  This scheme comprises an all purpose dual carriageway from Grange Road to the roundabout at Brewery Road and modest improvements to the Leopardstown Roads. </P>
    <P>I do not want to cast doubt on the report, but there seemed to be serious implications there, and not only in response to Councillor McDonald raising the issue at that meeting.  Maybe the Minister will take account of the various points and issues raised by me at the request of Councillor McDonald.</P>
    <P>Another important feature is that here we have Councillor McDonald, a member of a local authority, bringing to the attention of a Member of our national Parliament a fundamental proposition which would change the lives of a large segment of the community in south <Col N="446" /> County Dublin.  This is true democracy at work: the local authority discussed the matter, it was then brought into Dáil Éireann and discussed here on behalf of that group.</P>
    <P>The people in these areas are seriously concerned because they bought their houses believing they could quietly enjoy their homes, but they are now presented with the prospect of huge volumes of traffic in areas where such traffic was never envisaged.  Those who know the area well realise that places like Torquay Road, Brighton Road, Westminster Road, Brewery Road and Carrickmines Road, will be adversely affected by the plan proposed by the Government.  We find that unacceptable and we hope the Minister in her wisdom, or unwisdom as the case may be, will provide satisfactory answers to the queries I have raised.</P>
    <P>Leopardstown Road is beautifully tree lined and relatively safe as regards road traffic, and it would be a great tragedy and an act of environmental vandalism if this road were interfered with and made into a dual carriageway.  We think such development is unnecessary and is an intrusion into the lives of the people living in the area.  We also think it is an intrusion of the environment.</P>
    <P>I am greatful to you, a Cheann Comhairle, for allowing me to raise this matter and bring it to the attention of the House. As I said, this is part of the democratic process where, on the ground, there are the local councillors who, like myself, know the problems in the area, articulate them at local authority level and then, I, as a Deputy representing the constituency of Dún Laoghaire, bring them to the attention of the House, and of the Government in particular.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. A. Doyle)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have this opportunity to report to the House on the progress being made in the developments of the southern cross route.  This route is one of 54 major road schemes which were listed in the Government's 1985 road plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Southern Cross Route was recommended in the Dublin Transportation <Col N="447" /> Study of 1971 as part of a wide network of roads to be provided in the Dublin area.  Following protracted discussions, approval in principle issued in 1978 for the southern cross route and the local authority were advised to proceed with detailed planning of the route.  The alignment of the route proposed by Dublin County Council was approved by my Department in May of this year, without prejudice to any statutory procedures that might arise.  The preparation of detailed plans for the route is now a matter for the local authority.  The local authority are at present preparing a motorway scheme and a compulsory purchase order in respect of the route.</P>
    <P>I would like to make it quite clear that the development of this scheme is primarily a matter for the local authority concerned.  I venture to suggest that Councillor McDonald's views, which were referred to by the Deputy in the House, should have been listened to in that forum.  Any changes proposed by the local authority and subsequently sanctioned by the Department of the Environment would have been, I understand, previously sanctioned by the councillors in their forum &mdash; as the Deputy says, true local democracy in action.</P>
    <P>The intention of the local authority is to provide a dual carriageway motorway from the Firhouse Road at Tallaght across to Ballinteer.  The section from Ballinteer to White's Cross, which is known as the green route, will not be a motorway and the local authority are preparing a compulsory purchase order in respect of this section.</P>
    <P>When the motorway scheme and compulsory purchase order are made by the local authority they will have to be submitted to the Minister for the Environment for approval.  In accordance with the provisions of the Local Government (Roads and Motorways) Act, 1974, a public local inquiry must be held into all matters relating to a motorway scheme before it can be approved.  If objections are raised in respect of the compulsory purchase order, a public inquiry must also be held in that case.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="448" /> Reference has been made to local opposition to the proposed line of the route, particularly the green route section.  As I have already said, there will be a public local inquiry and this will present a forum for all interested bodies to make their views known and all objections or representations will be fully considered before a decision on the motorway scheme and compulsory purchase order is taken.</P>
    <P>The suggestion is also being put forward that the south-east motorway to Loughlinstown could be provided as an alternative to the green route.  The south-east motorway is a separate proposal and could not be regarded as an alternative to the section of the southern cross route linking to White's Cross.  Both the southern cross/green route and the south-east motorway are seen as necessary but the timing of the start of the latter road cannot be estimated at this stage.</P>
    <P>Deputy D. Andrews is also pressing to have the south-east motorway, from Fosters Avenue to Loughlinstown, built in conjunction with the southern cross/green route.  Having regard to the vast State expenditure in recent years on the improvement of the existing Bray Road, which roughly parallels the south-east motorway route, I am satisfied that the development of the south-east motorway to Loughlinstown should await the completion of the southern cross/green route and an analysis of the traffic pattern which may emerge.</P>
    <P>On the question of finance for the route, I can emphatically reject any suggestion that the road will be held up due to lack of funds.  Our record in the roads area is one of achievement.  The 1985 road plan set out a detailed programme of works for the period 1985-1987 and a tentative programme for the period from 1988 up to the mid-1990s. Fianna Fáil, when in Government, also published a road plan.  The test of the worth of any plan is, however, the availability of the funds necessary to achieve its objectives.  This is where the two plans differ.  In the first year of the 1979 road plan, the then Government saw fit to provide only 66 per cent of the funds <Col N="449" /> promised.  By the end of the second year this figure had reached 73 per cent.  On the other hand, in the first two years of the new road plan of this Government, 99 per cent of the funds promised have been provided.</P>
    <P>This Government's provision for roads is far in excess of anything provided by any previous Government.  The 1986 allocation alone is 65 per cent greater in real terms than the average for the years 1979 <Col N="450" /> to 1982.  As regards the southern cross route, grants totalling £1 million have already been notified to Dublin County Council and further grant assistance will be made available as necessary.  It is my intention that construction work will commence on the route in 1988.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 26 November 1986.</P>

      <P>As I informed the Dáil on 23 October I have personally raised the cases of the Birmingham Six, the Guildford Four, and Annie Maguire and her family with the British Home Secretary and my understanding is that all these cases are currently under review within the Home Office.  It remains my hope that positive action will be taken on these cases.  I have taken advantage of all appropriate opportunities to make my concern about these cases known to the British authorities both in my direct contacts with the Home Secretary and through the Embassy in London and I will continue to do so.</P>
      <P>Under Article 25 of the European Convention on Human Rights, the Commission on Human Rights may receive petitions from anyone claiming to be victims of a violation of the rights guaranteed by the convention.  It is accordingly open to all those involved in these cases to initiate proceedings should their lawyers advise that such action would be appropriate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Boland) Minister for the Environment (Mr. Boland)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision and operation of traffic lights in the Dublin area is a matter for the individual road authorities, subject to the consent, or at the direction, of the Dublin Transport Authority.  In the Dublin area, a substantial measure of traffic lights synchronisation has already been provided by Dublin Corporation in the Central Dublin area with computer-linked signals in a system known as Urban Traffic Control (UTC).  The UTC system has been developed under the auspices of the Dublin Transportation Task Force, which was the non-statutory precursor of the Dublin Transport Authority.  Since 1982, the cost of the system has been fully financed by State grants paid by the Department of Communications.  Outside the area covered by the UTC system, the scope for traffic light synchronisation is limited having regard to factors such as the type and volume of traffic and the frequency of junctions.  I understand, however, that Dublin County Council has already provided a partially synchronised system of traffic lights on sections of a number of routes, including the Naas, Bray, Lucan and Blessington Roads.</P>
      <P>Under section 35 (2) of the Transport Authority Act, 1986, which came into operation on 12 November 1986, the Authority is obliged, in the performance of its functions in relation to traffic signs, to have regard to the need for a proper system of traffic signs in its functional area.  It is, therefore, a matter for the Authority to consider, in consultation with the road authorities concerned, the adequacy or otherwise of traffic signs, including traffic lights, already provided or proposed to be provided in its functional area.</P>

    <P>This shows that while the actual fare level from Dublin to London (Heathrow) is the cheapest of the three routes, the fare level from Dublin expressed on a per mile basis is in fact the most expensive.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy will know, I have critically examined all airline fare proposals which have been put to me for consideration and I have intervened to refuse fare increases where I judged them to be excessive.  In this context, I am happy to report that the current executive class and superapex fares form Cork and Shannon to London are now lower by about 5 per cent and 38 per cent respectively in real terms than the equivalent executive and apex fares were in January 1983.  I understand that at the present time, Cork and Shannon Airports are experiencing very large increases in traffic to London as a result of the lower fares now on offer.</P>
    <P>I have also been prepared to allow competition in fare levels among airlines on routes to London.  For instance, on the Cork-London (Gatwick) route, Dan-Air recently secured my approval to introduce a new low pex fare of £119. This has less restrictive booking conditions than the standard pex fare of £157 on offer from Aer Lingus-British Airways. Dan-Air also have my approval for economy and Eurobudget fares of £218 and £190 respectively, which are lower than the corresponding executive class and budget fares of £240 and £212 respectively on offer from Aer Lingus and British Airways.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="307" /> So the Deputy will see that there is now keener competition than ever before and it is my intention to continue to pursue cheaper sustainable fares on all routes in and out of Ireland.  Moreover, I will be seeking the establishment of more and more routes in and out of this country.  This objective is being addressed, for instance, in our bilateral discussions with other countries and in the stance I have taken at the Council of Ministers (Transport) of the EC.</P>

      <P>The invalidity pension in payment <Col N="313" /> to the person concerned included an increase of £30.60 in respect of his wife as an adult dependant up to 19 November 1986.  His wife is receiving disability benefit at the rate of £41.10 on her own record.</P>
      <P>Up to now a married man claiming a social welfare payment automatically got extra benefit for his wife but a married woman could only get the extra benefit for her husband in limited circumstances. Men and women will now have an equal right to claim benefit for a spouse who is a dependant.  However, an increase in respect of a spouse will not be paid where the spouse is also in receipt of a social welfare pension, benefit or allowance in his or her own right.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, the person concerned is no longer entitled to the increase in his pension in respect of his wife but he will receive a special payment of £10 a week for a maximum of 52 weeks from 20 November 1986 in consideration of the loss of the adult dependant increase.  The rate of invalidity pension in payment to the person concerned from 20 November 1986 will therefore be £57.10, that is, £47.10 personal rate plus the £10 extra payment referred to above.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 113, 123, and 136 together.</P>
      <P>Staff at the employment exchange, Limerick, who are members of the CPSSU are at present engaged in limited industrial action which is related to accommodation problems and the proposed construction of a new employment exchange in Limerick.  In pursuance of their claim to have work started on the new employment exchange, the staff are refusing to deal with telephone calls and have recently stopped handling official incoming post.  The latter action affects postal applicants and new claimants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Postal applicants for unemployment benefit or assistance, normally receive their payments at their local post offices. Suitable alternative arrangements have been made with An Post to ensure that those claimants continue to receive a weekly payment.  New applicants for unemployment payments whose applications have not been processed at the employment exchange are being dealt with through the supplementary welfare <Col N="316" /> allowance scheme pending the resolution of the dispute.</P>
    <P>Officials of the Department of Social Welfare in seeking a solution to the dispute are in constant touch with the union concerned and with the Office of Public Works who are responsible for the purchase of the new site and the erection of the building.  It is understood that the contract of purchase is about to be signed between the owners of the site and the Office of Public Works and that construction work on the new exchange will commence in the latter months of 1987. In the meantime, a temporary exchange in Mungret Street to cater for female applicants is expected to be ready for occupation by the middle of next year. The union has been kept informed of developments and in the light of the positive elements that have emerged it is hoped that the members of the union will agree to resume normal duties at the employment exchange.</P>

Arising from these discussions and recent developments in regard to the equality measures the question as to how this additional <Col N="317" /> assistance might best be provided is at present being urgently considered in the Department.</P>

      <P>Where a person has less than 156 contributions paid since entry into insurable employment, entitlement to disability benefit is limited to 52 weeks.</P>
      <P>According to the records of the Department the person concerned has only 30 contributions paid on her behalf since entry into insurable employment. Disability benefit was paid from 4 April 1981 to 6 April 1982 after which date her 52 week entitlement became exhausted. She again claimed disability benefit on 12 August 1985 and payment inadvertently was made to 13 August 1986 which resulted in an overpayment.</P>
      <P>In order to requalify for disability benefit it will be necessary for her to have at least a further 13 weeks of insurable employment for which the appropriate contributions are paid.</P>
      <P>As the person concerned has not the means to repay this overpayment, the Department does not intend to pursue recovery of the amount at this time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mrs. Hussey)</NameTxt>
      <P>Since 17 November 1986 men and women claiming benefit, assistance or pension under the Social Welfare Acts will be treated equally.  Up to now a married man claiming a social welfare payment automatically got an increase of benefit for his wife and children living with him, but a married woman could only get an increase of benefit for her husband and children in very restricted circumstances.</P>
      <P>Since 17 November 1986 the definition of dependency has been changed to make it the same for men and women thus removing the discrimination which has heretofore existed against married women.  A spouse will be regarded as a dependant of the other spouse only where he or she is being wholly or mainly maintained by that person and spouses entitled to social welfare payment in their own right or with earnings in excess of £50 a week will not be regarded as dependants. In circumstances where neither spouse is dependent on the other, half of the normal rate of increases of benefit for the children will be paid when either spouse claims benefit.</P>
      <P>The person concerned was in receipt of disability benefit at the personal rate of £41.10 plus an increase of £26.60 in respect of an adult dependant and £46.00 in respect of five child dependants up to 15 November 1986.</P>
      <P>The claimant's wife is employed and earning in excess £50 a week and consequently from 17 November 1986 he will be entitled to £64.10 weekly, that is £41.10 personal rate and an increase of £23 for five children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, should the wife of the person <Col N="320" /> concerned claim and qualify for benefit on her own record, she would also be paid the full personal rate and an increase for qualified children at half rate.</P>
    <P>In a statement issued on 19 November, the Government indicated that it would be reviewing the equal treatment in their current consideration of the 1987 Estimate and that any changes that may arise would be made retrospective.</P>

      <P>The current signing arrangements for unemployed persons are governed by statutory regulations which provide that claimants to unemployment benefit or assistance must sign the unemployed register to indicate that they are available for and genuinely seeking work. In accordance with the regulations, a claimant is obliged to attend the local office at which he made his claim on every working day for which he is unemployed, except where the Minister directs otherwise. In general, claimants attending local offices in the Dublin area are required to attend there only once a week.</P>
      <P>The person concerned, who is employed on a casual basis, claimed unemployment benefit intermittently since 1 July 1986.  When he made his claim he was required to attend the local office once weekly.</P>
      <P>Following recent inquiries, however, it was established that during the period 25 August 1986 to 9 October 1986, he had claimed unemployment benefit in respect of a number of days on which he was employed.  His claim was, accordingly, disallowed in respect of those days and an overpayment assessed against him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because of the irregularity, he was requested to attend at the local office on each day he was unemployed to sign the unemployed register as proof of unemployment. He has now undertaken to <Col N="321" /> furnish a weekly statement from his employer indicating the days on which he worked and, on receipt of such statement, the position regarding his signing arrangements will be reviewed.</P>

According to the Department's records there are no contributions paid or credited in respect of him during the period 6 April 1984 to 5 April 1985, which governs his entitlement to unemployment benefit from 29 July 1986.  He informed his local office that he was employed for the full year in question and furnished a form P.60 as confirmation of this.  However, the form P.60 was not fully completed and inquiries are being made to establish his contribution record for that year.  These inquiries will be completed as soon as possible and his unemployment benefit will be determined in the light of the outcome.</P>
      <P>He has been advised to apply for unemployment assistance in the meantime.  It is understood that he is at present in receipt of supplementary welfare allowance from the health board.</P>

      <P>This measure will expire on 31 December 1986 in accordance with the EC Regulation. Therefore, all approved drainage works must be completed by 1 December 1986 in order to be certified and paid for this year.  The Department has no discretion to pay for works completed after the deadline of 31 December.  The EC Commission has been asked to extend the regulation and discussions are taking place with a view to ensuring that grants are payable for projects approved and commenced before 31 December 1986. No assurance can be given at this stage that the Commission will agree to the proposals.</P>

      <P>Since the introduction of the higher education grants scheme in 1968 expenditure by local rating authorities under the scheme in a particular financial year is recouped by my Department in the following financial year.  There is no undue delay in my Department in recouping expenditure to any particular authority after an application for recoupment is received.</P>
      <P>In the case of vocational educational committees, funds for the provision of scholarships to regional technical colleges and colleges of technology are included in my Department's annual grant to vocational education committees.  This grant is paid in quarterly instalments.</P>
      <P>The administration of the higher education grants and the VEC scholarships schemes has been statutorily entrusted to the local rating authorities and the vocational education committees respectively.  The specimen higher education grants scheme issued by my Department to the local authorities each year contains provisions as follows:</P>

      <P>(b)  Every effort will be made by the ...

      <P>In accordance with Government policy to provide additional aid to national schools serving disadvantaged areas, as set out in the Programme for Action, my Department operates a scheme of providing additional teaching assistance to such schools.</P>
      <P>In establishing an order of merit for the limited number of posts available under the scheme each year, the principal factors taken into account are the disadvantaged nature of the area served by each school, the level of staffing and the number of pupils in the school.  Reports from the inspectorate in each of the applicant schools are carefully considered before the final allocation is decided.</P>

      <P>My Department recently completed this year's allocation for new concessionary posts under the special scheme for providing additional teaching assistance to schools serving disadvantaged areas.  Two of the schools selected for assistance under this scheme had a teaching post suppressed due to falling enrolments in the school.  In each case, the school was <Col N="351" /> allowed to retain the redundant teacher to fill the new concessionary post.  The two schools in question are located in Ballina, County Mayo and in Ballyphehane, County Cork.</P>
      <P>In addition, two schools in Dublin south city were allocated a concessionary post on a shared basis; as one of the schools concerned had a redundant teacher, my Department allowed this teacher to be retained to fill the shared concessionary post.</P>

      <P>A Discussion Paper on Mathematics was issued recently by the Curriculum and Examination Board.  It made many constructive and worthwhile suggestions on the teaching of mathematics generally and my Department is at present considering them.  In relation to the senior classes in the primary school it made the point that &ldquo;the amount of content specified for these classes is over-demanding and, in some cases unsuitable for the majority of pupils&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware from his experience, children in the latter stage of primary education display a wide range of attainment in mathematics.  Given the range of ability and potential of such pupils it would not be unusual to have children in the same class whose individual levels of achievement might differ by three or four years.  The task and challenge for the teacher is to present varied mathematical experiences which will provide satisfaction and challenge for all the pupils.  In this context the recommendations of the Curriculum and Examinations Board and the findings of the various surveys on mathematical attainment conducted by my Department will be taken into consideration in any review of the primary school programmes in mathematics.</P>

As it is understood from Galway County Council, the body administering the scheme in this case, that the reckonable income in the case exceeds this limit, the applicant does not qualify for any maintenance element of a higher education grant.  However, the applicant does qualify for the award of a full fee grant in respect of her studies on the basis of the reckonable parental income.</P>

      <P>Ostlanna Iompair Eireann's (OIE) report and financial statements for the year ended 31 December 1985 were laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas on the 22 May 1986.  The company showed a profit of £13,225 in 1985 as against a loss of £264,063 in 1984.  In 1986, I expect the company to increase its level of profit over 1985 despite the difficult year for tourism.</P>
      <P>The company's accounts are compiled on a consolidated basis and, therefore, do not refer to individual hotels.  In addition, there are sound commercial reasons which I am sure the Deputy will appreciate for not releasing financial information on individual hotels.</P>
      <P>The company did not receive funding from CERT.  As part, however, of the agreed Exchequer financial package provided, when the shares of the company were transferred to CERT, the Government made a grant of £2,773 million to the company in 1985.  As shown in the annual accounts, turnover by the hotels in 1985 was £7,772 million; gross profit was £5,620 million; trading profit was £204,704; profits after extraordinary item was £71,432.  The net funds generated from hotel operations in 1985 were £209,049.  These will be used to fund day-to-day operations and further capital development of the hotels.</P>
