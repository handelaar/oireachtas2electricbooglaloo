    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if with reference to a Land Registry dealing (details supplied) in County Donegal, he will state when it was originally lodged; when it will be completed; and the reason for the delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Dukes) Alan Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Dukes)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the Registrar of Titles that the dealing, the details of which were supplied by the Deputy, was lodged in the Land Registry on 1 February 1985.  I am also informed that an earlier dealing in respect of the same land was lodged on 1 July 1981 and abandoned on 11 September 1984, as replies had not been received to all of the queries raised with the solicitor dealing with the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The dealing is an application for registration of title to unregistered land as well as registered land.  The application is a complex one from the legal point of view and is the subject of protracted correspondence with the applicant's solicitor. Some mapping and legal questions are still unresolved and it is not possible at <Col N="1250" /> this stage to state if, or when, registration will be effected.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I would prefer if the Deputy treated this as a specific question.  As it is a specific question it does not provide an opportunity to raise the whole matter of the Land Registry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The question was put down here for oral reply and it can be taken that it is done so as to highlight a situation which persists in the Land Registry. Therefore, I would submit that I am in order in asking about the generality of the situation of prolonged delays in the Land Registry which are causing serious embarrassment to people all over the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The practice has been that when a specific question about an old age pensioner or a Land Registry matter such as this is put down it does not afford a platform for across-the-board questioning on the position in the Department of Social Welfare or in the Land Registry.  I would ask the Deputy to accept that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept your ruling on that.  But I would have thought that the Minister would take this opportunity to indicate the position regarding the very excessive delays that are taking place not only in the Land Registry but in all branches of the administration of justice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I take your direction on the matter, A Cheann Comhairle, but it might help the Deputy if I pointed out some of the unusual features of this application.  It relates not only to unregistered land but also to commonage. 95/135ths is registered on eight folios and the remainder appears to be unregistered <Col N="1251" /> and it is this aspect that has caused the delays in this case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice the number of people who have been convicted of supplying heroin or of possession of heroin with intent to supply it in each of the last four years for which figures are available; and if he will make a statement on the degree of effectiveness of detections and prosecutions for these offences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that statistics relating to persons convicted of supplying, or of possession with intent to supply any particular controlled drug, are not recorded separately by the Garda.  Consequently, the information sought could not be compiled without the expenditure of a disproportionate amount of Garda resources.</P>
      <P>The information which is readily available, and which is published in the Annual Crime Reports, refers to persons convicted of unlawful possession of any controlled drug, including possession with intent to supply, and refers also to persons who have been charged with possession of heroin whether for personal use, or for sale or supply to others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This information is as follows: (1) Numbers of persons convicted for the unlawful possession of all controlled drugs including possession with intent to supply: 1981, 443; 1982, 818; 1983, 1,054; 1984, 446.  Convictions obtained in any one year may relate to prosecutions taken in previous years.  (2) Numbers of persons charged with possession of heroin, <Col N="1252" /> including possession for personal use or for supply to others: 1981, 177; 1982, 208; 1983, 449; 1984, 340.</P>
    <P>The quantities of illicit drugs which have been seized and the number of persons arrested and successfully prosecuted in recent years indicate the success of the Garda in tackling this problem.  I am informed by the Garda authorities that since 1983 illegal trafficking in drugs has levelled off and that, over the past two years, notwithstanding an intensification in Garda activity, there has been a decrease in the level of drug seizures, and in the number of persons charged with drug offences, which suggests a drop in drug trafficking.  However, the Garda authorities stress that there is no question of relaxation of effort in this area and that their strategy for dealing with the problem is constantly under review.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree with suggestions that the extent of drug abuse has been increasing year on year? Is he satisfied that the methods of detection being used by the Garda are satisfactory, or does he have plans to improve the effectiveness of their detection methods? So far as prosecutions are concerned, is he satisfied that amending legislation is not required or does he have any proposals in that regard?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>As I pointed out in the original reply, the number of persons convicted for unlawful possession, including possession with intent to supply, and the number of persons charged with possession of heroin reduced between 1983 and 1984.  That reduction, together with a reduction in the amount of illicit drugs seized would indicate that there is a falling off in the level of trafficking. I take the Deputy's question about the effectiveness of detection methods very seriously.  That is what I had in mind when I said the Garda constantly reviewed their procedures for detection. As to the question of prosecutions, I have given the number of persons convicted over that period.  I am not aware of any suggestions for a change in the law in that area, and I have no plans for that but if <Col N="1253" /> there are any proposals which any Member feels would be useful in that regard, I will certainly consider them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Mr. Woods Mr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said he does not have a breakdown of the number of persons who would be trafficking in heroin as distinct from those who are abusing, and the figure he gave covers general use of trafficking, but could he clarify that point?  Does he not know how many heroin traffickers or pushers were convicted in that period?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I pointed out that the statistics relating to convictions for supply, or for possession with intent to supply, are not broken down by drug.  I have given the number of convictions for the unlawful possession of all controlled drugs, including possession with intent to supply.  I also gave figures for the numbers of persons charged with possession of heroin, including possession for personal use or possession to supply, but I cannot give a more detailed breakdown than that in relation to convictions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister have preliminary figures for 1985?  Preliminary figures for 1985 for most other things seem to be available, and were given in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The preliminary figures for 1985 are more global &mdash; they are for the broad categories of offences, but as soon as more detailed figures in relation to the categories of drugs I have already mentioned become available, I will make them available to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to detection, is the Minister aware that there is a sizeable problem in carrying out stake-outs in certain areas?  Apparently, the responsibility for a stake-out has been allocated to the local district.  This means that gardaí who would be on the beat or on other duties could be put on stake-out duty for long periods, presumably because the drug squad do not have enough people available.  Would the Minister make provision in a supernumerary way, by way <Col N="1254" /> of overtime, or in some way which does not disrupt normal Garda duties?  I am familiar with this problem in my area because a number of stake-outs have been carried out by the local gardaí. Admittedly, this is good in one way because the local garda knows the area, but he is not available to carry out his normal duties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The matters raised by Deputy Woods are the responsibility of the Commissioner and I do not intend to comment on them, but this matter has been referred to on several occasions in this House.  A very high proportion of drug seizures have been made by members of the uniformed force who were going about their normal duties. The reason for that lies to a large extent in their local knowledge and due to the fact that we have spent a considerable amount of resources over the last few years providing training in drug detection for members of the uniformed force as a matter of course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is involved in the allocation of resources.  I am asking him to look at this problem because at present the local gardaí, in conjunction with the drug squad, are being taken from their ordinary duties for weeks on end to stake out a particular house.  This means they are not available to carry out their normal duties and there is no one to replace them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he is aware of the urgent need to have the manning levels of the Garda Síochána at Bishopstown, Cork, increased; and the steps he is taking to provide the additional facilities needed to combat crime in this expanding area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The arrangements for the policing of individual areas are a matter for the Garda authorities.  They have informed me that arrangements are being made to allocate two additional gardaí to Bishopstown station and to fill a vacancy for sergeant there next month.  As regards other facilities such as transport, it is a matter for the Garda authorities to decide on the allocation appropriate to individual stations having regard to overall needs and resources.  Bishopstown comes within the Garda Cork East Division and the Garda authorities state that transport allocated to this division as a whole is sufficient for present Garda needs.  The requirements of manpower and other resources at the station are however being kept under review.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice the current situation as to the use of spiked chains by the Garda in pursuit of car thieves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Sets of spiked chains have been issued to the Garda as one of the measures taken during 1985 to deal with the problem of so-called &ldquo;joy-riding&rdquo;.  I am informed by the Garda authorities that, so far, situations have not arisen which would warrant the use of the chains.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister amplify the circumstances in which the spikes have not been used?  Are they to do with insurance or the fact that the spikes have not been properly tested and <Col N="1256" /> might be a danger to people in the vicinity?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The use of spiked chains in itself is inherently dangerous to other road users.  Because of that, the advice of the Attorney General was sought as to the use of these implements before they were issued to the force.  The Attorney General issued guidelines on the matter and they are very restrictive guidelines. They are restrictive because, as I said, the use of these chains can constitute a danger to other road users.  The effect of these chains is to take away effectively the control of a vehicle which may be travelling at a very high speed.  Therefore the circumstances in which they can be used without creating unwarranted danger to other road users are very restricted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said the guidelines were issued by the Attorney General.  Were they available before the spiked chains were issued to the Garda? Secondly, is the Minister admitting now that it was wrong to give them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>On the last part, no.  The guidelines were drawn up and were communicated to the force before the chains were issued to them.  I might add that it is a matter which I have discussed with the Garda Representative Association because of their concern with it.  I am saying to the House that in any circumstances in which the spiked chains are used we must make sure that innocent bystanders are not put in danger.</P>

We are now in 1986 and it is a fairly simple report that is presented and laid before the House.  When does the Minister intend to make these reports available?

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen the newspaper reports referred to.  I would refer the Deputy to the detailed reply which my predecessor, Deputy Noonan, gave to a parliamentary question on this matter on 23 October 1985, the day before the newspaper reports appeared.  It is correct to say that discussions of the findings of the Kerry Babies Tribunal took place between my predecessor and the Garda Commissioner but it is not correct to infer from that that Deputy Noonan involved himself in any way in the decision to transfer the members concerned.  As indicated in the course of the reply to the parliamentary question on 23 October, decisions on transfers are made by the Commissioner, and it would not be appropriate for me as Minister for Justice to comment publicly on any individual case.</P>
      <P>As to the question of changing the system, it is not clear to me what the Deputy has in mind.  I have no intention, however, of intervening in matters which are properly the responsibility of the Commissioner.</P>

Will the Minister agree that the gardaí involved are professionals who carried out their duties in accordance with established practice and <Col N="1262" /> procedures?  Does the Minister also agree that the judge exonerated these men and that transferring them in the best interests of the force amounted to criticism and has given credence to the original allegation which has led a large section of the population to believe that these four men were responsible for injustices and guilty of negligence?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>From my answer, Deputy Skelly will have understood that I will not follow up his invitation to respond in relation to matters which do not fall within the ambit of the Minister for Justice.  I am not sure what Deputy Skelly has in mind when he suggests that there is a fault in the system.  I should also like to point out that the exoneration to which Deputy Skelly referred concerned specific allegations.  Other matters are dealt with in the report and it would be wrong to read it as an exoneration from all kinds of criticism.  Having said all that &mdash; and it has all been said before in the House &mdash; I should like to remind Deputy Skelly that the deployment of members of the Garda is a matter for the Commissioner who makes his own decisions.  In these particular cases the Commissioner made his decisions without interference from any quarter which was not entitled to interfere and I intend to continue that practice.</P>

      <P>I attended a portion of that conference and tonight I shall attend the annual conference of the Garda Representative Association.  I have quite a lot of contact with the Garda and I do not share some of the opinions enunciated by Deputy Skelly.  It is untrue and unwarranted to suggest that the persons in question were being treated as &ldquo;scapegoats for a faulty system&rdquo;.  I emphasise that I do not have the slightest notion what Deputy Skelly means by the reference to a system.  These people were not transferred in what he referred to as a blaze of publicity.  Various people seemed to take the opportunity to try to cultivate publicity; I am not referring to the four people in question but others tried to create a blaze of publicity although the tinder of the press is usually fairly dry and does not need much of a spark to get it going.

Does the Minister agree that one of the most offensive aspects of the handling of the case is the fact that on the same page on the same day as the gardaí were cleared of the allegations made against them under the tribunal, the disciplining of the gardaí appeared on the same page?  Was that the Commissioner's decision and was it purely accidental that it appeared at exactly the same time as the report?</P>

      <P>The report in question and the report of the Committee on Garda <Col N="1265" /> Training, to which I referred in my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 43 on 9 April 1986, both cover basically the same ground.  The recommendations of the two reports are at present under consideration in my Department.  As I stated in the earlier reply to which I have referred, it is my hope that it will be possible to implement at least some recommendations in time to benefit the new entrants to the Garda Síochána who will come from the next recruitment competition.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that the recommendations of the Select Committee on Crime, Lawlessness and Vandalism are with his Department since July 1985?  The House agrees that urgent measures need to be taken in regard to crime and is the Minister saying that he can take no action on the clearcut recommendations of the committee?  Some of these measures could be implemented in the short term although others might take longer.  I understand that the other committee produced an interim report in December&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for <Col N="1267" /> Justice if his attention has been drawn to an article (details supplied) to the effect that a German postgraduate student living in Dublin had been told by his Department that because she had a bank overdraft she was not to be permitted to stay in this country; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Manning will be aware the case referred to in his question has received considerable publicity apart from the article referred to by him. There was also a number of letters relating to the case in the newspaper in question including two from my private office. In one of these I found it necessary to refute the statements which formed the basis of the article in question as being seriously distorted and unjust to the people in the Aliens Section of my Department.</P>
      <P>Contrary to what was stated in the newspaper article the student was not told by my Department that because she had a bank overdraft she was not to be permitted to stay here.  In fact, no final decision was taken as to whether she would be allowed remain in the country or not.  However, it was explained to her that students had to be able to maintain themselves financially.  In this context she was informed that a bank statement showing an overdraft would not be accepted as proof of her having sufficient financial support to maintain herself.</P>
      <P>As to the relevant background, I should point out that the requirement that students be able to demonstrate that they are in a position to support themselves financially applies to students of EC countries.  Our procedure on this matter is in accordance with the EC Directives on rights of entry and residence of certain categories of persons who are nationals of EC countries and is in keeping with practices in other EC countries in relation to students who are citizens of member states of the EC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the article in question, the student attributes certain statements to officers of the Aliens Section which, if true, would reflect badly on them.  They deny <Col N="1268" /> emphatically that they made the statements complained of and I am satisfied that they did not do so.</P>
    <P>The article is seriously misleading in giving the impression that the student &mdash; as a young inexperienced non-national &mdash; was put in terror by the bureaucratic &ldquo;hassle&rdquo; of experienced and antagonistic officials &mdash; that was marvellous language in the article.  As was clarified in one of the letters from my office the truth is quite different.  The student in question is 31 years old.  She has had considerable experience of immigration procedures. She was accompanied by a male companion &mdash; an Irish national who appeared to be in his mid-forties &mdash; whose behaviour could only be called belligerent &mdash; if not violent.  He physically threatened the officer of my Department &mdash; a young girl &mdash; who had to deal with himself and the student and left the interview in a rage shouting, &ldquo;I'll get you&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In fact, he said to the young woman on the reception desk that he almost hit the official with whom he had been dealing. In this context I would like to point out that on all occasions each of the officials dealing with the student was younger than she and considerably younger than the man who accompanied her.  Indeed, the man's behaviour was such as to leave one of these young officers in a state of distress.</P>
    <P>My Department wrote to the student on 2 April 1986 stating that no decision had been taken in her case and pointing out that if she is here as a student she would have to produce documentary evidence of her ability to maintain herself. No reply has been received to that letter to date.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I was somewhat disturbed at the part of the question that was not allowed which dealt with an overdraft being used against a person staying in the country but, leaving that aside, I accept that the facts are as the Minister outlined because I carried out my own investigation into this matter.  What worries me is that very specific, detailed and disturbing allegations were made in print but it was weeks before they were answered fully <Col N="1269" /> by the Department thus allowing the impression to continue that there was something seriously wrong with the administration by officials in the Department.  Will the Minister accept that a speedier method of response by the Department to allegations of this sort in the future could prevent a story growing in the way this one did?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make one small point lest it is overlooked.  The existence of an overdraft is not in any case used against a person.  We could not accept the evidence that an overdraft existed as evidence that the person was able financially to maintain herself.  I am prepared to agree that, perhaps, a speedier, detailed reply from my Department might have helped to avoid other people getting a wrong slant.  As against that I have to say, and this underlines my response to the question before us, that in the normal course of events my Department and I would be very reluctant to enter into public debate about any specific case.  I do not think it is proper that specific cases like this should be debated in public and I regret the fact that the person in question saw fit to present what was, in the event, a very biased and partial account of her adventures to the newspapers.</P>

For the country as a whole the figures were 195 over the same period in 1986 and 184 in 1985.  I accept that in the DMA has been a slight increase but for the country as a whole there has been a slight reduction.

When one looks for additional resources or the presence of more police one is told that the money is not available to pay for overtime in those areas.  Will the Minister tell the House the special measures he intends to take to provide back-up for gardaí who are handling these difficult matters?  Is the Minister aware that in some Dublin streets it is alleged that rackets operate, that physical violence and abuse are commonplace and that young thugs come in and demand money with menaces, and that this is continuing daily?  Can the Minister offer some possible solution?  Is he prepared to take some special action to deal with it?</P>

      <P>Not only was it a speech but Deputy Woods strayed more than a little from the subject matter of the original question.  Of course I agree with the Deputy that in areas in Dublin and, indeed, in other parts of the country, there are serious difficulties resulting from the levels of criminal activity.  I might point out that over the last three and a half years this Government have taken a long series of measures to deal with the problem.  For example, we have indicated that we will keep Garda strength at 11,400, a level it had never reached before 1983.  We have also undertaken a major programme of equipment for the Garda, notably the installation of a new communications system.  I hope that the new system in the Dublin Metropolitan Area will be operational in <Col N="1272" /> the course of this year.  Those are measures that have improved the ability of the Garda to respond to the type of situation the Deputy has mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the figure of 11,400 constitutes a cutback on the 12,000 the Government promised coming into office?  He should be aware of that fact, having been Minister for Finance previously.  Will the Minister establish some special squads to support people in these areas?  I am sorry that the Minister is somewhat frustrated but I am living with its effects on the ground.  I will bring the Minister out and show him shops that have been closed on account of crime.  Is he aware that matters are not working on the ground in these areas? Would the Minister agree that it is not acceptable that some parts of the city are free from crime &mdash; about which the Minister can talk smugly &mdash; while others are subjected daily and nightly to serious crime that the Garda cannot handle because they do not have the necessary resources?  Will the Minister give the House a commitment to establish special squads, to provide special overtime or other arrangements affording the Garda an opportunity to root out these thugs, criminals and vandals in the areas in which they are taking over?  The Minister has only to look at Tallaght and at the north side of the city to see what has been happening there in recent times.</P>

      <P>In relation to this question it is important to bear in mind that the <Col N="1276" /> responsibility for the orderly control of crowds at football matches and other events of that nature rests on the organisers of such events.  The attendance of gardaí for duty inside the grounds or premises at these events can be arranged by organisers through the Garda authorities who will provide the level of Garda attendance requested.  Where this service is provided, the organisers must bear the cost.</P>
      <P>The persons responsible for crowd control and safety at the football match referred to in the question made private arrangements for the maintenance of order and did not request the Garda authorities to provide gardaí for duty within the grounds.</P>
      <P>Outside the grounds a number of gardaí were on duty concerned with traffic control and public order.  The Garda authorities say that, having regard to the particular demand on their resources at the time and the previous good record of crowd behaviour at that ground, the number of gardaí on duty was considered to be adequate.  When trouble did occur reinforcements were brought in and order was quickly restored.</P>

      <P>Proposals by the Irish Auctioneers and Valuers Institute for amendments to the Auctioneers and House Agents Acts, 1947 to 1973, have been received and are under consideration in my Department.</P>
      <P>In his speech at the Irish Auctioneers and Valuers Institute dinner dance on 15 November 1984 the Taoiseach referred to the question of amending legislation and said that he would hope that the Minister for Justice &ldquo;within the next few months will be able to come to the Government with proposals that reflect the needs of the consumer and that from those proposals legislation will ensue&rdquo;. Since November 1984 my Department have had consultations with bodies who would be concerned with any amendments to the legislation in question.  As recently as Tuesday of last week I myself had a meeting with representatives of the IAVI on the topic.</P>
      <P>I should point out that any such amendments would require careful consideration. In examining them consideration has to be given to such matters as the needs of the profession, the needs of persons who do business with them, the position of the public and, in particular, the interests of persons who would aspire to become members of the profession in the future.</P>
      <P>I am continuing my consideration of the proposals for amendments to the Acts before deciding what proposals, if any, I may put to Government for legislation.  I do not accept that there has been any undue delay in pursuing the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the debate adjourned last Thursday I was speaking about motor taxation and county roads. The allocation for these roads is very disappointing.  Sligo County Council are to be allocated £418,000, an inadequate sum to maintain the 1,428 miles of county roads in the area.  The condition of county roads throughout the country is a national disgrace.  It is almost impossible to travel by car on a number of such roads in County Sligo.  VAT, excise duty, tax on motor vehicles and all other kinds of tax <Col N="1340" /> bring in £800 million, yet Sligo County Council are given an allocation of only £418,000.  Such a very small allocation means that it will not be possible to maintain these roads.</P>
      <P>Regarding national primary roads, an application was made by Sligo County Council for £150,000 for a by-pass in Tubbercurry but only £50,000 was granted. We are short £100,000 for this project which has been going on for a number of years.  The last money granted for it was granted by a Fianna Fáil Government. When allocating money the Government should give an adequate amount to complete the job.  Work has begun on a number of these roads in my county but the money has run out after, perhaps, half a mile or less and these roads may be left in a dangerous condition due to inability to complete the works.  An application was made for a considerable amount of money for the Curry-Bellaghy by-pass but only £300,000 was allocated this year.  That is a totally inadequate amount in terms of purchasing the required land and making a new road. We are not getting the moneys we need to keep the national primary roads in the west up to the standards required for this day and age and when there are so many heavy vehicles from Europe using our roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For a number of years there has been controversy regarding the building of a third bridge in Sligo.  In 1982 Fine Gael people in Sligo were saying that the blame for the delay rested with Fianna Fáil. Now we are well into 1986, so one must ask whose fault it is that work on this bridge has not been started.  This year there has been an allocation of £800,000 for the approach road from Collooney and for some work on the bridge to be undertaken.  The total estimate in respect of that approach road from Collooney and for the bridge is about £7 million. Therefore, an allocation of £800,000 will not go very far in that regard.  It is time a realistic allocation was made to every local authority to enable them to maintain our county roads.  This should be possible in the context of falling oil prices <Col N="1341" /> and based on the statements made by the Minister for Finance on radio this morning.  In addition, there is the factor that we pay the highest road tax in Europe and also that the Government &ldquo;take&rdquo; in respect of new cars is of a higher percentage than is the case in any other European country.  In addition, we pay very high VAT charges.</P>
    <P>I was very pleased to hear our spokesman on agriculture endeavour to raise today the question of the numbers of cattle that are dying in Sligo and Leitrim as a result of the poor fodder of last winter.  The amounts of money allocated under the feed voucher scheme to alleviate the hardship in this respect was very inadequate.  Farmers who applied for aid under that scheme did not receive any help if the farm development services people decided that the applicant had 75 per cent of his feed requirements.  The question of the quality of the feed this year was not taken into account in assessing those applications.  Last year silage was made mostly in the month of September, but also in October, when normally it would be made in the months of June or July.  That meant that the quality of the feed was very poor.  The Government, and the Minister for Agriculture particularly, must now take the blame for the number of cattle deaths in both Sligo and Leitrim.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy who is due to speak next from the other side of the House may tell us about the allocations in respect of county roads in Cork, but whatever the story may be so far as that county is concerned the blame rests with the Government for the state of our county roads generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1342" /> In 1974 I was working in the GWI factory in Collooney, where there were then 400 people employed, but that factory has since gone to the wall.  When the present Minister for Finance was in charge of industry representations were made to him in the interest of saving the last 110 jobs there, but unfortunately help was not forthcoming and the jobs were lost.  The Minister should reconsider that matter.</P>
    <P>When I spoke last I expressed a welcome for the social employment scheme on the basis that, while it does not provide full time jobs, it gives at least some encouragement to the long term unemployed. While I welcome the announcement recently that married men participating in this scheme are to receive an increase in remuneration from £70 to £85, I submit that a similar level of remuneration should be granted to single men participating in the scheme.  Perhaps the rate for both married and single men might be increased to £90.  In the case of a single man some of the money is returned to the Exchequer by way of taxation.  The scheme is very important in the sense that it gives to those participating in it an opportunity once again to return to work, even if only for a few days per week.  I suggest that any money we save this year by way of reduced oil prices should be allocated to giving a little more to the unemployed.</P>
    <P>On the last occasion, too, I spoke about emigration, and I wonder how many people have left Ireland in the meantime. I know of a few personally.  Emigration is rampant again along the western seaboard. Our people go away because they have no wish to hang around without jobs.  There was mass emigration from the west in the fifties, but many of those people returned.  It is sad now that their children are finding it necessary to emigrate. The Government must make much greater efforts to create jobs for our young people.  As a member of the North Western Health Board the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Deputy Connaughton will be aware that there are drastic cutbacks in that health board area.  I have heard of an elderly <Col N="1343" /> person who has been informed that he will now be expected to make a contribution towards the cost of a home help. This is the first time that I have heard of any charge for this service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Considering the amount of money we are paying in VAT, motor taxation and excise duties, it is time once again that the Minister made a substantial increase in the allocation for roads.  I feel very strongly about the amount of money which is made available to agriculture.  That is why so many of our cattle are dying at present.  Agriculture is at a cross roads.  The Minister for Agriculture is in Luxembourg negotiating for our farmers.  I hope he comes back with a good package particularly for the farmers in the west who depend so much on their <Col N="1344" /> small farms.  Today more than ever we depend on our small farms.  Once upon a time you could subsidise your small farm by getting a job.  Unfortunately, it is very hard to get a job in the west today.  I hope, as I have said, that the Minister comes back with a good package, or else with no package at all, for the farmers of the west.</P>

      <P>There can be little doubt that the publication of the 1986 Finance Bill three weeks ago was an important attempt at giving the economy a boost as outlined in the most recent budget.  The Minister while speaking in this debate last Tuesday pointed to the fact that for the first time in several years the Irish economy shows signs of improving. The steep fall in energy prices and the low rate of inflation have both contributed to this positive outlook for the economy.  With the possibility of an upturn in economic activity in the near future, it is only fitting that a package of tax incentives aimed at encouraging savers and investors to move their funds into productive investment, at the rewarding of managerial initiative and at the promotion of research and product development should be introduced at this <Col N="1346" /> point in time so that the industrial and service sectors of the economy will be better prepared to benefit from the greater opportunities in a revitalised economy.</P>
      <P>Profit-sharing schemes which are dealt with in section 8 of this Bill are given further encouragement in line with that given in the 1982 and 1984 Finance Acts. Provision was made in the 1982 Act for employees to receive shares to the value of £1,000 tax-free in any one year.  Subsequently, in 1984 the value of shares which an employee could receive was increased to £5,000.  The situation will now be further improved by means of the 1986 Act to the extent that the minimum retention period in order to avoid an income tax charge will be reduced from seven to five years and also there will be no stamp duty on the first sale of these shares.  By having a stake in the business in which they work, employees will have a greater commitment and incentive to ensuring that their firm is efficient.  In the UK in 1979 there were a mere 30 employee profit sharing schemes but by 1985, with much Government encouragement, there are over 1,000 covering 1.5 million workers. Most workers in Japan receive about 25 per cent of their total pay in the form of a bonus with strong profit-sharing overtones.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Ireland at present there are 14-16 profit sharing schemes registered with the Revenue Commissioners with another possible 30 in preparation.  This figure seems very insignificant, but two factors must be taken into account.  First these schemes were established after the tax concessions provided in the 1982 Act so it is early days yet.  Secondly, the schemes cover approximately 15,000 to 20,000 people but much more significantly those companies include some major employers, for example Waterford Glass, Bank of Ireland, Guinness and Carrolls.  A promising outcome is that many multinational companies have shown a keen interest in these types of schemes and as more schemes come into operation it could be one factor to encourage further foreign investment as US and Japanese <Col N="1347" /> firms place a heavy emphasis on profit sharing schemes.</P>
    <P>Persuading workers and companies to fundamentally change the way labour is paid will not be easy but it is the hope of many like myself that when both partners see the favourable tax treatment of profit-sharing schemes they will be prepared to participate.  Provisions in the 1986 Act allied to those of previous years confirm the Government's commitment to profit sharing as a means of ensuring the success of Irish industry as well as the prosperity of Irish workers.</P>
    <P>Section 7 of the Bill rewards managerial initiative and expertise as any benefit derived by a director or key executive from the granting of an option, that is, to acquire any asset including shares in a company, will not be taxable until it is actually exercised.  It is imperative that by means of incentives like these executives with the necessary skills are retained in Ireland to assist in the development of business and the creation of jobs.</P>
    <P>A major new innovative measure in this Bill is the encouragement it gives people to move part of their deposit funds and other under-utilised resources into productive investment.  Therefore, it is a welcome move that the tax payable on the first £13,000 of dividend income from manufacturing companies will be reduced to 25 per cent as against 35 per cent charged on deposit interest.  Also an individual who subscribes for shares in an Irish company engaged in research and development will obtain tax relief on condition that the shares are retained for a minimum of five years or for the length of the R and A project if less than five years.  In France, since the &ldquo;MONORY&rdquo; system was introduced in 1977 which allows French citizens to invest a portion of their income on the stock market and offset it against tax, the number of individuals investing in shares has more than doubled.  In 1977, 7 per cent of the population invested in shares while by 1982 it had risen to 17 per cent although it has <Col N="1348" /> since fallen under the Mitterrand Government. The number of individuals owning shares in the US has risen to 19 per cent during the Reagan years and it is interesting to note that women now make up the majority of new investors.  Other figures for the percentage of the population owning shares are Sweden 20 per cent and Germany 17 per cent.  While no actual figure is available for Ireland it is thought that considerably less than 5 per cent of the population own shares.  Hopefully these new incentives for ordinary investors will encourage more and more people to have a direct stake in Irish industry by means of being share-owners.</P>
    <P>Just to take up the subject of research and development for a moment, from many deliberations while working with the small businesses committee, a very successful committee chaired by my very able constituency colleague, there is a decided lack of awareness of the impact of technology on product development across Irish Industry.  This is underlined by the fact that total R and A expenditure represents 0.32 per cent of gross domestic product in Ireland compared with 1.31 per cent in Sweden, 1.67 per cent in Switzerland and 1.56 per cent in the US.  This is a cause for concern as Ireland being an open economy, as such is open to competition.  As the First Report on Manufacturing Industry of the small businesses committee states:</P>
    <P>Irish Companies whether they are exporting or not, must be fully aware of the changes in competitors products in the international market place. Companies which are not actively examining changes overseas will find themselves vulnerable to competition both at home and abroad.</P>
    <P>In this context I have spoken before in this House about the need for co-operation in technological activity at national level between State agencies, industry and the higher education institutions. Universities in the US play a crucial role in industrial development.  Expertise in Irish universities must be harnessed by industry in a similar way.  Experiments like the Industrial Support Foundation <Col N="1349" /> taking place in the Limerick area which links higher education in the guise of the NIHE and various companies on the Shannon Industrial Estate are to be commended and should provide impetus for further experiments.  Both at third level and second level education innovative thinking and a positive attitude to risktaking must be encouraged.  Many believe as I do that one way of solving the awful problem of unemployment from which stems so many of our social problems at the moment is the encouragment of small businesses.  Therefore, any attempt through the educational system to foster this awareness and improve our expertise in R and D for the benefit of small businesses is to be commended. Another related factor mentioned in the report and one which I think needs to be emphasised again is the question of quality control.  The Irish Quality Control Association's national survey on attitudes to quality carried out in July of last year and involving 2,000 interviewees revealed that the majority of people regard quality as the most important feature when purchasing.  It seems a shame if after all the effort put into R and D that a product should fail because of quality. Therefore, a successful small business is not merely a good idea, rather it is a combination of good marketing, R and D and good quality.</P>
    <P>It is not surprising that after what I have said up to now I am delighted that the Minister has seen fit to extend the business development scheme which was introduced initially in 1984 for three years.  Because of the Minister's action the scheme will now continue until 1991. Despite much criticism following its introduction in 1984 because of what was seen to be an array of complexities in the legislation the scheme is now showing signs of becoming a great success in the future.  By January 1986 the scheme had raised more than £5 million for some 38 companies.  The Industry Minister reported only a week or so ago that a further £5 million has been approved by the Revenue Commissioners for a total of 53 companies.  This points to the developing interest in the scheme which has <Col N="1350" /> attracted investment in an extraordinary range of companies.  There are two distinctive ways of getting involved in the business development scheme. Investments can be made directly into companies which are approved by the Revenue Commissioners or alternatively the money can be invested through designated funds which have been set up specifically for the individual company.  The best publicised project to benefit from the scheme so far is the film production company Strongbow which is having a great success with its first feature film &ldquo;Eat the Peach&rdquo;.  In a 13 month period the Strongbow company succeeded in raising approximately £1.5 million under the business development scheme.</P>
    <P>The range of companies who have availed of the scheme is astonishing &mdash; from lock makers to computer software to shoe makers.  As the scheme continues there have been calls for refinements, for example, some of the designated funds find the need to make their investments before the end of the tax year in order to obtain the benefits of the scheme, somewhat restrictive.  It is generally agreed at the moment that if an increase in employment is to be achieved the formation and nurturing of small business is essential. Of course it is much more difficult to actually do that in practice but one must take heart from the general success of the business development scheme which after some initial hiccups is beginning to look as if it could be a very major scheme for assisting in the establishment of viable small firms in the future.</P>
    <P>The Ministers decision to give encouragement to the development of the newly-founded smaller companies market of the Irish Stock Exchange is an important one for the long term well-being of the small businesses sector of the Irish economy.  A special category of the capital gains tax will be created for investors in these kinds of companies on the Stock Exchange.  For a three-year period, the gains on shares traded in this market will be taxed at the rate of 30 per cent regardless of the length of time the shares were held.  Many have complained that the Irish Stock Exchange has been <Col N="1351" /> concentrated around a small number of &ldquo;blue chip&rdquo; stock and speculative oil exploration shares.  With that in mind the small businesses committee while looking at manufacturing industry recommended that:</P>
    <P>The Stock Exchange should reassess its criteria to allow for &ldquo;Small Business Stocks&rdquo; in the case of companies seeking to raise funds at a lower level than that which now prevails.</P>
    <P>While the number of shares quoted on the exchange has dwindled over the past decade, this year there are signs of improvement.  In the early seventies over 100 companies had their shares quoted. This number is now down to 48 with a further 16 being quoted under the unlisted securities market.  Already this year two new issues have come on the market; Wardell Roberts and Norish, while others are in the pipeline such as Jury's Hotel Group and Kerry Co-op.  It was very interesting to read in to-day's <i>Irish Press</i> that the public has oversubscribed by 6.5 times for the Jury shares. I hope this argurs well for this type of investment in the future and for the involvement of the public generally in productive investment.</P>
    <P>The smaller companies market is designed, as the small businesses committee recommended, to encourage further companies to seek a quotation for their shares at a much lower cost than being on the unlisted securities market or the main market.  This new market was launched in January and it has yet to make its debut with an issue but my hope is that that will change, given encouragement by the Government, the Stock Exchange, CII and other interested parties.  The market capitalisation of Irish publicly quoted shares represents only 10 per cent of national output compared with 50 per cent in the UK and the USA.  The smaller companies market is a great opportunity to change this situation while at the same time offering these small businesses a great chance to obtain additional funds to help them in further expansion and development.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1352" /> As many like myself who have practised what they preach, who encourage small businesses at every available opportunity, know, finance is one of the major obstacles to any new venture becoming a profitable business.  Often these businesses experience difficulty in raising loan finance may be because they lack a track record with a bank.  Even so, those firms that are successful have in the majority of cases the wrong mix consisting in the average case of 30 per cent equity and 70 per cent borrowed money.  Various measures which I have highlighted previously in my speech, for example the BDS, relief for R and D, encouragement for shareholders in manufacturing industry, small companies market in the Stock Exchange can provide a means to broaden and strengthen the equity base of small manufacturing industry in this country.  It is time for the financial institutions to encourage this climate of entrepreneurship by setting up funds similar to those of the BDS.  On the other hand a change in attitude on behalf of many owners of small businesses is necessary. Many are reluctant to part with &ldquo;their&rdquo; company and would prefer to own 100 per cent of an unsuccessful company rather than own 40 per cent of a very successful company, as has been said before in this House.  These provisions offer an opportunity to get away from the &ldquo;us&rdquo;<i>versus</i>&ldquo;them&rdquo; mentality that is prevalent in the country; the employer <i>versus</i> the worker, the big financial institutions <i>versus</i> the small businessman.  By encouraging enterprise this Finance Bill, for those who take advantage of it, offers them a chance to acquire a feeling of direct participation and involvement in the wealth of the nation.</P>
    <P>Turning to the important subject of tourism, there are few who would argue over the importance of this sector to the economy and to economic activity.  The third report of the small businesses committee, on tourism, catering and leisure, sets out the key issues affecting this sector, for example, lack of planning, competitiveness and standards that need to be tackled if Ireland is to obtain an increasing proportion of the growing <Col N="1353" /> international tourism market.  In this context I am delighted that the Minister has seen fit to reduce the rate of VAT on meals in restaurants and hotels from 23 per cent to 10 per cent, this being a major recommendation of the report.</P>
    <P>Restaurants and hotel dining rooms have a major role to play in the tourist industry.  Bord Fáilte figures for 1984 showed that 55 per cent of overseas visitors used restaurants and 41 per cent used dining rooms.  Like other sectors, restaurants are suffering from the twin effects of declining disposable incomes and increasing costs.  Thus the lower VAT rate gives them an opportunity to increase their already slender profit margins while providing a major boost to their business.  However, I appeal to all tourist interests to ensure that some of this reduction in VAT is reflected in the cross-counter price.</P>
    <P>Another major recommendation in the report was an increase in refurbishment grants for tourism hotels.  Therefore, the grants introduced last October point to the Government's commitment to help the hotel sector which has had many difficulties in recent years.  A major proviso of the new grants is that refurbishment work should consist of labour-intensive work.  The grant is provided for 20 per cent of the cost of reconstruction, 25 per cent if the facilities cater for disabled persons.</P>
    <P>There are two categories of reconstruction work eligible: improvements to hotel premises and improvements to hotel facilities, such as all-weather facilities, sauna, swimming pools and so on.  There was an allocation of £2 million for these grants in 1986 and the maximum grant available to any one hotel is £30,000.  The Department of Tourism are very happy with the interest shown in the scheme so far and hope it will be continued in 1987. At present there have been 59 approvals for grants and 100 are in the pipeline, which is very promising when one takes into account that the majority of renovation work in hotels would be done after the peak season in the summer.  I am sure these two measures will give an impetus to the tourism sector in Ireland and <Col N="1354" /> thereby make a significant contribution to the development of the economy as a whole.</P>
    <P>As a Minister of State whose responsibility includes areas of the Department of the Environment, I think it is important that I mention some grant schemes which have been introduced in an effort to boost activity in the very depressed construction industry.  As the very fine report of the small businesses committee on the construction industry pointed out, Ireland differs from most countries in Europe in the lack of priority given to the renovation, improvement and preservation of existing buildings. The condition of parts of central Dublin illustrate all too clearly that by neglecting such investment, decay and dereliction become all too rampant not only affecting the state of buildings.  It also results in declining business, increased crime, reflecting some of the major social problems of today and negative implications for the tourism sector, our third largest generator of foreign earnings.</P>
    <P>We in Ireland have failed to understand fully the major contribution that an attractive urban environment can make to successful tourism.  With this in mind I am wholly in favour of the sections of this Bill which deal with urban renewal and are a means to implement the tax reliefs referred to in the Taoiseach's statement of 23 October concerning the redevelopment of the Custom House docks area and certain other designated inner city areas in Dublin, Cork and Limerick.  These reliefs are also being extended to designated areas in Waterford and Galway.  The incentives involved include a 50 per cent capital allowance for commercial development; double rent allowances offset against tax; a 5 per cent tax allowance on the purchase price of private dwellings to apply annually for ten years.  These incentives are welcome and long overdue.  Thus they deserve the encouragement of all in this House who seek the renewal of our inner cities.</P>
    <P>Later this week, the Urban Renewal Bill will receive its Second Reading in this House.  The provisions of that Bill, together with the provisions contained in <Col N="1355" /> sections 35 to 41 of the Finance Bill, represent a major step towards implementation of the measures announced by the Taoiseach last October relating to unemployment and taxation and the initiation of a special programme to secure the reconstruction and revitalisation of the inner areas of our five largest cities.</P>
    <P>The relevant provisions of the Finance Bill provide for a range of taxation incentives for construction and reconstruction works carried out in the designated areas of the five county boroughs in the period between 23 October 1985 and 31 May 1989.  The comprehensive range of incentives being provided is specifically designed to encourage private sector involvement on a large scale in the revitalisation of the inner areas of the five cities and the success of the scheme will depend largely on the response of developers and investors in taking up the incentives on offer.</P>
    <P>The special financial incentives included in the Finance Bill are: (a) capital allowances for the construction or refurbishment of commercial buildings, including offices, shops, leisure and car parking facilities; (b) the granting of relief to lessors under section 23 of the Finance Act, 1981, for the provision of dwellings for letting in the Custom House docks area in Dublin; (c) the granting of a very generous relief to owner-occupiers for expenditure on the construction or refurbishment of dwellings; and (d) double rent relief for traders occupying newly constructed or refurbished buildings.</P>
    <P>All these incentives taken together represent a generous package of taxation reliefs aimed at stimulating a positive response from the private sector and as the incentives will have a relatively short life span it is important that investors, builders and the construction industry should respond quickly to the incentives on offer.</P>
    <P>My Department will monitor closely the operation of this scheme of incentives and will do all in their power to ensure its success.  The managers of the five county <Col N="1356" /> boroughs have already been requested to promote their areas in order to achieve maximum results in terms of development and redevelopment in the inner city areas in question.</P>
    <P>I will refer briefly to the new home improvement grants announced some months ago by my Department.  At the moment some 67,000 applications have been received.  They are coming in at the rate of 4,000 per week and, as can be appreciated, there could be a short delay in inspection and in approving grants.  Be that as it may, it proves how attractive is the scheme and how, in conjunction with the urban renewal measures, it should result in more work for the construction sector, particularly for the smaller building contractor for whom labour-intensive activity is most suitable.  In addition, these measures will also help towards combating the invidious black economy in the construction industry.  It will also have the beneficial effect of preserving our secondhand housing stock for the future.</P>
    <P>I will turn to the subject of agriculture and speak a little about the implications of last Thursday's vote in the European Parliament.  As we know, there have been proposals by the European Commission to reform the CAP in the European Community in an effort to alleviate the EC's budgetary crisis and reduce farm surpluses.  The Minister for Agriculture told this House on March 20 that these proposals &ldquo;could cost Ireland at least £150 million if pushed through in their present form&rdquo;.  It is, therefore, with the greatest of concern for the well-being of Irish agriculture that the vote of the European Parliament for a set of price proposals even together than those of the Commission, is viewed.  The vote gives some &ldquo;moral&rdquo; support to the Farm Commissioner in his negotiations with the Council of Ministers this week in Luxembourg. We must all hope that the new French Minister of Agriculture will maintain his stance stated at a meeting of EC Ministers on March 24 for a 4 per cent farm price increase and his strong opposition to any proposals that would alter the basic principles of the CAP.  If Europe <Col N="1357" /> was to mean anything to Irish farmers it was that agricultural production must be based in countries of greatest natural advantage.  Our Minister deserves the support of all in this House, in the farming organisations and the country as a whole in the task before him of convincing our Community partners of the concessions that must be made to Ireland.</P>
    <P>Of those sections of the Finance Bill dealing with agriculture I must commend the decision to extend for another year, from next October, the exemption from stamp duty on voluntary transfers of agricultural land where the person receiving the land is under the age of 30 years and has completed an appropriate training course.  We have extended the hours of training necessary from 100 hours to 150 hours and I hope that ACOT will be able to accommodate this, albeit at short notice.  This scheme has proved to be very popular and has the full backing of the farming organisations.  The injection of young blood into the farm industry is a welcome move and one which ensures that the ownership or management of our agricultural land is in the hands of those best fitted to work it and to produce from it what the market demands.</P>
    <P>It has been said that a people without a cultural heritage is like a man without a name and therefore devoid of an identity. There are differing opinions as to what constitutes the heritage but surely no one's image of Ireland is complete without its abbeys and castles, round towers and Celtic crosses, Killarney and Connemara.  It is a particular pleasure for me to have it as one of my responsibilities to oversee the activities of the Commissioners of Public Works under the parks and national monuments heading.  The commissioners have in their care some of the brightest jewels of both the built and natural heritage and I will be taking a special interest in their programme of work in the conservation and interpretation of those properties.</P>
    <P>There is, of course, a close link between this programme and the functions of the Department of the Environment for which I also have responsibility.  Our environment is now <Col N="1358" /> more at risk than at any time in history. Economic growth and modern technology have given man the ability to destroy his environment at an unprecedented rate.  The planners have an important role in trying to regulate economic growth so as to minimise its impact on the environment. The commissioners main job is to acquire the very special buildings and places and to conserve them free from exploitation and damage for this and for future generations.  In recent years they have seen the need to widen the scope of their activities and they are now actively involved in the field of interpretation. They have also stepped up the pace of archaeological survey, one of the principal objectives of which is to advise the planning authorities and other organisations involved in environmental change of the items of our built or man-made heritage which should be preserved.  It is about those two subjects that I wish to speak today.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Interpretation&rdquo; in this context has been defined as &ldquo;an educational activity which aims to reveal meanings and relationships through the use of original objects, by first hand experience and by illustrative media, rather than simply to communicate factual information&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Recently I had the pleasure of making a visit to the magnificent Glenveagh National Park in County Donegal and seeing there the beautiful new visitor centre which is now nearing completion. The commissioners had the good sense to take advantage of the money provided by the EC special fund for Border areas to build this centre which will provide an ideal setting for the interpretation of national parks in general and of Glenveagh in particular.  It will, I believe, be second to none in Europe.</P>
    <P>Interpretation is the key to conservation and, as our Finance Bill underlines for us with its various considerations in this regard, the immediate aim of interpretation is provocation rather than instruction, a principle which Freeman Tilden regarded as the father of interpretation linked with another phrase &ldquo;through interpretation, understanding; through understanding, appreciation; <Col N="1359" /> through appreciation, protection&rdquo;.  Interpretation is worthless unless it motivates people to have a concern for their environment and heritage.  A conservation message is a fundamental part of interpretation.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, it was well documented that tourism is a major earner of foreign exchange as well as having major links with many industries throughout the economy.  The Government's measures in this sector are very welcome but much more is needed in order that at Government level it is no longer treated as the Cinderella within the overall national economic policy.  Likewise, further measures will have to be taken within the constraints of Government expenditure to encourage the rehabilitation of our older buildings and our inner cities, thereby improving the environment we all live in.  But the major aspect of the Finance Bill before us today is the attempt to provide for greater private investment in manufacturing industry. This type of investment is encouraged via the BDS, R and D, the smaller companies market on the stock exchange and, finally, a lower rate of capital gains tax which in time, I hope, will be brought into line with similar taxes in other EC countries.  In the majority of cases in Europe the similar capital gains tax is lower or non-existent, thereby giving our competitors a decided advantage <i>vis-àvis</i> private investment in industry.  There is no way that industry in Ireland will ever be able to attract the necessary equity funds which will lead to growth if the advantages from investing in Government bonds and other forms of institutional savings far outstrip those of industry.  Individuals and private institutions have the opportunity, through the incentives of this Bill, to make a choice. Therefore it is my hope that many in the future will look upon investment in industry in a far more favourable light than before.  That is good news for industry, small business, the economy and ultimately the nation as a whole.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, Deputy Bruton, said &ldquo;there is a new optimism in <Col N="1360" /> the economy&rdquo;.  I thought I heard that before on a Finance Bill and I checked the budget speech made by Deputy Alan Dukes on 30 January 1985, and we find there a new optimism as well.  His purpose was to improve the environment for increasing employment.  He said that although it was projected that, given moderation in pay developments, employment should begin to pick up this year, special Government measures would be needed to stop the growth in unemployment.  The optimism that we heard from Minister Dukes in 1985 is echoed by his successor, Deputy Bruton, in 1986.</P>
      <P>The House will be pardoned for being a little dubious and a little cynical about those messages of optimism at the beginning of the year which are not backed up by reality as the year goes on.  We have had, in recent years, an unparalleled drop in oil prices.  <i>The Economist</i> used to quote light Arabian Crude spot as the standard at about $28 12 months ago and it has dropped, using North Sea Brent as the standard, to about $12&mdash;it dropped down to $10 and even below at one time.  Consequently that huge amount of money that was lifted straight out of our economy and placed in the economy of the Middle East or Britain or Norway is available and should be available to encourage investment both private and governmental and impact on employment which was the major objective of Deputy Dukes's budget last year and which remains a major objective because there has not been any success in that field.  When, by direct Government action, will the benefits of this reduction in oil prices be allowed to trickle down, to seep through to the various sectors of our economy without having penal taxes or excise duties imposed by the Government in office?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Inflation has also been referred to and some credit taken by the administration for the drop in inflation.  There has been a drop in inflation.  The two major impacts on inflation were in 1973 with a much greater and more serious one in 1979 when there was a big boost because of the oil boost at that time.  The drop in <Col N="1361" /> oil prices now has enabled the consumer price index to drop and, in our contention, it should have dropped still more. It is my opinion that the drop in inflation on its own is worthless as a stimulus to the economy.  Anybody who studied the economic history of the thirties would know that a £1 in 1939 would buy more than a £1 at the beginning of the thirties, at least before the big Wall Street crash. But the sad thing was that there was no developmental philosophy until Keynes came along and while the pound would buy a good deal it was impossible to get a hold of the pound.  The Government should take that into consideration when they are talking about the benefits of inflation.  The benefits of inflation, if there is no developmental philosophy, will simply make people who are already employed a little bit better off and will leave the others either rotting in unemployment or, if they have the initiative&mdash;as many of them have at the moment&mdash;taking to the emigrant ships or the emigrant planes.  We do not see any <i>sursum corda</i> in this Finance Bill.  While we have a short sentence about optimism from the Minister, we do not have anything like the kind of developmental policies that we should have to justify this optimism or hope for the future.</P>
    <P>I almost dislocate my jaws laughing when various Ministers, including the Minister with responsibility for the Office of Public Works, come here and talk about the benefits of the house improvement scheme.  This should be impacting now on employment in the building and construction industry.  I have some statistics to hand.  As on 28 March 1986, there were 237,204 people on the register.  In building, contracting and works of construction there are 48,000 people unemployed. These people have skills but no opportunity to deploy them because of a lack of a proper developmental plan.  In the Central Statistics Office leaflet covering February 1986, dated 27 March 1986, it is estimated that the level of employment in building and construction firms with five or more persons engaged decreased by 2.9 per cent over January 1986, and fell by 10.9 per cent in the 12 months <Col N="1362" /> since February 1985.  Will people stop trying to sell us this dummy that there are a few schemes which are bringing life back to the building and construction area, because it is simply not true.  It is time we spoke the truth in this House, faced reality and demanded proper developmental schemes that will impact in this area.</P>
    <P>I have here the statistics published by the Central Statistics Office giving tonnes of cement sold in 1983, 1984 and 1985. The average for 1983 was 115,200 tonnes, in 1984 it was 108,200 tonnes and in 1985 it was 102,800 tonnes.  The situation is getting worse as time goes on.  In December 1985 the figure was 66,900 tonnes as compared with 70,100 tonnes in 1984 and 80,500 tonnes in 1983.  This shows that the figure has dropped from 80,500 tonnes in 1983 to 66,900 tonnes in 1985, a very substantial drop.  In the face of the facts let us read the cement sales, read the unemployment figures in this industry, stop this codology and ask the Government, and this House, to do something practical and effective with regard to the building and construction industry.</P>
    <P>We should look at the volume of retail sales and see what grounds there are for the optimism the Minister was talking about.  I am referring to the volume of sales which is the only genuine touchstone because of the differences in prices. With a base of 100 in 1980, the average figure for 1985 was 91.8: this shows that from 1980 to the end of 1985 there was a drop of almost 10 per cent.  I am not being cynical when I look askance at statements from the Minister for Finance about optimism and hopes for the future.  According to the figures provided by the Central Statistics Office from January to December 1985 18 per cent of the work force were unemployed.  At 28 March 1986, in round figures there were 237,204 people unemployed.</P>
    <P>On a number of occasions in the past I spent some time talking about the European Monetary System, the desirability of having a petro-currency based on the EMS, the desirability of getting Britain involved in the EMS and so on.  Some of the most influential economic journals <Col N="1363" /> are pushing very hard in that direction. It is not of such significance this year as it has been, but it may become very significant in the future.</P>
    <P>I want to refer now to well placed policies for development which should be a priority.  Some time ago Conniffe and Kennedy did a study on employment and unemployment in Ireland.  I quoted it in this House on a number of occasions not because I regard it as something which has been brought down from the mountain, like the Decalogue but because in my opinion it was doing what we should be doing, namely, looking at employment and unemployment, the women content of unemployment, the increasing number of women in employment and the possibility of emigration.  They dealt with a nil emigration figure, a middle percentage emigration figure and a higher percentage emigration figure, and drew conclusions with regard to employment and unemployment. But in my opinion they did something even more important &mdash; and I am not claiming infallibility for it &mdash; they made an attempt to point the way for developmental policies which would result in increased wealth and increase employment.  That study got no attention in this House.  It got a formal, cold sendoff note from the Government, but nobody addressed themselves to specific problems mentioned in that report.  I dare say this report would have to be updated because emigration is now a reality and when they were carrying out that study it was not, but they were wise enough to see that it could be on the way and they set out three different scenarios.  An updated version of that or some other study geared to the primary objective of the production of wealth and consequently of employment should engage the interest of Members of this House.</P>
    <P>I mentioned oil and the drop in the price of oil.  As the House will understand, coming from a Border constituency I have an interest in the price of petrol, diesel, etc.  Just before I came into the House I rang a friend of mine in Blacklion, a village with just a bridge <Col N="1364" /> between it and Belcoo in County Fermanagh, and asked what the price of a gallon of petrol is at the moment in Belcoo.  It is £2.10.  If there was a filling station left in Blacklion &mdash; which there is not &mdash; the price there would be £2.85. Of course, this is a serious problem for traders along the Border.  The Minister referred to what is happening along the Border.  Everybody in the House knows about it and all the Deputies from all the parties from all the constituencies along the Border from Dundalk to the top of Inishowen have been shouting about it in this House.  It has been taken on board at least statistically by the various Ministers, but sweet damn all has been done about it.  I have talked about light Arabian crude, North Sea Brent etc., and it is all linked into that.</P>
    <P>I come now to the retention tax, or DIRT as it has come to be called.  People have been exercising their ingenuity in criticising and ridiculing it and talking about piggy banks being raided and the few bob taken from the children and so on.  I want to address myself to one matter, taking it from pensioners and refunding it to them.  If it will take a full 12 months to get a refund, many of those pensioners will be dead and the money which they should have got, which should never have been taken from them in the first place, will not be available even to bury them.  I have had representations about this.  People become over nervous perhaps about that period of their lives and about dying.  In particular the more underprivileged are concerned to have a few £s around when they are dying so that they can escape the pauper's grave. Taking £35 out of £100 from pensioners &mdash; or £17.50 out of £50 which would be more or less the range I am talking about &mdash; is unpardonable and the Minister should not take it.</P>
    <P>Can we get a definition of a charity?  It is exercising the minds of many people as to what the technical definition of a charity is.  These areas were mentioned which would be covered by the word &ldquo;charity&rdquo; in something issued by the Revenue Commissioners.  I come from an <Col N="1365" /> area where funds were collected with difficulty by minority religions for various purposes, partícularly educational, recreational and social.  I understand they will be exempt, but I would like to get confirmation of that from the Minister in his reply.  What does this area cover? Does it cover social, recreational and educational funds?  Does the word &ldquo;charity&rdquo; cover all those areas?</P>
    <P>Although it seems to be used as a sledgehammer to crack a nut.  I am pleased with the section of the Bill which covers the area of research and development. Quite regularly the <i>OECD Observer</i> gives us an indication of the percentage of our GNP, Government expenditure, or what have you spent on research and development.  A small country very often has to wait for the results of research and development which can be very expensive coming from other countries.  There is nothing wrong with that, and I am pleased that there is an effort to encourage research and development here.  Sometimes in small scale research and development schemes in this country when something has been researched and developed the benefit goes out of the country.  I have experience of two products in my constituency which were researched and developed by good applied scientists and in one case the benefit moved to Liverpool and in the other case to Newtownards in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>An area which my constituents feel has been neglected by the Minister for Finance is adequate provision for investment in agriculture.  A truism we hear regularly in this House is that our land and what we can get out of it are our greatest resource.  Like many platitudes it is accepted and that is that.  I mentioned the <i>OECD Observer</i> in another context a moment ago.  Recently, Members of the House got an edition of it which indicated how comparatively rich we were even in acreage of arable land &mdash; for example, we have more than Japan has &mdash; but now we are not getting out of it what we should, nor are we investing in it what we should.  We will have to deploy the <Col N="1366" /> investment and encourage development along other lines.</P>
    <P>At times I am inclined to be critical of agricultural scientists who, for example, told farmers in a certain area &mdash; it is the wrong metaphor &mdash; to put all their eggs in one basket, to put all into dairy farming. There is no question about it, the development was needed, and dairying, to which encouragement was given, was the most suitable industry there.  Now we have reached the super-levy and the end of the road in so far as quantity is concerned. Qualitatively we can still do better.  We can get 50 cows to do what 75 had been doing by improving our techniques etc., and then land will be available for another type of development.</P>
    <P>It is a disgrace that in my native village I see stacks of potatoes from the Netherlands piled up.  That village can grow potatoes of far superior quality.  I will not go into that.  I have spoken about it in the House already.  Frozen chipped potatoes to the value of £25 million should not be coming into this country.  The type of potato I am talking about, the ware potato which we were accustomed to eat here, is not suitable for making chips and expensive mistakes were made in that line.  Now we have done some research on that and we know that Dells and Pentland Dells are breeds of potato which will process well.  Investment can go into that area and development which is being blocked in the dairying line, in the beef line where the danger is grave, and in the cereal area, can take place.</P>
    <P>I will not deal with cattle dying and the fodder problem in my area because I have asked the Ceann Comhairle for premission to raise that on the Adjournment.  I hope he will give me an opportunity to do so as it is very important.</P>
    <P>The encouragement of indigenous investment in the Finance Bill is welcome. I will not exult in the removal of the 1 per cent income levy.  Of course I am glad it has happened, but it is like someone banging your head against a wall: you are grateful when it stops.  In the term of the previous Minister VAT was raised and lowered and he looked for <Col N="1367" /> plaudits for doing so.  The 1 per cent levy was supposed to be temporary, but it lasted a long time, and we are now supposed to be delighted at its removal.</P>
    <P>The new child benefit scheme is used in all kinds of illegitimate areas for justifying Government action.  The middle income couple with a large family pay for everything and, although they got an increased tax allowance, the new child benefit scheme is no good to them after a certain stage.  To say that you can justify the removal of subsidies from milk, butter and other foods is no consolation to a person who will not benefit.  There is no point in pretending that the new child benefit will adjust the inequities in regard to those who have to pay for medical treatment for themselves and their children.</P>
    <P>The date for the implementation of social welfare benefits should be brought forward.  I wish to commend the Minister's announcement regarding increased share ownership.  He said that section 8 would reduce the qualifying period for full tax relief from seven years to five years &mdash; in other words, by holding the shares for five years a person could benefit, which is desirable.</P>
    <P>Section 10 deals with the full rates of income tax on dividends paid out of the income of companies qualifying for the 10 per cent rate of corporation tax.  That is a move in the right direction.  I do not know if it will have the desired effect, but the country is crying out for investment and perhaps that will help.  I should like the Minister to publish a list of companies which qualify for that relief.  I have already mentioned the retention tax and I will not go over it again.  However, the Minister has not justified the most glaring examples of inequity following from it.  I know that the banks had been jabbering about the advantages which the building societies had and I suppose the introduction of this tax was to make the tax more equitable between the two groups.  Some people seem to think that there will be a greater element of confidentiality in the banking business as a result of the tax <Col N="1368" /> and that there will be considerable advantages. Needless to say, I do not have any great funds for investment, but many people complained over the years that there was not sufficient confidentiality in regard to banks and that people who were exempt from tax here because they were living in other countries did not have confidentiality in regard to their transactions with the Irish banks because of the system or the income tax authorities. They felt very aggrieved by this.  The Minister felt he had to defend himself against a charge of double taxation in regard to the retention tax and he said that interest had always been subject to tax.  That is a partial truth because individual amounts up to £50 were free of tax.  That is concealment of the truth rather than a direct falsity.</P>
    <P>At present modest sums of money in banking and other institutions which are subject to tax can deprive a person of a non-contributory old age pension.  I see such people in my clinics.  They have saved a couple of thousand pounds, many of them living very frugally to do so in order to make themselves feel secure. What will happen in future in that regard? Will the money which they have in financial institutions have to be revealed resulting in the non-payment of the contributory old age pension?  Perhaps the Minister for Finance or the Minister for Social Welfare will make a statement in that regard.  I am very pleased that the black economy will be taxed.  After all, the money he or she makes will have to be lodged somewhere.  If income tax is paid on that money, it is to the benefit of the Exchequer and, if proper use is made of the money, it will also be to the benefit of the people.</P>
    <P>I recall with some pride that the announcement to develop the inner city was made after I had put down a motion asking for development of the Dublin docks area.  In particular, I called for residential and office development, the development of manufacturing industry and sporting and recreational facilities.  I am glad that something is being done about this and that there is a provision in the Bill to deal with it.  I note that a <Col N="1369" /> special Bill has been published about such development.  There is a marvellous opportunity here for an overall plan and it is important that architects and planners of distinction and taste should be in on this project.  The publications of Mr. Beard with regard to the development of the London docks area are of interest in this regard and we may have an opportunity of debating them in the House shortly. With good planning and design and a proper mixture this money will be well spent.  I am aware that there has been an invitation for private investment, as well as public investment, and I am sure the House will not suffer from any ideological hang-ups on that provided the project gets under way.</P>
    <P>With regard to home improvement grants &mdash; they were referred to by the Minister of State at the Department of Finance earlier &mdash; I should like to reject the claims being made for that scheme. We have heard the figure of 3,000 jobs but that is <i>stercus taurinum.</i> There is not any such development and the statistics I have quoted from the Central Statistics Office with regard to the number of skilled people out of work, not to talk about the ones who have gone, and the fall in the sales of cement, are indications that something better will have to be thought up for that sector.  Fianna Fáil are studying that area with a view to the selection of worthwhile and economy enriching projects.  I should like to refer in passing to the fact that when Fianna Fáil had an inner city development plan ready it was ridiculed and reviled and drums were beaten about extravagance and excess but the exact same plan today has become a respectable one.  All one has to do, apparently, is to live long enough and one's respectability increases.</P>
    <P>I welcome the 10 per cent reduction for services.  We have been concentrating a little bit too much &mdash; it is almost a heresy to say this in the House because it has become a type of belief on all sides &mdash; on manufacturing industry.  An analysis of employment in the US which is regarded, despite the big deficit, as the most powerful economic unit in the world &mdash; watch out Japan; watch out USSR <Col N="1370" />&mdash; shows the high percentage of people employed in the service industries.  That is an indication of the importance we should attach to that sector.  The reduction to 10 per cent is something to be desired.</P>
    <P>The petrol, oil and car tax path has been trod sufficiently.  As far as my area is concerned, and the country in general, that area needs urgent attention.  That, and the added car expense of insurance, particularly for young people, are matters the House, which is supposed to be dealing with the realities of life here, should address.  The Minister has harmed those living along the Border with the increase in VAT from 23 per cent to 25 per cent.  It is like trying to confuse Pavlov's dogs; take something off one year and put it on the next year; applaud one year and decry the next year.  The reality is that for the traders along the Border a 2 per cent increase in VAT is a hard blow.  It can be said that at times in our economic history the flow of money was the other way, from Newry to Dundalk or Derry to Buncrana.  Where there are large conurbations the problem is not as great as it is in my constituency where we do not have large towns to attract people to buy things when items are cheaper on this side of the Border.  Many people in my constituency head for Enniskillen and little towns like Clones are severely affected.  Other towns like Belturbet and Ballyconnell also suffer.  I do not have to go through all the towns that suffer because the House realises the problem.  If that happened in other countries there would be a revolt, trucks and tractors would block the roads and business in the area brought to a standstill. It may be a dangerous thing to say that but the people are very patient about the whole thing considering how severely handicapped they are.</P>
    <P>As the DIRT was introduced to bring some kind of balance between the building societies and the banks the 9 per cent was hammered on to the insurance people lest they would have an advantage over the building societies and the banks. I do not intend to do an analysis of that <Col N="1371" /> but my criticism is that taxing is something that discourages people from keeping their money in the country or investing it here.  The Minister, in the course of his speech, made an important point about young farmers.  He told us that section 92 provides for the continuation of the stamp duty exemption for transfers of agricultural land to young trained farmers.  He said he was conscious of the fact that the scheme had over the past four years facilitated the transfer of land to young farmers.  That is correct and has been the experience of people dealing with young farmers.</P>
    <P>The Minister also said that he was conscious of the fact that its indefinite extension would remove the urgency for an early transfer of land and so would defeat the object of the scheme.  That is where I part company with the Minister.  Admittedly, if the intention is to ginger up some people to make the transfer as quickly as possible and that this will be followed by a big influx of young farmers into the offices of solicitors to take over the land, it is not a bad idea but I hope it is only pretence and that the scheme will be continued after next September, as mentioned in the Bill.  It is a great incentive. The second incentive which is more important than the first is the education element in this area.  The Minister reduced the limit from 35 to 30 and said the qualifying ACOT courses will be extended from 100 to 150 hours.  When I heard that I wrote to the ACOT director general to inquire about the matter.  A man from a farming background, he was pleased with the scheme and its extension. The fact is that he will find it somewhat difficult to gear up the ACOT courses.  There are 50 extra hours being added and that has not been implemented as of yet.  One might well ask what good that will be to a young chap of 16 or 17 about to begin a course.  Even though September next has been mentioned it is highly desirable that the Minister should go on record indicating that the scheme will be continued after September next. The scheme carries two advantages &mdash; one, the encouragement of the transfer <Col N="1372" /> of land, and the other very significant one of increasing the education and expertise of the farming community.</P>
    <P>There were many other matters with which I had intended dealing in the transport and education areas but I see there are two more speakers and I shall refrain from doing so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>In the short time remaining &mdash; and I want to facilitate Deputy Sheehan within that period &mdash; I will confine my remarks to a few aspects of this Bill rather than range more widely over it as I would wish had I been given a fuller opportunity to speak.</P>
      <P>Both Ministers for Finance whom we have had in office this year made great play about the concessions being given in income tax in the budget and in the Finance Bill.  If there is any one area in which it is necessary to grant concessions, because of the appalling disincentive obtaining, it is that of income tax.  I would ask the House to examine the figures, ascertaining where those concessions with regard to income tax have been granted.  The 1985 yield from income tax was £2,103 million.  The estimated yield for this year is £2,356 million, showing an increase income tax burden of £253 million or 12.03 per cent higher than it was last year.  It should be remembered that this is taking place at a time when the now projected rate of inflation for this year is between 2½ per cent and 3 per cent.  In other words, we have an increase in the income tax take this year four times greater than the rate of inflation.  If that does not constitute a considerably heavier burden in income tax in real terms I do not know what does.  It seems to be absolutely ridiculous to suggest that the provisions of the budget or of this Bill do anything other than increase very seriously, in real terms, the impact of income tax on taxpayers generally this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is worth examining the deposit interest retention tax, which has been so widely criticised and which has been amended in a very minor, cosmetic way in the Bill by the Minister for Finance. <Col N="1373" /> Notwithstanding those cosmetic amendments, the yield from this tax is estimated to remain the same.  That underlines how cosmetic are the amendments.</P>
    <P>In this respect I should like to refer to a statement of the Minister for Finance on 4 April, when the Finance Bill was circulated, made at a press conference on that day.  He said, in relation to changes made in this DIRT tax, that anywhere the line is drawn there will be genuine cases on the wrong side of it and that the only way of avoiding that would have been refunds for all non-liable persons. However, he said that was ruled out because it would have been far too costly, that it probably would have reduced the yield of the tax in 1987 by £60 million.  I do not think that figure has been adverted to at all.  It underlines what an incredible new imposition of tax this is.  The estimate of the yield of this tax for 1987 is £100 million, but if all people who are not liable to tax were excluded from it the yield would be reduced by £60 million.  In other words, 60 per cent of this tax is being collected from people who would not otherwise be liable for income tax because their incomes are so low.  If that is not injustice written with a capital &ldquo;I&rdquo;, I cannot imagine what is.  These are not my figures, or the estimates of an economist or somebody else.  They are the figures of the present Minister for Finance, who said that if those who were not liable to income tax were excluded then 60 per cent of the yield would be done away with.</P>
    <P>Therefore, it is the most cruel and vicious tax one could imagine if 60 per cent of it is going to be paid by people whose present incomes are so low they are not liable to any income tax.  God knows, there are not many people in this country who are not liable to any income tax.  That sort of tax is proceeded with and given a popular face, as far as the Government are concerned, by describing it, as it was in the budget and this statement of the present Minister for Finance, as a tax on financial institutions.  It is even described in the Finance Bill as a tax on deposit takers and, therefore, financial institutions.  The truth is that it <Col N="1374" /> is nothing of the kind.  The banks do not mind.  They are not paying the tax.  The tax is being paid by depositors and not be deposit takers.  This fallacy that it is the financial institutions that are being hit and that nobody worries too much about them is perpetrated by the Government in order to give a populist impression to what they are endeavouring to do and, I suppose, in deference to their colleagues who have ideological hangups about these things, who think that if one attacks a financial institution one must therefore be doing a very good thing for the country irrespective of the damage it does to individuals or the economy at large.</P>
    <P>In that context of financial institutions it is worth drawing attention to another financial institution on which taxes are imposed for, presumably, similar ideological purposes, that is, the purported tax on life assurance companies.  It is described in those terms but it would be my suggestion that there is a very considerable fallacy in that description because the tax will operate as a tax on ordinary people who take out ordinary life assurance policies, paying the premium every year, six months or whenever. The former Minister for Finance, in his Budget Statement, said that a 15 per cent levy would be charged on the gross income and funds of life assurance companies during 1986.  As a result of that proposal I understand there were strong representations made to the Department of Finance.  I understand there was an admission that a serious error of judgment had taken place, because the tax was virtually halved when it come to the Finance Bill and the rate reduced from 15 per cent to 9 per cent.  A promise was extracted that this taxation would operate for the year 1986 only, that a second set of amendments would be introduced on Committee Stage of this Bill in order to implement a different system of taxation on life assurance companies next year and for future years.</P>
    <P>If that is not an admission that what was introduced this year is untenable, I cannot imagine what else it could be.  On paper ostensibly the proposal is that it <Col N="1375" /> will be the life assurance companies that will be taxed and the ostensible reason an attempt is being made to tax them in this fashion is that they have been selling a very large number of what are called guaranteed income or growth bounds in recent years, that these allow people who are in a position to pay a large single premium of a substantial amount of money to obtain a tax free income at a relatively high rate that would not be available to them elsewhere.  It is perfectly arguable that one should seek to get at that device to which these individuals have resorted on a fairly wide scale in recent years.  It was adverted to by the then Minister for Finance in 1983 when he said changes would be made in the 1984 Bill to that effect, but the changes did not happen then, though discussions took place and it was made clear by the Department and the industry that any changes that would be made would not be retrospective but would apply to new business written after the change.</P>
    <P>Nothing happened in 1985, but suddenly in 1986 changes were made, ostensibly to take account of guaranteed income bonds and guaranteed growth bonds.  In fact, the changes apply to all the funds of life assurance companies other than their industrial branches, which would be very small, or their foreign business or credit unions and similar things which would not arise.  Now we are forced to draw the conclusion that the proposals as drafted amount to a tax on small savers rather than lump sum investors.</P>
    <P>All this is set out in section 85.  Though there will be a substantial tax liability arising from the several hundreds of millions of pounds invested in guaranteed bonds in recent years, the tax bill will not be paid by the investors of those huge sums because their benefits in virtually all cases are guaranteed by law under the contracts they have entered into.  Instead, the bill will be passed on in one way or another by reduced benefits in regular premium policies through which people are insuring their lives against unfortunate contingencies such as the death of <Col N="1376" /> the wage earner rather than entering into arrangements to avoid payment of tax. The retrospective nature of the tax will undermine the security of the prospective benefits of all policy holders.</P>
    <P>In some cases it has been stated that the solvency of companies would be in question as a result of this retrospection. This is obviously a major concern to the insurance industry here, following so soon after the collapse of two major general insurance companies in Ireland. Companies which are not immediately threatened by insolvency will have only one way to meet a retrospective liability without reneging on promised benefits, and that is to draw on working capital.  As in any other business, the use of working capital to pay taxes can place severe and total restrictions on the ability to trade in the future.  In the life assurance business, working capital is essential both to finance future new business and to underpin the security of benefits for current policy holders.</P>
    <P>In summary, I submit that the proposal to raise a substantial amount of tax revenue on a retrospective basis from the life assurance industry must take account of the industry's ability to pay, without creating insolvency or causing broken promises to policy holders.  This is not some remote point that might arise in the future if this is to be operated in a particular way.  The life companies have adverted to this in a way which is extremely detrimental to the well being and financial standing of Ireland.  I will refer to the 1985 annual report of the Canada Life Assurance Company, perhaps one of the largest life companies in the world, a mutual company based in Toronto, writing business in nearly every civilised country in the world.  On page 8 of their directors' report on operations for 1985 they find it necessary, though Ireland is only a tiny part of their world wide activities, to devote a paragraph to developments in Ireland since the end of the financial year because of the proposed retrospection into that year.  I will quote that paragraph:</P>
    <P>At the end of January, 1986, the <Col N="1377" /> Government of the Republic of Ireland introduced a Budget which, if the proposals were passed, would institute a 15 per cent tax on insurance company investment income.  Not only would this tax be retroactive to January 1985 but it would tax very heavily our nonparticipating deferred annuity business where pricing margins and the terms of the policies make it possible to recover the tax from either Irish policy holders or the pricing margins in our products. The proposed tax is unfair as it could, in effect, place a burden on policy holders not resident in Ireland.  Discussions are taking place with the Irish Government about the proposed tax and negotiations are continuing to try to ameliorate and clarify the matter. We are hopeful that substantial changes in the proposed tax will result.</P>
    <P>Since that was written some weeks ago the proposed tax has been reduced from 15 per cent to 9 per cent, but the principle is exactly the same, the difficulties and the unfairness of the retrospection are no less.  The necessity for this tax to be paid not by the people who have the benefit of the bonds and not by the companies but by the ordinary policy holders has not changed in any way.</P>
    <P>It is not just Canada Life that have felt it necessary to draw attention already in formal annual reports and to put a note in the accounts for the Republic of Ireland and make a provision in the accounts for the Republic of Ireland for retrospective tax: a number of the larger British companies, I understand, have discussed this matter and have conveyed to the Department of Trade in London their strong feelings about it.  They have asked the Department of Trade to convey those feelings to the Departments of Industry and Commerce and Finance here.  The general feeling of those British companies is that this proposal and its nature call into question the wisdom of continuing to write life assurance in Ireland.  That is a very serious matter for Ireland which goes far deeper than so-called taxes on financial institutions, taking up to £40 <Col N="1378" /> million extra from some insurance company or bank.  Nobody cares very much about those.</P>
    <P>In each case the tax is not on the financial institutions, although it is portrayed in that way by the Government.  In each case the tax will be on the person doing business with the financial institutions. The Government seek to could the issue and to mislead people in this respect.  Not alone, therefore, are they doing considerable harm to individual depositors here, and no harm to the financial institutions concerned, but in the case of life assurance they are doing tremendous harm to ordinary life policy holders here and in other countries, because the funds available in other countries will have to be made available to pay this retrospective tax being charged on money that was set aside in funds to meet liabilities which cannot be changed by the companies if there is to be retrospective taxation.  The boards of companies concerned and their managements will not stand for that.</P>
    <P>They consider that, if this is allowed by this House to happen, it will happen again.  They take the view that they will have to consider the wisdom of continuing to write life assurance in this country or, if they do, to continue to write it on the same basis as previously, where Irish policy holders would have access to the funds of the worldwide organisation. Rather, Irish policyholders will be forced to rely on Irish assets only, the Irish assets of a newly formed subsidiary of the company, which is far less attractive from that point of view.</P>
    <P>The Minister should seriously consider the whole problem raised by section 85 of this Bill.  It is perhaps not likely to set the world on fire because it has been put across by the Government in a way which is misleading &mdash; and I can only conclude deliberately misleading &mdash; as some form of tax on large institutions which will have no effect on ordinary people.  It will have a very great effect on ordinary people.  So far as the insurance aspect is concerned, it also has a serious effect on the financial standing of this country worldwide.</P>

      <P>I congratulate the Minister for Finance on this Bill.  Nobody else could have introduced such a comprehensive Finance Bill.  I appeal to my friends on the other side of the House for the cooperation which is the keynote of success. We stand or fall on the Bill before the House.  The Minister is faced with a tremendous challenge.  The Government must spend two-thirds of the country's domestic output.  Government borrowing is proportionately by far the highest of the OECD countries.  One-third of the tax revenue must go on interest payments for previous borrowings &mdash; and I emphasise the word &ldquo;previous&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We must tackle the problem of unemployment. We should increase by 20 per cent the natural gas offtake.  This would increase State revenue by about £25 million immediately and hundreds of additional jobs would be provided on pipeline construction.  The success of the East Link bridge across the Liffey indicates that roads and bridges can be built without cost to the State, if we pursue the right policy.  Where possible, stretches of roads and bridges should be offered for competitive tender to private firms. There is need for massive investment in housing, roads, natural gas distribution and industry.  The level of economic activities and opportunities for employment can be raised without increasing State expenditure.  There is need for radical and imaginative measures to stimulate and foster growth in investment and employment, while stopping the spiral of public spending and penal taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The road development plan of 1980 indicates an investment requirement from the State of £1,500 million during this decate in order to bring our national primary routes up to the minimum international standards.  What primary route milage have we in south-west Cork, an area far greater today than several county Council territories?  We have not one mile <Col N="1380" /> of national primary road.  A native Government sold our railway system and left us in that position.</P>

      <P>Who created the potholes? It was the Deputy's party that caused those potholes in south-west Cork, because there was no rescue package from them when we suffered the dreadful blow of the loss of our railway system. There was a rescue package when Whiddy collapsed, thanks to a good Coalition Government.</P>
      <P>To bring our roads up to EC standards would cost the Exchequer £3,000 million, but public spending on roads is estimated at £140 million for 1986.  I urge the Department to investigate as much as possible the use of private enterprise in the construction of roads and bridges.  We must create a climate in which enterprise can prosper.  This will generate growth and create the jobs which are so badly needed.</P>
      <P>Europe should be a large home market for us to explore.  We should sell our wares there.  It is a challenge to which we should rise; our future depends on it.  The mood is changing.  At long last we have turned the corner.  We can boast of a few achievements.  We have the largest lead crystal plant in Europe, one of the largest breweries in Europe, the largest manufacturing company of industrial diamonds in Europe and the largest single cheese processing plant in Europe, the largest beef operating plant and the largest aluminium plant in Europe.  Much has been achieved, but much more remains to be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The recent collapse of sterling had major implications for our export manufacturers. The price at which our products can be sold on the British market is now more than 10 per cent lower than six months ago and the cost of importing consumer products has dropped substantially. It is essential that immediate adjustments be made in all sectors of the economy to reflect the very significant cost changes of the last two months, to <Col N="1381" /> maintain the viability of manufacturing industry and to protect employment. There are no short-cut policies for the survival of this country.  It is illusory to believe that the creation of service jobs can be anything but a short term measure if not accompanied by industrial growth. Our primary economic and social focus must be on creating conditions enabling a 10 per cent expansion of industry, thereby benefiting the economy.  Since 1973 industry has expanded by an average of 5 per cent per year.  Despite two major international recessions, now more than 50,000 people are employed than were employed in 1975.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>The expansion of employment here was hardly noticed because of the simultaneous rise in population of more than 500,000 in that period.  This swelled the ranks of the unemployed.  Faster industrial growth is necessary to support this population.  We produce less than 1 per cent of the European industrial output.  I urge a national commitment to increasing that share to 1.5 per cent within the next seven years in order to achieve a major cutback in unemployment.  This cannot be brought about without an unswerving commitment on the part of the Government to provide a supportive environment as well as a commitment from all industrialists, who must play their special part.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to repeal the VAT charge at point of entry.  This is a crippling tax imposition and is hindering the development of industry and the creation of jobs.  I thought it was intended to look seriously at that when the Coalition <Col N="1382" /> Government took over and still think it should be done.</P>
    <P>This country is exceptional in the speed with which an individual starts to pay tax at an extremely high rate. The taxation system provides a very strong disincentive, even at relatively low incomes, to further increase one's earnings or output. Why not give recognition for every additional worker taken on by an employer. If we did that, and gave a tax reduction as an inducement to take on these additional employees, it would save the State millions of pounds in unemployment benefit and assistance.  Development of our economy will depend largely on the success in reducing Government spending compatible with high economic growth. The ability to achieve that goal is seriously undermined by high Government spending and taxation.  There can be little doubt that a more aggressive and more innovative policy could play a major role in reducing unemployment. The orientation towards innovation is very low because of lack of opportunity for private individuals to make a net tax profit.  The imposition of the highest capital gains tax in Europe, inadequate technological skills and the lack of a strong, innovative structure throughout Irish society are inhibiting factors.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. J. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Members of the House for their contributions.  I will begin by advertising to some points made by Deputy Sheehan. He is correct in saying that what is needed is a spirit of innovation in the technological field.  This is something which can be provided in a number of ways.  It can be done through tax concessions such as we have introduced in this budget whereby people who put money into the development of a new product will be able to write off that money for tax purposes, as long as the product is developed and the employment given as a result is in Ireland.  That is part of the ingredient. We are, to the best of my knowledge, the first country in Europe to introduce a specific tax concession designed to assist research and development.  Other countries such as Britain have introduced schemes such as the business expansion scheme designed to help manufacturing generally.  There is no doubt that we in Ireland spend less proportionately on research and development and new products. This is due to a number of reasons one of them probably being the relatively low profitability of firms, but I hope this will improve as a result of increased demand in the economy following on the reduction in oil prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Sheehan referred to the lack of an innovative culture in this country. No tax measure can remedy that.  Our people must develop the idea that they <Col N="1384" /> are being educated not simply to work for somebody else, doing what somebody else tells them to do, but to work for themselves and ultimately to be their own employer.  That encapsulates essentially the spirit of innovation we wish to encourage.</P>
    <P>The need for innovation could best be illustrated by a visit to a supermarket or a hardware store.  If one looks along the shelves in one such shop and asks how many of the products were not on the shelves five years ago, one will probably find that half of them were not on the market five years ago.  The logical corollary is that half the goods at present on the shelves will not be there in five years time since they will no longer be in demand because they have become absolescent technologically or in terms of taste.</P>
    <P>If we are to survive in the race to hold our share of the world food market or the manufacture market we must constantly develop new products.  It is very important and could well be of historic value in the long term development of this country that we are providing in the 1986 Finance Bill a tax concession specifically designed to encourage people to put private money into research and development. This is being done for the first time in Europe.  Obviously making a tax incentive of this kind available is better than giving grants because people who are putting their own money in will want to be quite sure that the research project has a prospect of producing something which will be sold at a profit; otherwise there would be no royalties returning to the original investors.  We are combining a generous tax concession with a profitdriven incentive to the investor.  I hope this tax concession will be seen in five, ten or 15 years' time to be of equivalent importance to the Irish food and manufacturing industries as was the initiative of one of my predecessors, the late Deputy Gerry Sweetman, in introducing export tax relief which undoubtedly was responsible for the transformation of Irish industry throughout the sixties and even into the seventies.  I hope the initiatives in this Bill will have some similar effect <Col N="1385" /> in renewing Irish industry in the same sense.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the importance of this Bill for agriculture, still our most important industry, apart perhaps from electronics. It is more important in terms of employment and slightly less important in terms of value of its exports.  Some will perhaps not have recognised the extent of the contribution that is being made to the development of agriculture in this Bill. They may be tempted to look solely at the provisions which have the word &ldquo;farmer&rdquo; attached.  It is important to recognise the potential of each of these incentives designed to assist the development of manufacturing: the business development scheme which is designed to bring more outside equity to business, the research and development scheme, the reduction in the rate of income tax on income from dividends in manufacturing, the reduction in capital gains tax for companies floated on the smaller companies market or on long term gains generally to 30 per cent.  Each one of those incentives designed to get more investment will not just be of benefit to the manufacturing industry but will also be of benefit to the food industry by enabling that industry to get more capital to develop new products which, without the provisions of this Bill, would not be available.</P>
    <P>Necessary thought such forms of EC aids as export subsidies, intervention and so on may be for the generality of products, the future of Irish agriculture must be in the area of the development of new products that can be sold on their own merits, products that have been well developed in terms of research and development and also of market research and development.  Therefore, the provisions in this Bill are of critical importance and value to the development of agriculture. By providing a means whereby products processed from the farm can be sold at a profit, we are providing the basis for secure, durable and good prices for farmers in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>It is my intention that there will be growth in the area of the various incentives designed to assist the productive sector&mdash;the business development <Col N="1386" /> scheme that has been extended to 1991, the research and development scheme, the dividend scheme, and so on.  It is my intention that my Office as Minister for Finance will be used to the maximum extent possible to promote each of these schemes and thereby to attract more investment to the productive sector.  It is extremely important that everyone responsible to me and to the Revenue Commissioners as well as to those Departments associated traditionally with the development of the productive sectors&mdash;the Departments of Agriculture and Industry and Commerce&mdash;should see themselves as engaged in a common endeavour to make these new tax incentives work because the most effective way of broadening the tax base, something that is being sought earnestly by many commentators, is by putting more people back to work and creating wealth for our country on a viable basis.</P>
    <P>I am anxious that the tax base should be broadened and that more revenue should accrue to the Exchequer, not by way of increases in rates of tax but by having more people in a position to pay tax.  The best way to achieve the objectives of the Revenue Commissioners, of the Department of Finance and of the Government as a whole, is to encourage productive activity.  Consequently, it is my intention to promote these incentives in every way possible, both publicly and directly and in contact with anyone in a position to invest.  From the contributions that have been made to the debate I am confident that in that endeavour we will have the support of all parties, including the people directly opposite, even if we have support for little else.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is extremely important, too, that people, whatever their position, own a share in a productive business.  That is important in the context of building as wide a constituency as possible for the creation of wealth.  It is why <Col N="1387" /> I have provided in this Bill for improvements in what are already general provisions for the giving of shares in companies to workers employed by those companies. It is beyond doubt that when employees of a company own part of that company, their loyalty and commitment to the company and their efficiency in reaching the company's objectives are far greater than is the case if there is some artificial division created in the constructs of traditional industrial relations between workers and management.</P>
      <P>The population generally should be encouraged to avail of the provision whereby income from dividends in manufacturing will be subject to a rate of income tax that is virtually half the rate they would pay if their income was derived from another source, that is, a rate of about 25 per cent on income from manufacturing companies if those companies are subject to the 10 per cent tax rate.  It is important that this incentive be availed of by every family in the community. I have no wish to see a situation in which only those who traditionally have invested in manufacturing, only those who have regarded themselves traditionally as people of some financial substance, take up these incentives to invest in the productive sector.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt that the traditional operation of the Stock Exchange is not suited to promoting wide share ownership among the population.  Stockbrokers' offices in obscure streets somewhere in the Dublin 2 area are not accessible to the broad mass of our people.  If we are to promote widespread share ownership in productive Irish manufacturing companies which are providing jobs and making profits for the shareholders, the Stock Exchange and the other institutions interested in finance must find ways of offering their services direct to ordinary people through normal outlets for financial transactions.</P>

      <P>The evidence, I would suggest to them, is that this policy does not lead to increases in employment.  The evidence, for instance, from countries such as Denmark indicates that they have been able, while reducing substantially the amount of government expenditure, to increase employment by 100,000 and reduce unemployment by 40,000.  Clearly, to my mind, the notion that Government spending and new schemes, new Departments and new promises create jobs is, in fact, directly contrary to the evidence.  The evidence suggests that the best way of creating more employment is by prudent management of the public finances.</P>

      <P>This is something Deputies on the other side of the House might usefully contemplate.  I am struck by some of the promises Deputies on the other side of the House have made.  For instance, Deputy O'Kennedy, in the course of his contribution, indicated that he would spend somewhere in the region of £70 million.  He wanted to spend £50 million on reductions in VAT on the building industry and £20 million or more on reductions in duty on diesel.  That, of course, is added to the £200 million which Deputy Burke told us over the weekend he would spend on the construction sector.  I would have to ask Deputies on the other side of the House where will this £270 million Deputy O'Kennedy and Deputy Burke talk of come from?  Will it come down from Heaven?  Is there some fairy godmother, perhaps in America, Deputy Haughey has been in touch with who will provide this money?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no doubt that there is nobody in the world, be they foreign banks or otherwise, who will provide a living for the Irish people other than the Irish people themselves.  Therefore, it is extremely important, if I may say so, that <Col N="1391" /> before Deputies opposite make promises, such as the £270 million worth of promises made in combination between Deputy O'Kennedy and Deputy Burke, they should say where the money is coming from.  The people would like to know.</P>
    <P>Indeed, that is a question Deputy Haughey himself might usefully ponder because I think it is fair to say that his address over the weekend set a new concept of Fairyland.  He was certainly in a position that he was elevated above the delegates.  I would also say he was probably elevated to the extent that his feet were at least three feet above the ground, because he was certainly not speaking in any sense of reference to reality in the promises he was making.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to recall the fact that, about a year or 18 months ago, at a time when the party opposite had a very high level of support in the polls &mdash; they are now about 11 points below that &mdash; Deputy O'Kennedy was rapped over the knuckles for having the temerity to suggest that he might have some ideas about restructuring the tax code.  He was told by his leader, Deputy Haughey: &ldquo;Tut tut, you are not supposed to be saying things like that.&rdquo;  Something has changed because, over the past weekend, every spokesman who spoke at the Fianna Fáil Ard Fheis seemed to have been given precise riding instructions: &ldquo;Do not worry about the cost; promise as much as you can.  We are desperate.  Our standing in the opinion polls has dropped 11 points.  It is time to dust down the tactics of 1977 and start promising all over again. That is the line we have to throw out.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>So, the mantle of responsibility in which Deputy Haughey clothed himself in such a statesmanlike mien a year or 18 months ago, when he told Deputy O'Kennedy not to be so crass as to be making promises, has somehow or other for some reason been cast aside.  I think this decision to slough off this unwelcome garment could have something to do with the fact that Fianna Fáil support in the polls has fallen from 58 per cent to 47 per cent.  I am glad to say that there were <Col N="1392" /> many people watching what Deputy Haughey had to say on Saturday night. The more he went on the more people I am sure became convinced that the man, sincere and all as he was, was not speaking about or living in the same country that we ourselves are inhabiting.</P>

      <P>I would like to refer further to the development of the construction industry.  I believe the construction industry is a very important part of our economic infrastructure.  However, the construction industry has suffered in the past from politically motivated short bouts of expansion which could not be sustained.  What the construction industry needs for its long term health is&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;a sustained programme of privately financed development which people can pay for because they have the money to pay for it.  To my mind, the most important ingredients for increased prosperity in the construction industry lie in the fact that people this year are going to have a substantial increase in their disposable incomes as a result of the tax reductions contained in the budget; the fact that pay increases were set in relation to a higher rate of inflation than is actually obtaining, 4 per cent to 6 per cent as against 3 per cent; and the fact that oil prices have fallen. These three ingredients &mdash; lower oil prices also mean that coal and other energy prices have fallen as well &mdash; mean many people will have more money in their pockets.  This certainly will mean considerably increased private demand on the part of people for additional housing either in the form of extensions to their existing houses for which substantial incentives have been given and to which there has been a tremendous response or in the form of buying new houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1393" /> The long term future of the construction industry depends on the continuance of the sustained economic recovery and sustained improvement in disposable incomes which is under way at this time. What the construction industry does not need is the sort of temporary short term panic expenditure of funds on ill-thought out projects, which cannot be sustained beyond a period of six to eight months such as the construction industry unfortunately was beset with in the past under Governments of a different colour from the present one.  The best future for the construction industry and for workers in the construction industry is in the pursuit of the current steady policies of the Government which are achieving a substantial improvement in the spending power of ordinary households, because it is ordinary householders buying improved houses who will provide a significant improvement in the position of the construction industry.</P>

      <P>Seeing that Deputy O'Kennedy wants to interrupt, I would perhaps say something to him as well. He spent about a quarter of his speech talking about petrol prices and the fact that the Government were so awful to put 10p on the price of petrol.  Deputy O'Kennedy, as Minister for Finance in 1980, when 20p was worth slightly more <Col N="1394" /> than at present, put 20p on the price of petrol in his budget.  Yet he comes in here and complains about a much more modest impost.  Deputy O'Kennedy should have the wisdom to recall his own record before offering it as advice to others in a situation of considerably greater difficulty than that which he faced.</P>

      <P>I would like to refer further to the position in regard to the deposit interest retention tax.  I would like to reiterate that charities will now be exempt from the tax.  Incapacitated persons and persons aged 65 and over may claim repayment of retention tax deducted to the extent that they would not otherwise be liable to income tax under relevant deposit interest.  There is evidence of some confusion about the eligibility of elderly people for a refund of tax.  I would like to take this opportunity to confirm that it is not necessary to be an old age pensioner in order to benefit from a refund.  All persons aged 65 and over may claim a refund irrespective of their status.  In the case of a married couple it is necessary for only one person of the couple to be aged 65 or over in order to make the claim.</P>
      <P>Some Deputies expressed concern in relation to the procedure for the refund of tax to eligible persons at the end of the tax year.  This procedure is inevitable since it is necessary to wait until the end of the tax year for a taxpayer to prove that he or she has no liability to tax.  I can assure the House that in making refunds every effort will be made by the Revenue Commissioners to ensure that such refunds will be made with a minimum of delay.  There have also been requests&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;by Deputies, particularly Opposition Deputies, for an extension of the exemption to other categories <Col N="1395" /> of persons and bodies.  I must again emphasise that since exemptions are costly to administer, increase the complexity of the tax code and reduce the tax yield, there can be no question of any further concessions being granted. Refunds for all non-liable persons cannot be considered as this would be far too costly.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Kennedy interrupted to ask a question and I will of course answer it. He wanted to know if people aged 65 or over will have to provide details of their income in order to establish that they are not eligible for income tax and therefore entitled to a refund.  Of course, they will. Surely Deputy O'Kennedy is not suggesting that somebody aged 65 or over who has perhaps £1 million on deposit in the bank should be entirely exempt from any tax on that and should not be required to disclose it to anyone?  I am sure that is not what Deputy O'Kennedy would suggest in his more reflective moments.  It is certainly not what I intend to do.  It is my intention to ensure that the Revenue Commissioners will satisfy themselves, as they should, before a refund is made that people are not liable to income tax.</P>

All of them are entitled to claim back the tax if they can establish that they have no tax liability.  Obviously, in order to determine whether or not they have a tax liability, we must be in a position to obtain certain information from them.  I do not think there is anything in the world wrong with that.  I am surprised that Deputy O'Kennedy or any other Deputy would want to criticise such a reasonable provision in the code to prevent the abuse of the tax measure for which the Government have made a decision.</P>

I am glad to say that in the event that any of the ideas they put forward are punctured, 10 per cent rather than a 25 per cent rate of value-added tax will apply to the service concerned.  I am glad to be able to inform Deputy Yates and the party opposite that this will be the case and that the puncture can be mended at the lower rate of tax.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley, interestingly, devoted most of his contribution to pleas on behalf of the insurance companies.  He quoted with approval the international report of the Canada Life Assurance Company published in Toronto recently which had some remarks to make about the Irish Government.  I am sure the Canada Life Assurance Company will be pleased to know that their contributions have been read into the record of Dáil Éireann.  However, I think there were certain contradictions in Deputy O'Malley's approach.  He seemed to suggest on the one hand that the tax would be paid by the companies and that therefore the companies would not want to do business here.  On the other hand, he suggested that it would be paid entirely by the policy holders.  If it is paid entirely by the policy holders there would be no question of the companies being at any loss and if it is being paid entirely by the companies there would be no question of the policy holders being at any loss.  I do not think Deputy O'Malley can simultaneously make the criticism that the tax is undesirable because it is being paid in its entirely both by the companies and by the policy <Col N="1398" /> holders.  His analysis of the facts is therefore somewhat inaccurate.</P>
    <P>However, I am glad to say that the provision is being replaced, in an amendment to the Finance Bill which will be introduced, by a fuller provision to change the basis for calculating corporation profits tax for insurance companies in future.  This will remove anomalies that have existed for some time.  It will put the taxation of these companies on a much more satisfactory basis than has been the case in the past.  I believe that this will prove to be of considerable benefit.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies referred to the concession for young trained farmers who have not paid stamp duty on the transfer of land since I proposed such a concession in the 1982 budget.  I am glad to say that this provision has been extremely successful in two respects, first, in transferring large areas of land to young farmers and also in achieving a much higher degree of interest on the part of farmers in obtaining training from ACOT and other educational institutions in agriculture than would otherwise have been the case.  It has been an outstanding success and a good example of how the tax code can be used to achieve an economically desirable objective.  In my work with Deputy Dukes and other members of the Government in putting together this Finance Bill I have been determined to follow on the example of the success of the concession regarding stamp duty to introduce other similar concessions in the tax code designed to promote economic efficiency and wealth creation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I changed the age limit because I believe it is important that those who are considering transferring land to people between the ages of 30 and 35 years should get on with the job. It should be done between now and 1 October rather than putting it off for another year.  I make no apology for raising the educational qualification under the ACOT scheme for people to qualify. We should try to encourage the transfer <Col N="1399" /> of land to young farmers and to those with higher educational qualifications.</P>

      <P>The Government have no interest in maintaining rates at an unduly high level.  It stands to reason that the should be the case because the Government are a substantial borrower and they have no interest in paying higher rates than they need to pay.  Hence, it is the intention of the Government to do everything they can, along with the other sectors in the money market, to encourage a reduction in interest rates.  Such rates are nothing more than the price of money and the price of money reflects two things, supply and demand.  If demand for money exceeds supply there will tend to be upward pressure on interest rates and when the reverse is the case the pressure is downward.  The Government by interventions of any kind cannot change that unalterable, fundamental reality of the money market but within those constraints it is our intention to encourage the rates in a downward direction. This is because we believe interest rates are a crucial factor inhibiting investment now because they are too high. Lower interest rates will provide the other funds to complement those that will flow into industry and agriculture as a direct result of these most innovative tax initiatives in the Finance Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1400" /> This Finance Bill provides for the extension of the business development scheme to 1991, the first tax concession in Europe for research and development and the first tax concession with regard to income on dividends in manufacturing companies.  No other country in Europe has a similar tax concession to encourage investment in manufacturing.  There is also a special provision for the encouragement of smaller companies and the giving of shares in business to workers in industry.  When these measures are combined it is fair to say they provide the best package ever presented to this House in a Finance Bill in terms of concrete incentives to invest.</P>
    <P>Rather than greeting these measures with the dismissive cynical sneers that we get from the other side of the House, it behoves everyone in the House and in the country interested in the greater prosperity of the country and in increasing the number of employed to give their full support to these incentives.  I can assure the House it is my intention to use whatever influence I have in contacts with those who have money to invest to encourage them to invest in Ireland.  We will not ask them to invest in uses that have no productive value and that merely serve to maintain the value of capital but in active wealth creation in manufacturing and in the food processing sector. That is the best way forward for the country.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the Minister was not in a position to announce on 11 March the news that domestic consumers would benefit from the reduced cost of oil.  We take exception to the fact that on that occasion the Minister promised many things, but he was remiss in not giving the advantage of the reduction in the price of oil to the consumers of the ESB. The Minister said he was pleased to announce the reductions and foresaw a significant reduction in energy costs, higher employment levels and bigger take home packages this year.</P>
      <P>It is interesting to note that it was the Minister who made the announcement which was carried in the media, and that he made it in advance of its being made known through ESB sources.  One would have expected, as in the past, that announcements of this nature would have been made by the board of the ESB.</P>

      <P>It would appear that the Minister has extra control and a veto so far as reductions in electricity costs are concerned, but it is a pity he did not find it possible to grant the decrease in electricity costs to all consumers &mdash; commercial, industrial and domestic.  We take exception to the fact that he omitted granting the reduction for the domestic consumer until September.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He should be aware of the impact electricity prices have on consumers.  One would have expected a member of the Labour Party, a socialist party, to grant any reduction possible to domestic consumers at least at the same time as he was giving an impetus to the commercial <Col N="1405" /> sector.  The fact that he has not given the reduction to the domestic consumers has created considerable hardship for the weaker sections of the community, particularly old aged pensioners, widows and people who over the years have found great difficulty in meeting increased electricity costs.  When one remembers that in the same month the Government announced that they were reducing food subsidies further and removing the children's tax allowance from the taxation code, this shows that this socialist Minister did not recognise the hardship which would be inflicted on domestic consumers. We take exception to that and that is why we moved this motion.</P>
    <P>Old aged pensioners and householders generally are dependent on electricity supply and any reduction which could have been offered between March and September would have been a great help when families were working out their budgets.  It must be borne in mind that, over the past winter, many of our underprivileged and those in the social welfare classes experienced great difficulty in getting full free fuel allowances from the health boards.  This has contributed significantly to the hardship consumers had to bear.  The Minister could have done something particularly useful by announcing a reduction in electricity costs for ordinary domestic consumers when he announced the small reduction for the industrial and commercial sectors.</P>
    <P>Everybody has been talking about the possible benefits that should accrue because of the reduction in the inflation rate and in the cost of oil.  The delay in giving the small benefit of a 5 per cent reduction in electricity prices until next September is unacceptable to us.  We must pose the question: would the Minister have been the one to make the announcement if there was to be an increase in the unit cost of electricity to the commercial, industrial and domestic sectors?  I doubt it very much.  Now that we have reduced costs, resulting in reduced electricity charges, if the reverse situation were to arise between now and next September would the Minister reverse the decision that has already been <Col N="1406" /> taken and would we see the prices increased again?  If oil costs continue to plummet will the Minister come in to give us an increase on the promised 5 per cent reduction next September?  Put a marker down in March that you are going to get a reduction in September, when everybody knows full well that production costs of oil are still falling, really means putting the consumer on the long finger.  We would have thought that the socialist Minister would have taken a different attitude.</P>
    <P>We want the Minister to tell us that he will top up that 5 per cent reduction if oil prices continue to plummet.  The only reason we have this advantage at this time is the falling oil prices and the more favourable púnt-dollar ratio.  Those falling oil prices have eased the problem of global inflation, but we are not getting the advantage from it.  That is our biggest criticism this evening.  Despite the fact that the Taoiseach on a few occasions recently was very vocal about the fact that there will be bigger disposable income in the family budget and that prices in all sectors will be reduced, this has not happened.</P>
    <P>We hear talk about inquiries and the Taoiseach setting up special subcommittees of his Cabinet to look into the reason why we are not benefiting.  Every other economy in the world has been benefiting from these cost reductions and from reduced inflation, but we are not benefiting from them and we resent that greatly. They should have had a profound effect on consumer costs as they have had on consumer and business costs in the US and Europe.  Why is the result not similar reductions here?  We should expect a much larger reduction in the cost of heating oil, diesel and petrol.  We would have expected a major windfall for motorists and electricity users and our principal objection this evening is that that has not been happening, despite the recent protestations of the Taoiseach and the promises made by Government Ministers. The reductions should have had a major impact on industrial costs, because the cost of oil impinges primarily on <Col N="1407" /> transportation, airline costs, bus services, diesel costs, rail costs, and freight costs.</P>
    <P>The farming community should be benefiting magnificently from all these wonderful reductions that were announced by the Minister, but they are not. Diesel, fertiliser and pesticide costs should have been down, but they are not. We resent the fact that the Minister has not taken the initiative to guarantee that those costs be allowed to be passed on to the consumer.</P>
    <P>The recent epic oil plunge was an unbelievable windfall and cheap oil should bring about a giant tax cut, but that has not happened here.  It should result in increased jobs, and the Minister for Energy suggested that that would be the case.  It should result in lower prices for petroleum and petroleum-based products from polyester to gramophone records, but none of these things has happened. Why has the Minister not insisted on suppliers reducing their costs and in particular why has he not taken the initiative in dealing with electricity prices?  A look at price increases over the last few years gives an indication of what exactly the Minister proposes to do.  In the August-September 1983 billing period the unit cost to the domestic consumer was 7.35p.  At that time the ESB were granted an increase of 9.69 per cent.  For the billing period December 1984-January 1985 the domestic unit cost was 7.85p. Standing charges also had increased, although not substantially; and for the most recent billing period, February-March 1986, the domestic rate stands at 8.20p.  Even if the Minister gives the 5 per cent reduction that he promised from 1 September it will mean only 0.40p anyway which will bring the unit cost back to somewhere around 7.8p on the domestic rate.  Therefore, he is not really giving anything like the amount that should be possible because of the reduction in the production cost of oil.</P>
    <P>We all know that crude oil and oil products are internationally traded commodities and that we must meet the price on the international market.  I put it to the Minister this evening that a substantial <Col N="1408" /> number of suppliers, manufacturers in the UK or their agents here in Ireland, have not been passing on the reductions of products that have been manufactured in the UK.  It is now suggested to me by those who know that many of our petrol reductions have not yet been passed on to motorists despite the fact that the Minister talked so loudly about it recently.  The Taoiseach referred to whole lists of products that should have had a cost reduction because of the reduced cost of oil but such cost reduction has not been passed on here.</P>
    <P>Our industrial base needs electricity at internationally competitive rates and our large industries are paying up to 40 per cent more for it here in Ireland than their EC competitors.  It is a very great cost penalty.  When we consider that discounts are not available here to large energy users as they are in other countries we get an idea of the disadvantage being endured by the Irish industrialist.  Electricity costs are greater here than in any other EC country and add up to almost half the total wages of some of our manufacturing industries here.  We do not see that as a means of attracting industry to this country or of allowing electricity to be used properly in the interests of the Irish people.  It is time that the tariff structure that is now biased against the industrial user was changed and a new system of pricing put in place.  We know that the ESB have had considerable difficulties, but that was all gone into as far as the price of electricity was concerned in the Government inquiry announced in June 1982.  What aspects or recommendations of that inquiry have since then been put in place?  The Government have a powerful influence on Irish energy costs. They control the levy, the price of natural gas, all the taxation on fuel oil.  When one considers how much involved the Government are in setting up the price structure for ESB charges we realise that they should take the initiative to see to it that the reduction in the cost of the production of crude oil is passed on directly to the consumer.</P>
    <P>We all know that the price of crude oil is some where between $11 and $12 per <Col N="1409" /> barrel.  It has reduced in the past 12 months from almost $30 per barrel.  Bearing that in mind, a bigger reduction could have been granted by the Minister in so far as electricity prices are concerned. We do not regard it as acceptable that the ESB are allowed to charge the current prices until September as certain sections of the community find it very difficult to meet their bills.  Almost 200,000 families are on the breadline and reducing their electricity costs would have resulted in a major saving in family budgets.  We greatly resent the fact that the Minister is penny-pinching in allowing the existing cost structure to continue until September without giving full advantage of the reductions in inflation and in the price of crude oil to be passed on to the ESB.  We request the Minister to change his mind immediately in this regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion so ably proposed by Deputy Flynn.  The Government's amendment is disappointing. They are merely congratulating themselves on what they have done to help industry but the reduction they are praising is only 6.2 per cent on average for industrial consumers from 1 April which falls far short of what industry needs when one considers that our energy costs are 20 per cent higher for the industrial sector than those of our competitors. Deputy Flynn also pointed out that the cost for energy intensive users can be as much as 40 per cent more than our competitors which makes it very uncompetitive for the industrial sector.  Last year, firms which used large amounts of electricity said that their energy costs were as high as those for wages and salaries. The reduction of 6.2 per cent will be of some help but their costs are very high and they need more relief.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because of the increases in 1984 and earlier this year there has been a loss of jobs in the industrial sector which has been commented on by the CII.  It is essential to get a further reduction for industry and domestic consumers should get the full benefit of the recent reductions in the price of oil.  We must also be concerned about smaller industries which <Col N="1410" /> have been helped by county development teams and the small industries section of the IDA.  These industries will not even get the reduction of 6.2 per cent &mdash; I am talking about light industry &mdash; because they would not use electricity to the same extent as larger firms.</P>
    <P>The domestic consumers are certainly feeling the pinch after the harsh economy and weather of last year and the early part of this year.  Families have lost the food subsidies and the tax free allowance for children has been scrapped in the budget.  They are very disappointed that the 5 per cent reduction in prices will not come into effect until September.  The Taoiseach and various Ministers tell us every day that inflation and prices are falling.  Why are ESB charges not falling? The consumer should get every benefit from the price decrease in oil.  If the Minister of State contacted the health boards and spoke to community welfare officers who have people coming to them daily seeking help in the payment of electricity bills, the Government would immediately pass on the reduction in the price of oil.  There was an increase in electricity charges for the period March-April and then the Minister for Energy has the gall to say that the domestic rate will go down by 5 per cent from 1 September which will cancel the recent increase. We are merely getting compensation for the price increase earlier in the year, which is very disappointing for the weak and elderly section of the community.</P>
    <P>A report published by the Council for the Aged &mdash;<i>The Incomes of the Elderly in Ireland</i>&mdash; made strong recommendations in regard to helping the elderly, especially in relation to the free electricity allowance. Recommendation No. 15 stated that the present scheme should be changed to permit the carry-over of unutilised units from one billing period to another. In other words, if a person in receipt of a free electricity allowance does not use his or her 300 units in a particular billing period, they should be carried over to allow that person up to 1,500 units in a full year.  It is a matter of debate as to why the full units are not used but old people are afraid that, if they use more <Col N="1411" /> than 300 units in the winter or 200 in the summer, they will not be able to afford the cost for the extra units used.  I strongly urge the Minister to look at that proposal and to allow the elderly to use the 1,500 units each year.</P>
    <P>Recommendation No. 16 of the report said that there should be an involvement of the meter reader in assisting the elderly to understand how many units they have and how many free units remain in any period.  This service could be improved and expanded to include subcontractors employed by the ESB for meter reading, to help the elderly wherever possible.</P>
    <P>Recommendation No. 17 said that any schemes operated by the Department of Social Welfare concerning the free electricity allowance should be widely publicised and that voluntary organisations, friends and relatives of elderly people should be involved in explaining the details of the scheme.  If the Minister was in contact with voluntary organisations, particularly the St. Vincent de Paul Society, in rural areas he would realise the problems of the elderly, not only in regard to the workings of the scheme but in regard to health boards who are asked to contribute towards the cost of the bill.</P>
    <P>We must be concerned at the way the western package is being implemented. On a number of occasions I expressed concern to the Minister about this.  I understand that more than 1,500 people have been approved and I hope the Minister will be able to announce soon that the EC have approved a similar scheme.  I hope the next scheme will be more flexible and extended so that people in rural areas who have electricity installed will not find that the balance of the deposit mounts every billing period.</P>
    <P>Many constituents have written to me about the charge imposed on them by the ESB.  One constituent told me that a capital contribution of £968 was being demanded by the ESB.  The final paragraph in the letter from the ESB to that constituent referred to the marvellous offers from the company if a consumer purchased a full electric cooker and a dual immersion group electric water heater.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1412" /> That constituent was informed that he would get free electricity up to £90. Obviously, a person asked to pay almost £1,000 for the installation of electricity will not be in a position to qualify for such marvellous benefits.</P>
    <P>It concerns me that social welfare is being considered as income under the scheme since it was altered.  I hope the Minister removes that anomaly and that the children of any farmer who is building a house can qualify for the electricity subsidy, as they did up to 1983.  On a number of occasions the Minister gave me an assurance that he would make an effort to have the scheme made more flexible so that people in rural Ireland would qualify.  The scheme should be made more flexible and extended.</P>
    <P>The Government have been making the point in recent days that the economy is picking up.  According to today's issue of the <i>Irish Independent,</i> under the headline, &ldquo;Boost to the Economy as Trade Rockets,&rdquo; a colleague and good friend of the Minister for Energy, the Minister for Finance&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Such comments by the Minister for Finance give the impression that the Government should not have any difficulty in arranging with the ESB for the benefit in the fall in oil prices to be passed on to consumers.  The many problems we have discussed in the House in recent times should not exist if one is to go by the ebullient form of the Minister for Finance yesterday.  However, when it comes to helping the less well-off sections in our community&mdash;the elderly, widows and the disabled, whose plight has been highlighted so well by the Council for the Aged&mdash;the Government do not appear to have any money.</P>
      <P>The Minister and other members of the Government told us that the price of electricity would fall when Moneypoint is in operation and I hope he will tell us what benefit consumers will receive from that project.  He must remember that the price of electricity will not fall until September. Where is the benefit for industry?  I understand that the price of our electricity is about 20 per cent higher than the average EC price.  I should like to know if the money the Government are saving as a result of the fall in the price of oil is going to fund Moneypoint. Will the Minister tell us the capital contribution being made by the Government to Moneypoint?  Consumers are disappointed that they are not getting an immediate benefit from the fall in the price of oil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On a number of occasions I expressed concern to the Minister at the way our milled peat is being utilised here.  It may represent a small amount of the fuel used in the generation of electricity but it is a very important one.  The Minister will be aware that from the Derryfadda group of bogs in Roscommon and Galway 140,000 tonnes of milled peat will be transferred to the power stations in the midlands.  I am sure the Minister will tell me that that is being done because of the poor peat production in 1985 in the midlands, but I wonder why Bord na Móna are engaging in this expensive exercise.  It will cost a lot of money to transport that milled peat over very bad roads.  That natural resource should be used in the local areas. <Col N="1414" /> I hope the long term proposal for Derryfadda is the erection of a briquette factory there.  It is ridiculous to transport so much milled peat on bad roads from the west to the midlands.  Perhaps the Minister would comment on that aspect of energy policy.  We should revert to developing all our bogs, using the resources available where such development is taking place.</P>
    <P>Another matter I have raised with the Minister in this House is that of alternative energy sources.  I have had a number of questions to the Minister on what is Government policy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>From the west, yes.  For several years past the ESB and the Government have been conscious of the need to alleviate the problem of high electricity costs in industry.  In September 1983, the Government established an inquiry into the price of electricity &mdash; Jakobsen inquiry.  The inquiry report, which was published in January 1985 was wide-ranging and detailed.  It examined in considerable depth the cost and price structure of the ESB for purposes of comparison. It also looked at the electricity prices obtaining in various other countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The inquiry found that, while the price of electricity to domestic consumers in Ireland was in the middle range of prices in European countries, industrial electricity prices were higher than average. Obviously this finding of the inquiry was a matter of serious concern to the <Col N="1417" /> Government.  It was of particular concern that our exporting industries should be at such a disadvantage <i>vis-à-vis</i> their competitors abroad.  The inquiry report conceded that the ESB labour under certain disadvantages by comparison with many of their European counterparts who produce lower cost electricity.  Their system is smaller than most of them and, therefore, cannot avail of economies of scale. It is an isolated system and, in consequence, is deprived of the benefits which inter-connected systems enjoy.  By virtue of its small size and isolation it is constrained, for reasons of security, to avoid concentrating on the use of any one primary fuel even though that might present the cheapest option at a particular time. In other words, it has to maintain the capacity to use a mix of fuels and that implies a cost penalty.</P>
    <P>Against the background I have been describing it should not be surprising, therefore, that we have been moving gradually to improve the price to industry by a judicious tilting of the balance at each review.  This has obvious importance for job creation and the competitiveness of the economy.</P>
    <P>That was evident in January 1985 when I was able to announce an average reduction of from 2 per cent to 6 per cent in the industrial tariff.  This reduction was facilitated by a special allocation of natural gas in recognition of the urgency of the problem as highlighted by the Jakobsen report.</P>
    <P>It will be recalled that subsequent to this, around the middle of 1985, the ESB applied to the National Prices Commission for a phased increase to cover normal increases in their costs.  This was, of course, long before the dramatic turn-around in oil prices which is a very recent phenomenon, and even before the dollar started to weaken in the international currency markets.  The application was carefully examined and considered by the Government and an average increase of 2.7 per cent was approved and announced in December 1985.  This level of increase was fully justified at that time.  It was decided that this increase be applied as 4.5 per cent <Col N="1418" /> for domestic consumers, 3.5 per cent for commercial and a zero increase for industry.</P>
    <P>Bearing in mind that inflation since the previous increase of November 1984 was 6.7 per cent, I am satisfied that the weighting of the increase in the manner which I have just outlined was fully justified.  The increase, incidentally &mdash; and this is relevant to what I will be saying later &mdash; was based on costs as they were at the time and made no allowance for costs which would be increasing in the normal course in 1986.  This is particularly pertinent to the 25th round pay arrangements. I should say, too, that the calculations in December were based on information current at that time and not on the application which had been made by the ESB several months earlier when, among other things, the price of fuel oil was still distorted by the UK miners strike.</P>
    <P>Having placed that brief background on the record, I will now turn to more recent events.  It was into 1986 when the spot market prices for crude oil and oil products started to soften rapidly. Records show that the average spot price for 3.5 per cent sulphur fuel oil was $139 in December last.  The January average was $120, February, $90 and March, $86. I am giving the high of Platts in each case. I and my Department, and indeed the Government separately, were alive to these developments and we opened consultations with the ESB at the appropriate time.  In fairness to the ESB, I have to say that they too were conscious of these developments and of their responsibility. In the circumstances I found them to be willing partners in the consultation.</P>
    <P>At this point, I want to remind the House of one or two salient points.  The ESB reported a loss of £27 million in their accounts for the year ended 31 March 1985.  This brought their accumulated deficit to £64 million.  That figure cannot be ignored either by me or by the ESB in considering appropriate pricing policy. The Government have a responsibility to ensure that the ESB maintain their financial viability.  Failure to do so would inevitably result in the Exchequer and, <Col N="1419" /> in the final analysis, the taxpayer, being called on to carry the burden.  The ESB, during their long history, have never had to make demands on the Exchequer.  It is my Government's intention that they will not need to do so now or in the future.</P>
    <P>When the ESB were set up in 1927 and given their mandate to generate, transmit and sell electricity it would have taken no less than a prophet to foresee the enormous developments that have taken place since then in every area of the electricity business in this country.  The fact that the ESB are now in a position to sell their expertise abroad in a highly competitive market is a measure of the degree of maturity at which they have arrived.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not be as old as the Deputy.  Much of the change and development has taken place in comparatively recent times.  This is not in any way to denigrate the achievements of the early years without which later advances could not have been made.  But it is salutary to recall that up to as recently as twenty five years ago the ESB's electricity was generated predominantly by hydrobased plant.  Since then customer numbers have doubled and unit sales have increased seven fold.  The ESB have had to undergo major changes during that quarter century, not merely in order to keep pace with the growing demands for electricity, but to plan for future demand and to ensure the best of advantage for their customers.  The ESB are now on the threshold of a new era in their history. The recent movement into coal by the ESB will add a greater degree of security to the nation's electricity supply.  The ESB of course have taken the precaution of diversifying their sources of coal supply and this will add a further measure of security.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland is a comparatively under-industrialised <Col N="1420" /> country.  In that respect it is still a considerable way behind most of its partners in the EC.  By comparison with many European countries it was later for historical and other reasons, in developing an industrial base and the infrastructure required to service it.  Security of supply and cost of energy are vitally important considerations in such a climate. The ESB's movement to coal-based electricity generation will contribute significantly to the nation both from the economic and strategic points of view.</P>
    <P>In common with every other business, the ESB have been affected by the worldwide recession.  During a period of several years of falling demand they had to contend with rising imported fuel costs. They have coped well with the consequences of the recession but they are not emerging totally unscathed.  In my view and that of the Government it would be short-sighted and foolhardy in the extreme to embark on a programme of swingeing electricity price reductions at the first signs of recovery.  The viability of the ESB and the continued development of our electricity system are too important to the nation as a whole to be put at risk for the sake of short term popularity gains.</P>
    <P>Secondly, their 1985 annual report showed that native sources, natural gas, peat and hydro, accounted for 80 per cent of units generated compared with 20 per cent from imported oil.  This was as a result of policies pursued for a number of years.  It is also known, that the first unit of the Moneypoint coal-fired station commenced producing electricity in September of last year although the build-up of generation is a gradual process.  The point of this is to say that oil consumption by the ESB is nowadays on a very limited scale and the scope for increasing it on a sustained long term basis is somewhat constrained.</P>
    <P>This is not to deny that trends now emerging bode well for the future of electricity in this country.  Following a period of stagnation, demand increased by 4.2 per cent and 4.5 per cent in each of the <Col N="1421" /> years 1983-84 and 1984-85.  The steady recovery of demand is encouraging.  The commissioning of a further two 300 megawatt units of coal-fired plant at Moneypoint will increase the security of the electricity system and help to reduce costs.  If oil prices continue to remain low this will help too.  All of these trends are good grounds for being optimistic.</P>
    <P>The decision which we arrived at in relation to price decreases took into account factors other than the drop in oil prices.  It also included savings due to coal generation, exchange rate and interest rate benefits and an increased demand for electricity.  In announcing the decreases I said that they would cost the ESB £30 million in 1986-87.  Clearly, they would cost more in a full year; the figure is an extra £6 million to £8 million depending on demand.</P>
    <P>Bearing in mind, as I said earlier, that the increase approved in December made no provision for the 25th round pay increase or other internal cost inflation and the accumulated deficit, this £30 million represented the limit that could be afforded at the time.  I said then that I would keep the situation under review, and that I am continuing to do.  If and when the time is right for further announcements I intend to make them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>The decreases which I <Col N="1422" /> announced were 6.2 per cent on average for industrial consumers, 3.9 per cent for commercial consumers and an adjustment in the night rate domestic tariff which was worth 13 per cent to those who avail of that rate, all with effect from 1 April.  I also announced that the general domestic tariff would be reduced by 5 per cent with effect from 1 September.  I am conscious that the decision to defer the reduction in the domestic rate by five months attracted some unfavourable comment.  As I said earlier, we have been pursuing a gradual adjustment in favour of the industrial tariff in response to the Jakobsen conclusion.  We have been trying to achieve this while continuing to be fair to other consumers bearing in mind the rate of inflation.  Within the arithmetic available at the time it was possible to give meaningful reductions to industry and commerce while reserving some money to reduce the domestic tariff.</P>
      <P>I had two choices in the case of domestic consumers, either to give a small reduction from a current date or to give a larger reduction from a slightly deferred date.  I opted for the latter.  To have brought forward the domestic reduction to a current date would have cost a further £8 million.  This money simply did not exist in the arithmetic facing me. Naturally, I would have wished things to be different.  Was I to have had a smaller reduction for industry?  Indeed, if industry generally was to approach reducing costs in the energy area, including electricity reductions, along with oil, in the same spirit as I and the ESB have done, the domestic consumer should benefit in the medium term from both the domestic and industrial tariff reductions. I expect this is happening in some instances either in direct reductions or by foregoing increases which might otherwise have been necessary.  The underlying downward trend in inflation confirms this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said already, I chose a deferral of the domestic tariff reduction as being of greatest long term benefit to domestic consumers.  Consumption is on average lower in the summer and individual bills <Col N="1423" /> tend to increase with increased winter consumption.  A full 5 per cent reduction per unit would obviously be attractive to consumers at that time and I would have thought more welcome than a 2 per cent or 2.5 per cent from an earlier date.  The new rate in September will become the basic rate for the future and this is a very important point which should not be overlooked.  The average domestic consumer will have paid only an extra 2.5 per cent or 3 per cent for five months in return for a benefit which will last for some time.  For example, an individual consumer paying about £75 every two months would have paid an extra £5.60 in those five months whereas the same consumer would save £3.75 every two months from a 5 per cent reduction. These calculations are made before any adjustment for summer/winter consumption variations.  Again I have to say that I am satisfied that my announcement of 11 March did well by the domestic consumer.</P>
    <P>Over the weekend I read a comment from Deputy Reynolds at the great circus I referred to in which he said that the ESB had insulted the housewives of the country in offering a derisory 5 per cent cut in prices from September.  I have explained the reasoning for postponing the reduction until September.  It is difficult to see how a 5 per cent cut could be described as an insult.  In fact it gives domestic consumers a higher cut than that given to commercial consumers and is only marginally below that for industry. I cannot help wondering, however, whether the role stereotyping implied in the quotation from Deputy Reynolds is not itself insulting to the modern woman.</P>
    <P>I want to draw attention to another important feature of this matter.  I said already that only 20 per cent of electricity was generated from oil in the last ESB financial year.  It is also relevant to say that only 42 per cent or a total of £303 million of the ESB's current expenditure in that year was on fuel.  Therefore it takes about a 2.4 per cent decrease in the total fuel bill to create a 1 per cent <Col N="1424" /> average decrease in electricity prices if other costs stood still.  In practice, however currency and interest rates have been moving in the ESB's favour in terms both of their loan commitments and repayments and their foreign purchases. Payroll costs will increase as a result of the 25th round and of course the starting point was a current account loss and an accumulated deficit.  All of these factors had to be and were taken into account in arriving at the decreases which I announced. The ESB said publicly at the time of my announcement that they expect to hold prices stable now for two or three years.  That is a very happy outlook for consumers but it does not take from my assurance that if favourable movements indicate further decreases, these will be implemented.</P>
    <P>There is another factor to be borne in mind in considering the oil price decrease and its impact on the ESB.  To the extent that the ESB have limited scope to increase their oil consumption, and they have been availing of this, one cannot simply take the spot market price of oil into one's calculations.  Oil must be brought to Ireland incurring freight charges, port dues and tax.  It also carries an inventory cost which does not apply at all for some fuels, or to the same extent for others.  Any extra oil which the ESB consume incurs a 90 day stock obligation under EC regulation applicable directly to power stations and which continues until the end of the following calendar year.  All of these are real costs.  If Deputies opposite are doing calculations which do not include these cost factors, then it would not be surprising that they would expect price reductions to be somewhat greater than they have been.</P>
    <P>I want to turn now to the real price of electricity, leaving aside the increase of January last which was effectively cancelled, the last increase in electricity prices was effective from November 1984. Cumulative inflation from then to 1 September next is estimated at 7 per cent. During that time the industrial tariff has been reduced by about 13 per cent cumulatively on average and these decreases <Col N="1425" /> were worth substantially more in percentage terms to the biggest consumers; in fact over 20 per cent in some cases.  By 1 September the domestic tariff will be back below its 1984 level.</P>
    <P>In December of 1984 a unit of electricity at the general domestic rate cost 7.85p.  From September 1986 this will be reduced to 7.8p.  The economy night rate, which was 3.80p per unit, is now 3.30p per unit.  In a period of inflation, when the CPI will have increased by 7 per cent, I do not think Members opposite can justifiably decry that performance.  There can be few, if any, performances to match it in any other economic sector.</P>
    <P>It would be remiss of me not to record my appreciation of the contribution made by the ESB themselves in improving the outlook for electricity prices.  The board set themselves quite high targets in their forward plans in terms of increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of their organisation.  They have been quietly transforming many aspects of their organisation in recent years in response to the energy crises of the seventies.  The ESB went, in ten years, from being an organisation which could plan to double itself in every respect every eight or nine years or so, to one which had to deal with a down-turn in growth of demand and a severe economic recession.  I am not going to catalogue their achievements but I want to commend them.  I want, in particular, to commend the workforce for the demonstration of their adaptability and response to change.  I hope, and the recent past gives me some confidence, that I, and we, can count on the continuation of these efforts.</P>
    <P>Since 53 per cent of electricity in the year ending March 1985 was generated from gas, the price of this has an important influence on the price of electricity. On the one hand, the ESB are and have been a very important customer for natural gas.  On the other hand, Members of the House will have heard the chief executive of the ESB on radio recently extolling the virtues of gas as a fuel for electricity generation.  In present circumstances in this country, the two fit conveniently together.  By their own public <Col N="1426" /> admission the ESB have benefited to the tune of very many millions from their use of gas in recent years.  Now conditions have changed and I am examining this question in consultation with the ESB and Bord Gais Eireann.  I am optimistic that this and other favourable factors can give rise to a further reduction in electricity prices.  I am not in a position to talk about the extent and timing of such a decrease this evening.  Equally, I do not wish to create false hopes.  If we are in a position to announce further price decreases for electricity, these will be modest, based on any outlook that I can see now.  But again, let me say that if there is scope for any decreases, however modest, they will be made.</P>
    <P>It is my duty, of which I am constantly aware, to keep electricity prices at the lowest possible levels.  This is underlined for me and for everybody else concerned when it can be readily seen that every 1 per cent of electricity prices is worth £7 million approximately.  Even few multiples of that figure can be quite important from the point of view of the economy. Low domestic prices for electricity, as well as for many other items, play a part in keeping down inflation and the need for high pay demands.  Low industrial electricity prices keep down consumer costs and reflect in the competitiveness of the economy.  Low pay demands do likewise.  It is relatively straightforward economics to draw a direct connection between these statements and the ability of the economy to generate sustainable employment.  I recognise my responsibility in this matter.  I know from experience that the ESB recognise theirs.</P>
    <P>The House is aware that some commentators have in recent times, and with the benefit of their version of hindsight, started to question the current viability of the decision made in 1978 to construct Moneypoint as a major coal burning station. I want to say that Moneypoint is reasonable value for money, even compared with current low oil prices.  Furthermore, the price of coal must gradually adjust itself to firm trends in oil prices and this process has started.  More importantly, however, coal is in very long <Col N="1427" /> supply in the world &mdash; known resources extend to several hundred years at present consumption levels and coal is available in many widely dispersed locations around the world.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>In addition, many commentators still believe that oil will again have its day of high prices; there is a wealth of evidence to support this view. We may be witnessing a slower re-run of events in the mid-seventies where falling real oil prices stimulated demand which in turn created the climate for the second oil shock of 1978-79.  It is not for me to put a date on when these events might culminate in another spurt for oil prices. What I would say is that it is a scenario with a high probability some time in the next decade.  In case there are any lingering doubts, I want to say now that Moneypoint is the right long term decision, giving the ESB a good strategic balance of fuels and keeping down their dependence on imported oil for the future.  Fortunately, the modern trend for many stations to be dual-firing allows a degree of flexibility to use the most advantageous fuels from time to time, but this does not take from the validity of having a long term posture in favour of balanced strategic fuel options.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, a Leas-Cheann-Comhairle, I want to take an unusual step in the context of a Private Members' motion.  I want to thank Deputy Brady and the Members opposite for affording me this opportunity to explain in detail where we have arrived at in relation to electricity prices. It has given me time to give a fuller background briefing to the House than I could have had at any other time, with the possible exception of the introduction of the Estimate for my Department.  I am happy to have put all this information on the record.  The record speaks for itself in relation to electricity prices.  We have had a significant reduction in the industrial electricity prices which will be good <Col N="1428" /> for the economy and for job creation.  We will have a significant reduction for domestic consumers and I am keeping the possibility of a further reduction under review and I am cautiously optimistic that there can be further reductions.  Finally, the outlook for electricity prices across the next few years is more stable than it has been for a very long time.</P>
    <P>I would remind the House again of the technical drafting point which I made at the outset concerning Deputy Brady's motion and I commend the amendment to the support of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanWalsh" hpid="Mr. S. Walsh Mr. S. Walsh">

      <P>That Dáil Éireann calls on the Minister for Energy to make the necessary arrangements with the ESB to pass on, forthwith, to all their domestic consumers the full benefit of the recent reductions in the price of oil.</P>
      <P>The Government have submitted an amendment to this motion.  I should like at this stage to remind the Minister that last week, prior to a particular vote being taken, there was a turn about, a change of heart in policy.  It is quite possible that perhaps before the vote will be taken tomorrow night there will be another change of heart and perhaps a change in direction by the Government which will benefit the many hard-pressed people here in Dublin.</P>
      <P>As a Deputy for the Dublin area, with particular reference to the constituency of Dublin South-West which I am privileged to represent, on many previous occasions I have spoken on matters concerning problems in the Tallaght and Clondalkin areas.  I am speaking in support of this motion and I hope many other elected representatives in the Dublin area and in the constituency of Dublin South-West will also support it.</P>

      <P>Some of the Minister's colleagues might take the opportunity.  I recall speaking on a motion about 12 <Col N="1429" /> or 18 months ago relating to Clondalkin Paper Mills and at that time the pressures were on the Deputies of the Minister's party.  I was the last speaker on behalf of my party that night.  Only three minutes before the end of a speech by the Minister of State at the Department of Energy a member of his staff passed a note to him saying that arrangements had been made for a particular company to take over the working of Clondalkin Paper Mills.  I said that night that this was done to save embarrassment to Deputy Mervyn Taylor, a man whom I respect.  He was in an embarrassing position that night and a deal was done, just as a deal was done last week with the Progressive Democrats.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not interrupt the Minister and there should be some manners shown.  As one of the elected representatives for Dublin South-West I want to highlight the problems in the area.  Special concessions should be afforded to many Dublin areas, particularly Tallaght and Clondalkin.  I have said many times before that in view of the high level of unemployment they should be regarded as special areas.  Very little has been done to help the cause of the worker, the poor and the people affected by the policies of this Government.  That is why I am supporting this motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Speakers on behalf of the Government have taken every opportunity to highlight the reduction in the price of oil.  If the Government were able to find a way out <Col N="1430" /> last week, surely they can find a way out on this occasion and pass on these benefits to the consumer now.  Is it to be similar to the case of those who must wait until July for increases in social welfare payments granted in the budget?  Some allowance has been passed on to the industrial section, small though it may be, and as an old industrial worker I welcome it, although it is only in the region of 5 per cent.  The reduction in the price of oil is in the region of 25 per cent. Why must we wait until next September for a mere 5 per cent reduction to be passed on?  At a time when things are so depressed and people are calling for some benefits, these reductions should be passed on.</P>
    <P>Many Members will be aware that during the past few years many of the health boards have been called upon to help people to meet their ESB bills.  The money must be found somewhere to help these unfortunate people.  Why can we not now pass this allowance on to the people?  Is this not what Government is about?  The Government describe themselves as being a good and caring Government and now they have an opportunity to show this, particularly to the people of Dublin South-West, whom I have the privilege to represent.</P>
    <P>Recently we had the withdrawal of many of the subsidies, thereby causing an increase in the cost of living.  The price of milk, bread and many other items was increased.  We have heard very little about this but an opportunity is now being given to the Government to show some concern for these hard-pressed people.  Why can they not see their way to meeting the situation?  Is it because they do not wish to or because they have not the heart to do so?</P>
    <P>I recall that some time ago the Taoiseach came to Tallaght to present the People of the Year Awards.  I was present on that occasion when the Taoiseach assured the people that the Government of which he was head always had at heart the interests of the poor and the working people.  He said they cared for them.  It appears now that they have changed their <Col N="1431" /> minds.  Possibly the Minister present will explain this when he speaks.</P>
    <P>I am calling for special concessions for many of the hard-pressed people in Dublin generally and especially in Tallaght and Clondalkin.  We have mentioned the people who are unemployed and those receiving various kinds of assistance.  These are the people who should be cared for and towards whom the Government have a duty and responsibility.  I call on the Minister to consider this motion.  We had a turnabout last week, so why cannot we have another one this week?  This motion is in the interests of poor people and working people, those who are hard-pressed.  The Minister for Energy is the Leader of the Labour Party who say they represent the working people.  Now they have an opportunity to show their consideration and care for these people and I call upon the Minister to allow the decreases in the cost of energy to be passed on to the consumer. I am calling on all the other elected representatives for the constituency of Dublin South-West and other Dublin constituencies to support this motion.</P>
    <P>Recently documents were distributed in this area by members of the Fine Gael Party, the Labour Party and the recently formed Progressive Democrats expressing their interest in and care for the people.  One wonders what the response of the Progressive Democrats will be on this occasion.  I trust that the Member who was elected for the constituency of Dublin South-West will support the document she distributed recently and vote in support of this motion.  I trust too, that the former Leader of the Labour Party, Deputy O'Leary, will support the motion.  When he came to the constitutency of Dublin South-West he gave as his reason for doing so his belief that he had something to offer the people of the area. So far we have not had much evidence of his having anything to offer the people. However, perhaps he will have a change of heart when the division bells ring tomorrow evening.  It is easy to talk and to make promises but matters may be very different when one is called on to stand <Col N="1432" /> by what one has said.  I am calling on Deputy O'Leary who is now a member of Fine Gael to support us in this motion and in that way to show his support for the unemployed of Tallaght and Clondalkin with particular reference to the Killinarden, Jobstown and Brookfield areas of Tallaght and to the Bawnogue and Deansrath areas of Clondalkin where, as I have said many times here before, there are many families in which no one is employed.  In many other areas one can find seven or eight families but not one person employed.  This is why I am speaking in support of this motion, a motion that might urge the Government to have some consideration for these people.</P>
    <P>So far the Government have failed to deliver on their many promises.  They have done little or nothing in the matter of the creation of employment in the Dublin area.  There is no evidence of their having done anything in this respect in the Tallaght area.  Instead, factory after factory has closed.  These are the facts.</P>
    <P>Apart from the inner city area, the constitutency I represent is one of the worst hit in Dublin by reason of the policies pursued by this Government.  I recall occasions when Fianna Fáil were in office and when we had to listen to speaker after speaker from the then Opposition criticising us at every opportunity.  I recall some elected representatives at residents' meetings in my constitutency not being able to find words severe enough to criticise the then Government, but when the shoe is on the other foot matters are different.  I recall some of those elected representatives disappearing suddenly when matters became too hot.  They would leave with the excuse of having to attend other meetings.  I expect the attitude of these people will be the same tomorrow evening when the division bells ring.  I am calling on these Members to support this motion.  If there was a change of heart on Wednesday evening last and if a deal was done then with certain people in order to avoid embarrassment and to avoid the possibility of the Government having to face the people in an election, what is to prevent a change of direction tomorrow evening?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1433" /> In every newspaper we open these days we read references from various Ministers to the reduction in oil prices with the implication that in some way this is happening because of Government policies and that consequently there will be a general improvement in our economy. I should like these Ministers to tell us why we must wait until September next for a mere 5 per cent to be passed on to the consumer.  Why can we not make this reduction now?  After so many depressing years why can we not help the consumer at this point?</P>
    <P>The social welfare benefits announced in the budget will not be implemented until July.  In other words, social welfare recipients are another group that the Government are not thinking of so far as passing on the benefits of the oil price reductions is concerned.  I am very happy to support the motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened carefully to the rather long speech from the Minister, though judging from the monotone in which the speech was delivered it seemed that the Minister did not comprehend fully the implications of what he was saying.  The many points outlined in the script, which obviously had just been delivered from the Department, are <i>non sequitur</i> points.  For instance, at the outset the Minister sought to interpret our motion but he interpreted it narrowly in the sense that Fianna Fáil seemed to be concerned only with domestic consumers. If the Minister had any doubts in that regard they should be dispelled by what he has heard from Deputies Flynn, Kitt and Seán Walsh, who have demonstrated that Fianna Fáil are concerned very much with all consumers both domestic and industrial.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred in detail to various aspects of the 1982 report.  It is with the implementation of the recommendations of that report that we in Fianna Fáil are concerned.  A historical account of what the report contains is of little use at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister reminded us that the ESB survived economically despite rising fuel costs during the years of the recession <Col N="1434" /> but can he tell us who paid for those rising fuel costs?  They were borne by the consumer by way of increased charges. Why, then, should the consumer not be put in the position of reaping the benefit when prices are falling?</P>
    <P>Our motion highlights a specific problem which is part of a larger question. It is hoped that as fuel prices decrease inflation will decrease also and that purchasing power will increase in industrial oil importing countries such as ours. The Government, not by means of any great national plan or of foresight, have taken two steps in the last six months which would seem to ensure that all else being equal domestic and industrial purchasing power will increase in this economy. First, they have fixed the pay contracts for 1987 at rates of between 6 and 7 per cent.  After tax, income in the 12 months period will average about 6 per cent.  Secondly, the Government have indexed tax allowances and bands for a projected inflation rate of 4½ per cent whereas inflation is expected to be of the order of 3 per cent or lower.  That means that the total purchasing power of the economy should increase by 3 per cent during the 12 month period from 1 January 1987.  In order to ensure that happens we must prevent the benefits of falling inflation from being confiscated by intermediaries and consequently not passed on to the consumer.  We have highlighted one instance in which an intermediary, namely the ESB, have not passed on the full effect of falling fuel prices and of the fall in inflation.  If this trend is allowed continue the impact of falling fuel prices, the potentially beneficial impact from the point of view of generating economic activity and employment, will not percolate through to the economy.</P>
    <P>We are concerned, too, with the social aspect of this question.  The cost of a unit of electricity bears proportionately higher on a person in the lower income group.  In other words, those who are hit hardest proportionately by ESB prices are the poorest people in our community and many of those people are poor because of the economic recession that <Col N="1435" /> resulted from increasing oil prices.  It follows that those people having had their circumstances reduced and poverty brought upon them in this way should benefit when oil prices fall.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Wilson has been given permission to raise on the Adjournment of the House the animal feed crisis in County Cavan and the alarming increase in animal deaths in the past few weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, first of all I want to thank you very sincerely for giving me an opportunity to raise this very urgent matter in the House by way of an Adjournment Debate.  The position is a very serious one.  The background to my asking for permission to raise this matter on the Adjournment is that an ACOT meeting was held in Ballyhaise Agricultural College yesterday because of the very serious crisis in the county at present.  I do not want to be parochial or exclusively county minded and I have had discussions with people today from Counties Leitrim, Sligo, Mayo, Galway, Roscommon and Donegal who find themselves in a similar plight.  I want to compliment our spokesman, who is from County Limerick.  The crisis is not as severe in the south of Ireland as compared with the north.  I want to compliment him on knowing that the crisis existed.  In fact, had I known that he was going to raise it on the Adjournment I would not have asked.  I want to divide my time briefly with Deputy Noonan and Deputy J. Leonard, with the indulgence of the Chair.</P>
      <P>Present at the meeting in Ballyhaise Agricultural College were the ACOT members, public representatives, representatives of the Agricultural Credit Corporation, the Ulster Bank, Allied Irish Banks and the Bank of Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1436" /> Thus, one can see what was in the minds of the ACOT people by looking at those whom they had invited to the meeting. There has been serious panic about fodder since the week before last.  We had a bad summer, a bad autumn and a bad winter in 1985.  Calculations were made that there would be some grass growing at least by 1 April.  We have had severe east wind weather throughout January, February and March.  There is no substantial growth and no sign of any such growth.  Hence, the panic.</P>
    <P>A local dead animals processing factory has had a 33 per cent increase in intake from the area which it covers, 67 per cent of it from the local area &mdash; I am trying to give an idea of the seriousness of the matter.  Comparing the past three weeks with the similar three weeks of 1985 there has been a 72 per cent increase.  These are checked statistics and I am using them to impress on the House the seriousness of the problem.  The agricultural advisers have been telling people to have their first cut of silage ready for harvest in May.  This, as became clear from the discussion, is pie in the sky.  The grass will be eaten, when it grows that is &mdash; it has not even started to grow in that area.  A May silage was one of the big and well grounded, scientifically, drives that was being made by the agricultural advisers in the area.  That is only a dream, as one member of the ACOT committee said at the meeting.  I want to mention in passing that there is a serious problem with sheep in the western part of the county as well as in other counties.</P>
    <P>The very best farms which have made the very best provisions and calculations are out of fodder at present.  There were complaints about the voucher scheme in that people who bought hay against the possibility had that hay wettened when the decision was taken on the provision of vouchers.  This was a penalisation which should not have taken place.  Reference was made to a few years ago when a £300 interest free loan, which was paid back by people in part of the area, was made available.  I am throwing that out as a suggestion, although the amount of money would of course have to be upped <Col N="1437" /> considerably because of the intervening years.  We had, as the lady representative on the committee said, a nine month winter and consequently we had serious problems as a result.</P>
    <P>One of the problems that surfaced was that big quantity offers might be available.  Again, the ordinary small individual farmer is not thinking in those kind of terms and he has not got the money to purchase.  Suggestions were made of a once-off headage covering the whole area not merely the disadvantaged part of the area which covers only 10 per cent of the animals.  I am just calling the Minister's attention to the suggestion.  Out of fodder at present but unfortunately out of money.  Hence, the invitation to the financial institutions to come to that meeting.</P>
    <P>It seems that the Government, the co-ops and the financial institutions should have an input into this.  As I mentioned sheep in passing, I must mention the suckler herd as well lest we forget that we were concentrating on dairying.  There is a section of the suckler herd industry in the area and, of course, they have to be fed also.  There is no fodder for them. One scientific point I want to make here is that some of the carcases at the factories which were discovered to be in reasonably good condition were fed meal but because there was no rumination and because they did not want the fibre those cattle died.  In other words, the diet was not balanced in a way which would keep the animals alive.  Of course, we are and have been&mdash;we are making up for it a bit&mdash;short of housing in the area.  As a result of this if cattle are let out with the condition land is in they will trample the grass into the ground and nothing will grow when growth comes.</P>
    <P>There is no use bellyaching without having practical suggestions.  What we are suggesting is a subsidy for fodder silage grain&mdash;in other words, cheaper money.  The Government and the EC, as it is a crisis, might be brought in on this problem.  I had the privilege of putting to the financial institutions that they, in fact, should also bear some of the cost by a reduction in interest.  For the most part <Col N="1438" /> the profits of the banking institutions are good.  This is a time of crisis and they should be prepared to help their customers at this particular time.  In fairness to them, and unlike a few years ago, their individual statements to the meeting were more than satisfactory.  They said to come in and talk to them and they would deal with individual cases.  They could not say anything else.  They all repeated that, so I knew that that was an important proposal from their point of view.  They seemed to be more amenable to the suggestions which were made and more anxious to please their customers because, as the individuals from the banks, said: &ldquo;Dead cows are no good to the farmer and they are no good to the banks either&rdquo;.  This is a matter of some urgency.</P>
    <P>We will also have people who will be reluctant to deal with the banks, not because of a lack of sophistication but because of fear, a fear which was instilled into them maybe previous to 1973 but certainly subsequent to 1973 because of what went wrong when loans taken out at a low rate of interest shot up to 20 per cent and swamped some of them, to my own knowledge.  Suggestions were made for a restoration of the calf subsidy so that money would be available for the purchase of fodder silage grain in the circumstance.  It is not so long ago since the subsidy was at about £22 to £23.  That is another possibility.</P>
    <P>The co-ops have been taking action in the area.  There has been a sourcing of fodder and silage.  Going to the meeting I thought that it was dealing with what was a country wide situation but I discovered that the co-ops, Macra, the IFA and the Irish Countrywomen's Association, which were represented at the meeting, had sourced supplies in various places, in particular in Wexford, west Waterford, Kilkenny-Carlow, that particular area.</P>
    <P>One of the problem that surfaced in regard to that area was the question of transport.  It takes a fairly good team to load a 40 foot trailer with bales, a job which takes a few hours.  It is a long <Col N="1439" /> journey from Wexford to the Cavan-Monaghan area.  I was pleased to know that fodder is available.  It is on that basis that I am appealing for help from the Government.  If the Government would consider giving assistance per livestock unit it would be the best solution.  Information and statistics on the numbers of animals in the area are available in the Department of Agriculture.  One point that was made by a representative of a co-operative was that sometimes when a co-operative society is in the market the price goes up.  This is natural.  The co-ops then have to charge the farmers.  We want to have a reasonably priced product. Some co-ops increased the price per gallon of milk that they were paying to their customers in order to tide them over so that they could purchase fodder if it became available.  The problem was getting the fodder into the area.</P>
    <P>Last week a person phoned me who thought that I had silage for sale.  He said it was advertised on the radio.  I informed him that I did not have silage for sale.  I had six such calls in half an hour until I got in touch with the radio station.  I am giving that instance to show how desperate people are to get food for their animals. The figures quoted for a bale of hay were in the region of £1.50, £1.80, £2.10, £2.20 and £2.50.  There was also mention of 440 tonnes of silage available at £10,000.  I am asking the Minister to come up with some emergency help to provide fodder before it is too late.  It is not a matter of getting a package together over a week, two weeks or three weeks.  It is a question of helping the farmers to get the feedstuffs into the area as quickly as possible so that the animals will not die. Even if the weather improves the problem will not be solved.  It will continue into 1987 if it is not dealt with properly and herds will be allowed to die. It has been suggested that the rescue package or the interest subsidy scheme should be extended.  I am making a cry from the heart for help for an area which needs it badly at the moment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> I am <Col N="1440" /> glad to have an opportunity to speak on this debate because a serious situation has arisen where cattle are dying, particularly in the area outlined by Deputy Wilson and in the west.  They are dying through lack of fodder and the poor quality of fodder as a result of last year's disastrous summer.  The problem is far worse than many people realise.  I hope the Minister and his officials realise the seriousness of the situation.  At present there is a disastrous problem looming on the individual holdings of farmers.  I will be calling for an emergency debate in this House on the matter and I hope that the Government will give time for a full scale debate on it.  Some farmers have a very serious problem with regard to fodder. In a reply which I put to the Minister for Agriculture last week I was told that they should consult their agricultural advisers. Of course they should but the matter is a lot more serious than that.  Advice will not feed hungry cattle.  The Government should introduce a scheme such as was introduced last summer.  Maybe it was introduced too late but better late than never.  They should take fast and effective action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am putting forward some proposals and I hope that the Minister will come up with some positive proposals also.  The Minister should introduce some type of voucher scheme as was outlined by Deputy Wilson.  Failing that, he should bring in some type of scheme whereby farmers would get a certain amount per head of cattle, particularly in the disaster areas.  An alternative is that the headage grants be paid in advance.  Government action is required at once because days and even hours count.  We all know, as Deputy Wilson pointed out, that there is fodder available in certain parts of the country.  It is a matter of getting the fodder from that part of the country to the areas where it is needed and the question is will the farmers who need the fodder be in a position to pay for it? There are four or five choices which the Minister can take up.  I hope he will get clearance immediately from the EC Commission to make those payments.  I <Col N="1441" /> hope that some solution will be found to this problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. J. Leonard Mr. J. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Last Wednesday I raised a Private Notice Question on this matter and was told that it was not a matter of urgency.  I then raised the matter on the Adjournment.  It was accepted but we had not time to discuss it because of the two votes that evening. This indicates that there should be a reexamination of the system whereby we raise matters such as this.</P>
      <P>This is a very serious problem.  There has been no growth of grass so far.  This year, land is waterlogged and cattle are hungry in many of the Connacht-Ulster counties.  Last week I spoke to a man who has cattle housed for nine months.  He has 35 cows and has spent an additional £3,000 on straw and silage as well as compound feed for the animals.  That man will not make a profit this year. Much of the stock are in poor condition and if they are not tended to over the next couple of weeks there could be many more cattle deaths.</P>
      <P>In my county a committee was set up to deal with this problem.  I was a member of that committee and we did valuable work in conjunction with ACOT, the IFA, the lending institutions and the co-operatives. A substantial amount of feedstuffs were brought into the area and the lending institutions provided the money. All concerned co-operated to ensure that there was no hardship.  However, we have now come to the crunch.  On the committee to which I have referred, an all-important consideration was the breeding stock.  We were most concerned regarding the retention of the breeding stock, especially the suckling herd.  If something is not done to rectify the problem in the next week or so, there will be serious repercussions in the years to come.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been suggested that the headage payments might be brought forward.  A sum of £27 million was not taken up in respect of agriculture in 1985 and that money could be used to help in the present situation.  At the end of April in any year the co-ops are stretched to the <Col N="1442" /> limit.  I was a member of a co-op and I know the efforts made to work within a budget in normal years when money was more readily available and when interest charges were not so high.  Now the co-operatives are unable to provide more cash.</P>
    <P>Another suggestion has been to have some kind of subsidy.  During the past winter I made the point that there should be some kind of discretionary fund operated by ACOT, the co-operatives, and the FDS to deal with cases of hardship.  If that were done cattle could be saved.  I hope the Department will look at the matter urgently and consider having an interest-free loan over two or three years for people who have grave problems.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MattBrennan" hpid="Mr. M. Brennan Mr. M. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>A special meeting was called last Wednesday of the Sligo County Committee of Agriculture and they sent a telegram to the Minister expressing the need for urgent action. Viewers of the RTE News last Thursday saw reports on the number of cattle dying in County Leitrim.  A neighbour of mine lost nine cattle.  If the people concerned produce the cards relating to the dead cattle, the Government should compensate them for that loss.  Any small farmer who loses nine cattle will suffer a loss of profits for a few years.</P>
      <P>The people concerned need help urgently.  As Deputy Wilson pointed out, fodder is available in other parts of the country but not in the west.  Any driver on the road from Sligo to Dublin will see lorryloads of hay and straw on the way to feed hungry cattle.  Some farmers have adequate feedstuffs but this does not apply to all farmers.  We had a particularly bad summer last year and the quality of the feed harvested suffered as a result.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Hegarty)</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that the late growth of grass this spring on top of the effects of the prolonged bad weather last summer is causing problems for many livestock farmers particularly in the north western counties.  The House will be aware of the various measures <Col N="1443" /> adopted by the Government such as the winter fodder scheme, the Shannon valley flood scheme, the feed voucher scheme and the provision of an additional 125,000 tonnes of grain.  This was a generous response to the problems that existed and was successful in containing them. Farmers were also encouraged at the time to consult with their ACOT advisers about a feeding plan for their stock over the winter and spring months and many who followed this advice will now be in a position to carry stock in reasonable condition.</P>
      <P>There is no shortage of cereals and cereal based feeds which farmers should be using to supplement fodder supplies. There are reasonable quantities of hay available also but, as in last autumn, much of these are not located in the areas in which they are most needed.  Many of the animals need mineral supplement in addition to hand-feeding particularly in areas where the fodder is below standard in quality.  I strongly recommend that all farmers with problems in relation to the feeding of their livestock should consult with their local ACOT advisers as to the most appropriate action they should take. Where animals are weak or debilitated veterinary advice should be taken.  If the co-operatives were to find where hay and straw are available, there should not be a major problem in getting them to the areas concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Cattle deaths have doubled and even trebled in a number of western counties this year.  This is a reflection of the scarcity and poor quality of fodder arising from the poor weather last summer and autumn and the shortage of cash for the purchase of meals.  The areas worst affected are in the north west, Leitrim, north Longford, north Sligo, Cavan and west Donegal.  Losses will continue for a few weeks because when pregnant animals are seriously affected with starvation and especially when they become <Col N="1444" /> recumbent there is little chance of recovery.</P>
    <P>Other areas seriously affected are north Cork, west Limerick and south west Kerry in the south west and north Roscommon, north and west Mayo and west Galway.  More cows are being sold than normal and there is a big increase in the numbers of dead animals.  Farmer indebtedness has also increased and fertiliser sales have dropped.</P>
    <P>The farmers most affected are those normally relying on hay and who were unable to make adequate provision for winter feed in 1985.  The better farmers, especially those who had turned to silage, are less adversely affected.  It should be noted that, although losses have doubled or trebled in some regions, the figures for previous years on which these increases were based were small.  There are individual cases where losses were very high. The losses which have occurred, however, reflect a rather serious situation on many farms.  Because of the serious shortage of fodder, expenditure on meals has been higher than usual even on farms which did not suffer stock losses.  This situation has been aggravated by the late spring.  In these circumstances many farmers are short of ready cash for the purchase of fertilisers and so on.  At the moment the Government are considering a proposal from the Minister for Agriculture to make advance payments on the beef cow scheme and an announcement will be made on that matter as quickly as possible.  There are some technical matters to be overcome.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 20 and 22 together.</P>
      <P>It would be contrary to established practice to provide details of the number of gardaí deployed on Border duty at any particular time or to indicate the divisions from which members have been temporarily assigned to such duty.</P>
      <P>The detailed deployment of Garda manpower is a matter for the Garda authorities who keep the policing needs of all areas under review in the light of changing needs and circumstances and, as indicated in reply to Question No. 34 on 27 November 1985, measures have been taken to ensure an adequate Garda presence in all areas.</P>
      <P>As regards the incidence of crime in rural areas, I am informed by the Garda authorities that provisional statistics for the four-month period ending 31 January 1986 (these are the most recent general crime statistics available) show a reduction in the crime rate in most Garda divisions as compared with the four-month period which ended on 31 January 1985.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards Question No. 20, 112 temporary clerical trainees have been assigned to Garda offices throughout the country for training in a variety of office <Col N="1283" /> skills.  The employment of these trainees is part of the scheme to provide work experience for young people which was announced by the Government last September in the White Paper <i>Serving the Country Better.</i> It is not the position that they were employed to facilitate the transfer of extra gardaí to Border divisions.</P>

      <P>In the three month period ended on 31 March 1986, a total of 165 armed robberies and armed aggravated burglaries were recorded by the Garda authorities in the Dublin metropolitan area, of which 12 have been detected so far.  The total value of cash and other goods involved is estimated at approximately £860,000.  It should, of course, be borne in mind that, as the period in question is so recent, the figure in relation to detection may tend to be misleading in the sense that it is to be expected that further detections will be made in relation to some of these crimes.</P>

      <P>The Garda authorities inform me that every effort is made to ensure the safety of members of the force and road users <Col N="1284" /> during the operation of Garda checkpoints. In addition to the use of hazard warning lamps and reflective signs, all members on duty at checkpoints during the hours of darkness are required to wear flourescent protective clothing and to be in possession of a torch.</P>
      <P>As regards the effectiveness of the hazard warning lamps in use at the checkpoint on the Newry Road, Dundalk, the Garda authorities say that arising from complaints that the standard hazard warning lamps on issue to the force were not fully effective at that particular location, the matter was taken up with the suppliers of the equipment who produced a modified version of these lamps.  The modified lamps have already been tested at Dundalk and further modifications are being considered in consultation with the local Garda officers so as to ensure the optimum safety for members of the force and road users alike.</P>

    <P>There is concern that not all finds are being reported to the National Museum but obtaining evidence of breaches of the law of this type is understandably difficult and all rumoured cases are investigated. Artefacts of Irish origin are occasionally offered for sale in other countries.  It does not follow that all of these were illegally <Col N="1285" /> exported.  These artefacts are examined by the National Museum and efforts are made whenever appropriate to purchase them.</P>
    <P>Evidence of the recent unlicensed export for sale of two lots of important archaeological objects (not treasure trove) is being actively examined by the Irish antiquities division of the National Museum.  In one case, the initiation of legal proceedings has been requested by the museum authorities and in the other, litigation is being considered.</P>

      <P>When Moneypoint reaches its full capacity of 900 MW, it is estimated that emissions of SO2 will be about 67,000 tonnes per annum.</P>
      <P>The ESB are presently carrying out a cost appraisal, at the direction of the Government, of installing flue gas desulphurisation systems at Moneypoint and other generating stations.  The study is almost complete and a report is expected shortly.  It should be stated, however, that successive independent studies by An Foras Forbartha and An Foras Talúntais have indicated that there will be no environmental problems caused by sulphur dioxide emissions at Moneypoint. The ESB have also carried out their own analysis which indicates that the sulphur dioxide levels will at all points be well within the stringent limit values set as conditions for the granting of planning permission by Clare County Council.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, the ESB have built a total of 14 strategically located monitoring stations which will provide reliable environmental information.  Arrangements have been made to have this monitoring validated independently by An Foras Forbartha.  To date, since the start-up of the first of the three generating units in September last, there has been no indication of any adverse environmental impact arising from emissions at Moneypoint.</P>

      <P>Council Directives 85/210/EEC, <Col N="1293" /> of 20 March 1985 on the approximation of the laws of the member states concerning the lead content of petrol requires member states to take the necessary measures to ensure the availability of unleaded petrol and its balanced distribution within their territories from 1 October 1989.  I will be co-ordinating arrangements to this end and the Air Pollution Bills, 1986, when enacted, will provide the appropriate regulatory powers.</P>
      <P>There is agreement in principle at EC level that all new petrol engined vehicles should be designed to run on unleaded petrol.  The proposed implementation dates vary from 1 October 1988 to 1 October 1993, depending on the vehicle category.</P>
      <P>Council Directive 85/210/EEC also required member states, as soon as they consider it appropriate, to reduce the permitted lead content of petrol marketed in their countries to 0.15 grammes per litre.  Regulations made by my predecessor have the effect, from 1 April 1986 of reducing the permitted lead content of petrol marketed in Ireland from 0.40 to 0.15 grammes per litre.  This reduction of over 60 per cent should achieve a similar reduction in the level of lead in the air.</P>

      <P>The St. George's Oyster Fishery was acquired by <Col N="1303" /> An Bord Iascaigh Mhara late in 1981. Following its purchase a preliminary survey of the fishery was undertaken by the board in mid-1982 which indicated the feasibility of restoring the oyster beds and reviving the fishery.  In 1983 work commenced on a three year biological and hydrographic assessment of the bed in conjunction with the Department of Oceanography, University College, Galway.  This work involves diving surveys, growth trials, dredge surveys, larval sampling and a hydrographic study and has cost £10,500 to date.  A pilot greenhouse oyster nursery system at Clarenbridge to supply both the St. George's and Clarenbridge beds in the event of the detailed survey proving positive has also been set up at a cost of £7,000.</P>
      <P>Given the pressing demands on the board's resources it would have been inappropriate for the board to proceed with an expensive development programme before results of the detailed survey were analysed.  I expect that the results of this survey will be available in December 1986 and, depending on the results and subject to the availability of funds, work on the development of the bed could commence next year.</P>

      <P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that, in addition to his employment earnings, the taxpayer is in receipt of a social welfare pension.  Both sources of income are chargeable to income tax.  In accordance with standard practice the aggregate tax free allowances under PAYE are reduced to take account of the social welfare pension which is paid gross, the tax attributable to it being recovered under PAYE from the other income by means of the restricted tax free allowances.</P>

      <P>In this regard, the person concerned submitted particulars of her part time employment from 7 June 1984 to 21 September 1984 for which Class J contribution had been paid, for decision by the Department on the appropriate PRSI contribution applicable.

      <P>The relevant regulations relating to part time employment provide that where employment is for less than 18 hours a week and the person is not mainly dependent for his/her livelihood on the remuneration received, the employment is insurable at the Class J rate of contribution. This class of contribution gives cover for occupational injury benefits only and cannot be reckoned for payment of unemployment benefit.

      <P>Following investigation of his unemployment assistance claim, the means of the person concerned were assessed at £21.50 weekly, derived from <Col N="1317" /> the value of board and lodgings on his brother's holding.  He is, accordingly, entitled to unemployment assistance at £12.30 weekly, being the appropriate maximum rate payable in his case of £33.80 less means of £21.50.</P>
      <P>He applied recently for a review of his means, and notified the local office of a change of address.  His case was referred to a social welfare officer for reinvestigation and it is anticipated that the inquiries will be completed within two weeks.  The means of the person concerned will then be re-assessed in the light of the outcome of the investigation and the rate of unemployment assistance payable, determined accordingly.  Further weekly payments will continue to be made as they become due.</P>

      <P>Entitlement to pay-related benefit with flat rate unemployment benefit is subject to the condition that the sum of weekly flat rate unemployment benefit, pay-related benefit and income tax refund may not exceed 85 per cent of the average net weekly earnings of a claimant from the beginning of the tax year, to the date of claim.</P>
      <P>In this case, calculation of the 85 per cent limit was based on the earnings of the person concerned, from insurable employment, in the period 6 April 1985 to 25 November 1985, when he claimed unemployment benefit.  The person concerned however, had earnings, reckonable for this purpose, only in the period 6 April 1985 to 1 May 1985 as he had, apparently, been abroad for approximately six months prior to the date of his claim.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 85 per cent limit was calculated at £17.95 and as the rate of unemployment benefit payable in this case exceeds that sum, pay-related benefit is not payable.

      <P>Entitlement to unemployment benefit is subject to the condition that a claimant must be available for and genuinely seeking employment.  The person concerned claimed unemployment benefit on 4 November 1985.  His claim was disallowed for a period of six weeks from his last date of employment on 30 October 1985 on the grounds that he lost his employment through his own misconduct. Following the expiry of the six week period, his claim was disallowed on and from 11 December 1985 on the grounds that he was not available for and genuinely seeking employment.</P>
      <P>He appealed against the disallowance and at an oral hearing on 20 February 1986, he was given the opportunity to present his case.  The appeals officer, however, also decided that he was not available for and genuinely seeking employment.  He ceased to sign the unemployed register after 6 March 1986.</P>
      <P>The person concerned again claimed unemployment benefit from 10 April 1986 and inquiries are being made at present to establish whether he now fulfils the condition of being available for and genuinely seeking employment.  When these inquiries are completed, his entitlement to unemployment benefit will be determined without delay.  In the meantime, if he has insufficient means to meet his needs, he may apply to his local health board for payment of supplementary welfare allowance.</P>

      <P>The Department's concern in relation to the cashing of social welfare cheques is to ensure that banks, traders and others who assist social welfare beneficiaries by cashing their cheques would do so only for persons who are known to them or who can produce satisfactory identification.</P>
      <P>It is difficult to define what constitutes proper identification and the Department has made available certain guidelines in this regard, mainly to assist traders.  As far as the banks are concerned no guidelines have been issued indicating that cheques should be cashed through payees' accounts only and from inquiries made in the matter, there is no indication of any recent change in the banks' general policy in this regard.  Banks have traditionally cashed cheques for social welfare beneficiaries and there is no reason to believe that they will not continue to provide this facility.</P>
