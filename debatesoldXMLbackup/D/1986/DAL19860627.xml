      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £23,721,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1986, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Justice, and of certain other services administered by that Office, and for payment of a grant-in-aid.</P>
      <P>I propose that all the Votes for which I am responsible be taken together, but I shall endeavour to answer any questions on any particular Vote.  The total Estimate for all the Votes for which I am responsible is £355,231,000, an increase of £23,596,000 or 7 per cent over the expenditure for these Votes in 1985.  The Estimate is made up as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1401" /> Vote 24&mdash;Office of the Minister for Justice, £23,721,000,</P>
    <P>Vote 25&mdash;Garda Síochána, £255,273,000,</P>
    <P>Vote 26&mdash;Prisons, £60,877,000,</P>
    <P>Vote 27&mdash;Courts, £9,175,000,</P>
    <P>Vote 28&mdash;Land Registry and Registry of Deeds, £6,059,000,</P>
    <P>Vote 29&mdash;Charitable Donations and Bequests, £126,000.</P>
    <P>Pay and allowances and so on, account for 81 per cent of the total Estimates and show an increase of 7 per cent compared with 1985.</P>
    <P>In addition to the sum required which I have already outlined, I will also be asking the House for a Supplementary Estimate, which is already before the House, for a sum not exceeding £4,400,000 to defray charges which will come in course of payment in the year ending 31 December 1986 for awards, costs and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Justice in respect of the Stardust compensation tribunal.</P>
    <P>The overall Estimates provision for the Garda Síochána in 1986 is £255,273,000. Salaries, allowances and overtime account for almost £198 million of this figure and superannuation provision is close on £35 million.  The other major items included are £9.3 million for travelling, subsistence, compensation and miscellaneous expenses, £7.85 million for Garda transport, £4.6 million for postal and telecommunications services and £3.8 million for the purchase, rental and leasing of radio, computer, office and other equipment.</P>
    <P>The allocation for salaries and allowances provides for the continuation of Garda recruitment so as to maintain the strength of 11,400 provided for in the national plan.  Sixty-eight recruits have been appointed so far this year, a further 100 will be commencing training next Wednesday and further recruitment to fill vacancies is planned for later in the year.  Altogether, over 1,400 gardaí have <Col N="1402" /> been recruited since the Government took office.  This is a substantial achievement at a time when public service numbers generally are being reduced and it is an expression of the Government's continuing commitment to providing the resources necessary to deal with the crime situation.</P>
    <P>Garda overtime has been the subject of much exaggerated comment in the press and elsewhere in recent weeks and I think it would be useful to put the matter in perspective on the occasion of this debate.  The Estimates provision for Garda overtime in 1986 is £12 million and there is no question of any reduction in this amount.  However, because expenditure in the first four months of the year was running at a very high level, the Garda authorities undertook a detailed review of expenditure on overtime so as to ensure that the best possible return is being got from it.  This review, together with a general reappraisal of Garda deployment, has led to some changes in the use of resources but the situation is being closely monitored by the Garda authorities so as to ensure that effective policing is maintained in all areas.  It is unfortunate that scare headlines and misleading allegations in the press and elsewhere of cutbacks in essential Garda services should give the public the impression that very high expenditure on Garda overtime is a prerequisite to an effective police service.  This type of publicity serves only to create a needless sense of insecurity and groundless fears that people and their property are being left without adequate protection.</P>
    <P>The fact is that the overtime provision is only one element in the total provision of Garda resources and it would be entirely misleading to regard a high incidence of overtime working, on its own, as any kind of reliable or valid measure of the effectiveness of policing.  This is what is important &mdash; the provision of an effective policing service that adequately meets requirements on a basis that is cost effective as well.  I want to assure the House that I will continue to ensure that the necessary resources are made available to the gardaí, and that all appropriate <Col N="1403" /> measures that need to be taken to enable the Garda Síochána to meet the policing needs of the community in an efficient and effective manner will in fact be taken.</P>
    <P>A sophisticated new national communications network is being provided at present for the Garda Síochána.  The new system is now installed and went &ldquo;live&rdquo; in February of this year in all parts of the country other than the Dublin metropolitan area.  This new system has brought about a very marked improvement in Garda communications facilities.  There is the facility now within each Garda division for instant communication between the divisional headquarters and each district in the division, and between each district and the sub-district stations attached to it.  This means that, at practically all times, gardaí and Garda cars on patrol duty within the division are in contact with and contactable from their station. In addition, each Garda division has the facility of instant radio communication with all adjoining Garda divisions.  This new system provides for much greater efficiency not alone in the transmission and exchange of information but in the control and utilisation of manpower and patrol cars.  It enables an improved service to be provided for the public &mdash; for example, in terms of a quicker response by the gardaí to calls for assistance &mdash; and of course it also means that any garda in need of help or guidance can seek it from his station instantly by radio.</P>
    <P>An important feature of the new network is the provision of radio telephone equipment &mdash; what has come to be known as the &ldquo;Green Man&rdquo;&mdash; at rural Garda stations which are not open round-the-clock. This equipment provides the public with immediate and direct access to the gardaí at times when their local station is closed.  This is a very useful feature in areas where station opening times are restricted.  It is free of charge and extremely simple to operate and I would encourage people to make good use of it whenever necessary.  The second stage of the network installation <Col N="1404" /> programme is the radio system for the Dublin metropolitan area.</P>
    <P>A £2 million contract was placed in April, 1985 for this system and it is planned that it will come into operation later this year.  It includes the most modern type of central control room which will replace the existing central control room in Dublin Castle which is no longer adequate for Garda needs.  The radio system will be supplemented by a computerised command and control system which will provide essential management information for the Garda authorities and ensure that the most efficient use is made of all gardaí and patrol cars on operational duties.  Similar systems have proved to be of very considerable benefit to police forces in cities abroad and I am confident that it will be of immense value to the gardaí in Dublin.  I hope to be in a position to place a contract for this system very shortly.</P>
    <P>Over £11 million has been spent to date on the communications network and the amount provided in the current year &mdash; £1.62 million &mdash; is sufficent to cover leasing repayments on the equipment which it is intended to acquire this year.  The continuing allocation of a high level of funds to this project is an example of the Government's commitment to ensuring that the Garda Síochána are provided with the technical resources they require in the vital area of communications.</P>
    <P>Computerisation is another area where the benefits of modern technology are being put at the disposal of the gardaí.  A new computer costing over £300,000 was provided for the gardaí in December of last year.  This has replaced their former model which was no longer adequate to meet the growing needs of the force and the new equipment will facilitate considerable expansion of the computer service available to the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>Sixty visual display units and ancillary equipment were purchased in 1984 and a contract was placed towards the end of 1985 for a further 45 visual display units and ancillary equipment.  This equipment, which has cost over £500,000, has <Col N="1405" /> enabled the 18 Garda divisional headquarters and a number of other busy stations both inside and outside the Dublin metropolitan area to be linked directly to the Garda computer.  This facility for immediate access to records &mdash; for example to check out stolen or suspect vehicles &mdash; is proving to be of great practical assistance to the gardaí in dealing with the crime problem.</P>
    <P>Work is being carried out at present on improving existing Garda computer systems, such as those dealing with stolen vehicles, firearms and criminals records. A new crime reporting and analysis system has been introduced this year. This is a sophisticated computer system which will provide investigators with information which may help in the solution of particular crimes and will produce analytic reports which will enable particular areas of criminal activity to be explored in depth so that necessary counter measures can be taken.  The amount provided for in 1986 &mdash; £980,000 &mdash; is sufficient to meet the cost of development planned for this year.</P>
    <P>Within the past decade the level of serious crime in our society has emerged as a major cause of public concern. Between 1977 and 1981 the level of indictable crime rose by some 42 per cent. The increase continued in 1982 and 1983 but at a lower rate &mdash; about 9 per cent and 5 respectively.  However, in 1984 &mdash; for the first time in six years &mdash; national serious crime figures actually, decreased by 2.6 per cent.  I am glad to be able to say that this downward trend continued in 1985 with a further reduction of 8.5 per cent and the early indications are that this trend is being maintained so far this year.</P>
    <P>There are many causes of increased crime rates and no doubt the reasons for a decrease in crime are complex also. However, there can be no doubt that the efforts of the Garda Síochána, with the full backing of the Government, have played a vital part in bringing about the continued reduction in the amount of indictable crime recorded.  I would like to make it absolutely clear that neither I nor the Government think that the battle <Col N="1406" /> is won.  The level of serious crime must still be viewed as a major problem facing our whole community and there is not the slightest room for complacency in our attitude to the matter.  The fight against the criminal must, and will, be vigorously pursued.  I can assure the House that the Government are fully committed to giving continued support to the various measures which have already been taken to deal with the situation.  I think, nevertheless, that we can take heart from the latest statistics.  They are proof that we are moving in the right direction and that measures being taken, with the full support of this Government since assuming office, are beginning to produce the desired results.</P>
    <P>I believe we can have confidence that the Garda, given the necessary resources and the support of the community as a whole, can continue to tackle the crime problem successfully.  It is right that we should acknowledge and appreciate that special measures taken by the Garda to deal with particular types of crime have been very effective.  I have in mind here the measure which were introduced to counter the spate of so-called &ldquo;joy riding&rdquo; crimes, to counter the series of reprehensible attacks on elderly people in isolated areas and to deal with drug abuse.</P>
    <P>The outbreak of so-called &ldquo;joy riding&rdquo; escapades was a feature of Dublin city life early last year.  The measures implemented by the Garda to deal with this menace have borne fruit and there is a strong evidence that the Garda are now winning the fight against this particular form of dangerous and wanton lawlessness. A special Garda unit was set up to deal with the problem.  A number of vans and cars have been specially deployed and additional custodial accommodation has been provided to ensure that &ldquo;joy riders&rdquo; and other criminals will serve the full sentences imposed on them by the courts.  Available statistics indicate that the problem of unauthorised takings of cars and rammings of gardaí in patrol cars and on motor cycles has abated considerably in the last 12 months.  For the State as a whole there was a decrease of 20 <Col N="1407" /> per cent in the number of unauthorised takings of vehicles in 1985 as compared with 1984.  As well as that, there has been a further decrease of 15 per cent in the number of unauthorised takings of vehicles in the first four months of 1986, as compared with the same period last year. These are the latest (and still provisional) figures available so there is every reason to hope that the downward trend is set to continue.</P>
    <P>The Garda have also been successful in dealing with the heinous attacks on elderly people which were so prevalent in 1984.  There was a considerable reduction in the number of recorded attacks on the elderly in 1985, as compared with the previous year.  This can be attributed in substantial part to measures devised and taken by the Garda and community groups working together in close co-operation. I should emphasise that this previously unheard-of type of crime presented problems of particular difficulty. I think Deputies will be well aware of the difficulties facing the Garda in affording protection and reassurance for elderly people living in remote and isolated places who were prey to crimes of particular viciousness.</P>
    <P>In association with the Community Alert Project, organised by Muintir na Tíre, the Garda authorities introduced certain detailed measures appropriate to each local situation.  The number of recorded attacks in 1985 fell by almost 50 per cent compared with the 1984 figure. This, I think, is a fair measure of the success of the strategies adopted to deal with the problem.</P>
    <P>We are all aware of the dreadful scourge of drug abuse in our society.  The effect which drug abuse has on the crime rate is difficult to measure, but I think there can be little doubt that it makes a bad situation a good deal worse.  However, I am glad to be able to say that it is the view of the Garda that the incidence of drug trafficking has levelled off.  In this context, it is relevant to make the point that whereas significant increases had been recorded each year in the early 1980s in respect of the number of persons <Col N="1408" /> charged with drug offences and the number of drug seizures, the figures for 1985 show a decrease &mdash; 7 per cent in the case of the former and a reduction of 4 per cent in the case of the latter.  The trend is continuing this year.  I believe that these figures are a fair indication of a reduction in the level of offences as the Garda certainly have not relaxed their vigilance in this area.  Indeed, more and more gardaí are being trained in the skills necessary to deal with these offences.  I am pleased to be in a position to report this improvement to the House. Again, I need hardly say that there is no room for complacency in relation to this most serious problem.  Nevertheless, it is heartening to note that the measures which the Government have initiated in recent years are beginning to pay off.  I can assure the House that any further steps that are seen by the Government to be necessary to combat the drugs problem will be taken.</P>
    <P>The Government's strategy in dealing with the crime situation has not been confined solely to measures to ensure that the Garda Síochána are as effective and efficient as possible in the investigation and detection of criminal activity.  The importance of crime prevention has not been overlooked.  It is probably true to say that it is only in recent times that the vital role the community can play in the fight against crime has come to be fully recognised.</P>
    <P>One crime prevention strategy which is being implemented by the Garda is the neighbourhood watch scheme.  Initially, pilot schemes were implemented by the Garda in the Dublin area.  These schemes were considered to have a useful role to play not just in relation to crime prevention but also in fostering a closer relationship and understanding between the Garda and the community.  The Government allocated funds last year for a publicity campaign to promote neighbour watch with a view to having it implemented as widely as possible throughout the country.  The campaign was launched in mid-summer and concentrated on television and radio coverage.  I am glad to be in a position to say that this was money <Col N="1409" /> well spent.  So far there are over 200 schemes in existence involving some 56,723 households throughout the country.</P>
    <P>While it is too early yet to come to any definite conclusion as to the effect of neighbour watch schemes on the level and incidence of crime, the preliminary indications are that the schemes are playing a valuable role in this respect.  The community relations section of the Garda Síochána have commenced a formal evaluation project on neighbourhood watch to measure the effectiveness of the scheme in reducing crime levels and in fostering improved relations between the Garda and the community.  I would like to take this opportunity to commend the Garda Síochána for adopting and promoting this innovative measure to deal with the crime situation and to congratulate the large number of communities who have initiated schemes in their areas.</P>
    <P>I come now to the Prisons Vote.  The Prisons Estimate reflects the very heavy demands which continue to be made on the prison service, particularly because of the large increases which have taken place in recent years in the number of offenders in custody.  The House will be aware that, since coming into office, the Government have been determined to ensure that people convicted of serious offences serve the sentences imposed on them by the Court.  The extent of the measures which have been taken to this end can be seen from the size of the increase in the number in costody since 1982.  The daily average number in custody in that year was about 1,200. Over the past four years the number has increased by over 50 per cent to about 1,900 at present.  To put this increase of about 700 into perspective it should be seen against an increase of only 200 over all of the ten years prior to 1982.</P>
    <P>This substantial increase in the number of prisoners being accommodated creates a need, in the short term, for further prison places.  We are now taking further measures which will provide the prison system with over 100 extra places over the next few months.  These include the acquisition of a new unit in the grounds <Col N="1410" /> of the Central Mental Hospital and works to provide additional accommodation at Portlaoise, Mountjoy, Cork and Spike Island.  Work is continuing on the new purpose-built place of detention at Wheatfield, and the intended capacity there has been increased to provide accommodation for 320 offenders.  This institution, which will be the second largest in the State after Mountjoy, should be completed towards the end of next year for use early the year after.</P>
    <P>There are some who have persisted in suggesting that the present accommodation difficulties would not have arisen if the prison capital programme which the Government inherited when they came into office had been proceeded with in its entirety.  I would like to make it clear once again that there is simply no basis for that suggestion.  The fact of the matter is that under that programme the earliest major additional accommodation which could be made available was the place of detention at Wheatfield.  That project has continued without interruption since the Government came into office and, as I have already indicated, the proposed capacity of the institution has been increased.  But the earliest moment at which that project could be completed was towards the end of 1987 and there can be no grounds, therefore, for the suggestion that if other parts of the programme had been proceeded with they would have been available to deal with our present needs.  It might be argued that it would have been prudent for the Government to proceed with the other parts of the programme to deal with future needs but that is a very different proposition from the misleading one which is normally put forward.</P>
    <P>The point about proceeding with the other projects in the capital programme so that they would be available to meet future needs is arguable.  The Government, took the view that, while there was a clear need to proceed with the place of detention of Wheatfield, it would not be sensible to proceed with other major projects without first having a thorough review of the entire penal system by a committee of inquiry.  In reaching this <Col N="1411" /> decision, the Government took into account the enormous costs which would be involved in proceeding with those projects and the likely timescale for their completion &mdash; a timescale which meant that they would not be available in the short term to deal with increases in custodial demand which were already taking place.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances, the unprecedented increase in the numbers in custody has had to be dealt with, by and large, by maximising the use of existing institutions. This has required considerable resourcefulness on the part of management and staff of the prison service and I am sure that the House will join me in paying tribute to the efforts which the service have been making to cope with these demands.</P>
    <P>Increases of the magnitude which have taken place clearly pose severe difficulties for the prison service and I am anxious to take whatever steps are open to me to help alleviate those difficulties. However, the House will accept that the only real alternative to the measures which have been taken to increase custodial accommodation would have been to resort to early releases on a scale which would have had the most serious implications for the operation of the criminal justice system.  While there is no doubt that the numbers in custody at present are, in terms of prison administration, undesirably high, the Government, when faced with difficult choices in this area, have to take into account the overriding need to protect society from those who engage in serious crime.</P>
    <P>While I do not wish to understate the difficulties facing the prison service it is, nevertheless, the case that the pressure on prison accommodation is by no means unique to our administration and, more importantly, we have been able to cope with it so far without resorting to the type of extreme measures which other administrations have deemed necessary. In particular, every effort is being made to maintain the level of services to offenders despite the increases in the prison population.  This approach can be <Col N="1412" /> seen from the Prisons Estimate for this year: the provision of £645,000 for manufacturing is almost 90 per cent up on last year's outturn and the provision of £229,000 for educational services, excluding teachers' salaries, is over 30 per cent higher than the 1985 outturn. Having mentioned the difficulties being experienced by other prison administrations, I can inform the House that it is quite common for people from other administrations who visit our prisons to comment favourably on them in the context of the difficulties they face in their own systems.</P>
    <P>Again, while not wishing to minimise the extent of our difficulties, it is fair to say that people who attribute all the problems which arise in the prisons solely to pressure on accommodation are adopting an excessively simplistic approach. The reasons, at a given time, for trouble in prisons are, of their nature, very complex and I would caution against a tendency towards superficially plausible, but perhaps ultimately unsustainable, analysis in this area.</P>
    <P>Before dealing with some of the detail of this year's Estimate for the prisons I would like to refer fairly briefly to the report of the committee of inquiry into the penal system.</P>
    <P>The Report represents the first study of its kind into our penal system and I reiterate the Government's gratitude to all the members who served on the committee and particularly to their chairman, Dr. T.K. Whitaker.  Consideration of the report is continuing in my Department and I am in the process of consulting with various groups &mdash; mainly groups directly involved in the penal system &mdash; about various aspects of the report.  I would, of course, welcome also any views which Deputies might wish to communicate to me on the report</P>
    <P>While time does not permit me on this occasion to deal with the issues raised in the report in any detail, there is one observation I should make.  Since the report was published a number of calls have been made along the lines that it should be implemented immediately and <Col N="1413" /> in full.  Those calls are, at best, disingenuous and attempt to ascribe to the report a nature which it does not have.</P>
    <P>The problems which the committee were asked to examine are very complex. They are problems faced by every democratic society and ones for which there are very few easy or definite answers.  The committee advocate certain approaches to these problems and principles which should guide future policy. The committee does not, however, purport to set out a detailed blueprint for the operation of the penal system indicating in precise detail what steps the Government should take in this area.  It will be clear to those who study it that the report is of a very different kind.  In the circumstances, calls which have been made for the implementation of the report without further clarification and which are made as if they indicated, of themselves, definite and specific actions which I or the Government should take do not amount to much.</P>
    <P>Returning to the Prisons Estimate before the House, it will be seen that the largest proportion of expenditure is in respect of the remuneration of prison staff.  A sum of £37,143,000 has been provided for salaries, wages and allowances but this will have to be revised later in the year to take into account extra expenditure arising from the continuing high numbers in custody and, more particularly, difficulties which have arisen in relation to certain groups of offenders.</P>
    <P>One of the most unwelcome developments in the prisons in the past year has been the need to cater for a number of offenders who have been found to have AIDS antibodies.  This has inevitably had implications for staffing levels.  The House will be aware that it was decided to segregate offenders in this category principally for two reasons, first, the need to avoid unease among the general prison population and, second, to enable the precautions and restrictions which are medically advised to be applied more easily.  A section of Arbour Hill Prison, as well as part of Mountjoy Prison have had to be used exclusively for a number of male offenders with AIDS antibodies. <Col N="1414" /> Female offenders with AIDS antibodies are located at present in another part of Mountjoy.</P>
    <P>Staffing levels have also had to be increased as a result of additional security measures being taken at Portlaoise Prison since the attempted escape last November by a number of prisoners there.  In addition, extra measures involving increases in staffing levels have proved necessary in a number of institutions, notably Mountjoy, to aid better supervision and control of offenders.</P>
    <P>The specific problems which I have outlined are among those which have necessitated the deployment of extra staff in order to maintain good order and security.  Pending a detailed review of extra staffing requirements &mdash; against the background of the Government's policy of restricting numbers in the public service but taking into account the particular demands being made on the prison service &mdash; the bulk of the demand for extra staffing has been met, so far, almost exclusively by overtime working.  This, particularly when taken in conjunction with the level of overtime dependency inherent in the operation of existing roster arrangements, has led to very heavy demands being made on staff for extra attendance.  I am conscious of the undesirability of allowing this situation to continue indefinitely and I have been examining a number of ways in which it might be alleviated.</P>
    <P>Both management and staff within the prison service will benefit from the use of Beladd House in Portlaoise as a residential training centre.  I had the pleasure of opening the centre some weeks ago and already a number of courses have been held there.  A sum of £45,000, exclusive of staff costs, has been provided in this year's Estimates for staff training and development and this will be used to provide training not only for new recruits but also developmental training for prison service personnel at all levels.  I feel confident that the investment of these resources will prove to be a wise development and I am sure that the House will join me in wishing this initiative well in its attempt to equip further the prison service to deal <Col N="1415" /> more effectively with its responsibilities in a difficult and rapidly changing environment.</P>
    <P>Apart from staff costs, the major item of expenditure provided for in the Prisons Estimate for 1986 is the allocation of £12.74 million to the capital programme. The bulk of the money being made available is to enable work to continue at full momentum on the new place of detention at Wheatfield.  Site works and enclosure were completed in 1983, construction and servicing of the buildings are now more than half completed and it is expected that the project will be finished on time by the end of 1987.</P>
    <P>An extension to Cork Prison, to provide 50 additional cells, commenced last October and is virtually completed.  This extension is constructed to the same high standard as the existing modernized cell units and should enable the prison's education unit, which has been temporarily used since last year to provide dormitory accommodation for approximately 30 offenders, to be used again for its original purpose.</P>
    <P>Other projects relating to the upgrading of existing custodial accommodation are covered by the capital allocation.</P>
    <P>It is perhaps inevitable, given the amounts of money involved, that in speaking on the Prisons Estimate I have concentrated on expenditure incurred on providing and operating places of custody.  This should not be taken as any lessening of a desire on the part of the Government to continue to develop effective alternatives to custody.</P>
    <P>The major new alternative introduced in recent years has been the community service scheme which was brought into operation at the end of 1984.  I am pleased to say that the scheme is being resorted to extensively by the Courts and by the end of last month over 1,000 orders had been made and a further 280 offenders were being assessed for suitability by the probation and welfare service.</P>
    <P>Probation is used widely by the Courts and it is my Department's policy to continue to develop its effectiveness as a viable alternative to custody.  Towards <Col N="1416" /> this end several probation hostels, workships and day centres have been established throughout the country by voluntary committees in association with the probation and welfare service.  My Department contribute 100 per cent towards the capital cost of purchasing and refurbishing premises for these projects and up to 90 per cent of their running costs.  I am convinced that expenditure in this area is both cost-effective and socially desirable and I think this year's allocation of £1.4 million, compared to an outturn last year of about £1.1 million, is further evidence of the Government's commitment to a wide range of approaches within the penal system.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the Courts Vote where I have broad responsibility for providing essential back-up services to enable the Courts to function effectively.  My responsibility also extends, of course, to the promotion of legislation relating to the establishment, jurisdiction and functioning of the various Courts and the making of statutory orders under existing legislation.  In practical terms, my main concerns are in three areas, namely, courthouse accommodation, the strength of the Judiciary and other matters requiring legislative action, and staffing.</P>
    <P>Most Deputies will be aware of difficulties arising in regard to the suitability and adequacy of courthouse accommodation. I am afraid that I still find it necessary to emphasise that responsibility for the provision and maintenance of court accommodation, with certain exceptions in the Dublin area, is vested by law in local authorities.  It is apparent that pressures on local finances have affected the level of commitment of some local authorities to maintaining decent court venues.</P>
    <P>The picture is not all black, however, and there have been many improvements in recent years in a number of areas. Large scale improvements have been carried out at Waterford, Tralee, Carlow, Ennis, Kilrush, Portlaoise, Roscommon and Wicklow, while Wicklow County Council provided a new purpose-built courthouse at Bray in 1984.  Work on the <Col N="1417" /> restoration of the fire-damaged courthouse in Monaghan started early in March 1985 and is expected to be completed by August next.  Leitrim County Council are considering the possibility of providing a new courthouse at Carrickon-Shannon. Other local authorities are dealing with less extensive works on an ongoing basis.</P>
    <P>The current major concern is the restoration of Cavan courthouse.  For financial reasons work on this project was delayed by Cavan County Council.  However, acting on an order of mandamus made by the High Court, I issued a direction to the Commissioners for Public Works at the end of January to effect the necessary repairs as provided for in section 6 (1) (a) of the Courthouses (Provision and Maintenance) Act, 1935.  I understand that Cavan County Council have since indicated that they are now prepared to proceed with a scheme for the reconstruction of the courthouse to include court and county council requirements. In doing so they would be acting as agents for the OPW for the court element of the work.</P>
    <P>In Dublin within the past few years nine additional courtrooms have been made available for the various courts.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to go into this matter in detail but I would like to point out that the new Children's Court complex will provide generous waiting and consultation facilities, conference rooms and duty rooms for probation and welfare officers. The plans include two courtrooms and judges' rooms, a retiring room for solicitors, and separate waiting areas for gardaí, witnesses and members of the public.  Deputies will be aware that the money necessary to build the permanent Children's Court is being provided from the dormant funds of suitors in the High Court under the Funds of Suitors Act, 1984.</P>
    <P>In the few minutes I have left, I would like to deal with a few of the other aspects of the Courts Vote before the House.  As far as staffing is concerned, court officers have had to cope with staff shortages arising from the restrictions on Civil Service <Col N="1418" /> recruitment in common with most other State services.  In some cases, lack of staff combined with increasing workloads has given rise to problems.  I am glad to say that the assignment from November last of 56 temporary clerical trainees to court offices has helped to alleviate some of the problems.  In addition, it was found possible to have special arrangements made for a few offices where the effect of the embargo was becoming critical.  Among these were the High Court, particularly the central office and the probate office.</P>
    <P>One area where staff shortages and increased workloads had brought about unacceptable delays was in the issuing of fines warrants.  Deputies will be aware that the Committee on Crime, Lawlessness and Vandalism raised this issue last year.  Various claims were made at the time about the value of the unissued warrants. An informal survey carried out in my Department last September showed that some 115,000 warrants with an estimated face value of £4.25 million were outstanding.  Computerisation, the assignment of temporary clerical trainees and special staff effort where this was possible helped to reduce the arrears by the end of the year to about 76,000 warrants with an estimated face value of £3.4 million.  Further inroads have been made into the arrears since then.  It is important to appreciate, of course, that at the best of times there will be a volume of unissued warrants representing an irreducible level of work in progress.</P>
    <P>It is intended to extend computerisation in court offices.  This will bring about a greater degree of modernisation of court work and will also help to offset the effects of staff shortages.  A computer system is already in operation in the Dublin metropolitan district.  It has proved most successful in processing a large volume of summonses and warrants. Statistics for the Garda Commissioner's crime report are also compiled on this computer and as a consequence there have been significant savings for court staff and the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>The build-up of delays, especially in Cork, in the hearing of High Court jury <Col N="1419" /> actions and in Circuit Court criminal and civil business, is a cause of concern.  The time taken to dispose of High Court civil actions at present is about 12 months, with the exception of Cork where the delay has been as high as 30 months. Following special steps taken by the President of the High Court, including extra court sittings, the delay there has been reduced to about 26 months.  It is hoped that this will be reduced to 24 months by the end of the year.  There are no delays in the hearing of non-jury common law actions.  Circuit Court business in Cork has increased substantially since 1979 and this has inevitably affected the speed with which cases have been disposed of.  The president of the Circuit Court is doing all that is possible to reduce the arrears and has assigned a second judge to Cork on a full time basis.</P>
    <P>The Presidents of the High Court and Circuit Court have been helped in arranging additional sittings by the appointment by the Government early this year of an additional judge to each court which was made possible following the legislation I mentioned earlier.</P>
    <P>I wish to make some brief comments about three matters which are covered by the Vote of the Office of the Minister for Justice, viz., compensation for victims of the Stardust fire, legal aid and law reform.</P>
    <P>Almost £8 million has been paid cut in awards in 400 cases by the Stardust victims compensation tribunal.  In addition £0.6 million has been paid in respect of legal and other expenses.  Of the £8.6 million million spent so far £0.8 million was spent in 1985 and £7.8 million has been spent this year to date.</P>
    <P>As was stated in this House by my immediate predecessor, the reason the Stardust victims compensation tribunal was set up by the Government was to bring to a speedy end the difficulties that obtained in relation to compensation for victims of that tragedy.  The tribunal commenced work last October and it has dealt expeditiously with all claims made to it since then.  An indication of the satisfaction felt by the victims with the <Col N="1420" /> work of the tribunal is that to date only one award has been turned down by an applicant.</P>
    <P>The original closing date for the receipt of applications by the tribunal was 31 January 1986.  Representations were made in recent months, however, that not all applicants had been able to submit their claims to the tribunal by that date. Accordingly, it was decided in the middle of last month that there should be a new closing date.  Notices were put in the newspapers to the effect that a new closing date of 20 June 1986 would apply.</P>
    <P>It is not clear yet what the exact total cost of awards made by the tribunal will be.  What is clear, however, is that the provision in this year's Estimate of £5 million is inadequate.  In fact, as I have mentioned already, £7.8 million has already been paid out this year.  On the basis of the information now available it would appear that £9.4 million will be required this year.  Accordingly, the House is being asked to approve a Supplementary Estimate of £4.4 million for the Vote of the Office of the Minister for Justice.</P>
    <P>The 1986 provision for civil legal aid is £1,552,000.  Although this allocation will not, of itself, allow for any expansion of the board's services the board have been able to open three additional Law Centres, a second centre at Cork and centres at Tralee and Athlone in recent months, and intend to open a fourth centre at Tallaght shortly.  These centres will be financed until the end of 1987 from the moneys available for civil legal aid under a provision in the Funds of Suitors Act, 1984.</P>
    <P>I introduced substantial improvements in the means test provisions in the civil legal aid scheme with effect from 29 May last.  Details of the changes were announced in the usual way and copies of the amended scheme have been laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The changes are designed to restore the position regarding eligibility for services under the scheme to what was intended when the scheme was introduced in 1980, and to extend further the improvements <Col N="1421" /> made since then for applicants who are in receipt of social welfare payments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>A sum of £2.5 million is provided for criminal legal aid in the 1986 Estimates &mdash; this represents an increase of just over £325,000 on what it had cost to run the scheme last year.  One reason for this is that there has been increased recourse to the scheme generally by the Courts in disposing of criminal business coming before them, and the Supreme Court ruling that accused persons have a constitutional right to legal aid in certain circumstances must be borne in mind in this context.  Other reasons include increased legal fees to counsel and solicitors under the scheme, coupled with an increase to 25 per cent in the rate of value-added tax charged on these fees which, of course, is ultimately recouped to the Exchequer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the subject of law reform, the position is that it is not within the Rules of this House for a Deputy to advocate legislation in the course of an Estimates debate.  For that reason, I do not think that it would be appropriate for me &mdash; even if I were technically within the Rules of the House &mdash; to make any statement about particular legislative measures in my area of responsibility.  Accordingly, I propose to confine my remarks to saying that my legislative proposals will be brought to the notice of the Members of the House in the usual way.  Deputies will be aware that many proposals for law reform have been introduced and <Col N="1422" /> debated in the House in recent times relating to areas for which I have responsibility.</P>
    <P>To comment briefly on the Estimate in relation to the Land Registry and Registry of Deeds, there is a specific vote for that office.  A number of improvements are required there in order to deal with delays which have emerged.  I would point out that a programme of computerisation of the registry's folios commenced in December 1982.  It was decided to start with the Dublin folios for the reasons that it has the smallest number of folios of the five geographical regions into which the registry is divided for work purposes and there were no duplicate folios available for Dublin as there are in the local offices of the other 25 countries.  The computerisation of the Dublin folios was completed during 1985.  Plans are being prepared at present for the continuation of the programme into other areas of the country. Word processors are being used in different areas of the registry and the use of personal computers is being considered. The feasibility of computerising the registry's maps is also under active consideration.</P>
    <P>The technological advances which have been made in the Land Registry in recent years and the further proposals under consideration in the Land Registry and Registry of Deeds represent considerable progress which has already reflected itself in increased efficiency in some areas and will eventually do so over the whole range of activities of both registries.</P>
    <P>I shall conclude on that note, a Cheann Comhairle, thanking the House, and Deputy Woods in particular, for his&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We have pleasure in supporting the Estimate for this Department.  If we had any question about it, it would be about applying greater resources in this area, particularly to the Garda Síochána in the work which they are doing at present in trying to tackle the incidence of crime.</P>
      <P>While I have some comments to make on the management and administration of the Votes which we are discussing here, I want to make it clear that we believe all the resources required should be applied to this area to bring down the present levels of crime as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>Before going into that subject in any detail, I welcome the Supplementary Estimate which we have before us today under G.3, Stardust compensation tribunal, which is for £4.4 million, being the additional sum which the Minister considers would be required in the course of this year to meet the requirements of the tribunal.  As the Minister knows, we welcomed the setting up of this tribunal and I wish to record the fact that I particularly welcomed the Minister's decision to extend the closing date when it became clear that people did not quite understand the situation in relation to the original closing date.  That date was 31 January 1986 and as the Minister has said, representations were made in recent months that not all applicants had been able to submit their claims to the tribunal before that date.  I was amongst those who made representations on behalf of individuals who had missed the original date and I commend the Minister and the Government on taking that action in a very considerate and caring way.  It indicates the way in which the work of the tribunal has been very caringly handled by the Government on behalf of this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to return to the general area of crime and vandalism which the Minister dealt with at the outset.  Crime and vandalism are still rampant in Dublin, Cork, Limerick and other urban areas.  The fear of being robbed, attacked and mugged <Col N="1424" /> has reached epidemic proportions in both urban and rural areas.  This new fear is a very real fear though it is not always based on reality.  I accept the comment which the Minister made in this respect.</P>
    <P>People have lost their sense of security. They have lost faith in the ability and commitment of the Government to deal effectively with crime and vandalism. People are tired of listening to statistics, international comparisons and talk about plateau and levelling off.  They want a return to law and order, to security in the homes, in businesses and on the streets. They want to see it now in practice.</P>
    <P>I find very little patience when I tell people that the position is bad but that there has been some improvement in relation to stolen cars and in relation to the incidence of recorded crime.  People in areas which are still being very severely affected by crime do not want to know about that.  The statistics show that crimes of violence are increasing.  That is probably one of the reasons for the continuing fear in the community.  People see increasing incidence of violent crimes, robbery, brutality and thuggery throughout the community.  Even though the total number of theft of vehicles and so on may be reducing somewhat, nevertheless they see these obvious manifestations of crime.  They are afraid when they are going to shopping centres, particularly in some areas of this city or when they are going out at night.  They are even afraid in their homes.  They are afraid to open their doors to anyone, especially at night.  That terrible fear has grown in the community.  If we look at studies in other countries we find that this fear becomes bigger than reality, sometimes much bigger.  We must deal with that fear as well as dealing with the reality.</P>
    <P>The Minister said there was a reduction of 2.6 per cent in crime in 1985 and that he expects a further reduction of 8.5 per cent.  He said that the early indications are that this general figure is reducing.  I do not know if the Minister saw a programme last night on &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo;. It was very late in the night by the time <Col N="1425" /> I saw it because I was attending a meeting during the evening on crime and vandalism. It was a very large meeting.  If one talked about statistics there, one would be in serious trouble.  While we were at the meeting stolen cars were being driven up and down outside the community centre.  All the small shops in the area have been closed.  The shopping centre was closed completely due to arson and vandalism but it is now opening again. The community centre has been burned on several occasions.  This has involved tremendous costs.  The community are trying to run that centre.  The parish hall which was formerly a church was recently burned.  This is not happening in that community alone.  The community next door are in exactly the same position. Jokes are being passed around the north side at present.  I have reported these matters to the Garda.  I know they are watching some of the people who have been coming into the communities.  One can understand people becoming very annoyed and upset on hearing about reductions in the overall figures for the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>On the programme last night a retired garda officer spoke about the recorded figures for crime.  He stated that 20,000 crimes went unrecorded in the year.  He said that one must be careful when looking at the overall figures.  There is a quetion mark about what is being recorded. Only the ones that go down on the relevant form are recorded.  I did not have an opportunity to study the programme in detail because I was trying to do other things while looking at it on video during the small hours of the morning.  I am nearly afraid to say that I have a video because making the fact known might lead to my not having it very soon.  That is a reality and is not a joke.  Many videos in my area have been stolen.  There is a problem in relation to the recording of crime and to the figures and statistics in general.  I warn the Minister against becoming too tied up with statistical figures.  It was also pointed out on the programme that for a reasonably long period last year these forms were not <Col N="1426" /> available and that would have affected the amount of recorded crime.</P>
    <P>We hear complaints from time to time about the extent of recorded crime and how realistic it is.  We hear complaints by experts who say that the basis for recorded crime is not the most accurate or the best basis.  The Minister could look at that some other day.  I have urged him before not to be complacent.  He said that while he thinks things are going in the right direction he is also being careful not to be complacent.  He is very wise in that. There are serious problems in relation to the availability of manpower and to overtime.  I suggested before that the Minister should look at some of these areas and see what is happening.  The gardaí are not available in sufficient numbers, but those who are available are doing their best.  Any of them will tell us that they do not have the manpower, the flexibility and the overtime arrangements to deal with crime.  They are very familiar with what is happening.  They become annoyed when they hear people talking about statistics because they know that they could do so much more to clean up the crime problem if they had the resources to do so.</P>
    <P>I welcome any levelling off in crime but my argument is that the current level of crime is far too high.  We must reduce it very substantially and urgently before we can make any real progress in this area.  It requires dramatic action which will take a major commitment on the part of resources and manpower.  People want to see a return to law and order.  They want to see a return to security and more gardaí on the streets with modern equipment and technical back-up.  The visible presence of gardaí in the community will instill a new sense of security.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, there are two aspects.  First, the severe incidence of crime, vandalism and frightening violence, and second, widespread fear.  We have got to deal with both of these.  In addition, effective measures to tackle crime will help restore the faith of the community in the existence and administration of law and order.  People are very unsure and uncertain.  All of this cannot <Col N="1427" /> be laid at the doors of the Minister or of the Garda Síochána, in particular.  There are the questions of sentencing policy and the treatment of offenders.  There are recent cases to which I can point to.  After a great chase by the Garda Síochána and efforts by local citizens they apprehend a couple of people who are brought before the courts.  These people come back out laughing.  The process will catch up with those people, probably fairly soon.  Try to explain that to people who see dangerous situations on the streets and children within a hair's breadth of being knocked down.  I have given the Minister letters about stolen cars careering around in board daylight.  The Garda Síochána are fully aware of this situation.  People are very much afraid because there will be a fatal accident.  There have been in the past with adults.  There is a real fear for small children.  Small children play around greens and roads.  No one would necessarily want to have children knocked down, even the drivers themselves. Tragically, that is what will happen.  They have got to be stopped in their tracks.  We have not seen the implementation and the use of spiked belts.  We were told that they would be used in particular cases and appropriate instruction would be issued.  People felt this would be a good thing.</P>
    <P>In Canada there has been a good deal of success with spiked belts rather than the initial chain idea.  There can be dangers in using these.  If we contrast this with the danger of small children playing on the streets and coming out of schools, action has got to be taken in those circumstances. I would ask the Minister in his reply to let us know how he is getting on with the studies he is doing in that area or if he has decided to leave them aside. The problem is still there.  As I say, the presence of the Garda Síochána would help a great deal.  This will not be achieved without a radical restructuring and modernisation of the Garda Síochána. This must include the granting of authority and responsibility for the financial control and disposal of the Garda budget to the management of the Garda Síochána. <Col N="1428" /> This is one of the kernel points in relation to these Estimates.  We are talking about substantial Estimates.  The Minister gives us global figures for his Department and the Garda Síochána. The figure for the Garda Síochána is £255 million.  There is some breakdown for salaries, travelling and incidental expenses.  The system is far too centralised in relation to the management and disposal of the financial resources.  This centralisation has not only undermined the effectiveness of the Garda Síochána but it has resulted in a cold war between the Minister and the Garda associations, a decline in Garda morale and the disruption of entire communities by vandals and thugs.  That is at the heart of this question. There is no point in us discussing global figures if the authority and responsibility in relation to expenditure is not given to the Garda Síochána.  It is time they were given that responsibility and controls were put on them to account for themselves in an exact and detailed way under proper management systems.</P>
    <P>The position is hopeless for a Garda superintendent trying to deal with crime in his local area.  He knows what his problems are.  He knows what is needed to deal with them.  If he does not, he should not be the one on the job.  The Minister has to realise that as far as the Garda Síochána are concerned we are not managing individuals any more, we are managing managers.  Every other business manages managers, but the Garda Síochána in relation to financial responsibility are not managing managers.  They are not managing by objectives.  They are not organised to do that.  That organisation is necessary.  This can be seen very clearly on the ground from the various superintendents trying to tackle the problem. They know from their own police experience how to go about tackling it.  They know the information, the intelligence and the surveillance they need.  They are the professionals on the ground, not the Minister, not the Department, not the Opposition.  They must be developed, promoted and supported to manage. They have to carry the responsibility of that management.  There is a need for a <Col N="1429" /> redefinition of that role and the part Garda management must play.  It is my clear impression that the system has become far too centralised.</P>
    <P>Improvements in the management and training of gardaí are long overdue.  Several valuable reports on management have already been prepared.  I am not going to go back into them.  There have been a variety of reports down through the years.  There is no point in the Minister saying that a previous Minister did not deal with it, that he left and passed it on to the next Minister.  That is no use. That is only playing games in the House from one side to the other.  The Government are there almost four years.  The Minister has the opportunity and he is the one in control.  If he wants to take action, he can take it and he is responsible for it.  It is not as if work was not done before his time, it was.  As a result of that work done by various Ministers, reports on management are available.  These have been ignored by the Minister, together with the reports on Garda training and on the prison system.  They are gathering dust in the Department.</P>
    <P>There are two reports on Garda training. There was one completed by the Select Committee on Crime, Lawlessness and Vandalism which was submitted a year ago.  That was a valuable exercise, when people of all parties came together and studied such matters.  Of course they recognise that they are not the ultimate experts.  Very quickly we saw there were major deficiences in the whole training of the Garda and various steps that should be taken urgently to rectify those deficiencies.  Some time after that committee had begun their work the former Minister established a group to study the subject of Garda training.  Since the committee established by the Minister would have a great deal of resources available to them, freedom of activity, travel facilities and so on, we decided we would allow them add their extra expertise.</P>
    <P>It is quite clear that nothing has been done about the recommendations of either of those reports.  Of course the Report of the Dáil Committee has been published for all to see.  It appears that <Col N="1430" /> only the Minister, his Department or possibly other Government Ministers have the other report available to them.</P>
    <P>As I understand it, it is a fairly comprehensive report which goes into more detail with regard to costings and so on. The Minister said that the Whitaker Report did not constitute a blueprint or give a detailed analysis of costings of its recommendations.  As I understand the position, the report of the committee established by the Minister did provide that kind of information, recommending immediate action.  Their mandate was to publish a first report which would help the Minister in taking action.  The delay in that respect is too great and the Minister should get on with the job.  The Garda themselves have been crying out for action for a long time.</P>
    <P>It is somewhat ridiculous to be considering these Estimates in relation to the Garda Síochána without knowing who will be responsible for the expenditure of the moneys or on what they will be spent. For example, under subhead A &mdash; Salaries Wages and Allowances &mdash; the Estimates show an increase of £7.6 million or 4 per cent, which includes a figure of £12 million for overtime in 1986.  The Estimate shows the global figure.  It does not break down that figure into allocations to the Garda for community policing, Border duties, prison duties, the protection of dignitaries and embassies, escort duty, traffic control, sporting occasions or headquarters operations.  The Minister may contend that some of these are security matters in respect of which he does not want to give detailed information. Of course we accept that.  But that does not mean that the cloak of security should be used to cover up everything; that cloak has been used for too long. The question of Border security needs to be divorced from the basic problem of community policing, which is what people, particularly in our larger cities and towns, are concerned with, where crime is at its highest levels.</P>
    <P>The lack of a specific allocation of moneys for policing communities has been at the heart of the recent crisis in <Col N="1431" /> overtime allocation.  Local superintendents did not and do not know where they stand.  The Minister may contend that there has been some kind of communications breakdown.  I noticed that he referred to that matter in the course of his introductory remarks.  Presumably he realised that many problems have been raised in this area.  Indeed the media have raised many questions on this whole issue of overtime.  In this respect the Minister repeated what he said in the House before:</P>
    <P>The Estimates provision for Garda overtime in 1986 is £12 million and there is no question of any reduction in this amount.  However, because expenditure in the first four months of the year was running at a very high level, the Garda authorities undertook a detailed review of expenditure on overtime so as to ensure that the best possible return is being got from it.</P>
    <P>The Minister continued to say:</P>
    <P>This type of publicity serves only to create a needless sense of insecurity and groundless fears that people and their property are being left without adequate protection.</P>
    <P>The Minister continues to give assurances that he will provide the necessary resources in this regard.  Indeed he continued to say:</P>
    <P>This is what is important &mdash; the provision of an effective policing service that adequately meets requirements on a basis that is cost effective as well.  I want to assure the House that I will continue to ensure that the necessary resources are made available to the gardaí, and that all appropriate measures that need to be taken to enable the Garda Síochána to meet the policing needs of the community in an efficent and effective manner will in fact be taken.</P>
    <P>The fact of the matter is that the Garda on the ground do not have adequate resources.  When communities, the subject of vandalism and crime, turned to their local superintendents asking what <Col N="1432" /> are we to do, they are told there is no money for overtime.  That is why there are so few gardaí in these areas to follow up problems.  The sad reality is that if adequate numbers of gardaí were available they could deal with such problems, effectively.  Therefore I must disagree with the Minister because it is evident that the police are not being provided with the necessary resources.  It would appear that there is an allocation of £12 million for overtime, for flexibility of Garda manpower, in 1986.  It appears the Government then raided the overtime fund to provide for Border commitments. Garda management and effectiveness have been severely compromised especially in crime-ridden urban areas, resulting in frustration and the total failure of the Government to reinforce the Garda.  The overtime allocation was not available to the Commissioner and the Garda to deal with crime.  A political decision of the Government removed a substantial part of that allocation. Therefore this should have been catered for by way of a supplementary allocation.  If the Government are seriously concerned about the problems of crime and vandalism they must deploy more Garda to protect people and their property, to increase detection rates and prevent crime.  Garda must be freed from their typewriters.  They must receive more civilian support and be allowed to engage in the work of policing for which they have been professionally trained.</P>
    <P>I listened to the Minister speak about sophisticated computers.  We welcome the introduction of such technology at the upper levels of Garda management.  I see gardaí using very old typewriters, typing with two fingers.  That is the position on the ground.  They are totally behind the times.  I presume that the Minister would hope that computerisation would work its way downward.  But perhaps he could begin to do something in local Garda stations, particularly in areas severely affected by crime, freeing gardaí from their typewriters so that they can engage in proper police work.  The most obvious deficiencies in the overall position are the <Col N="1433" /> lack of civilian support and of modern office procedures and equipment.</P>
    <P>These deficiencies are so great as to be literally shocking.  No semi-State body is as badly equipped or supported as the Garda.  Going into the Garda stations around Dublin which are dealing with high volumes of crime is like walking back through the ages in terms of the facilities available by way of staff, back-up services and equipment.  I do not see why AnCO and other such bodies should have very sophisticated equipment to carry out their tasks and all the assistance they need &mdash; nearly every second person has a secretary &mdash; the position in which the gardaí find themselves is deplorable.</P>
    <P>This is the time to make the Stokes Kennedy Crowley report on the Garda Síochána available to the Oireachtas, particularly for the consideration of the Select Committee on Crime, Lawlessness and Vandalism.  It is obvious that &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo; producers had some information about it.  It seems everybody will get information except this House.  Why keep this kind of information secret from the House?  Apparently they were excluded from dealing with security matters. The Select Committee on Crime, Lawlessness and Vandalism, having reported a year ago on Garda training, are now considering the objectives, organisation and management structure of the force.  The Minister is thwarting the work of the committee by refusing to release either the report itself or a synopsis of it.  The &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo; programme last night had some sort of synopsis, wherever they got it from. These things are not available to this House, the Parliament of Ireland.  It is a disgraceful situation and the Minister should remedy it.</P>
    <P>No matter how hard the gardaí work, their contribution will be frustrated if the courts and the prison service do not play their part in a modern and efficient way. We do not have time now to go into greater detail on the work of the Garda Síochána.  It is such a major area that it merits much more time and discussion to <Col N="1434" /> help the Minister in arriving at the best solution.  The question of security is above politics.  I congratulate the members of the select committee on the way in which they co-operate almost totally in preparing valuable and useful reports in this area.  They realise that crime must be dealt with on a united basis.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the courts system and it is clear he is giving attention to that area which is in need for urgent overhaul and updating.  There must also be codification of laws.  The courts system was not designed to cope with today's high volume of crime and litigation.  Here again the Government's policy of overcentralisation is resulting in concentration in Dublin city to the detriment of the great and populous suburban areas like, Tallaght, Coolock and Ballyfermot.  The chambers of commerce in these areas are protesting and claiming that their little courthouses are being closed down. There are many effects of this policy of centralisation.  It means that the local gardaí must go into the city to pursue cases in court and offenders are not visibly dealt with in or near the communities where their crimes were committed. Community association and chambers of commerce want to help and to be involved and they are looking for a different approach.  There is a need for the lower courts to be brought closer to the communities they serve.</P>
    <P>The reform of the prison service has been thoroughly examined in the Whitaker report.  Sadly we have seen little action on this report.  Meanwhile low morale and tension are still a problem in the prison service.  This is illustrated at present in the pressure under which staff are working in Arbour Hill, St. Patrick's, Mountjoy and Portlaoise.  Staff in Arbour Hill are near breaking point from the imposition of compulsory overtime instead of the creation of new, even temporary posts.  I note from the Minister's speech that he seems to be aware that there is a problem in this area and that he intends to review it.</P>
    <P>A random sample of overtime worked in the 22 weeks up to mid-June shows <Col N="1435" /> prison officers being forced to work an extra 17 to 22 weeks overtime on top of their normal duty.  Some men worked a double week every week in the 22-week period; others worked a double week 17 times; and some others actually worked 24 weeks overtime in the 22-week period. I remember some time ago that prison officers were being criticised for the amount of money they were earning on overtime.  I remember a former Minister putting out a lot of nasty publicity attributing as large amount of overtime to the prison officers.  This is compulsory overtime and it cannot continue.  The strain is too great.  In any event working in the prison service is a considerable strain and the Minister must act now and appoint even temporary staff to relieve these men before another crisis develops in the prisons. I understand that similar problems exist in Mountjoy.</P>
    <P>Press reports have given some indication of the type of thing that is happening. Yesterday's edition of <i>The Irish Press</i> contained a report by Maol Muire Tynan which stated:</P>
    <P>The doctor of a 41-year-old Portlaoise prison officer who died earlier this month from a heart attack recommended last March that his patient should be assigned only light duties.</P>
    <P>It is claimed in the article that this recommendation was ignored by the prison authorities.  The individual and the doctors concerned are mentioned and it is stated that the man suffered from angina and diabetes.  The doctor wrote as follows:</P>
    <P>I recommended that his duties be confined to light duties.  He should not climb any stairs; he should not work any overtime or night duties.</P>
    <P>The article continues:</P>
    <P>This ledger (sic) went to the Department of Justice but the prison officer was still assigned to compulsory duties like other staff &mdash; including 20 hours overtime a week.</P>
    <P>His family said he was put on a particular wing where he had difficulty climbing the <Col N="1436" /> stairs.  If that kind of thing can happen in the prison service then there is an urgent need to look at the management.  There must be concern about those questions. We should not have a rigid textbook application in regard to compulsory overtime for all officers.  The circumstances in each case must be taken into consideration. We all are aware of the High Court action about compulsory overtime in which a pregnant female officer appealed against the decision to force her to do compulsory overtime.  Obviously, this is a serious issue in the prison service and may lead to difficulties in maintaining the prisons, particularly during the very warm weather.</P>
    <P>We are all aware of the riot and breakout at Arbour Hill in January.  That was an unusual occurrence because, as everybody recognised, Arbour Hill has always been quiet.  The staff there are overworked and I understand that some of them have been fined sums of £20 and £30 for failure to return to work overtime.  The Minister should review the system as a matter of urgency because what is happening at the moment is not good management. I appreciate that there are special considerations in regard to overtime in the prison service but one must follow that up.  The Minister should give special attention to that area.</P>
    <P>I regret that I will not have time to deal with all the matters referred to by the Minister.  I am pleased that the neighbourhood watch scheme is progressing reasonably well.  It is a good scheme and we will give it every support.  I was disappointed to hear that those promoting the scheme were not getting the equipment they were promised such as overhead projectors.  The Minister should ensure that those facilities are made available. He should not spoil the scheme for the ha'p'orth of tar.  The publicity material prepared for that scheme is very good. The gardaí responsible for developing the neighbourhood scheme are doing an excellent job.</P>
    <P>The victims of crime are being badly treated.  The compensation under Subhead G.1 for personal injuries criminally inflicted is being reduced by 33 per cent <Col N="1437" /> and the Irish Association for Victim Support are getting £10,000.  I appeal to the Minister to find some money from the multi-millions of pounds involved in the running of his Department and give it to the victim support group who are trying to do an important job for him in a voluntary way.</P>
    <P>With regard to civil legal aid, will the Minister consider introducing a management system so that the Department will know where the money is being spent. When I asked about the number of cases involved I was told that could not be worked out although we are aware that individuals have been paid £96,000 and £120,000 in one year.  When I asked the Minister to tell me the number of cases dealt with by five solicitors I was surprised to learn that that could not be worked out.</P>
    <P>We support the work the Minister is doing.  Our only complaint is that more resources are needed for the Garda Síochána.  They may be found internally or by an extra allocation but the Minister should ensure that the Garda get all the resources they require without delay.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mrs. Fennell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to speak at any great length on this Estimate because the important areas have been covered by the Minister.  I should like to refer to the areas for which I have a responsibility.  In his concluding remarks Deputy Woods referred to the neighbourhood watch scheme.  We all should be pleased at the success of that scheme. I hope it will expand in the future as people become aware of how it works. In my view it is the greatest resource that can be used by the Garda and the community, working closely together, in their efforts to combat the heinous crimes being committed against old people living alone.  The scheme will help to reduce those crimes because neighbours of those old people will be more watchful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My responsibility in the Department relates largely to the area of family law reform and equality of treatment for women.  I should like to mention that this <Col N="1438" /> week the Seanad passed Bills related to the equality of women, the Domicile and Recognition of Foreign Divorces Bill and the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Bill. I am happy to be able to record that those measures, which have been passed by both Houses, will enable us to remove at least two reservations entered in our ratification of the UN Convention on the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women.  I should like to state that after lengthy discussion on our White Paper we have produced the Bill dealing with the status of children.  It is expected that the Bill will be introduced in the Seanad shortly and will be before the Dáil in the next session.  That is an important and worthwhile piece of legislation.</P>
    <P>A particularly important development for the Garda Síochána and the prison service has been the extension to them of the scope of the Employment Equality Act, 1977.  The European Communities (Employment Equality) Regulations, 1985, made by the Minister for Labour last October, have the net effect of abolishing the general exemption from the scope of the 1977 Act which formerly applied to both the Garda Síochána and the prison service and to limit exemptions to certain categories of posts in both services. The exempted posts are: first, posts where it is necessary in the interests of privacy and decency that the post be filled by a person of a particular sex because the duties of the post involve either carrying out personal searches or direct personal supervision of prisoners of that sex while they are dressing or undressing; secondly, posts where the duties include guarding, escorting or controlling violent persons, or quelling riots or violent disturbances.</P>
    <P>Over the last decade there has been a steady increase in the number of banghardaí serving in the force from 34 in 1976 to a current strength of 357 and a further 20 have been called to commence training on 2 July.  The range of duties assigned to banghardaí has been extended over the years from being restricted to dealing mainly with women and children to a position where they perform practically <Col N="1439" /> the total range of duties in all branches of the force.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that banghardaí have been successful in a recent competition for promotion to sergeant rank, but I would like to see more banghardaí going forward for promotion as soon as they are eligible.  I hope to see increased participation of women in the higher ranks of the force and this can come about only if banghardaí are prepared to compete for promotion and demonstrate that they are willing, as well as able, to undertake the extra responsibilities that promotion entails.  I know they have the ability and that the willingness is there.  I am sure that the progress of women within the force will be further enhanced by the fact that the Garda Commissioner has assigned reponsibility for implementing, within the force, the policy of equality of opportunity between men and women to a chief superintendent in the headquarters personnel branch.</P>
    <P>In relation to the prison service, the extension of the Act will mean the gradual introduction of mixed staffing in the prisons.  Progress has already been made. For the first time, this year's recruitment competition for prison officers was open to male and female candidates and successful female candidates will be assigned in the next few months from the competition to fill vacancies in the prison service in accordance with the order of merit. Serving female officers will also become eligible for transfer to male prisons as new staff become available from the recruitment competition and promotion outlets will be open to women staff on an equal basis to men.  This is something which has been the case in practice for some time but it now has statutory backing. That represents a considerable breakthrough in an area which has been a traditional area of work for men.</P>
    <P>The regulations also mean that male officers may be assigned to female prisons, subject, of course, to exemptions on grounds of decency and privacy. Unfortunately, the small size of our two institutions for female offenders at <Col N="1440" /> Mountjoy and Limerick restricts scope for implementing this aspect of employment equality.  The reality is that we have a smaller number of female prisoners, about 60 women to 1,800 men.  I do not regret that; it is symptomatic of the nonviolence of women.</P>

      <P>It restricts the area of work for female officers to female prisons.  However, I am glad to say that the new and separate unit in the grounds of the Central Mental Hospital in Dundrum which is to be transferred from the Eastern Health Board to cater in the foreseeable future, primarily for female offenders, will be staffed on a mixed basis.</P>
      <P>I welcome the extension of employment equality to the prison service and I believe that the service and those it caters for will benefit from it.  I am glad to say that the Department are committed to implementing the regulations in an enlightened manner.  A policy statement issued following consultations with the Prison Officers' Association affirms that it is departmental policy to promote employment equality and that, in particular, regard will be had to equal treatment as regards training, job experience and promotions.  An initial target for female staffing of 10 per cent of total staff has been set and to ensure that the policy is implemented, and to iron out any problems that develop a monitoring committee, comprising of representatives of the Department, both headquarters and prison management, and of the Prison Officers' Association, have been set up. I feel confident that in future years the advent of employment equality in the prison service will be regarded as a landmark in the history of the development of the prison service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I now wish to say a few words about the pilot family mediation scheme.  Early in 1985 I appointed a steering committee to set up a pilot family mediation scheme. In October they presented their report to me, outlining how the scheme should be run.  The pilot scheme will be launched <Col N="1441" /> on 10 July.  It will operate in Dublin, in offices in Middle Abbey Street, and will be administered by a mediation committee, representing the legal profession, family counselling groups and social workers.</P>
    <P>In essence family mediation is a process whereby a third party &mdash; a professional mediator &mdash; assists a husband and wife to work out their own solutions when their marriage has irretrievably broken down.  The scheme will operate on an out-of-court basis and will be available free of charge to married couples resident in the State, usually before any steps are taken by them to avail of legal proceedings. It is envisaged that clients most likely to benefit from mediation would be referred to the service by, for example, solicitors, doctors, clergy, the Legal Aid Board's law centres, marriage counsellors, family assessment or counselling services.</P>
    <P>The main advantages of the scheme are: it can help both parties to identify and assess their options and to discuss the consequences before major decisions are finalised; it can bring the parties face-to-face and by tackling the issues directly it can dispel suspicions and misunderstandings; it can encourage people, especially parents, to take control of their own affairs and to work out their own solutions; it provides a neutral territory free from distressing associations and interruptions where the couple can talk in privacy; it can alert parents to what their children are experiencing because of the breakdown of the marriage and help them to maintain their parental role despite the ending of the marriage; and it can reduce the expense, delay and costs involved in marriage breakdown.</P>
    <P>In order to assess the effectiveness of the scheme, it will be independently assessed and monitored during its three-year term and a report prepared at the end of the experimental period for a Government decision on the wider use of such a service.</P>
    <P>Apart from the obvious benefits in human and emotional terms &mdash; the most important aspect of the scheme &mdash; it is confidently expected that the process of <Col N="1442" /> mediation will reduce the expense and delay involved in court action concerning marital breakdown.  Apart from the important social aspects of such a service for the parties to a breakdown and for their children, there could be a reduction in the number of court cases and thereby a saving to the State of administrative expenses and legal aid costs.</P>
    <P>I am very pleased that this important process which I initiated last year has been brought forward very efficiently and professionally by the voluntary committee who came together.  With great speed they have brought it to fruition and it will be in operation within the next two weeks.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak in this debate on the Estimate for the Department of Justice.  I preface my remarks by saying that one of the most disappointing aspects of economic and social development in Ireland in recent years has been that an increasing amount of scarce financial resources has had to be directed towards the preservation of law and order.  I do not think anyone in this House would disagree with that comment.</P>
      <P>In fairness, it must be said that the problem is not confined to Ireland alone as Governments generally find themselves having to make increased provision for law enforcement.  However, I have often made the point here that the level of crime in society is a fairly reliable barometer of the success or failure of a Government in the area of social and economic reform.  This view holds in the Irish context as we have watched the crime graph climb in line with the frightening increase in unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All of us welcome the assurances given by the Minister today when he quoted statistics showing that the level of crime is reducing.  However, statistics can be misleading and confusing and a person would have a very difficult job at present convincing anyone on the streets of Dublin that crime in urban and rural areas is decreasing.  It is also accepted that the crime graph rises in line with the <Col N="1443" /> level of confidence instilled by Government in terms of leadership and the hope and optimism generated in a community.</P>
    <P>In relation to the breakdown of law and order, one of the problems is that there is a lack of confidence on the part of many in our community in that they consider we have not the capacity to deal with the issue of law and order and with the many social problems in society. What we are experiencing is a backlash of our failure in that regard.  The House will agree that under these two headings, and there are many more, this Government have failed to tackle the root cause of crime and discontent.  Today we are trying to meet the financial cost of this failure through inadequate financial provisions which give society the worst of both worlds.  We have failed to bring about an economic climate where people will get employment and where proper social facilities will be provided.  At the same time under this Estimate we are refusing to provide adequate resources to protect society from the worst effects of the Government's failure in regard to social and economic reform.</P>
    <P>The Government area admitting that they do not have the capacity to tackle the root cause of these problems and they will not provide adequate protection against their failure in this regard.  This is not acceptable and the people will not tolerate it.  Deputy Woods referred to a meeting he attended last night where a large number of the citizens of Dublin expressed their abhorrence at our failure to deal with the problems of the breakdown in law and order.  I do not need to remind the Minister of the fear and insecurity which abound in our community in terms of the threat to life and property. This is not a sensational statement because the evidence is unfolding daily in our newspapers, on television and on radio.</P>
    <P>There was a time when a deterioration in law and order was confined to the urban areas but tragically in recent years this has spread to the rural areas as well. The criminal is retreating from the urban areas to the rural community and many <Col N="1444" /> people in rural Ireland, particularly those living alone and in isolated areas, are living in fear.  I want to compliment Muintir na Tíre for their efforts in organising the community watch which is an invaluable support system for the Garda Síochána. This scheme has more than proved its worth.  It is important when speaking about law and order in this House that we recognise the voluntary commitment made by those involved in the community watch system.</P>
    <P>The fact that we are an island nation should make for the easier curtailment of crime.  We should have more control over our own destiny.  I am not saying we are totally protected from what happens in Europe, but our isolation should make the problem easier to resolve.  I am very disappointed that crime in urban Ireland has increased at a faster rate than in any urban community in Europe within the past four or five years.  We are left with no other option than to channel an increasing amount of scarce financial resources into providing protection for our citizens.</P>
    <P>There has been a lot of talk in this House about how we can get the best return for the money collected by way of taxation.  I am a member of the Committee on Public Expenditure and we examined the expenditure patterns of various Government agencies, with, in my opinion, reasonably good results. However, this is tedious work and it will take time to get results.  I hope we have at least created an awareness within the Government of the need to monitor the social cost of policies as distinct from the immediate financial cost.  This is very relevant in the context of today's debate. The point I am making is that we cannot divorce the Estimate for the Department of Justice, or monitor the cost and how it could be reduced, without viewing it in the context of the efforts of other Government policies and decisions as being contributing factors.  I have no doubt that if the situation were examined we would get a far better and more productive return for the limited money available for national development.</P>
    <P>Escalating crime is a product of the <Col N="1445" /> society we have created.  The House will agree that unemployment is a major factor in the increase in crime as are poor housing and bad social conditions.  I do not see any real hope of improvement unless we are seen to tackle this area and those who are socially deprived have their confidence restored in this House and in the Government.  The answer to the problem is not the employment of additional gardaí or the building of more prisons. We are in the position of having to react to a situation which is frightening but which could have been minimised if the Government had taken action earlier in other areas.  I want to reiterate that if Governments had laid more emphasis on tackling social problems which are the root cause of the high level of crime, we would not be providing so much money for what could be decribed as unproductive expenditure.  This is unproductive expenditure to the extent that we do not get a viable return on it, but nevertheless it is necessary to provide this money since it is our duty to protect our citizens.</P>
    <P>In the past I have spoken of the need for confidence in the Government.  There is an unnecessary air of despondency around at present which would not exist if we had good and proper leadership. It is my honest belief that, apart from creating the correct economic environment, there is a duty on Government, and on the leader of Government, to instil a degree of confidence in society.  I am not making an unfair political comment when I say that level of confidence has not existed in this House or in the community for a considerable time.  This is one of the reasons young people become frustrated.  They look to the legislators to create the economic environment which will provide employment, but they have been looking in vain towards this House, this Parliament and the Government.</P>
    <P>If one reads Government statements in the papers one would have to agree &mdash; and the Minister of State opposite will have to agree &mdash; that there is no leadership and that no effort is being made to restore confidence in the Government. Despite all the problems facing us, I <Col N="1446" /> believe we can provide a good future for all, particularly our young school leavers. They are the people who are reacting to the Government's failure and they are the people who make it necessary for us to provide the level of security we are talking about today.</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods said the efforts to reorganise the Garda Síochána seemed to have been put on the long finger.  I join with him and, I am sure, with other members in complimenting the Garda Síochána on the extremely difficult task they perform on behalf of the community. On the other hand, they look to this House to provide them with the level of support they need to deal with difficulties which are increasing in intensity.  A source of disappointment to me and probably to other Members is that much of the legislation required and promised to give the Garda support in their task has not passed all stages in this House at present.  Therefore, it is imperative that instead of giving the lip service which we tend to give to the Garda Síochána we do something positive about their position and give them the support they are entitled to expect from this House.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his comments referred to the fact that Garda overtime was not a problem, but I say to him that as far as my constituency of Laois-Offaly is concerned Garda overtime is a problem.  The presence in our constituency of the top security prison has created a problem in the additional drain it creates on Garda manpower.  That is totally unacceptable as far as we in Laois and part of County Offaly are concerned.  Small towns and rural villages are being denuded of their Garda support because of the strain and demand which Portlaoise prison makes in relation to them.  Garda overtime certainly is a problem in the Laois-Offaly area and I ask the Minister to consider the position in County Laois in particular where communities are totally dissatisfied at the fact that they are being denied the Garda support they require.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to hear the Minister say that his intention is to proceed as rapidly as possible with Garda recruitment.  I am disappointed that he was unable to give <Col N="1447" /> any definite assurance that the system of Garda training in the Templemore Training Depot is to be extended and improved.  Anybody would agree at present that with the increasing level of crime and the increasing demand on our Garda Síochána there is an urgent need to update continuously the standard of training for Garda recruits, and to extend the period of training within the depot. Apart from all that, there should be an in-course training for gardaí 12 months after they leave the depot for the purpose of keeping them up to date with the most modern developments in police forces throughout the world.</P>
    <P>The people are saying to this House at present that they want a return to law and order.  I appreciate that the Minister and his Minister of State are as concerned about law and order as anybody on this side of the House is, but they have not created the structures under which the Garda can operate efficiently and they have not provided the level of technical support which the Garda need to enable them to deal with crime in society.  A further disappointment to me in relation to the Bill before us is the fact that the Government are proposing to do away with malicious injuries compensation.

      <P>It is in the context of the Estimate of the Department of Justice. Anyway, Sir, I will accept your ruling on that.  My final comment is in relation to the situation in our prisons and the strain under which prison officers operate.  My colleague, Deputy Michael Woods, referred to the recent tragic incident in Portlaoise where a young police officer because of the increasing strain of overtime suffered a serious coronary attack and went to his eternal reward.  That incident <Col N="1448" /> has created a great deal of unease within the prison staff in Portlaoise where compulsory overtime applies.  It should be within the Minister's jurisdiction to bring about the recruitment of additional prison officers for the purpose not only of providing the support staff needed in prisons but also to relieve the demand on overtime on existing prison officers.  The Minister is losing out on an ideal opportunity to create additional employment within the confines of his Department. Therefore, I urge him to think seriously about the situation in our prisons and in particular to do something positive about the Whitaker report which has been on his desk for a number of months.  This is a very worthwhile, far reaching report which would help to re-organise prison staffing which would result in an improved prison service.  Therefore, I ask the Minister and the Government to take the Whitaker report seriously into consideration and to act as soon as possible on some of the major aspects of that report.</P>

      <P>The area of the Justice Estimate that I want to refer to is Border surveillance and the spending of public money on that but before I turn to that I want to express my pleasure at the decrease in crime figures in the past year or two.  As a man of rather hardline views in the area of law and order I did not believe that I would ever see in my time here in the Dáil the escalating crime rate reversed to a downward tendency.  However, there is a decrease in it.  Everybody will appreciate that, and the Garda can take a great deal of the credit for it.  The real reason for this decrease is that there has been an increase of over 700 prisoners in our jails.  That indicates that the judges have got the message that the sentences they had been meting out prior to 1982 were totally inappropriate and did not fit the crime.  In particular the judges have begun to deal with crimes of violence more severely, and the 1,900 people in jail at present contrast starkly with the figure of 1,200 in prison in 1982.  The real reason for the drop in crime is that over 700 offenders, probably hardline and <Col N="1449" /> continual, have been put behind bars.  In my region the fact that many consistent offenders have been put away has brought a corresponding decrease in the number of crimes committed there.</P>
      <P>I should like also to express my appreciation of the efforts of the Garda Síochána in combating crime.  Very often they are the butt of criticism, sometimes unjustified, but we must remember that we have 11,400 gardaí and the highest percentage of police in Europe per head of population.  Members of the force have pointed out to me that they also perform more duties than do other police forces. That area should be examined and explored by the Department.  Policemen should not be signing passports, issuing and checking on dog licences, or doing other jobs of that nature which civilian employees could more gainfully do, thereby releasing policemen and women for the job for which they were originally intended, fighting crime.  It is a waste of manpower to have Garda personnel bogged down in offices, as Deputy Woods said, typing with two fingers.  All gardaí should be released for duty on the streets in our towns and cities.</P>
      <P>It is a pity that the garda get so uptight on the question of overtime.  It should be part of their job to do night work without overtime as was the case for many years since the formation of the State.  When the Garda became unionised, the crime rate escalated.</P>
      <P>How many gardaí are on neighbourhood watch committees in their off duty time?  There is no doubt that the neighbourhood watch scheme has been successful and I should like to see gardaí getting involved in the scheme in their own neighbourhood and giving the benefit of their expertise in the field of crime which would be a significant advantage to the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How much is paid by the banks to the Garda for transferring money on their behalf?  I understand that the services of the Garda are free but, in view of the millions which the banks are making year after year, they should pay for this service. The Garda are not there for the benefit of the banks or shareholders but <Col N="1450" /> to ensure that crime does not pay.  The banks do not provide services free of charge.</P>
    <P>A second legal centre has been opened in Cork, Tralee and Athlone.  The Border region get nothing and I wonder if some Ministers even know where we are located.  All the emphasis is on Dublin and Cork, because of the size of the political lobby in these areas, whereas the Border region continues to suffer in every section of public life.  Could the fact that Government Ministers live in Tralee and Athlone have something to do with the location of the centres?  Dundalk, a town of 30,000 people, badly needs a legal centre but the fact that we do not have a voice in the Cabinet militates against us and, once again, we have been passed over.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the spending of money in the Border region by the Garda Síochána. As a member of the Committee of Public Accounts it makes me weep to see the waste of money in that area.  The Government must be indicated for criminal waste of money in that area.  I must be mindful of the fact that those who live in Dundalk and north County Louth are in an extremely vulnerable position because in 1972 there was a tragic occurrence when a bomb exploded in the centre of Dundalk killing two people and injuring many more.  It left us very fearful of a repeat performance.  In the wake of the hysteria engendered by the Anglo-Irish agreement among Unionists and amid repeated calls by the Iunatic fringe of the Unionist party, particularly Mr. Seawright and Mr. Graham of Kilkeel, for bombing reprisals to be carried out in the Border region &mdash; naming Dundalk, Clones and Monaghan &mdash; there has been a great deal of concern.  I am aware of the need for continued surveillance and very appreciative, as are the people of Dundalk, of the efforts of the Garda Síochána and the Defence Forces over the last 20 years.  They have given a great service in regard to surveillance and the fact that only one bomb exploded underlines the value of their efforts.</P>
    <P>I want surveillance to continue but I protest at the charade enacted in the <Col N="1451" /> Border area by the creation of road blocks. These are set up all along the Border area, indeed even in your own area of Cavan, a Cheann Comhairle.  In Dundalk it is very irritating to see a permanent road block set up on the Newry road totally inhibiting trade especially at Christmas when Dundalk was virtually closed to the hinterland around it.  This road block was there until a fortnight ago and it is most ineffective.  Over the last 18 years there has not been a single seizure of arms or apprehension of any wanted criminal.  However, since last November, there has been a constant presence of policemen playing games there as a sop to the British Government in trying to create an impression of eternal vigilance&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>They are paid huge sums for overtime.  Recently an American journalist and I went out of Dundalk, skirted the Border and the road block and went into south Armagh without any detection, good, bad or indifferent.  Not alone were we not detected by Irish personnel but we were not detected by British personnel.  We stayed some time in Armagh and then retraced our steps, again without being stopped.  Ordinary people in Dundalk cannot understand why this road block is necessary and why men should be hanging around ineffectively deployed.  We need mobile police checks covering every Border road doing lighting spot checks, which would be a big improvement on what we have at present.  The presence of this road block <Col N="1452" /> outside two business premises has hampered business.  One is a licensed premises run by a very reputable firm and the business has been decimated by the continued presence of a road block just outside.  Some compensation should be paid to ensure that this business will not go bankrupt.</P>
      <P>Since last November over £2 million has been wasted in an area that is economically deprived because of the situation in Ulster.  Business in Dundalk has virtually ground to a halt and no help has come from any Government in the past few years.  The money spent could have been used to bolster some of the unfortunate businesses that are hanging on or have folded.</P>
      <P>I hoped the Minister for Justice would be here to hear what I have to say in regard to his surreptitious visit to Dundalk recently, ostensibly to visit the Border region and look around.  He did not tell me he was coming to Dundalk.  I am only a humble backbencher but I am a parliamentary colleague of his who came in here in the same way as he did, representing the people of my county in the same fashion as he does the people of Kildare.  I am an admirer of the Minister's ability but it was a grave lapse of protocol not to have informed me that he was visiting the region.  I was aware of his presence because I got a telephone call from a friend in the Garda barracks.  I said nothing because I hoped he might give some explanation as to why he disregarded me to such an extent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I did not expect to be part of the high powered discussions, but ordinary protocol demands that he should have told me he was coming to the region and that he should meet me for a half an hour or an hour to discuss the position and perhaps listen to a different perspective from what the Garda would have told him.  I can tell the Minister that at the various road-blocks the men were told to smarten up, to stand alertly rather than lounging about and put on a businesslike approach because the Minister for Justice was in town.  The Minister for Justice came to town and failed to recognise his own back bench colleague who could have given <Col N="1453" /> him a different perspective on the Border situation, having lived in Dundalk for 50 years.  I could have brought him around, as I brought the American journalist, and avoided the whole charade because that it what it is, it is a joke.  This neglect of party colleagues, particularly backbenchers, causes Deputies like myself, and perhaps Deputy Skelly who is more famous than I am, to point the finger sometimes at our own Government.  I can contribute as much information on the local scene as any desk bound Garda officer, no matter how senior, who might have entered the force in 1950 but does not live in the Border region.  Are the local gardaí consulted? If decisions are made, where are they made and by whom?</P>
    <P>I deplore the criminal waste of money in the Border region.  We want surveillance and we are appreciative of the job done by the Garda and the Army.  But as a member of the Committee of Public Accounts I have to point the finger at the criminal waste of public money in that region.</P>
    <P>I conclude by asking why were the Irish Army withdrawn from Border surveillance? Was it because money was made available in September of last year for the Border region and the Garda are paid overtime whereas the Army are not. Until last November the Army, who have a substantial barracks in Dundalk, were used in that area.  I want them reintroduced. I realise that the Garda&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. Wallace Mr. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to speak here today.  Like Deputy McGahon I came up especially to make my contribution because of the very serious situation that exists, particularly in Cork.  Deputy McGahon mentioned that we have the highest number of gardaí ever, 11,400.  I fully agree with him.  But I would like to know where half of them are because they are certainly not on the streets of Cork and it is the same throughout the country.</P>
      <P>It is a sad reflection on our system of justice that many people are of the view that crime does pay.  It is an indictment of this Government's failure to tackle the problem of rising levels of crime.  This increase in the levels of crime and vandalism cannot be allowed to continue.  But that is what will happen unless strong action is taken by the Government.  The resources must be made available to the Garda, including modern equipment, transport and communications systems, if they are to do their job effectively.  This was discussed in a motion in the House recently.  I believe the Garda do not have the resources and the back-up facilities they need.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is almost a complete absence of gardaí in Cork.  Parts of Cork with 20,000 to 30,000 people are patrolled by two gardaí at night.  What is being done about this?  It is easy to come in here and carry out a public relations exercise but I am genuinely concerned that the resources of the force are not being utilised in the best way possible on behalf of the people. That is the Minister's responsibility and I want to know where we go from here. Recently two new Garda stations were opened in Cork and these are welcome. But they are under-manned and under-utilised. We have to come to grips with this situation.  I am criticising top management in the Garda regarding the utilisation of the force.  The deployment of the force in various areas of Cork gives me cause for concern also.  The station in Gurranabraher is responsible for patrolling Ballincollig, seven or eight miles <Col N="1455" /> away, because stations are closing at night.  Mallow Road station and Water-course Road station have to cover additional new developing areas with banks and commercial developments with fewer personnel.  This is a cause of serious concern in Cork and the people there are losing their patience.  They are not getting the protection to which they are entitled. It is the reponsibility of the Minister and he is failing in his duty.</P>
    <P>We have been told that there are no cutbacks in Garda overtime, but there are major cuts in policing levels in Cork city.  Would the Minister outline exactly where the money is going?  We have been told that the total figure is £12 million and that £9 million is being spent on Border security, leaving the rest of the country neglected.  I am very conscious of the importance of the Border to the citizens, North and South, but surely we must not ignore the other areas.</P>
    <P>Great strains are being put on Cork gardaí and they cannot adequately protect the elderly, the defenceless, in our society.  The initiative must be taken away from the thieves, the vandals, the so-called joyriders, the drug pushers and organised criminals.  Unless we are prepared to provide adequate Garda manning levels at all times, we are not serious about dealing with the menace of crime. Prevention is more important now than ever before.</P>
    <P>We have heard much talk about the neighbourhood watch system and how successful it is proving.  I have yet to see this.  We have endeavoured to implement this system in Cork, but because of the lack of back-up by the Garda I would be genuinely concerned about starting such a system in a number of areas in Cork. The gardaí cannot do the job on their own, they must have co-operation from the community.  I ask the Minister to give immediate attention to the needs of the Garda stations in Cork, whose officers are endeavouring to cope under very difficult circumstances.</P>
    <P>More gardaí are needed on the beat. Their physical presence on the streets is the best single deterrent against crime. <Col N="1456" /> There is almost an absolute absence of foot patrols in vital areas in Cork where the crime rate is high and there are many social problems, with high unemployment and large families in which no member is working.  We have no proper policing and no proper opportunity of integrating the efforts of the people with those of the Garda Síochána.  A greater involvement of members of the Garda force in the community is very necessary, but because of non-availability of resources this is not occurring.  Gardaí should be encouraged to develop a liaison with schools, voluntary organisations and community associations.  I do not want to sound totally pessimistic, but we must ensure that every assistance possible is given in this direction.</P>
    <P>I have in the past criticised some of the duties put on members of the Garda force.  In this day and age, why should they be putting parking tickets on cars or carrying out duties for the Department of Social Welfare, or amassing statistics on behalf of the Department of Agriculture, or being involved with census forms?  With the demands on the force because of the high crime rate, is it not time that serious consideration was given to removing many of those duties which could be done by civilians, particularly having regard to the present high unemployment rate?  I again call on the Minister to give serious consideration to this in the interests of the community and of the Garda Síochána.  Let the gardaí get on with the job for which they are highly paid and highly trained, of protecting the people.  Prevention of crime is much cheaper in the long run than apprehension and going through the whole court procedure.  Greater attention must be given to prevention of crime because of the present strains on manpower and resources.  We will not have an immediate solution.  I realise that.  But there has been a greater concentration on the checking of the spread of crime than on the treatment of the causes.  No one can dispute the fact that unemployment is a major contributory factor to crime.  Since the Government came into office 60,000 people have been added to the numbers <Col N="1457" /> unemployed.  Every working day of every working week since the Coalition took up office 70 people have become unemployed. No attention has been paid to the terrible social consequences of this.</P>
    <P>It was disturbing to learn from last night's TV programme, &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo;, of the low detection rate for offences.  The programme outlined clearly how unsatisfactory the detection rate is.  I am sure the Minister must be concerned. The cause must be established. Very clearly, gardaí are doing duties other than those for which they were trained and for which they have been appointed.  If we do not tackle that problem immediately there is no hope for us in the future.  It is the responsibility of the Minister to find out why detection rates as low as 10 per cent and 17 per cent can be given.  Many people have now given up reporting offences to the gardaí, particularly housebreaking and robbery, because they do not consider that the cases will be followed through.  People that I have met have had their homes broken into from four to six times and some have left different parts of the city because of this in the hope of getting some extra protection in other areas.  The low detection rate is very serious.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the courts in Cork, saying that the delays there were longer than anywhere else and I agree. We have been agitating for some considerable time for the causes to be tackled. There are major difficulties, particularly for witnesses in criminal cases who have to wait for years to be called and there is a continuing trauma for the families in these cases.  There is no doubt that the courts are the Cinderella of the criminal justice system.  Expenditure in this area has grown more slowly than in other areas and without an efficient courts system the whole criminal justice procedure will grind to a halt. There is urgent need for a radical overhaul and streamlining of the courts.  I hope the Minister will give this matter urgent priority.  The Minister mentioned additional sittings in Cork and that the delay in getting a hearing there had been reduced from 30 months to 26 months <Col N="1458" /> and by the end of the year would, it was hoped, be down to 24 months.  While we welcome any reduction, this delay is still very unsatisfactory.  The time taken to deal with cases in Cork is double that of any other part of the country.  There must be good reasons for this.  I ask that something positive be done.  The need for a permanent High Court in Cork is very clearly spelt out by the Minister's own admission of the delays experienced.</P>
    <P>There has recently been considerable criticism of the inability or unwillingness of our courts to develop to meet modern circumstances.  If we are considering reform, it is important to examine the existing courts system.  We need to know what is required of the system, if these requirements are being met and, if not, to establish the reasons for that failure. The public want justice to be administered in an even-handed and reasonably uniform manner, without bias in favour of any parties or individuals before the court and want the Judiciary to be able to carry out these functions independently.</P>
    <P>Most important, from the citizen's point of view, is the speed of justice. Justice must be administered without delay in both criminal and civil cases. The old adage, &ldquo;Justice delayed is justice denied&rdquo; is as true today as when it was coined.  From time to time concern has been expressed about the wide variations of sentences which are imposed for similar crimes.  I accept that the circumstances of each case may be different and the character of each accused may be different and may require individual consideration. Nevertheless, particularly in the case of drugs and drug-related offences and attacks on the elderly, there is a clear need for an updating policy on sentencing.</P>
    <P>I am sure I do not have to spell out to the Minister the widespread public concern that has been expressed over the past couple of years regarding some of the sentencing.  Like us all, the Judiciary are human beings.  The public generally are at a loss to know how certain sentences can differ from others.  If the public were administering the law they would be very clear as to how they would do it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1459" /> It is easy to say that when looking at it from outside because one would not have all the facts.  Even though the Judiciary cannot be interfered with, the Minister has an obligation and a duty to ensure that every possible resource is made available to them.  Some form of commission must be set up to assist or advise them regarding sentencing.</P>
    <P>We have all come across cases where people have been very irritated and vexed when serious criminals who have committed major crimes get off scot-free with suspended sentences.  We often hear of cases where the excessive use of alcohol is used as an excuse for doing something wrong.  Immediate attention should be given to this area.  The public feel that the whole legal system is wrong and that there is no justice any more.  We have too much law and not enough justice.  We will all be the sufferers in the end if this whole area is not tackled quickly.</P>
    <P>As has been mentioned by some of the previous speakers, it is almost a year since the Whitaker report on the penal justice system was published.  There is still no indication that the Minister is prepared to take any action to implement any of the recommendations of the expert commission.  According to the Minister the recommendations are still under consideration in the Department.  I wonder what priority they are receiving in the Department.</P>

With respect, I have treated the Minister with kindness so he should keep his comments to himself.  If we do not grapple with the problems in the prisons very quickly, we will have major problems.  It is not good enough to knock everybody else.  When the Garda Representative Body make a comment and the Commissioner is upset, or when the Prison Officers' Association speak out and it hurts somebody, they should not be cut off because it affects some antiquated official in the Department of Justice who is out of touch with reality.  They should discuss these matters.  Major problems in our prisons are being covered up.  You, Minister, are the man with the responsibility to face up to that.

He has been a failure as Minister for Justice.  He is not tackling the problems and that is the way the public see it.

      <P>There have been a couple of major cases in recent years the handling and the result of which have undermined the judicial process.  They have definitely weakened the public's belief in <Col N="1462" /> the system of justice in Ireland.  There was widespread dissatisfaction as a result of the <i>nolle prosequi</i> that was entered into in the McArthur case in relation to the murder of Donal Dunne.  The so-called Fairview Park manslaughter was debated in this House on 10 March 1983. There were up to 15 contributions and it was regarded as one of the best debates held here by the then Fianna Fáil Chief Whip and now spokesman on Labour, Deputy Ahern.  Deputy Haughey, the Leader of the Opposition, participated as did the Minister for Justice and two junior Government Ministers.  The Fairview Park case caused disquiet and hence it was raised.</P>

      <P>On 10 March 1983 a debate was conducted which dealt entirely with a specific case.  I have the extracts from 12 different speakers which I can read&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>There were 12 different statements and I can read some of them. One was by Deputy Dr. Woods.  He said that the tragic case in Fairview demanded urgent action from the Minister for Justice and the Government.  He said that the questions which were raised in the Fairview case must be answered and that there was an onus on the Minister to deal with the questions which remained to be answered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Both the people and the courts must be aware of the disquiet and controversy caused by these cases.  The public awareness was heightened by the Kerry Babies Tribunal last year. Common sense should have warned the authorities that this other case was going to be a controversial one pertaining as it does to the elements of wealth, society, sex, drink and the Catholic Church.  The people wanted to see justice done.</P>

If he proceeds, I will have to rule him out of order and take the necessary action under Standing Orders.  I do not want to do that.  I have explained to the Deputy that if he wants to deal with the case he is leading up to, he can put down a specific and substantive motion and have it debated in the House.

If we were ever to reach the stage when decisions of the courts would be subject to appeal in <Col N="1465" /> this Chamber, it would be very bad.  I cannot allow it, Deputy, and I will not.</P>

      <P>It is about justice.  Some people no longer believe that justice can be done in this State.  Instead, we have the family calling it a shambles and a travesty of justice.  The public believe that this case smells.  As a Deputy, I see it as my responsibility to raise the matter. I am not trying to stir the pot.  The conduct of the trial &mdash; I am not going to go into it &mdash; did nothing to dispel the growing belief among the large majority of the people that justice was not done.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a reflection on the judge who tried the case.  The Deputy will resume his seat.  The judge's salary is not a charge on the Vote for the Department of Justice.  It is a charge on the Central Fund.  That is for a specific reason.  Judges' actions and conduct cannot be discussed in this House unless on a substantive motion put down in a formal way.</P>

      <P>Since this House last approved annual Estimates for my Department, there have been significant developments on many fronts in the communications areas.  Most of these have been extensively and constructively debated by the House.  I do not feel it is desirable or necessary to cover such ground in detail again.  However, given the importance of the communications sectors and the State bodies within these for the general competitiveness and employment prospects of the economy, it is important that Members of the House be given an opportunity to debate and contribute to general policy formulation in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During my three and a half years in office, I have striven with, I think, a fair degree of success to provide a regulatory framework for the communications sectors which will ensure that not only will they be the most efficient in the domestic economy, but their performance will also compare favourably with corresponding sectors in our main trading partners.  I am also determined that the State bodies for which I have direct responsibility will be efficient and profitable.  These are the general parameters within which my <Col N="1475" /> Department have been operating over the past few years and will continue to do so over the coming one.</P>
    <P>Expenditure on transport accounts for about 15 per cent of GNP.  Demand in this sector is basically a derived demand, depending on developments in other sectors. In this regard, the outlook for it is the most encouraging for many years. Thanks mainly to the stimulus given to the industrialised world by the fall in oil prices, economic growth in the OECD area will be considerably higher both in 1986 and 1987 than any of us, or indeed most reputable international economists, had forecast at the beginning of this year. More importantly, the composition of this growth is radically different from what has been experienced in recent years.  Domestic demand and in particular personal consumer expenditure will be the main driving force in economic growth in our main trading partners.  This development presents us as a trading nation with a unique opportunity to achieve the substantial increases in output on which employment prospects for our growing labour force will depend.  We can achieve this provided our competitiveness is at least maintained, if not improved, and we have sufficient flexibility in all markets to take advantage of increased foreign demand and other changes in our main markets.  In this regard, it is imperative that we recognise that it is movements in relative competitiveness which primarily determine market shares.  We must remember that our competitors have also had the benefit of the fall in oil prices and their input costs have also been reduced as a result. This is being reflected in lower output costs for the goods and services they produce and with which we must compete. Unless we can match them in this regard, we will inevitably suffer loss of market share with consequential adverse effects for employment.</P>
    <P>One very important determinant of the competitiveness of our trading sector is the cost of finance.  The CII in their recent newsletter emphasised the need for a substantial reduction in domestic interest <Col N="1476" /> rates.  I strongly share their views on this topic.  Interest rates in early 1986 were at an exceptionally high level here due in large part to uncertainty about exchange rate movements and in particular fears about the constituents of the impending EMS realignment which led to a large increase in speculative flows.  The Government took a very positive and unambiguous stance in the realignment, conscious of the fact that a certain readjustment process would be necessary for certain industries.  We have helped and will continue to help them achieve this.  Now that our intention to pursue a strong exchange rate policy is clear to the financial markets, we expect that this be reflected in a substantial reduction in interest rates as soon as possible.  Apart from interest rates there are other favourable effects from a stable exchange rate policy.  Inflation should be much lower, which is good news for those on fixed incomes.  The escalation in debt service costs due to exchange rate movements which have been a major factor in the imbalances in the public finances will be halted and reversed.  However, by far the most important benefit is the establishment of an environment of certainty and confidence in which our trading sectors can plan and flourish.</P>
    <P>However, a strong exchange rate policy also necessitates discipline in other areas of economic policy, a fact which I regret to say is not adequately appreciated and acted upon by the social partners. As a nation, we must accept that fiscal, monetary and incomes policies must be compatible with the exchange rate policy we pursue.  Another small country in the Community, Denmark, has shown us the substantial and beneficial effects &mdash; particularly for employment &mdash; which can be gained from a strong exchange rate policy supplemented by appropriate action in other areas.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the most important area where an adjustment is needed is incomes.  I have already referred to the benefits of lower inflation.  The minimum we can expect is a corresponding reduction in income demands to reflect this.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1477" /> Unless we do so, not only will we destroy existing jobs but we will also make it difficult, if not impossible, for new entrants to the labour market to obtain gainful employment.  Some of our trading sectors have other adjustment problems caused by structural problems, shifts in demand patterns, product obsolescence etc., which may require State help to overcome.  However, any progress they make in this regard will be to no avail if their competitive position is undermined by excessive income increases.</P>
    <P>While I do not have overall responsibility for fiscal policy, I can assure the House that any expenditure for which my Department are responsible will be economically justifiable and desirable.  I can also assure the House that the regulatory framework for the sectors for which I have specific responsibility will be fully compatible with the overall national effort to improve or at least maintain our competitive position.</P>
    <P>My commitment in regard to CIE has been clearly demonstrated by the provisions of the Transport (Re-organisation of Córas Iompair Éireann) Bill, 1986, which was introduced into Seanad Éireann and passed all stages there on 17 June.  The provisions of this Bill will introduce a greater transparency into all the operations of CIE and will help them to provide the range and quality of services which we have requested of them at the minimum possible cost.  Equally important, from my viewpoint, it will enable the workforce in CIE to identify much more readily with the service they are providing and the performance of the company providing it.  The workforce in CIE has been much maligned over the past few years. In a small few cases this has been justified but the general body of workers in CIE have provided this country with a service of which they and I am proud.  I wish to place on record my acknowledgment of this fact.</P>
    <P>Because of this and my personal commitment to maintaining and raising morale in the company I accepted and included in the Bill a number of amendments to reassure all that the Bill was not about closing down CIE nor designed to <Col N="1478" /> achieve stunning numbers of redundancies. The Bill contains detailed provisions for the maintenance and protection of conditions of employment of workers transferred to the subsidiary companies. It also provides that, in the unlikely event of any of the companies being wound up, the functions of the companies shall be taken over by the board and the board shall accept into their employment without interruption of service all officers and servants transferred to the company on vesting day.</P>
    <P>Against that background, I was rather taken aback by the scare-mongering tactics of the President of the National Association of Transport Employees, who is reported to have stated that almost 7,000 jobs could go and that the national railway system could be lost unless the Government changed their policy on the proposed re-organisation of CIE.  Irresponsible comments of this nature make me wonder who is trying to put CIE at risk with attacks on the future of the organisation and their equipment.  The individual CIE workers cannot be very happy, and what must the passengers think on whose support the CIE services are dependent?</P>
    <P>I would like to assure both in a number of ways.  While the improvement in the CIE finances over the past few years was a laudable achievement, it was nevertheless essential that the escalating losses of the seventies and early eighties be halted. There is no doubt that the Exchequer could not have afforded to support CIE if the losses had continued to increase at the same rate.  The proposed re-organisation together with the package of financial measures introduced in 1983 were designed, not, as may have been suggested, to give rise to large scale redundancies in CIE, but on the contrary to ensure the future of CIE and their services. Make no mistake about it, if these steps had not been taken, the future for the CIE workforce would have been a bleak one.  We just could not have afforded to continue to suport CIE losses if they had continued to escalate out of control.  The new structures for CIE are designed to give everyone in CIE an opportunity to <Col N="1479" /> put new life into the organisation and to ensure its long term future.</P>
    <P>The realities of life as regards equipment are that since 1983 a building programme of new mainline coaches has been in progress at Inchicore with many of these coaches now in service, the DART system, at a capital cost of £113 million was introduced in 1984, the whole rural bus fleets have been improved and earlier this year CIE acquired a new touring and supabus fleet.  There is nothing unusual about railway locomotives running for a ten year period as locomotives have a very long lifespan.  By the end of 1987 CIE will have spent about £29 million on the present signalling and communications programme.  All of these are the lifelines of CIE activity and they give the lie to derogatory remarks or the raising of doubts about the quality of CIE transport equipment and safety issues.</P>
    <P>Apart from the approval of transport hardware for CIE, it is relevant to the future of CIE that the Government introduced a special subvention formula which also provides for payment of the Exchequer support above the line, involving a sum of well in excess of £300 million over the period 1984-86.  In addition, commencing in 1985 CIE are being paid £3 million annually for each of ten years in order to reduce the board's borrowings. Indeed, we also took on the interest charges on the DART.  All of these measures were taken in the best interest of CIE and their workforce.  They have been successful and the re-organisation of CIE is aimed at breathing further new life into the organisation.  I am convinced that the changes are necessary and that the CIE employees will co-operate to show their worth.  I cannot but conclude that the motives of critics of necessary change are difficult to understand.</P>
    <P>The Estimates before the House provide a total of £300,000 to meet the running costs of the Dublin Transport Authority in 1986.  The Bill to establish the Authority has recently been enacted. I am now preparing to establish the Authority so that it can get down to its main task without delay, that is, to ensure that <Col N="1480" /> existing transport resources in the Dublin area are organised and utilised in a way which will enable people and commercial traffic to move freely, quickly and as cheaply as possible.</P>
    <P>One of the immediate tasks of the Authority will be to take over responsibility for the traffic management strategy which the non-statutory Dublin Transportation Task Force has been pursuing for a number of years.  Subhead R of the Vote provides £395,000 for the necessary works in 1986, of which approximately £50,000 will be spent on bringing the remaining 60 or so traffic signals in Dublin Corporation's Urban Traffic Control area under computer control.</P>
    <P>The Task Force is probably best known for its work on the introduction of bus lanes, of which there are now more than 14 kilometres in Dublin.  While the scope for further bus lanes is constantly under review, the focus in devising new bus priority measures has switched to the selective bus detection system, which uses an infra-red link between buses and roadsides units to give priority at signalised suburban junctions to buses which are behind schedule.  The pilot scheme which has been installed at a number of junctions in the southern suburbs at a cost of almost £400,000 will be operational shortly.  This will be monitored and the benefits assessed before any decision is taken regarding a wider deployment of the system.</P>
    <P>The Road Transport Act, 1986, has recently been enacted.  This again is another initiative which my Department have taken to enable a more cost effective service to be provided for our trading sectors.  In this regard, it has been welcomed by a wide cross section of our community.  I will carefully monitor the effects of this Act to ensure that the competitive benefits which I intend will flow from it will actually materialise.</P>
    <P>There has been some criticism concerning the enforcement of legislation relating to road transport.  It has been alleged that in the past the <i>ad hoc</i> application of the regulations has caused great difficulties for the provides and <Col N="1481" /> users of road freight transport services.  I can assure the House that the enforcement of all aspects of road transport legislation, including the limits on weights and social regulations which must be implemented universally and be subject to common criteria throughout the country, will, in future, be enforced rigorously.</P>
    <P>A central theme of my speech to the House has been the need for a competitive transport sector relative to that in our main trading partners.  However, competitiveness is not much use if our operators are denied access to markets in which they can gain and hold a share.</P>
    <P>The major portion of international road freight haulage is undertaken on the basis of bilateral agreements.  Such agreements are already in operation between Ireland and 12 other countries, namely, France, Belgium, the Federal Republic of Germany, the United Kingdom, Denmark, Italy, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Greece, the Netherlands and Luxembourg.  Agreements with Spain, Portugal and Czechoslovakia are at an advanced stage of negotiations and negotiations are also proceeding with Yugoslavia.</P>
    <P>These agreements benefit Irish hauliers in two ways.  First, Irish hauliers wishing to operate to from, or in transit across these countries may obtain the permits, where required, from my Department rather than from the transport authorities of these countries.  Secondly, the agreements provide exemption for Irish hauliers from certain taxes which would otherwise be payable by them while their vehicles are in the country concerned.</P>
    <P>In addition to bilateral permits, Ireland has quotas of multilateral authorisations under the EEC Community Quota Scheme and a scheme operated under the auspices of the European Conference of Ministers of Transport.</P>
    <P>In the context of the European Communities, I would like to mention a significant decision of the Council of Transport Ministers in November, 1985, when there was agreement in principle on the creation of a transport market free from quantitative restrictions by 1992 at the latest.  It is hoped that this will lead <Col N="1482" /> to substantial increases in the EC Community quota of multilateral authorisations for road haulage over the years between now and 1992.</P>
    <P>I have succeeded in getting a 40 per cent increase in our allocation of authorisations for 1986, from 147 to 204, but I can assure the House that I have been pressing and will continue to press for much higher increases than this.  I have no doubt about the capacity of the Irish haulage industry to take on and beat the best operators already in the Community market.</P>
    <P>For an island nation it is essential that we provide regular, efficient and competitive access transport.  Shipping is paramount in this regard.  It is generally accepted that the quantity, quality and cost of shipping services for trade are relatively good by international standards.</P>
    <P>Policy in relation to passenger services has been the subject of much debate in this House recently in the context of the British &amp; Irish Steam Packet Company Limited (Acquisition) (Amendment) Bill, 1986.  The House was furnished with full details concerning the Government's £38 million rescue package for B &amp; I and various questions raised by Deputies were dealt with.  I do not consider it necessary to dwell any more on B &amp; I at this stage except to acknowledge the resolute manner in which the board and management of B &amp; I have acted.  In this context also the company's workforce must be commended for their acceptance of the proposals which include the type of flexibility in work practices which I would like to see implemented in other sectors.  What is needed now and in the years to come is a sustained commitment from the workforce and management alike to work together towards the common goal of creating a vibrant, efficient and commercially viable enterprise.</P>
    <P>There has been some criticism recently concerning the regulatory framework for passenger services between Ireland and the UK.  In this regard, I would like to point out that my Department have a <Col N="1483" /> dual objective in so far as transport services are concerned.  First, they have a responsibility for the commercial and financial viability of State bodies under their control.  Secondly, and as I have repeated several times throughout this debate, we have a duty to provide the necessary regulatory framework for the most efficient operation of the sectors of the economy for which we have responsibility.</P>
    <P>To take the first objective, I feel it must be acknowledged that the achievement in turning B &amp; I around to a point where they will be making profits shortly is a substantial one by any standard.  That is not to say that I have ignored or will ignore the second responsibility which I also have. However, in this regard I feel that we must look at the transport sector as a whole and recognise that there is now a considerable amount of competition within the sector, particularly between sea and air transport.  Because of the initiatives I have taken on air travel over the past few years, air fares are now much lower than they otherwise would have been.  This in turn has put pressure on the shipping companies to reduce the cost of their services.  I would also like to point out that while there may be a fare cartel arrangement on cross-Channel services I have insisted, and will continue to insist, that B &amp; I achieve the maximum possible efficiency in their operations.  I stress the word efficiency because while this is a similar, it is also a much broader, concept than pure price competitiveness.</P>
    <P>We must also take into account the quality of the services and remember that customers are prepared to pay a premium for a comfortable and friendly service. However, I am also conscious of the need for price competitiveness.  In this regard, I can assure the House that the B &amp; I objective is to provide similar services to those operated internationally at a corresponding, if not improved, relative price.  My objective in this regard is also shared by the Chairman and Managing Director of the B &amp; I.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1484" /> In the Green Paper on Transport Policy I referred to the question of providing a strategic shipping fleet for Ireland. The report of the committee which I set up to examine this matter is being examined by the Government and their decisions will be announced in the White Paper on Transport Policy which I hope will be published by the end of the year.</P>
    <P>My main policy in relation to ports is to provide an efficient and cost-effective service to international trade so as to maximise the potential for growth in our economy.  I am also conscious of the role which port investment can play in regional development.  In this regard, the House will note that provision has been made in my Department's Vote for grant assistance of £2.8 million to Cork Harbour Commissioners in respect of the construction of the deepwater wharf at Ringaskiddy in Cork harbour.  Work on this project commenced in 1984 and is due for completion this year.  The completion of the wharf is the final stage in the Cork harbour development scheme.</P>
    <P>The Free Ports Act, 1986, was enacted in March of this year.  While it is an enabling measure permitting the establishment of free ports in any area of the State, the immediate purpose of the legislation is to facilitate the establishment of a free port at Ringaskiddy.  My Department are consulting with other Departments and with Cork Harbour Commissioners on a number of operational aspects to be finally decided, including the precise area to be designated as the free port, the designation of the management company, details of the licensing regime that will apply to users of the free port when established and the customs and VAT regimes that will apply.  These consultations will be concluded as speedily as possible.  I believe that both the harbour development scheme and the establishment of a free port at Ringaskiddy have the potential to make a very valuable contribution to the industrial development of the southern region and Cork in particular.</P>
    <P>Other expenditure on harbours includes a grant from the Department's Vote of £3 million to the Dublin Port and <Col N="1485" /> Docks Board towards the resolution of the board's financial problems.  This forms part of the financial package for the board agreed by the Government last year.  I am glad to say that the major elements of the package are now in place and that user confidence in the port has been revived.  A sustained effort will be required, however, if the port is to maintain recent progress in its return to viability. Provision has been made in the Vote for grant assistance of £359,000 this year towards the cost of providing passenger handling facilities at Rosslare.</P>
    <P>The balance of the amount provided in the Vote for grant assistance is mainly in respect of projects at the harbours of Sligo, Tralee and Fenit.  Projects at other ports are also being considered for grant purposes, as well as assistance to the Royal National Lifeboats of Ireland for the improvement of lifeboat facilities around the country.  The foregoing projects do not include those being financed from the Local Loans Fund, or projects funded by harbour authorities from commercial borrowings or own resources.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that the Harbours Bill, 1986, was circulated recently and currently has passed the Committee Stage in its debate in the Seanad.  This Bill will provide for the setting up of a unified harbour authority, to be known as the Shannon Ports Authority, which will take over and manage the existing harbours and publicity owned piers in the Shannon Estuary, excluding for the moment Foynes Harbour.  The Bill also proposes to provide powers to enable the Minister for Communications to dissolve, reconstitute or amalgamate any of the harbour authorities specified in the First Schedule to the Harbours Act, 1946, to give effect to Government policy as enunciated in the Green Paper on Transport published in November 1985.  I look forward to the debate on the Bill when it comes before this House.</P>
    <P>A token provision of £1,000 under subhead W.1 is being made to cover payments to the General Lighthouse Fund. Following negotiations between the Irish and British authorities, it has been agreed that in future a greater share of the costs <Col N="1486" /> incurred by the Commissioners of Irish Lights in the State will be met from sources in the State.  Under the agreement, the light dues collected at Irish ports will be supplemented as necessary by an Exchequer contribution so that total revenue from sources in the State will account for 50 per cent of CIL's expenditure in the State.  The arrangement will be phased in over a five-year period commencing at a level of 30 per cent in 1987 and increasing to reach the 50 per cent level by 1991.  It is estimated that the cost to the Exchequers in 1987 will be of the order of £1.4 million.  The pressure in this matter from the UK Government has irritated me not a little and they are aware of this fact.  Arrangements, satisfactory to me, on the future administration of CIL have now to be finalised, but I do not visualise dramatic change.</P>
    <P>My commitment to a regular, efficient and cost effective air transport sector is a matter of established fact and considerable achievement.  I have consistently kept air fare increases below the rate of inflation and will continue to do so.  My recent approval of an application by Ryanair to introduce a scheduled service on Dublin-Luton at unrestricted low fares is an example of my continuing efforts to maintain fares at the lowest possible levels, consistent with continuity of service, and to generally bring a greater degree of liberalisation to air travel.</P>
    <P>I have also authorised or agreed in principle the operation of services by:</P>
    <P>Ryanair:</P>
    <P>Waterford-Luton</P>
    <P>Shannon Executive Aviation:</P>
    <P>Shannon-Manchester</P>
    <P>Shannon-Belfast or Bristol</P>
    <P>Shannon-Dublin</P>
    <P>Dublin-Derry</P>
    <P>Celtic Air:</P>
    <P>Connaught-London (Stansted)</P>
    <P>Connaught-Manchester</P>
    <P>Connaught-Dublin</P>
    <P>Connaught-Shannon</P>
    <P>In addition, on the North Atlantic route I have authorised two additional carriers &mdash; Delta and Pan Am &mdash; to operate into <Col N="1487" /> Ireland.  These, together with Aer Lingus and Northwest Orient who are already on the route, now provide us with the most extensive access air transport from North America in many years.  The consequential benefits to the economy are self-evident.</P>
    <P>At the European level, there has been much comment on the recent decision by the European Court of Justice concerning the applicability of the competitiveness provisions of the Treaty of Rome to air transport.  The Commissioner for Competition, Mr. Sutherland, has signalled his intention to press for the introduction of a far greater element of competition into European air transport. In this he has my full support.  It is something I have campaigned strongly for in the Council of Ministers over the past few years.  Given the relatively small size of our domestic market it is desirable, if not essential, that Irish operators be given access to far wider markets and at a minimum should have free access to Community markets.  In this regard I have the full support of Aer Lingus who have spent considerable effort and resources in developing routes which have been either taken from them or which they have had to share with other carriers who did not incur or share in the initial development costs.</P>
    <P>At a meeting of the Council of Transport Ministers in Luxembourg last week, Commissioners Sutherland and Clinton-Davies did not cover themselves in glory. It seems clear that the EC Commission is now pulling in its horn on liberalisation of air transport and the very late paper which they submitted to the Council during last week's meeting was very disappointing to say the least.  I hope it is not a case of the Commission, like some of our colleague countries, talking liberally and acting conservatively.</P>
    <P>Nineteen eighty six has been a very significant year for our national flag carrier, Aer Lingus.  I am sure Members will all join with me in congratulating the board and workforce in the company on their 50th anniversary.  They have made a significant contribution to the image of this <Col N="1488" /> country abroad and to the development of our economy.</P>
    <P>The early eighties witnessed difficult years for the company during the which they made relatively big losses.  While they have overcome these difficulties to a large extent and profits for year ending March 1986 should top £20 million, the fact has to be recognised that the profitability of the company has not been sufficient for them to renew their basic plant, that is, aircraft.  Given the inadequacy of their reserves for fleet replacement, I feel that we have to look at all the other possible options available to them and to us as owners of the company.  Subsidies and free additional equity by the Government, which in effect is the same thing, have been advocated by some and, inevitably, the question of public equity participation arises.  However, there are also other options including a range of leasing possibilities and allowings the company borrow either on the domestic or international markets to fund at least part of their capital development programme.  Either way, greater profits in an increasingly competitive environment are required.  I can assure the board and the workforce that their profits will continue to be available to the company for reinvestment. The future prosperity and expansion of Aer Lingus require that future financing be carefully considered by all and that no option be prematurely excluded.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier in my speech to demand for transport being a derived demand.  Demand for Aer Rianta's services is also to a large extent derived &mdash; from the traffic and passengers passing through our airports.  As you will gather from the theme of my speech I am determined to increase these as fast and as much as possible.  In this regard I have taken a major initiative this year which I am confident will attract more traffic to our airports.  I refer to the introduction of US immigration and public health preinspection. This scheme is just about to commence on a trial basis at Shannon.  I would like once again to thank Members of both Houses for facilitating the speedy <Col N="1489" /> introduction of this service by passing the necessary legislation so quickly.</P>
    <P>The Government are determined to maintain air transport infrastructural facilities at the highest possible level.  We are also acutely aware of the role of such investment in stimulating building and construction activity.  Expenditure on capital works in this area will more than quadruple this year.</P>
    <P>Some months ago the Government approved the provision of a new 8,650 foot runway, together with associated facilities and buildings at Dublin Airport, at an estimated cost of over £31 million. This will be the biggest project to be undertaken at the State airports for some time.  Traditionally State airport capital works have been funded fully by the Exchequer.  In the case of the runway project, however, there will be a break with tradition in that the project will be funded primarily from non-Exchequer sources.  The bulk of the funds will be provided from Aer Rianta's resources and borrowing by the company.  An allocation of £3,350,000 is included in the Estimates for electronic equipment for civil aviation and the marine coast stations. The main projects to be carried out during 1986 are:</P>
    <P>(i) Installation of two new ILS systems at Dublin Airport.</P>
    <P>(ii) Installation of a new ILS system at Cork Airport.</P>
    <P>(iii) Installation of new reserve VHF communications equipment at Dublin Airport.</P>
    <P>(iv) Installation of new reserve VHF equipment at Shannon Airport.</P>
    <P>(v) Provision of additional radar display unit at Dublin Airport.</P>
    <P>(vi) Installation of new Range Azimuth beacon monitors at Woodcock Hill and Mount Gabriel.</P>
    <P>I would also like to inform the House that I have initiated reviews of all the activities in the Air Navigation Services Office and the Meteorological Service.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1490" /> Outside consultants have recently commenced the ANSO review and are expected to report back shortly.  The Meteorological Service review is being carried out by my Department in association with the DPS.  The report of this review should also be available soon.</P>
    <P>A key element in our regional development programme is the provision of adequate air transportation facilities within the country.  This year I have provided over £1 million in my Estimate for the development of such airports.  The bulk of this is earmarked for the development of Carnmore Airport, County Galway, where there is a local contribution of 25 per cent.</P>
    <P>Connaught Regional Airport was formally opened last month.  I think it is only giving credit where it is due to claim that neither the opening of the airport nor the pilgrimages flights to Lourdes last October could have taken place but for the assistance given by my Department in advising on the technical and administrative steps necessary to meet the target for the commencement of operations.  In addition to facilitating the completion of the airport, I gave approval in principle to the inauguration of scheduled air services between Connaught and Dublin, Shannon, London and Manchester.</P>
    <P>A number of matters regarding the future administration of the airport remain to be resolved; it is essential for the company to ensure that, for instance, the optimum administrative practices and appropriate accounting procedures be employed.</P>
    <P>From the outset, the Connaught Airport project has inspired a mixture of enthusiasm and scepticism.  Nevertheless, we can only admire the indefatigable vision of its promoters in pressing the project through to completion.  I would like to reiterate the hope that the drive and enthusiasm of the airport's promoters will overcome the valid doubts expressed about its viability.</P>
    <P>I am happy to inform the House that the licensing and bonding scheme for the travel trade introduced in 1983 under the Transport (Tour Operators and Travel Agents) Act, 1982, continued to show its <Col N="1491" /> worth as a consumer protection measure in 1985.  A total of eight travel firms ceased trading in the second half of 1985 as they were unable to meet their obligations to their customers under overseas travel contracts.  I activated the statutory rescue arrangements in each.  The amount in the fund at present is of the order of £2 million.  It has always been my intention to reduce or suspend contributions to the fund when it is large enough to meet any possible contingencies. While this stage has not yet been reached, I propose to carry out a review of the position at the end of this year.</P>
    <P>Before concluding my remarks on the transport sector I would like briefly to refer to the response to the Green Paper on Transport Policy.  First of all I would like to thank those individuals and institutions who have made submissions as invited on the contents of the discussion paper.  The number of submissions received exceeded my expectations and indeed some are still coming in.  My officials are analysing these and have already had some meetings with interested parties.  I can assure all concerned that I will take full cognisance of their submissions in arriving at conclusions to be incorporated in the White Paper on Transport Policy which I hope will be published before the end of this year.</P>
    <P>There are three other important sectors whose regulation is primarily a matter for my Department, namely the postal, telecommunications and broadcasting sectors.  The effectiveness &mdash; cost and otherwise &mdash; of the postal and telecommunications sectors is also a major determinant of competitiveness in our economy.  They are also dominated by two State bodies whose financial performance is of equal importance to the taxpayers of this country who, through the Government, are their ultimate owners.</P>
    <P>When An Post were set up I gave a clear mandate to the boards to provide a good quality and very cost-effective service.  Their response to date has been gratifying and encouraging.  Present indications <Col N="1492" /> are that the company are within sight of achieving break-even in their profit and loss account.</P>
    <P>The company introduced a series of adjustments in postal charges.  The increase in basic postal rates &mdash; which averaged about 7 per cent &mdash; was the first since April 1982, a period of four years. In the same period the price of the main morning newspapers with which the cost of posting a letter is often compared, doubled approximately.</P>
    <P>The quality of service of An Post's mails operation continues to be very high, especially by international standards. This is shown by surveys commissioned by An Post themselves and confirmed by independent surveys organised by the Postal Service Users' Council.  In general, more than 90 per cent of letters, properly addressed, are delivered on the first day after posting, while over 96 per cent are delivered within two days of posting.</P>
    <P>A feature of An Post since vesting day has been their policy of seeking out new business opportunities in order to promote growth and greater utilisation of the postal service including the company's counter facilities.  This policy has resulted in a large number of new initiatives by the company, including the special St. Patrick's Day cards, Christmas and Valentine's Day stamps and Publicity post providing a low cost unaddressed mail service for advertisers and so on.</P>
    <P>In 1985, the company, for the first time, with Central Bank approval, introduced <i>bureau de change</i> facilities in Dublin, Cork, followed by Killarney earlier this year and the company's intention is to gradually extend this service. The new service provides welcome foreign exchange facilities outside normal banking hours and on Saturdays and will be helpful to the tourism trade.  An Post see the provision of <i>bureau de change</i> facilities as part of their strategy to develop and provide a wide range of financial services to consumers.</P>
    <P>In 1985 also, An Post succeeded in securing the franchise for the operation of the proposed national lottery.  This was a considerable coup for the company in the face of significant competition.  The <Col N="1493" /> national lottery is a major undertaking for any company and the decision to entrust the operation to An Post was interpreted &mdash; correctly &mdash; as a sign of Government confidence in the company's capacity to do the job well.  I know that this capacity can be translated into performance provided the company can continue to contain costs.  Given the labour intensity of the service labour costs must receive priority in this regard. Workers in An Post have been given extra job security by the Government decision to award them this franchise.  I know they appreciate this and hope it will be reflected in their wage demands.  Their first priority should be to contribute towards making the company a profitable and vibrant entity by reducing charges to business and the public and thereby generate increased demand for their services.</P>
    <P>Telecommunications is an area where availability of service has tended to dominate discussion with the price of the service being considered secondary by many.  While I will concentrate my remarks on the former I do not wish in any way to downgrade the importance I attach to costs in this area and the need to ensure the maximum possible efficiency in all segments of the market.</P>
    <P>Operation of the public switched telephone network is and will always be regarded by Telecom Éireann as their primary function.  Telecom Éireann have continued to make significant progress towards the elimination of the waiting list for telephones.  A waiting list of over 60,000 on 1 January, 1984, when the company came into operation, has now been reduced to less than 28,000 and the company feel that they will meet their target of eliminating that list in the current year.  During the 12 months to 31 December, 1985 BTE connected 75,008 new phones, almost as many as in 1984 &mdash; 75,949 &mdash; and an increase of almost 37.5 per cent on the number connected in 1983.  If the growth rate of telephone lines continues at present rate the company expect to be within sight of 1,000,000 lines in 1991 and to have lines in 60 per cent of households by that date.</P>
    <P>Ireland now has one of the most <Col N="1494" /> modern telex services in the world.  The national network is completely automatic while, internationally, automatic service is available to 160 countries.  The company expect to increase the number of lines on the network to 7,740 this year and to establish the maximum waiting period for service at three weeks from the date of application.</P>
    <P>When Telecom Éireann came into operation on 1 January, 1984, a number of firms were already supplying a range of telecommunications terminal equipment. With the intention of giving the new State body an opportunity to establish themselves, I decided to restrict those companies in the initial stages at least to the types of equipment supplied by them in the pre-1984 period.  I gave Telecom Éireann an exclusive licence for items such as telephone sets, dial-up modems and telex terminal equipment which were formerly supplied exclusively by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.</P>
    <P>I have decided, in response to representations from the telecommunications trade, to stimulate competition in the telecommunications terminal equipment market with a view to reducing the costs. I, therefore, extended to all licensees the right to provide dial-up modems and telex terminal equipment with effect from December 1985 and April 1986 respectively. Telecom Éireann are still exclusively licensed for the remaining item, namely, telephone sets.  I will, however, keep the situation under review.</P>
    <P>In the initial period following the establishment of Telecom Éireann, a system for the licensing of firms to supply, install and maintain equipment approved for connection to the national telecommunications network was introduced.  This system had two aims: (i) to regularise the position of firms already in or entering the retail telecommunications terminal equipment trade; and (ii) to protect the network and network personnel.  The aims of protecting the network and network personnel were achieved by ensuring that firms were competent before they were licensed and by ensuring that all equipment connected was compatible with the network.  Firms already in the <Col N="1495" /> business were deemed to be competent. A scale of licence fees ranging from £10,000 to £300 was established with the aim of making the licensing scheme self financing and financing the testing of equipment to ensure compatibility.</P>
    <P>This system which was intended only as an interim measure was found to be cumbersome so I decided, after consultation with the retail telecommunications trade, to replace it with a single renewable licence covering all approved equipment with an annual licence fee which I set at £150 for 1986.  I also decided that from 1 January, 1986 applicants who wished to have equipment approved for connection to the network would be obliged to finance the necessary tests themselves.</P>
    <P>I am hopeful that these initiatives to stimulate competition will lead to a more efficient and cost effective sector.  However, I also hope that BTE will continue to reduce the cost of their core business to improve the competitiveness of our trading sectors.  Their progress in this regard has been reasonably satisfactory to date.  In 1984 substantial reductions &mdash; up to one-third &mdash; were made in international telex and leased line charges. Further, international telephone and telex call charges generally were exempted from the charge increases implemented from 5 April 1985, and from 1 April 1986.  As a further step in improving competitiveness, telephone prices on key international routes were reduced by 10 per cent from 1 April 1986. I hope this process will continue and accelerate until BTE are fully competitive with the most efficient bodies in the same field in our trading partners.</P>
    <P>Last, but by no means least, I come to the final area for which my Department have responsibility, namely broadcasting. Subhead F1 of the Estimate provides for a grant-in-aid to RTE of £38.2 million in respect of net receipts from television licence fees.  This is an increase of some £5.1 million or 15 per cent over last year and is well above the anticipated rate of inflation this year.  The increase in the grant-in-aid payment to RTE reflects the <Col N="1496" /> efforts of An Post in increasing sales and the increase in licence fee rates approved by the Government from 1 March 1986.</P>
    <P>The review of Radio Telefís Éireann commissioned by me and published in September 1985 recommended that RTE should be given full responsibility for the control of licence fee revenue collection. RTE argued themselves for many years that it is more appropriate that they should have full control over the collection of what amounts to approximately 50 per cent of the body's total income.  At present the task of collecting television licence fee revenue and of detecting unlicensed and incorrectly licensed sets is delegated by statutory order from the Minister for Communications to An Post. Gross licence fee revenue is paid by An Post to the Department and is brought to account as an appropriation-in-aid of the Vote.  A payment equivelent to gross receipts less collection and other minor costs is made from Subhead F to RTE.  I am considering how the present arrangements can be improved upon and how the relationship between RTE and An Post can be placed on a less cumbersome footing.</P>
    <P>The computerisation of all licence fee records should be completed by the end of this year.  During 1985, An Post achieved the target of 750,000 sales set.  Also, as a result of ongoing inspections and selective campaigns, over 52,000 licence evaders were detected in 1985.  This year, An Post are confident of reaching a target of 770,000 licence sales.  In this context, a new saving stamps scheme, using forgery resistant stamps, was introduced in May.</P>
    <P>Following the detailed review of RTE carried out last year by consultants on my behalf, the RTE Authority have considered the findings and recommendations contained in the consultants' report and have submitted a draft corporate strategy for the period up to 1990.  The strategy document is currently being considered within my Department and I hope to be in a position to respond to it in the near future.</P>
    <P>The RTE Authority will, I am now confident, streamline and strengthen the organisation and its financial base so as <Col N="1497" /> to enable it to face the current and future demands of its customers.  This will entail greater labour flexibility in RTE, increasing substantially the amount of home produced material transmitted and containing all input costs.  RTE can and must give the licence holder better value for money.</P>
    <P>In anticipation of early enactment of the Local Radio Bill, 1985, which was introduced in this House this time last year, I established a non statutory interim local radio commission over a year ago to do all necessary preparatory work to facilitate the speedy establishment of legitimate local radio following the enactment of the Bill.  The commission have done much work in endeavouring to formulate the policy that would be adopted by the statutory commission in relation to the areas where local and community radio services could be established and in relation to the type of service that may be allowed within the framework of the Bill.  Deputies will appreciate that this type of work will be the statutory responsibility of the commission in due course and to the extent that the ground rules have been laid, legitimate local and community radio can be established quickly.  I am very disappointed that it has not been possible to make progress on the Bill despite my efforts to resolve the difficulties that have arisen.  I am still hopeful that these difficulties can be resolved and that the genuine concerns and fears of RTE and others in regard to the proposals in the Bill can be met.</P>
    <P>Subhead F2 provides for a grant of £1,625,000 to RTE in respect of net receipts from licence fees on cable television systems.  Increases in this subhead amounting to £275,000 or 20 per cent over 1985 are due mainly to increased charges for cable television services and to growth in the number of systems and the number of homes connected.</P>
    <P>In March 1985 I published the report of the committee which I set up to look at the whole future of the cable area.  The committee's recommendations, which are quite wide-ranging, constitute a useful blueprint for the future development of cable.  In the short term I have <Col N="1498" /> been addressing the question of permitting satellite delivered programmes to be relayed on cable systems, etc.  Work will be commencing shortly on a revision of existing cable regulations and on the preparation of a new upgraded technical specification for cable systems.  I expect that further discussions will take place with the cable industry on these matters in the near future.</P>
    <P>In September 1985, I announced that the Government had decided, in principle, to enter into negotiations with Atlantic Satellites plc. with a view to concluding an agreement to allow the company to construct and put into place the necessary satellite infrastructure and hardware which will enable the country to take advantage of direct broadcasting by satellite.  A detailed business plan has been submitted by the company.  This is being evaluated by the inter-departmental committee overseeing the project, representing my Department, the Department of Finance and the Department of Industry and Commerce. When the recommendations of the commitee on the business plan have been received the question of entering into a formal contractual commitment with the company will be considered by the Government.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I emphasise once again my commitment to efficiency and costeffectiveness in all the sectors and services which come within the ambit of my Department.  The Estimates before the House today are the minimum amounts needed to provide such services.  They are value for money.  They could not be provided without the co-operation and commitment of many dedicated public servants.  For this I thank them.</P>
    <P>I commend these Estimates to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>On the eve of the Derby, if I were putting à bet on I would know where to place it for speed.  The Minister said that, given the importance of the communications sectors and the State bodies within these for the general competitiveness and employment prospects of the economy, it is important that <Col N="1499" /> Members of the House should be given an opportunity to debate and to contribute to general policy formulation in this area.  This half day's debate is not adequate for a debate on the multifaceted Department of Communications. The Members of the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party sub-committee on communications would like to contribute to a more widely ranging debate which would last over a longer period than this.  However, there is no point in complaining about it now as we must make do with the time available.</P>
      <P>No matter what we may find to commend in the speech &mdash; and there are a number of things on which I would be in full agreement with the Minister &mdash; there is one item of the Minister's policy which, for me, vitiates the whole thing, one apple that rots the barrel.  I refer to the Government's handling of the Irish Shipping fiasco.  I repeat that I consider the action of the Minister and the Government to be national sabotage.</P>

      <P>It jettisoned decades of profitable activity by a company of prestige in international shipping circles.  It also jettisoned the good name for credit of Ireland in all major ports, east and west.  It drew opprobrium on Irish officers and crews in the Indian Ocean at Mombasa, in the Pacific Ocean Taiwan and in the Mediterranean at Marseilles.  Above all, it treated Irishmen and Irishwomen, who were paragons of achievement &mdash; and I have gone into this and studied it &mdash; in studying marine science in Ireland and in Britain and in handling our ships with an expertise unsurpassed in international shipping, with a shabbiness and a meanness unparallelled even in the greediest of private enterprises.  How the Labour Members of Government could support such miserly, ungenerous decision is hard to comprehend.  I am appealing to the Minister to look at subhead W.2 again and to increase the lowly sum to cover payments to all the former employees of Irish Shipping.  I do this for <Col N="1500" /> the umpteenth time in this House and with the backing of Deputies from the Government side of the House.</P>
      <P>The <i>Irish Spruce</i> was only the latest of the sales of our deep-sea ships.  Various sums have been mentioned as being the cost of this debacle.  Even with the Minister's figure of £50 million we could have an Irish deep-sea fleet of 16 <i>Irish Spruces</i>, something we do not need, on the basis of what was paid by whoever bought the <i>Irish Spruce</i>.  Perhaps the Minister will tell us that.</P>
      <P>Various Ministers, including the Minister for Health, have been sneering at Fianna Fáil's commitment to establish within a reasonable time a deep-sea fleet. I want to repeat that commitment to the Dáil.  The strategy may demand handy sized rather than larger ships.  Be that as it may, we shall stand by our policy and ask the Minister for Health, or any other Minister who indulges in the type of sneering that he did, to stick to their last. I have already stated in this House that the time is more than opportune for an investment in a deep-sea fleet.  Ships are available at knock-down prices.  Fuel, as the Minister mentioned, has dropped dramatically.  The last time I checked <i>The Economist</i> figure the drop was 15.3 per cent for North Sea Brent-Light Arabian crude which used to be the one quoted. Whichever is quoted, that is the figure we are talking about.  Admittedly, prices for fuel and ships have dropped for other countries as well.  But we envisage a deep-sea fleet, even if we start with one small ship and then expand as profits are made and as demand builds up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have so many things to cover that I will be brief on most of them.  First, the Minister has already taken the Bill on CIE into the Seanad.  The Bill envisages an overall company and three separate companies, one for the Dublin city services, one for rail and one for the provincial bus services.  This, of course, is not what is recommended in the McKinsey report.  We all know that and admit that. We have expressed doubts as to whether adding another layer of bureaucracy will make for efficiency in the new companies. I had an opportunity of seeing <Col N="1501" /> privately the demonstration of the new structures and I was impressed by them. However, we have been getting a great deal of correspondence on the matter from people vitally interested on theoretical levels and from those vitally interested in that they are employed in CIE, and specifically from the trade unions, that they are particularly worried about the proposal to have the two separate companies, one for the provincial bus services and the other for rail.  Their belief is that one single company would be better because otherwise there will be two companies under the same umbrella, so to speak, in competition with each other.  The transport committee of Fianna Fáil is examining their fears and trying to see whether there is truth in what they are alleging.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister, in his attack on the National Association of Transport Employees, was a little bit intemperate today.  I cannot let the opportunity pass without saying that.  He seems to have taken the opportunity to launch an attack on a trade union leader who, in fact, was simply making a statement at his annual general meeting in defence of his members, as he is not merely entitled but enjoined to do by virtue of the office which he holds.  I would just like to say that I do not agree with the Minister in making that kind of attack.  It is an ominous kind of an attack and rings certain bells that link up with certain provisions that were put into, and in one case withdrawn from, Bills that came before this House trying to stifle trade union participation in industrial relations and to reserve for the Minister for Communications certain rights of decision with regard to remuneration of workers in companies under the aegis of the Department of Communications.  There is no justification for the attack.  I see the way the chairman of NATE was thinking. He was thinking that the rivalry between two companies under the same umbrella, the CIE umbrella, could cause the railway to lose the battle.  As that trade union, as far as I know, represents mainly railway workers, he is entitled to express his concerns and we are obliged to listen <Col N="1502" /> and reject it if we find his argument unreasonable or take cognisance of it by way of amendment to the Bill if the situation so demands.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in going through the various activities of CIE, indicated that the mainline coaches programme, initiated by Fianna Fáil in Government, has been advanced.  He indicated that the DART system, also initiated by Fianna Fáil in Government, is also under way.  I would like some statistics on the DART operation now.  We had statistics before and the Minister told the House how many passengers DART would have to carry per annum to break even and go ahead to make a profit.  I was looking in the Library for some statistics but the most up to date statistics I could get in the Library were up to June of 1985.  I have on my own files more up-to-date statistics than those.  If he gets an opportunity when replying, perhaps the Minister would indicate how passenger traffic on DART has developed since he last gave statistics to the House.</P>
    <P>I am on record in this House regarding Dublin city bus services.  It is well to look at the Book of Estimates to see the breakdown of the subsidy to CIE.  On page 179, Revised Estimate 43, we are told that the payment in respect of public service obligations associated with the provision of rail services for 1986 will be £73,250,000.  Payment in respect of public service obligations associated with the provision of Dublin city bus services is given at £18 million &mdash; a welcome drop of £1.5 million.  I cannot see how the Dublin city bus service, with proper drive and motivation, could not be a paying proposition.  I have stated that during many debates here.  There is here a huge population in a constricted area.  The buses available are usually of good quality. The marketing does not appear able to cope, to attract more passengers for those services.  The transport consultative commission report gave comparative statistics for other cities of similar size throughout Europe and, from the finance point of view, Dublin came pretty well out of the comparison.  However, that is <Col N="1503" /> not good enough.  Years ago there were complaints that Dublin city services were subsidising inefficient services in the rest of the country.  When we look at the statistics as given in the Book of Estimates, we see that the Dublin city services cost is £18 million in 1986 and the provincial bus services amounts to £2,700,000.  If the new CIE cannot get that house in order, they will be another transport failure.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister's comments on the following subject.  There has been published an account of a Craig Gardner report of 1985.  As far as I know, the report was submitted to CIE at the end of 1985.  There have been denials of its existence.  Can the Minister say if it exists?  If it does and was put together at public expense, why can we not have a look at it?  Why has it not been published? It may have been published since I made these notes about it, but to my knowledge it has not been made public.  It is in this context of the Dublin city service as a viable, commercial and profitable unit of CIE that I am talking about it.  Could the Minister let us know if it exists, when it will be published, or the principal recommendations of the report?  I would be grateful for that information.</P>
    <P>I use the Dublin city bus service occasionally &mdash; far too infrequently, because one learns much from the top of the bus.  The top of the Clapham bus is, of course, the place for the real, solid citizen.  I have been struck by the courtesy of the conductors.  I have heard complaints about this and know that certain people have gone public about the lack of courtesy.  There may be discourteous conductors but on a number of occasions I took a bus at times when school children were getting on and off.  As far as I could see there was a personal relationship between the conductor and those school children.  They knew him by name and he knew some of them by name.  He was able to keep them in order which, at the best of times, is a difficult task but also great good humour prevailed thoughout <Col N="1504" /> the entire operation.  I am not saying that is universal among CIE personnel but it exists and could be built on.  In the context of developing a bus service for the city of Dublin, where the customers are, if you could only entice them on to the buses, that kind of courtesy is very important indeed.</P>
    <P>I can deal only superficially with the various problems which come up in this wide ranging Estimate debate.  I should like to mention the engineering plant potential at Inchicore.  It has been indicated to me that there is a wealth of talent and skill there.  Might it not be worth while engaging consultants to look at what is there by way of skills, with the objective of branching off into areas of engineering other than those directly related to CIE activities, doing creative work in its proper sense, creating new small industries as has happened in similar industries in Denmark, for example?</P>
    <P>My next point relates to a different Department but that being so, it tends to get lost and is not highlighted at all.  The Minister cannot and will not comment on it, but it concerns the CIE hotels.  I have a list of their losses in the early eighties. They have gone to CERT and to the Department of Labour and we do not know whether their financial position or performance has improved in the meantime. I am putting down a marker to remind myself to query the Minister for Labour who, I think, has responsibility now in that area.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Communications is constantly boasting about the improvement that he made in CIE finances.  He will find that the decision to make an above the line contribution was already made when he went into that Department.  I approve of this decision and it can improve morale.  As far as CIE subsidies are concerned, there was a 500 to 600 per cent increase in these in the period between 1972 and 1977.  That is something that we should not forget. There is a tendency to blame Fianna Fáil for all heavy expenditure, but I just wanted to put that on the record of the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise to the Minister if he thinks I said he made that statement. I just said that the tendency was to hang that criticism around the neck of the Fianna Fáil Government.  It jumped from £6 million in 1972 to £33,200,000 in 1977 and that increase has continued on its merry way.  I accept what the Minister says in that regard.</P>
      <P>We had a long and detailed debate on the Dublin Transport Authority in this House.  I indicated to the Minister that I was very disappointed with what he ended up with.  He emasculated the Bill as it was originally envisaged.  I said at the time, and still maintain, that the Department of the Environment counterattacked the Department of Communications &mdash; or Transport as it was then &mdash; and succeeded in getting the Environment point of view accepted, thus taking away the real powers that were envisaged for the Dublin Transport Authority at the very beginning.</P>
      <P>The time will come when the Dublin Transport Authority legislation will be amended by this House and when some of the original powers will have to be given back.  European criticism of our transport focuses on one point which was covered in the original Bill.  That is that transport, in the context of the Dublin Transport Authority, has no control over the roads.  The European mind cannot envisage that.  It was originally intended that the powers of the Dublin Transport Authority would stretch not to the area of road making, the Department of the Environment would continue to have responsibility for that, but to organising the whole road system and would have the expertise to deal with the road and rail system and to ensure that the planning was co-ordinated which is not necessarily so at present and may not necessarily be so in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Dublin Transport Authority Act is a kind of toothless dragon in some areas.  In other areas it is a good Act and will improve traffic if it is effectively <Col N="1506" /> implemented.  I would like the Minister to tell us when the transport authority will be created.  What date has he in mind? As we have all recorded in the House, the task force have done a very fine job considering they did not have any statutory legs to stand on.  They have done a lot of work since their establishment.  I observe in Dublin city, not with increasing frequency but frequently enough, that people are breaking the regulation about the use of the bus lanes.  I hoot at them whenever I can.  It is not very effective but it is an indication that I do not approve. When I was in office I was put under some pressure by interest groups to allow then to use the bus lanes but I refused to do so.  I hope that a strict and strong line will be maintained in that regard.  The bus lanes have freed transport considerably.</P>
    <P>The Minister devoted a considerable part of his speech to the new Bill covering the activities of road hauliers.  I do not intend to spend any more time debating that.  We discussed it in fine detail in the House.  The hauliers are anxious about enforcement.  Those who are anxious to avail of the new regulations and to equip themselves with proper licences and so on want the legislation enforced without delay.  The Minister's new inspectorate is an important element in this whole area. I would like him to tell me &mdash; he mentioned it when we were discussing the Bill &mdash; when he expects to establish the inspectorate, whether he will be using officers who are already in the Department of Communications and, if not, when he will be recruiting the staff. What are the qualifications that will be necessary for this task, apart from a very tough hide and when will the force be under way?</P>
    <P>I know that international hauliers have been worried about the various aspects of European travel in particular.  I will mention a representation <i>en passant</i> which I received from a person who spends most of his time on the Continent. He gave me a schedule of the road toll charges he pays in France and Spain.  He made the case that although his truck is seldom in this country he is paying substantial tax on it here.  He is also <Col N="1507" /> paying a very substantial tax in Europe. The figures are quite alarming.  He felt that he was at a competitive disadvantage in this regard.</P>
    <P>The Minister dealt with the B &amp; I on which, as the Minister indicated, we had a very full debate in this House.  I indicated the criticisms that this side of the House had with regard to the new B &amp; I arrangement.  We are very suspicious of the cartel.  We are very suspicious of the arrangement on the southern corridor and with good reason.  We want to make sure that a State-subsidised company &mdash; we were voting £38 million at the time &mdash; should not use their position as a State-subsidised company to damage private hauliers using the southern corridor.  I got an assurance from the Minister and from the B &amp; I that this would not happen. Vigilance is important in this area.  I had the advantage since then of meeting the chairman and chief executive with his two deputies, Messrs.  Bird and Kennedy, and had a discussion with them on the matter.</P>
    <P>We should watch what is for sale on the B &amp; I ships and the Sealink ships. Sealink were a British company but are now owned by an American, an efficint and ruthless businessman.  we want to make sure that Irish goods are not excluded from the single ship that will operate on the Rosslare-Fishguard route. I got assurances on most of the points I made from the Minister and from the chairman and chief executive when discussing this with them.  We must remember that the gentleman who now owns Sealink also owns Holyhead, Fishguard and Stranraer ports.  CIE own Rosslare port, the OPW own the port of Dún Laoghaire and the Dublin Port and Docks Board own Dublin port.  These three bodies should see to it that they exact from Sealink what is and has been exacted from the B &amp; I who had ships on the Pembroke route first and now on the Fishguard, Holyhead and Liverpool routes.</P>
    <P>The Cork situation has come in for considerable debate.  I cannot help going along with what Deputy Coveney said, as reported in <i>The Cork Examiner</i> some <Col N="1508" /> time ago, that there was need for a ferry but only during the summer months.  I agree also with him that local interests should be involved in it.  I would go a stage further and say that the Minister and the Government should give any support they can in this regard.  The whole business is difficult to assess from an economics point of view.  We gain a great deal from the tourist trade in the Cork, Kerry, Clare and Limerick areas when there is a ferry.</P>
    <P>Deputy Coveney envisaged a break even three month operation.  If that is so, it is an economic plus for the country as a whole.  Even if there was a slight loss in the operation of the ferry &mdash; giving the game away at that stage as it were &mdash; it might not necessarily mean a loss for the country.  As we have no longer a price control mechanism I am asking the Minister to keep an eye on the cartel arrangement. Air fares will cause the shipping companies to watch their charges and so on.  There have been substantial increases by both B &amp; I and Sealink which some people say could not have been warranted on the basis of the drop in fuel charges.  It is an area where exploitation could take place.</P>
    <P>I received a letter today from Anglo Irish Container Line indicating that they had read what I had said here on the B &amp; I and I quote:</P>
    <P>In view of your comments relative to the alleged cartel operating on the Irish Sea, I felt you would be interested to learn of the establishment of this new line which commenced operations on the 2nd June.  With a chartered vessel we operate a lift on lift off container service direct between Dublin South Bank Terminal and Royal Seaforth Terminal in Liverpool.  We sail from Dublin on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays and from Liverpool on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays and believe we are filling a necessary gap in the &ldquo;Central Corridor&rdquo; by providing a direct competitive personalised service to Irish importers and exporters.</P>
    <P>I do not know who owns that company <Col N="1509" /> but obviously, not all that is said in this House is ignored by everybody.  The Minister did not mention Irish Continental Line in the course of his speech.  I would like him to tell us what the position in that regard is.  By persistency, I extracted the information that the B &amp; I had asked consultants to advise them on what was the best thing to do with regard to Irish Continental Line.  I have not got any follow on information on that.  I would like to know what the position is. An allegation has been made that Sealink's boss has been encouraging the B &amp; I to purchase ICL.  I do not know whether there is any substance in that but that hint was given in this House and repeated outside.  If the Minister has information on that matter the House is entitled to get it.  It will not do any damage to the general credibility of any of the Irish interests concerned.  It would be as well for us to know what the real position is.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that he made £3 million available to the Dublin Port and Docks Board.  The improvement at the port is highly desirable.  We should be delighted that this improvement has taken place.  It is the capital city and it is a major port by any standards.  It has almost died.  People as far north as Carrickfergus were gaining from the troubles which took place in Dublin Port.  Every place from there down to Drogheda and from Dublin south were gaining by the troubles that were being experienced in Dublin port.  The troubles were damn near killing it.  It is a matter of some satisfaction that the major trouble has been dealt with.  I hope it stays that way and that the port continues to thrive.</P>
    <P>The Minister also referred to the Harbours Bill.  I have already criticised certain powers that the Minister tried to take for his Department in the B &amp; I Bill.  I do not like something I see in the Harbours Bill which sets up the estuarial Authority in the Shannon Estuary.  The Minister gives himself powers to abolish <i>ad nutum</i> the Foynes Harbour Authority. He should not do that.  As Minister I met the Foynes Harbour Authority people. They were very impressive and convincing. Nothing convinces one as much as <Col N="1510" /> being shown a balance sheet with a profit. They are afraid to get into the grasp of Limerick city or any authority covering that area.  They are profitable.  The grant they received from the Government with regard to development was minimal. They used their own moneys to develop Foynes.  I would say to the Minister, be careful, hands off if they are doing well.</P>
    <P>The Free Ports legislation received minute treatment in the House.  We went over all the free ports in the world, in particular the very successful one in Florida which has conditions and circumstances with which no one could compete.  There is no way that anything as profitable could be developed in this country.  It is more in earnest than in hope that Cork is being established as a free port.  It was agreed on all sides of the House at the time that it is not a panacea, that free port will not cure Cork's ills but if it encourages investment in industry on the very substantial industrial site near it, the investment in the equipment for Ringaskiddy deep sea harbour will come to fruition.  As the House well knows, Cork needs some kind of economic elixir at present.</P>
    <P>With the Minister, I would like to compliment Aer Lingus on having reached their golden jubilee.  The celebration of the jubilee was very enjobable.  It was good to see two people who flew on the original flight travelling again to Bristol to celebrate the golden jubilee.  I first used the DC-3s over 40 years ago.  I had a great liking for them.  There was real leather on the seats and one sank very deep into them.  Sometimes one had a bucking bronco type of flight.  I could only afford night flights then.  These were known as &ldquo;star flights&rdquo; where one left at 2 a.m.</P>

      <P>They were for the respectable people.  The cosmhuintir had to go at 2 a.m.  It was nice to be nostalgic for a while but I must get back to realities.  The cost alleviation figure has been dropped this year.  Last year was a very successful one as everyone knows.  Marketing <Col N="1511" /> people may claim credit for that but the fact is that the big credit was because of the strength of the dollar.  There is no question about that.  There was also an ethnic significance.  The dollar was strong for the Irish-American as it was for everyone else.  It seems strange that having maintained the figure at a certain level in a year that was very good, it is now being dropped.  It is generally agreed that there will be a drop in the number of passengers this year due to something stupid which happened in the Mediterranean.  People are frightened to come to Europe.  I cannot understand that that is the particular year we choose to drop the alleviation figure particularly when Delta are coming for the first time and when Pan Am have resumed their flights into Ireland. There may be a lack of logic in that.  The paramount question exercising people's minds at present is the financing of the fleet.  The general report is that the company want the Boeing 737-300 because flights out of Heathrow are becoming very frequent, so a somewhat larger plane is needed if profits are to be maximised.  The Minister devoted a portion of his remarks to this whole question.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>There was an element of the Delphic Oracle about what the Minister said on funding.  He did not say he was refusing equity; he did not say he was giving equity.  He did not say he was inviting private investment; he did not say he was going to preclude the possibility of private investment.  I am sure Deputy Kelly would be able to give six or seven utterances, off the top of his tongue, from the Delphic Oracle which would be in the halfpenny place only with the Minister's <Col N="1512" /> remarks about the financing of Aer Lingus.  We would like something up front, clearer on that.  How much equity, what exactly is required?  The ICTU say there are big exaggerations, that £200 million is all that is required; others have stated £1 billion.  I think they are thinking about the jumbos way out front many years hence into the nineties.</P>
    <P>I want to mention Ryan Air, the Celtic Air, Delta and the Pan Am new situation which has put pressure on Aer Lingus.  I suppose in the end the weakest will go to the wall.  At least in the short term the customer will benefit from what is happening.</P>
    <P>I have a note here about the European Court of Justice, the ruling that price fixing is out.  I know that the European Parliament took the Council of Ministers of Transport to court over dragging their feet with regard to competition in various areas.  I am in full agreement with the Minister when he says there is a lot of lip service paid to competition.  My experience was that competition meant different things to different people.  The British and Dutch have received great praise in this House and outside it for their initiatives on the matter.  I do not believe that was straight-across-theboard acceptance of free competition, particularly with regard to fifth freedom rights to which we were entitled on the basis of having established a business. Then they were taken from us in one particular instance.  There is a good deal of pseudo-liberalism bandied about but, when the chips are down, it is the pound sterling, the guilder, or whatever, that counts.  I think the Minister has been somewhat hard on Commissioner Sutherland. He has indicated that he is anxious to get competition going.  However I have noticed with other commissioners a certain arrogance, a certain stepping out of their place with regard to the Treaty of Rome, a kind of bullying philosophy.  I am not saying Commissioner Sutherland is guilty of that but others of them are, a type of attitude: whether Ministers like it or not, we will make them do this or that, again, relying on the Treaty of Rome to do so.  I had intended dealing <Col N="1513" /> with the Euro shipping policy, the efforts made to have a common policy, but I do not have sufficient time.</P>
    <P>With regard to Aer Rianta there is a little exercise I should like someone to do.  Aer Rianta are making a profit. Would someone do an accountancy exercise and state what would be the exact position if the capital costs had been borne by Aer Rianta in the past?  Let us say Aer Rianta make £10 million profit and make that available to the Minister, but to date the capital costs had to be borne by the Exchequer.  I note the Minister has announced a change in this respect. One question that has been posed and that I am repeating is: how could Connacht Regional Airport build a 10,000 foot runway for £12 million whereas an 8,600 foot runway at Dublin Airport will cost £31 million exclusive of compensation costs for the land?  Belfast has proved to be a very strong competitor with Dublin.  Particularly in my area it is said that the Belfast-London run is being operated at a loss and, for that reason, the charges are low.  I am delighted that Ryan Air are operating.  There is one point that arose in Europe to which I should like to refer and which is highly relevant to the operations of Aer Rianta, that is the danger that the duty-free operation, which is a great money spinner &mdash; I think £8 million on the last count &mdash; might be abolished by the European Council of Ministers cum Commission.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister on having provided the new preinspection facility at Shannon.  Perhaps it is an earnest of freer access.  Last May Deputy Frank Cluskey and I were in a queue at New York Airport for nearly two hours.  If this new facility speeds up that operation, all the better.  Deputy De Rossa adopted a rather silly type of attitude to it, fearing the infiltration of the Americans, building it up into a case without any substance.  I know it is important to watch the super powers, that that is the essence of political wisdom.  They are like ourselves, out for themselves, out to take whatever advantage they can, but one can exaggerate in the manner that Deputy De Rossa did.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1514" /> The Minister mentioned the tour operators and the Transport (Tour Operators and Travel Agents) Act, 1982.  I am glad the provisions of that Act are operating well.  The Minister mentioned the fund. There is another fund &mdash; about which I asked a parliamentary question some time ago, perhaps two or three years ago &mdash; which was established prior to that and in which some commentators were interested.  I think it is under the control of the tour operators.  It was available before the funds were built up as a result of the provisions of that Act.  I should like to know in what kind of legal Valhalla that fund is now.  Some commentators indicated that they did not think it was at the disposal of the tour operators.</P>
    <P>I had intended to go through the Book of Estimates.  I have a number of points noted here but I think I shall have to leave them for some other time.  It happened me last time also, that I did not get through everything that had to be dealt with.</P>

      <P>I shall conclude now by saying that the Euro dimension will assume increasing importance in the next few years.  They will find it very difficult to make any progress because of the &ldquo;mé féin&rdquo; type of attitude that obtains.  We must be honest, we adopt it too; if one is in that kind of business one has to do it. If one has to surrender an advantage one has to be seen to gain a little advantage if one is looking after the interests of one's country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might make one final point about the Minister's powers under the Foreshore Act, of, I think, 1946.  I know there are two Acts quoted in a footnote in the Book of Estimates.  Rosslare have made representations to me and asked me to go down to see the serious coast erosion problem there.  The Minister has overall control, the Office of Public Works being involved also.  CIE own Rosslare Harbour. I am talking about Rosslare itself <Col N="1515" /> where barriers have been erected to catch the sand.  Apparently the sand moves north and these barriers stop the erosion. A number of these barriers have been erected at a very moderate cost.  Apparently other barriers can be erected which would do a great deal of good in the preservation of the shore in that area. The people in Rosslare itself are anxious that some initiative be taken in this regard.  They have also talked about nourishment of the strand by pumping sand up onto it and so on.  It is an area requiring serious attention.  It appeared to me that there might be a European interest in its development.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Estimates all except with regard to Irish Shipping Limited which, as I said at the beginning vitiates a good deal of it for me.  For that reason probably I shall be opposing the Estimates as a whole.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to raise one point only on the Minister's Estimate.  I would have had many other things to say about it but I do not want to distract attention from this single point which I tried but failed to raise on the Adjournment two weeks ago.  It appears to me to be of such importance that I should not let it slip and I am very surprised that no other Deputy tried to draw the attention of the House to this matter during the past three weeks.</P>
      <P>On 5 June <i>The Irish Times</i> and perhaps other papers carried a report from the annual conference of the Postal and Telecommunications Worker's Union in Portlaoise. The report is, of course, in the words of <i>The Irish Times'</i> reporter and I cannot vouch for the truth of it but I naturally take for granted the accurate intent of the reporter concerned.  The report states:</P>
      <P>Postal workers all over the Republic may refuse to handle the South African Digest.  The annual conference of the PTWU yesterday adopted a resolution asking the executive committee to instruct all branches not to handle the magazine which was said to be propagandist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1516" /> A named gentleman, whose name I will not repeat here said that members of the union in Blackrock had been refusing to handle the digest for the last six months. About 30 copies arrived every month and they were piling up in the Blackrock post office.  The report adds that the general secretary said the postal authorities approached the executive to try to get the ban lifted.  However, the executive declined to lift it.  The general secretary, very much to his credit, reminded the union and its conference that there were penalties under the criminal code for interference with mail delivery.  That was an extremely pertinent reminder and credit is due to a very responsible secretary for drawing the attention of his conference to this point.</P>
    <P>It seems to me to raise a much larger and more urgent public issue which ought not to pass unnoticed in this House.  I recognise that there are strong feelings about the regime in South Africa and I share them myself.  The only respect, perhaps, in which I differ from the people who promote policies of sanctions against South Africa is that I cannot see why South Africa alone is singled out among all the other criminal or semi-criminal regimes in the world.  I cannot see why it alone must be the pariah when there are many other States in which I would be equally or more unwilling to live than South Africa.  I cannot see why there should be a special case made of South Africa but that is the only respect in which my opinions on it differ from those of the PTWU.  I respect and take for granted the generosity and humanity of their feelings about the people who suffer from the existence of a regime such as that run by the Pretoria Government.</P>
    <P>I do not want to give offence to a large number of very decent people, to whom I unwittingly and very foolishly and stupidly did give offence a few years ago by a very stupid unconsidered remark which they quite rightly resented and for which I did my best to apologise at the time.  I do not want to give offence to the PTWU but I have to say that a postal worker has no business forming a judgment of any kind about the content of a packet which <Col N="1517" /> it is his duty to deliver.  I use the word &ldquo;packet&rdquo; because it is the technical legal word for anything going through the post and includes even a slim letter with a single sheet of paper.  It is the duty of a postal worker to expedite the delivery of that letter, even if it be a circular or a piece of blatant progaganda, quite irrespective of its content.  For all I know, it might even be a piece of criminally seditious literature.</P>
    <P>There are proper authorities for dealing with that and these authorities may in some contexts have the right to call upon the postal worker to co-operate in impounding mail or interfering with it under other well recognised legal powers, but the postal worker himself has no right to do so.  He may have his own strong opinions, which may be very correct and which many of us in the House might share, about the source from which propaganda material going through the post may emanate.  I have said already that I would share the feelings of the PTWU about the Pretoria Government's propaganda material but that has nothing to do with the duty he is paid to perform, namely, to deliver that letter to the person whose name and address appear on the outside.</P>
    <P>I am one of the recipients of the <i>South African Digest</i> and I do not mind telling the House that I never even take it out of its wrapper.  My <i>South African Digest</i> goes straight into the waste-paper basket and if the South African Embassy in London like to take note of the fact they are welcome to strike my name off their mailing list.  I do not make an invidious exception of South African material since I put nearly all such material into the waste-paper basket with complete impartiality. Life is simply not long enough to read the material which every Deputy gets in massive does every day of the week.</P>
    <P>The point is that today it is South African material to which the postal workers take exception and feel they are within their rights in refusing to deliver.  Under a different constellation, next year or in five years' time, there may be some other <Col N="1518" /> set of beliefs and dissatisfactions, resentments and hostilities in the world and it may be that post office workers here or elsewhere will take exception to material which can be classified as propaganda coming from the Fine Gael Party, the Fianna Fáil Party, the Labour Party or any other party in this country.  While one can sympathise with the sentiments about South Africa, it has to be made absolutely plain that the post must be relied on regularly to deliver and to expedite whatever is entrusted to it.  Once the principle is admitted or tolerated for an instant that anybody working in the postal service is entitled to exercise his own judgment over the content of material which is going through the postal process, one of the principal things which make for a civilised society is in danger.</P>
    <P>Although it is not very often seen in this light, the freedom to communicate is exercised quite as much through the postal service as through the media, quite as much through the distribution of letters, circulars or propaganda material through the post as it is by the publication of opinions in the newspapers or the transmission of opinions over the broadcasting system.  I would be just as unwilling to see the postal service subject to a kind of quiet, unpublicised private censorship exercised at the behest of anybody &mdash; I do not care how good his motives are &mdash; as I would be to see the same kind of thing done with the newspaper, television or radio service.</P>
    <P>I should like very much to have the Minister's reaction.  I quite recognise that he does not have responsibility for the day-to-day operation of the postal service but he does have a residual overall responsibility for it which he cannot shed. His main duties in regard to posts and telegraphs, subsumed though they be under the umbrella title of Communications, are still pretty well what they were under the 1924 Ministers and Secretaries Act.  That Act, which gathered up the postal functions and transferred them to An Post a few years ago, has still left him with certain responsibilities.  One of those responsibilities, one of those powers under the Act, is the power to initiate <Col N="1519" /> summary prosecutions for a certain range of offences.  One of the offences is that of delaying or detaining a postal packet or doing anything to prevent its due delivery. The fact that there is a statutory power vested in the Minister means that he is bound to use reasonable diligence in excercising that power and making use of it.  Therefore, he must take an interest in what happens in regard to the due despatch of postal business.  He must take seriously, as I presume he does, the fact, even if it is only at one post office and even if it is only in regard to rotten propaganda material from Pretoria, that postal workers have taken it upon themselves to hold up even a trickle of 30 or 40 copies of a publication each month.</P>
    <P>A Minister or a Government who do not take that issue seriously will be opening the door to far more serious and sinister abuses in the future.  I do not wish to make a mountain out of a molehill, but this is not a molehill.  I am amazed that nobody has seen fit to make a fuss about this matter before and that our editorial writers, who are black in the face giving out about the horrors of South Africa, about illiberality in every other walk of life, about sinister Ministers of either Fine Gael or Fianna Fáil persuasion exercising censorship on RTE, who work themselves into a frenzy of righteousness if there is the faintest whisper of criticism of themselves, let alone censorship have left this go without comment.  I do not think I have seen one editorial comment on this issue.  I recognise that it is the Minister's policy, and rightly so, to be on good terms with the unions represented in the concerns for which he has responsibility in the House.  I support him in everything he does in that regard, but there is a point at which justifiable anxiety to maintain good relations within industrial organisations on the labour side must give way to other forms of duty.</P>
    <P>There is a duty on the Minister to take seriously this apparently accepted idea that we can have a censorship inside the postal service operated by employees of the postal service.  I am not asking the Minister to reply to this in the Dáil.  The <Col N="1520" /> Minister has not had any notice of my raising this matter and he may want to think about it or take advice on it.  I am not asking him to respond to it today if it does not suit him to do so.  As a responsible and careful Minister I accept that he will take seriously this threat to one of the principal freedoms we havethe freedom to communicate with one and other, albeit in a mode not very often classified as a medium of communication.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>The debate on this Estimate gives us an opportunity to express our views on a Department which has responsibility for communications, transport and other important facets of Irish life.  I shall deal with the areas for which I am Opposition spokesman, post and telegraphs and broadcasting.  It is vital that Telecom Éireann provide without delay details of all telephone calls made from each number.  There is concern among the 750,000 subscribers about the problem of telephone accounts.  In his report for 1985 the Ombudsman said he had received 1,206 complaints in relation to telephone accounts.  All Members have received numerous complaints from their constituents.  I have received many complaints from people in my constituency and from other areas in the country about the billing system operated by Telecom Éireann.  The problem can only be resolved by the provision of detailed accounts every two months.</P>
      <P>The Minister may say that this is not his direct responsibility but he told us in his speech:</P>
      <P>They are also dominated by two State bodies whose financial performance is of equal importance to the taxpayers of this country who, through the Government, are their unltimate owners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government are the only shareholders of Telecom Éireann and I do not think the Minister can wash his hands in regard to the policies of that organisation. He should involve himself in a more positive way in such matters.  In the course of his report for 1985 the Ombudsman outlined in great detail the complaints he received regarding the accounts system. <Col N="1521" /> The Minister should insist on more co-operation between Telecom Éireann and the Ombudsman who is carrying out his responsibilities on behalf of the hard-pressed subscribers.</P>
    <P>Is the Minister in a position to tell the House the progress made in regard to making private meters available to telephone subscribers?  I should like to appeal to Telecom Éireann to provide such meters where accounts are in dispute.  It is one way of helping people to understand how accounts are prepared.  A detailed account of each call made, the date of the call and the telephone number dialled should be provided as a matter of priority.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister not to allow An Post erect special letter boxes at the head of driveways and roadways in rural areas thereby removing the daily contact between postman and those living in rural areas.  In many cases the postman is the only contact people in rural areas have with the outside world from one week to the next.</P>
    <P>As a matter of policy the Minister should instruct An Post to implement a full domestic banking system, such as proved very successful in other countries.</P>
    <P>The Minister should provide the £3 million fund for capital development in 1986 as promised in <i>Building on Reality.</i> I find it difficult to understand why the Minister has not provided that money.  In the annual report of An Post, up to 31 December 1985, the Chairman, Mr. Fergal Quinn, appealed to the Government to provide the £3 million for capital development.  I support that call.  When we were debating the Bill dealing with the setting up of Telecom Éireann in 1983 it was agreed that the Government would provide the funds for capital works such as the improvement of post offices and sorting offices.  In many areas those buildings are below the standard which the public demand.  When we handed over the assets of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs on 1 January 1984 some of the buildings were not in good condition and An Post have found it difficult to maintain them.  Some of those historic <Col N="1522" /> buildings are in good locations in our principal towns.  The Minister should make a case to the Government to provide £3 million for development work on those buildings.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to look at the position in regard to the GPO.  The way An Post have defaced the GPO with the erection of green banners between the fine columns of that building is most unacceptable. The building is not simply the General Post Office but it is the building that symbolises Irish republicanism because the rebellion took place there in 1916.  The Department of the Environment are talking about improving the city of Dublin.  As a non-Dubliner I was somewhat taken aback by the erection of these banners which have taken from the architectural character of the building.  Everyone knows where the GPO is and An Post do not need the banners there.  I accept this is a minor point and is not significant, but when the Minister is passing the building perhaps he would look at it.  I am sure he will agree with me that the banners do nothing to enhance that fine building.  With regard to the GPO, perhaps the Minister will confirm in the near future if we have purchased he ground rent of the building.  When I was in the Department I was very anxious to finalise that matter.  At one stage the ground rent was owned by a foreign national and I think we should at least buy it out.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the national lottery has been allocated to An Post: in fact, I lobbied for it.  While Fianna Fáil as a party have objections to the National Lottery Bill, I support the principle of allowing An Post to operate the lottery. They have 2,000 offices throughout the country and, consequently, are in a position to provide the service for a national lottery.  An Post should also be given responsibility for other services.  For instance, they should finalise negotiations with the ESB for the collection of electricity accounts and, in conjunction with Bord Fáilte, arrangements should be made where selected offices would provide tourist information.  Post offices <Col N="1523" /> throughout the country should have for sale a selection of tourist guides, maps and so on.  The sub-post masters throughout the country would be able to provide this service.  This would be appropriate and it would provide additional work for the local post offices.</P>
    <P>With regard to local radio, it is regrettable that after three and a half years the Coalition have failed to finalise the Bill and to have it passed by the Oireachtas. On 5 July 1985 the Bill was introduced for a Second Reading but after a one-day debate the Coalition were forced to drop it because Deputy Cluskey pointed out repeatedly he could not support it.  For the past 12 months nothing has been done.  This is an indication of the instability of Coalition Governments, that they cannot bring forward and finalise legislation. I sympathise with the Minister on the frustration he and his Department have experienced in that they have been unable in the past few years to bring forward this Bill.  At present there are more than 60 unlicensed radio stations operating in this State.  They are anxious to come out of the twilight zone.  They want to be registered and to make their full contribution to employment and economic recovery.  On our return to Government, which is probably imminent at this stage, it will be our priority to bring forward legislation in relation to local radio.  It must be implemented six months after our return to office.</P>
    <P>It is an area of public unease.  In this city and throughout the country unlicensed services are being provided.  The public are responding and are listening to them and I do not think the present situation is acceptable.  We should have legislation in force and licences should be issued.  Jobs could be created and revenue could be raised.  Our Bill would provide for the setting up of an independent local radio authority.  It would provide for local independent radio to cater for community and commercial needs and would allow RTE to apply for licences in areas where they have facilities and are already established.  In this connection, again I call on the Minister to give permission to <Col N="1524" /> RTE to extend the broadcasting hours of Cork local radio who are providing an excellent service in the Cork region.  At this stage the Minister should not await the passing of the legislation for independent local radio.  He should give permission to Cork local radio to extend their broadcasting hours in advance of the Bill.</P>
    <P>We support the application by RTE for the establishment of a long wave radio broadcasting service on the frequency allocated to Ireland by international agreement.  RTE are recognised throughout the world as having broadcasters, producers and technical staff of the highest quality.  We need to assist them and to give them new opportunities, particularly in light of the recent reports on RTE.  By providing a long wave radio service jobs could be created here and advertising revenue could be earned from abroad.  In his reply to this debate, I ask the Minister to indicate the reason he has not approved the application by RTE to provide this very good service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no problem.  This debate gives us an opportunity to put <Col N="1525" /> forward points to the Minister and it is my wish to be as constructive as possible. The Minister has an important area of responsibility and we should try to obtain the information we require either today or at an early stage.  Is the Minister aware of the request from the entertainment profession in relation to the provision of another national radio service to provide so-called &ldquo;middle of the road&rdquo; music and particularly to give Irish entertainers and recording artists an opportunity to be heard on national radio?  While RTE 1 and RTE 2 are providing a good service with regard to radio, on RTE 1 there is the high percentage of news and current affairs programmes and there is not the same opportunity for recording artists to be heard on that radio as they would like and RTE 2 is generally regarded as a pop station.  Thus, there is a void to be filled. The Minister may say that local radio could fill this need and I agree to some extent that if local radio were in place now recording artists would have more opportunity to be heard.  In advance of that perhaps the Minister could consider it.  It is worthy of serious consideration that RTE use their existing radio 1 network to provide an additional service. This could be a joint development with entertainment and private enterprise.  It could be a joint RTE/private enterprise development which could be very beneficial and worthwhile and would not be in direct conflict with RTE 1 or RTE 2 but probably more in conflict with other stations abroad.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to consider very seriously providing Telefíts na Gaeltachta services in Gaeltacht areas and establishing a pilot scheme for such.  I believe that we have the existing transmitter facilities and utilising the studios of Radio na Gaeltachta in the Gaeltacht areas, this could be a very important development.  I know that a cost factor will be involved, but at least this should be examined and some departmental committee or some professionals should look at this future development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that regard we are still debating local radio when we should be considering the <Col N="1526" /> advent of independent television services. Competition is the life of trade and there is room for a totally independent television service here.  Again, that should be examined fully by the Department of Communications to see if the population figures and the economics would justify the provision of an independent television service.  At this stage RTE 1 and RTE 2 have a monopoly.  Monopolies generally are bad and when it comes to any debate of public concern the question of impartiality will always arise.  We should have an alternative to provide an alternative point of view.  If there was an independent television service there would be more competition also between RTE and that independent television service to give a much sharper news and current affairs service for the public. From my examination of other countries which have numerous television services I can say that our population would justify that.</P>
    <P>Regarding direct satellite broadcasting, we should be moving to finalise the agreement with Atlantic Satellites to operate an orbital slot located 31ºW longitude. This slot is a very useful allocation to Ireland and should be utilised fully.  It would provide much needed employment, and the link with Atlantic Satellites and the Hughes Corporation would give a very strong company position.  The Minister should ensure when he is finalising arrangements that RTE and Telecom Éireann are involved in the final agreement with Atlantic Satellites and that they be given opportunities of a say or involvement in the development of direct satellite broadcasting.</P>
    <P>There is need for legislation in the area of television deflectors.  We continue on the path we have taken in the past of ignoring the problem so that it may eventually go away, but in rural areas the only method for the transmission of television signals for multichannel viewing is through television deflectors.  The Department regard it as rebroadcasting. This is a matter for debate, but I know that within the Department there is major objection to the provision of television deflectors.  However, the Minister <Col N="1527" /> can bring in the legislation necessary to license the provision of television deflectors to provide multichannel viewing in rural areas.  Nothing is impossible in this area, and the Minister is being restricted to some extent by information which is available in the Department and is being advised in a certain way.  I advise him to get outside advice in this areas to equip him to introduce the legislation to provide multichannel viewing in rural areas.</P>
    <P>I compliment RTE on their generally high standard of broadcasting.  At times we have reason to complain and I, for one, am not totally satisfied with their conduct in the recent referendum.  That is over now and the decision has been made very satisfactorily.  Nevertheless, I and, I am sure, many people feel that it is difficult to provide impartiality within any broadcasting organisation.  That, of course, is a human frailty which arises at times, but at this stage I appeal to the Minister to institute the necessary policy developments that I have suggested and at least introduce the Bill to provide for independent local radio.  That should be his priority, but he will not be able to implement it with this Government. Nevertheless, he should as a matter of urgency regard this as a priority within his Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern" hpid="Mr. M. Ahern Mr. M. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a few words to say on the Estimate.  Over the past year the Minister has brought in a great deal of legislation and I will refer to a couple of Bills that he has brought through the House.  The Road Transport Bill was legislation that was needed and had been outstanding for many years.  It was necessary to update road transport legislation generally.  That Bill set out to regularise and harmonise the whole road transport field.  However, not only I but also the members of the Unlicensed Hauliers Association feel that they have not had a fair crack of the whip.  Over the years thousands of these people have operated within the road traffic regulations regarding tax, insurance and licence in the Revenue area but have not had road traffic licences.  They are in an unenviable position <Col N="1528" /> as regards getting licences under the new regulations.  I would like the Minister to assure them that their livelihood will not be put a risk and that they will have every opportunity to get a licence under the new system.  During the debate the Minister of State told us that the majority of these people, if they conform to the three conditions laid down, will be able to acquire the new licence; but the Minister should come out and make another statement on this issue.  Even last night I was speaking to one of these unlicenced hauliers who was still in grave doubt about what his position will be under the new regulations.  It would be a good idea if the Minister would make a further statement on this matter to alleviate the fears of many of these law-abiding people who, through no fault of their own but due to successive Governments not updating regulations, find themselves in an invidious position.</P>
      <P>Let me refer to the Dublin Transport Authority Bill &mdash; or Act, as I presume it has been signed by the President.  Initially, that Bill gave great power and teeth to the Authority, as I understood it prior to it being brought into the House, and it embodied the ideas that Deputy Wilson had put down.  Since then the Minister has taken the teeth away from it and it has been watered down.  That Act will not be as effective as had been supposed and it will be necessary to review and amend it.  I am sorry that the Minister would not accept many of the amendments that we on this side of the House put down to that Bill because the regulation of traffic in the Dublin area is of great importance for the good running of the city and the environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the past year Irish Shipping are discussed on many occasions.  The whole debacle was a disaster and a sell out of the nation which has caused great embarrassment. It has brought disgrace on us. Not only has our good name in regard to credit and business taken a hammering throughout the world, but the final cost to the Government makes me wonder if the decision to liquidate was wise.  I submit that it was not.  During and following the liquidation, the officers and crews <Col N="1529" /> of the ships were abused all over the world.  The ships should have been brought back to this county prior to the liquidation.  It was inhuman as well as bad judgment to allow our crews to be stranded in areas where they had no protection. This was proved by what happened to them when the ships were impounded.  The blame for this must lie with the Government who made the decision.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the question of providing a strategic shipping fleet.  An opportunity arose for refloating the fleet which had been scuttled when the <i>Irish Spruce</i> was sold at an knockdown price of £3.5 million.  That is a minimal sum and would have been recouped in a very short time.  This is an example of the lack of business acumen prevalent in the present administration.</P>
    <P>The provision of a ferry from Cork has been put into the hands of the local community in the southern region which, along with the south west, has suffered greatly since the ferry went out of existence a number of years ago.  Tourism has been badly hit and there are very few vehicles coming from Britain to the south west region.  We have more continental visitors because that link still exists.  British visitors usually land at Rosslare and travel on the eastern side of the country. The Government should take a more active part in ensuring that a service will be provided in future for the south west region.  It is not good enough to say that a ferry should be provided by local interests as, although the Government promised funds, they did not provide a boat which had belonged to B &amp; I.  The Government should take a more active part in ensuring that there will be a ferry service available next year from Cork to Britain.</P>
    <P>B &amp; I have been restructured, I wish every success to the new management and I hope that their problems have been solved.  I look forward to seeing their accounts over the next couple of years. The new team are able and efficient and if they have luck and nothing goes radically wrong, they will make a success of the company.  Of course some of us expressed reservations regarding the sum of £38 <Col N="1530" /> million given to B &amp; I but I will not cover that ground again.</P>
    <P>Everybody is interested in ICL and perhaps the Minister can enlighten us in regard to their future.  Have B &amp; I shown an interest?  If so, I hope it is for themselves and not for another company.</P>
    <P>In conjunction with the Minister and Deputy Wilson I should like to congratulate Aer Lingus on their 50th anniversary. They have provided a good, friendly and profitable service over the years and have been a good example to other airlines.  I wish them more success in the future because, as was pointed out by the Minister, their profits at present are not sufficient to provide new planes.</P>
    <P>Cork Airport labours under fog for a number of months during the year which has been a disadvantage to its growth.  Of course it should never have been built on that site in the first place but it is there now and we must make the best of it.  I am glad that the Minister and the Government agreed to provide moneys for the installation of a new ILS system at Cork which should make the airport more reliable than in the past.  It should also enable it to increase business and to become more successful.  However, concern has been expressed that passenger traffic through Cork has declined, especially during the March-May.  Some people say that this is due to high fares between Cork and London.  Aer Lingus maintain that their policy is to promote Cork Airport and that they are not downgrading it.  I should like the Minister to reassure us that is the case as such a step would be detrimental to the Cork area.</P>
    <P>The Cork region has been revaged and savaged in recent years by unemployment. The harbour development scheme at Ringaskiddy and the establishment there of a free port has a potential to make a valuable contribution to the industrial development of the southern area especially Cork.  The delay in drafting regulations and in the setting up of the operating company is causing great concern.  Perhaps the Minister would let us know whether it is likely that a decision will be reached in the near future.  It is <Col N="1531" /> important that these two items be dealt with at the earliest date.</P>
    <P>I would like to make one reference to television.  Many areas have no cable television and deflectors are being used to tune into television stations from abroad. This is illegal but it is still going on and it is time that the Minister legalised the whole situation.  It is bad to have an illegal system in operation as it only leads to lack of respect for the law.  Is it the Minister's intention to legalise the use of deflectors? What has the Minister in mind?</P>

      <P>This is a difficult problem.  I fully understand the aspirations of people in remote areas to have access to multichannel television just like the people in major cities and towns, particularly on the east coast.  There are frequency spectrum difficulties which we are looking at and examining thoroughly with a view to finding a solution to this problem.  I cannot encourage or tolerate the illegal use of deflector systems, particularly in areas where there is already a legal franchise for cable television.  This has happened in one or two areas, notably in Cork.  I reiterate to the House that it is my intention to rigorously enforce the law and I very much regret that political figures have got themselves involved in this illegal activity.  On the question of access to multichannel services for people in remote areas, this is receiving very careful examination and we are looking at new possibilities &mdash; for example, the new system being developed in Canada at the moment which might provide a way out of this problem in the future.  However, it is at a very <Col N="1532" /> early stage of development, so we cannot say yet; but we are exploring it.</P>

      <P>I know An Post is not the Minister's area, but he has a responsibility in relation to policy.  An Post are proposing to provide letter boxes for people away from their homes.  I express the concern of the conference of the union involved as to the use of these boxes which would deprive the public, particularly in rural areas, of the services of An Post on a daily basis to their door.</P>

      <P>These matters should be resolved within An Post between management and trade unions.  Certain people do not want to face change or commerciality and conjure up a picture of the postman as some sort of social worker whose job it is to call daily to every house on his rounds.  But the fact is that he does not.  He only calls to those houses for which he has letters.  Very often the most isolated and desolate people in the country are those who never receive any letters.  So this is imagery at its worst.  An Post should do what is commercially right.  We have to acknowledge that our postage rates, even though there has been no increase for four years, are still too high, and we must keep searching for ways of reducing the cost of postage stamps and so on.  I am not aware of any radical change proposed by An Post in this area.  There are suggestions of having pilot schemes in certain areas but what is proposed for these pilot schemes is normal practice in places like Switzerland, Austria, the US and Canada.  I feel it is not right for me to intervene in matters relating to An Post.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank the Deputies who contributed for being so constructive and I will endeavour to answer as many questions as I can.  First, I want to thank Deputy Wilson for his typically constructive contribution and for his very active co-operation in getting much of our legislation through.  Seven transport Bills have gone through this House since the beginning of this year and that would not be possible if we did not have a constructive attitude from the Opposition and I am grateful for it.  I hope the result of all that legislation will greatly improve the environment for transport.</P>
      <P>The point on which Deputy Wilson chose to take issue with me was the question of Irish Shipping.  That is not something that has happened in the last year or is going to happen in the current year; it is not really appropriate to an Estimates debate for this year, although there are residual items to be dealt with as was anticipated at the time of the liquidation. I want to repeat that there was simply no alternative to the course adopted and any Minister or Government in the position we found ourselves in would have had no choice except to do exactly as we did.  To do otherwise would have been a folly inimicable to the overall interests of the public and the taxpayer.  Of course it was a heart-breaking decision and of course there is fall-out as we anticipated at the time, and continuing difficulties to be ironed out.  But it was the only decision possible.  I and the Government have great sympathy with the workers of Irish Shipping.  They little deserved their fate. It is a matter of great regret to me that, try as we did with enthusiasm and effort to find a way of helping out that workforce, no means have been found yet which would not carry with them enormous risks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I fully share the views expressed by Deputy Wilson in relation to a strategic fleet.  For that reason I set up the interdepartmental strategic shipping committee which reported on this.  As I said on opening, it is my hope that the Government will be in a position to decide this matter before too long and <Col N="1534" /> that that decision will be announced in the White Paper on Transport Policy which I expect to be published by the end of the year &mdash; if the decision has not previously been announced.  In respect of the need for a strategic shipping fleet, there is not disagreement between myself and Deputy Wilson.</P>
    <P>Care will have to be applied in setting up a new fleet, so that the next time we do not allow the situation to develop which unfortunately developed and enveloped Irish Shipping Limited.  I would remind the House that the problems which led to the liquidation of Irish Shipping arose many years before I became Minister.  It is true to say that the Department and the Minister of the time were not aware of the decisions taken, nor were the board of Irish Shipping. That in itself is a criticism.  I have sought in my three-and-a-half years to date in this Department to ensure that the State relates to the State companies appropriately and sets up a proper system of control without stifling initiative and imagination in the parent State companies, also trying to bring about competiveness and efficiency in each one.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that for many years the State &mdash; and in this I mean all Governments &mdash; did not properly relate to the State sector.  That sector was often damned by the attitude, or sometimes lack of attitude, of the State and also by the attitude of some of the greatest adherents of the State sector who very often refused to change with the times or see the need for change if the State sector was to survive, because they see change as a bad thing.  Change is often the only means of allowing the particular State enterprise to survive.  It was in that context that I made my opening comments on the speech yesterday by the President of NATE.  The latter was a grossly inaccurate speech and I make no apologies for referring to it an pointing out what has happened since I became Minister.</P>
    <P>I have notes which I will take <i>seriatim,</i> not necessarily following the order in which the questions were raised.  First, Deputy Kelly raised a point in relation to the threatened banning in the post of mail <Col N="1535" /> emanating from white South Africa.  I know the Deputy tried to raise this matter as a Private Notice Question or on the Adjournment in the past few weeks, but this was not allowed.  I understand that he gave the impression that this was because of ministerial resistence.  I know nothing about such resistence and I want to assure the Deputy that I would have been very happy to have dealt with the question if it and been allowed.  I agree very much with the Deputy.  I am one of the strongest opponents in this House of the apartheid system.  That is saying something, because there are many very strong opponents of that system here.  I agree, however, with Deputy Kelly that to start banning literature from any source, whether by individuals or groups, through An Post is a very dangerous precedent.  It is akin to trying to block freedom of expression, which is very basic to any democracy.  No matter how much one disagrees with another's point of view, freedom of expression is essential to democracy.  The suggestion is not right and it should be strongly resisted that any body or any group should feel that they had the right to block the transmission of mail through the post.</P>
    <P>Deputy Leyden raised the question of the Local Radio Bill.  This was discussed across the House at Question Time recently.  I believe that the Local Radio Bill brought to the House is a good Bill which provides for a good regime of local radio.  I am not saying that it is perfect, or that it cannot be improved by amendment; of course it can.  I very much hope that the House will see its way to enacting that Bill in the next session.  I am certainly working towards the goal of trying to persuade the House that that is the right course.</P>
    <P>I am acutely conscious of my duties to the State and the listening audience to regulate the air waves to their advantage. I hope that we can enact three broadcasting measures in the coming session, one being the Local Radio Bill already before the House on Second Stage.  The second is the Broadcasting and Wireless Telegraphy <Col N="1536" /> Bill already circulated in the Seanad and there will be a third Broadcasting (Amendment) Bill dealing with administrative and financial matters, among other things, in RTE arising from the SKC report.  I would be very grateful for an more open and non-party political approach to that Bill, in the name of making progress.</P>
    <P>I want to repeat what I said last week at Question Time: that I will not be rushed or pushed into accepting a regime for radio which I do not believe in and which I do not think will be good.  If the alternative is doing nothing, I would prefer to do nothing, with all the frustration and neglect of duty that that would entail, rather than doing something which would make the position worse.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ahern raised the fares differential between the Cork-London and Dublin-London air routes.  I can appreciate the concern of Cork interests at the existence of such a fares differential.  I had this matter taken up with Aer Lingus, who indicated that the differential is in line with their costs, which are higher on Cork.  I am told that the company have explained the basis for these figures to local Cork interests.  In the circumstances where the yield from the Cork-London route is lower than that from the Dublin-London route because of the lower business content, there does not appear to be any significant basis for securing an across the board reduction in the fare differential between the two routes.  A recent introduction by Aer Lingus of a new £95 Super Apex fare, Dublin-London only, has further widened the fares differential at the lower end of the market.  I am therefore asking the company to consider introducing a similar type low fare on the Cork-London and Shannon-London routes at appropriate levels.</P>
    <P>I compliment Deputy Leyden on his speech, in which he raised the question of direct broadcasting satellites.  The position now is that negotiations have finished with Atlantic Satellites.  An interdepartmental committee are examining the position and a recommendation will be made to me, I understand, in <Col N="1537" /> the coming weeks.  Then the Government should be in a position to make a decision, it is hoped during the course of the summer.  The Deputy also referred to substandard post office premises and I could not agree more with him.  There is provision in the legislation which would allow the Exchequer to provide up to £50 million to An Post.  That is merely an enabling provision.  It is a feature of semi-State company legislation.  It does not mean that the Government are giving the money to them, although An Post have managed to give the impression that it was a promise of £50 million.  That is not so.</P>

    <P>Deputy Leyden mentioned telephone billing.  There is a lot of progress being made in this area.  Telecom Éireann will be spending about £20 million on installing equipment at exchanges over the next year or so to allow for detailed billing on request.  It is a very big price to pay but because of all the complaints about billing over the period it has been decided to instal this equipment.  Over the past number of years we have done extensive tests on billing methods, as distinct from the Billings method.  We have had it investigated by international consultants who are expert in this area.  Our system is as reliable as any other.  Our telephone charges are too high and that is why people complain about their bills.  They <Col N="1538" /> are high because of the huge investment in the telecommunications system over the past number of years.</P>
    <P>Now that the major investment is over it should be possible in the coming years to freeze telephone prices.  Some prices have been brought down this year as I mentioned in my opening speech.  I hope that in future years we will be able to think in terms of reducing telephone charges as An Post moves into profit which I confidently expect them to do in the next year, a couple of years ahead of schedule.  Things are going relatively well in Telecom Éireann.  They have a huge debt.  There is no room for complacency. There is more to be done in terms of the level of connections, the speed of repairs and so on.  Steady progress is being made. Just like our postal charges which have been stabilised for four years, they are still too high.  I hope that they can be reduced.  I am sorry that I have no time to reply to all the points made, but I will undertake to write to Deputies to answer the questions which they raised in the course of the debate.</P>

As the Deputy knows, I am not responsible for ICL.  It is a matter for the liquidator.  The House can be assured that I am keeping a very close interest in the matter.</P>
