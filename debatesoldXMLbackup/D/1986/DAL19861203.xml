      <P>Amendment No. 1, Deputy Wilson.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Will you take the amendment now or do we work through Report Stage and take it under the section?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 10, lines 11 and 12, to delete &ldquo;such period after the end of each accounting year as the Minister may direct&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;four months after the end of each accounting year&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The House will remember that on Committee Stage, I put an amendment down in the exact same place and in almost the same terms.  The amendment I put down was for the words &ldquo;such period after the end of each accounting year as the Minister may direct&rdquo; to be substituted by the words &ldquo;three months after the end of each accounting year&rdquo;.  During the course of discussion on that amendment, the arguments advanced were mainly geared towards the admitted desirability for a transparency of accounts and a desire that the Department of Communications should have, as soon as possible, after the end of the accounting year, a full transparent statement about the accounts for the preceding year.</P>
      <P>The general acceptance of the principle of transparency seemed to indicate a willingness on the part of everybody in the House to have a fixed period for the auditors to come up with reports.  I gather from the Minister's reply that if, instead of three months, we substituted four months, there might be a possibility that he might accept the amendment.  It was that which prompted me to put down this amendment which I hope the Minister will accept.  During the arguments in the House on this matter, it was pointed out that in the case of many semi-State bodies, the accounts came out too late for decision makers to come to conclusions about policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new CIE operation like the old operation is fairly complicated.  In the past it involved a very heavy load of auditing work.  The load will not be lightened because we now have the parent company of CIE and three subsidiaries, despite our efforts to make it two.  It was argued that perhaps we are making too <Col N="1095" /> much of a demand on the auditors in asking them to have these accounts ready three months after the end of the audit year.  To give them another month we substituted four for three.  Deputy Ahern made the point strongly, and he knows what he is talking about because he is a qualified accountant, that it should be possible to have the audited accounts within three months.  If it is possible within three months, it is possible within four months.  Nowadays, with the availability of computer technology which speeds up this process for auditors, this should be possible and that is why we are putting down this amendment.  I strongly urge the Minister to accept this amendment which will satisfy the desire of the House for information on the activities of this very important company as quickly as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very specific issue.  The amendment seeks to delete &ldquo;such period after the end of each accounting year as the Minister may direct&rdquo; and to substitute &ldquo;four months ...&rdquo; It is taking discretion from the Minister and making it mandatory on the company to produce an audited account. That is all that is at issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>From my experience in the Department of Communications, I know there is a lack of control and accountability in CIE in relation to the Department of Communications.  As a result of this amendment, I hope there will be more accountability from CIE within the Department.  There was a total breakdown of accountability for the <Col N="1096" /> activities of CIE by the management under Liam St. John Devlin and the Department of Communications as they were in 1982.  We tried to rectify that.  In the bus company at Shannon, for instance, in relation to engines that were provided there, I have a long file on the lack of communication between the Department and CIE.  Decisions were made and reversed by CIE, without any consultation with the Department, who were in charge of CIE at the time.</P>
      <P>The amendment put forward by Deputy Wilson should be accepted by the Minister. The amendment confirms my fears about the lack of accountability.  I have always found the Minister more than agreeable in relation to amendments.  In the debate on the Postal and Telecommunications Bill, the Minister agreed to put in amendments at my request and later deleted them because of union pressure at the time.  Deputy Wilson has vast experience in this ministry and in other ministries and the Minister should accept his amendment and put in the four months provision.</P>
      <P>The Bill as it is, is very loose, and a four-month provision here will be of great assistance to us, when Fianna Fáil return to office.  There will be a very busy legislative programme and we may not have the opportunity to put forward amendments to Bills.  Therefore, amendments to this Bill should be inserted now instead of waiting until 1987 when we will have a difficult time in Government.  We may not have the opportunity to go back over legislation in relation to certain Bills and that is why the Minister should facilitate our spokesperson on Communications. Accountability is very important and I have grave reservations in relation to the management of CIE over the years.  The Department did not exercise enough control and this legislation may give them a far more positive involvement in the control of CIE.  The most important amendment to the Bill is the proposal by our party to &mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister stated that he was in favour of tightening up the <Col N="1098" /> reporting date and suggested a period of four months.  Auditors and accountants would be capable of doing the work within the time limit but to place it before the board and so on within three months might be hard to achieve.  I am sure the Minister will accept this amendment as he is aware of the necessity for information, such as that contained in the accounts, being made available as quickly as possible to the Minister.  In many cases semi-State companies and others will not complete accounts on time unless there is a specific deadline set for them.  That is why there is a necessity to have a deadline set in the Bill.  I strongly urge the Minister to accept Deputy Wilson's amendment because it would ensure that information is available on a certain date.  There is nothing like the hangman's noose for concentrating the mind although I am not suggesting that anything in the Bill will be a hangman's noose in relation to auditors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Minister for Communications (Mr. J. Mitchell) Jim Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Communications (Mr. J. Mitchell)</NameTxt>
      <P>We discussed this matter on Committee Stage and I have some sympathy with the intent of the amendment. Regrettably, for reasons I will now explain, I am unable to accept it.  On Committee Stage an amendment put forward by Deputy Wilson specifying a three months limit on the submission of accounts was rejected.  As I explained on that occasion, I am in full sympathy with the idea of having the accounts of State bodies published as soon as possible after the end of the financial year and I have pushed State companies in that direction. My reasons for resisting that amendment were threefold.  In the first instance, there is a need to take account of the results achieved by persuasion, secondly, a deadline in an Act of the Oireachtas can only be changed by new legislation and, thirdly, where the deadline could not be respected, for example, in a strike at the printers or if the auditors could not complete their work by the deadline, there would be an infringement of the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The subsection of the Bill, as drafted, allows for the imposition of a specific time limit on a flexible basis.  I included that provision because I intend to revoke <Col N="1099" /> it if the need arises.  Following the debate in the House last week, I looked at the issue again and, as a result, I wish to mention a few additional points.  Under section 148 of the Companies Act, 1963, every company is obliged to lay before the annual general meeting of the company the accounts and balance sheet within nine months of the end of the financial year.  As the accounts must be ready at least 21 days before the annual general meeting takes place, for sending to members with notice of the AGM this effectively reduces the period for producing the accounts to close to eight months.</P>
    <P>There is also a requirement for the directors' report and the accounts to be prepared for transmission with the accounts.  This effectively further shortens the period available for the finalisation of the accounts.  The Companies (Amendment) Act, 1986, which was enacted to implement the Fourth EC Directive on company law contains far reaching requirements relating to the format of accounts, the information to be included in directors' reports and information on associated companies.  In the case of good accounts, neither the Act nor the four directives envisage as strict a deadline as that proposed in the amendment. In the circumstances, the insertion of a deadline in the Bill would amend the Companies Act as it applies to CIE.  This could amount to a form of discrimination against CIE who would have to conform to a requirement not generally applicable. The insertion of too tight a deadline could increase the cost of auditing as the auditors would probably require additional staff to meet the deadline.</P>
    <P>For all the reasons I have given, I am convinced that the balance of advantage lies in achieving progress on a more flexible basis than that envisaged in the amendment.  The specifying of a deadline on the basis of a direction, as provided for in the Bill, is a much more suitable approach to the issue.  This facilitates the setting of deadlines on an experimental <Col N="1100" /> basis initially.  Even though I sympathise with the motivation behind Deputy Wilson's amendment, I regret that I am unable to accept it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>My first reaction to the Minister's remarks is one of disappointment. I interpreted the fact that the Minister did not get in touch with me as meaning he wanted to give the House a pleasant surprise by accepting the amendment.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned flexibility. The weakness I see in the present system is that it is too flexible.  Nine months of a gestation period for auditing accounts seems to be an extraordinary long time. It seems to frustrate and nullify the value of producing accounts as aids to decision making.  Remember that I am talking in the context of £115 million being provided by the taxpayer last year through the agency of this House for this company. For that reason we should have this type of information as soon as possible in the year following the end of the financial year of that company.</P>
      <P>At a meeting of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Public Expenditure, of which I am a member, the problems regarding the delay in auditing came up. I made inquiries regarding local government audits and some of them are years behind.  I do not know whether the Minister's reference to a nine month period refers only to companies but right across the public sector we should tighten up the period of delay.  I have no doubt at all about that and it was for that reason I put down this amendment.  Flexibility is what the Minister mentioned, my thesis is that we have too much flexibility.  We were waiting for a report from another semi-State the B &amp; I, until we were practically blue in the face.  I have an idea that they may have contravened the particular Act the Minister mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Ahern made the point that talking about the Companies Act, 1963 is like talking about the weapons used by Brian Boru at the battle of Clontarf as a way of conducting warfare.  The fact of the matter is that since then there have <Col N="1101" /> been so many developments in aids for the accounting and auditing profession that the argument does not hold water. The Minister said it was dangerous to set a deadline, my contention is that it is dangerous not to set a deadline.  As Deputy Ahern said, nothing concentrates the mind like hanging.  If a firm of auditors know they have to have the accounts ready by a specific time, that deadline will be met.  At one of the meetings of the committee on public expenditure I put that question to somebody who is familiar with the auditing system in the United States where a huge pile of work hits the auditors each year at the same time.  I asked him if this did not mean that there was a very serious logjam at that time and his answer was &ldquo;no&rdquo;, they simply worked their ears off for that period.  This means of course that there will be a slacking off at other times of the year but simply if it means working 24 hours a day to present the accounts that is the system that obtains.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, the thrust of this amendment is to provide information for policy makers.  Take, for example, something that Deputy Leyden mentioned. Apart from mentioning other very important things, he mentioned the bus company at Shannon.  If the Government want to make a decision based on the audited facts they should not have to wait nine months for information from a manufacturer who is living from week to week not knowing what the future is.  The only point I can make about it is that it is Stone Age administration.</P>
    <P>In normal circumstances the Government Estimates are put together at the end of the preceding year.  We do not know what is going on at present.  We are living in Tir na nÓg so far as that is concerned.  The Minister for Finance told us we were going to have them in September. He was like Savonarola, a great reformer of a few years ago.  At present we are waiting for the 1987 Estimates.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in time for people to have a look at what is going to happen in 1987.  Each prays to his own particular God at this stage.  We in this House are going to provide a substantial sum of money.  What we are talking of here is a substantial sum of money in any man's language.  One can bandy figures about in regard to real and apparent money until the cows come home but £115 million had to be provided by this House for this company in 1985.  The Government are putting their Book of Estimates together. In a sense it is unfortunate that CIE's financial year corresponds with the financial year of the Government.  In other words, it ends on 31 December. Even at the best of times and with audited accounts available at three months, as I suggested originally or four months as I am suggesting now, mainly because of a hint I picked up from what the Minister said on Committee Stage, there is still a certain amount of blind man's buff about the Book of Estimates.  In other words, there is a good bit of guesswork about the Book of Estimates.</P>
      <P>What is to be the position if the auditors are to be allowed to meander on through the spring and the summer and until the leaves begin to fall before we have audited accounts for the previous year?  In those circumstances the case that we on this side of the House are putting is eminently reasonable.  I cannot but record my disappointment that the Minister did not accept this which seemed to me in my foolishness to be totally in keeping with the Minister's own view.  I am convinced that that is the Minister's own view.  I am convinced also that what Deputy Leyden said is correct, that the Minister does not have a closed mind.  He went back to the Department.  Wise men had a look at the proposal.</P>

      <P>Heuston Station was phoned.  The Deputy took my line.  They began to say: &ldquo;We do not know.  They are putting a straitjacket on us.  We would like to be able to meander on through the spring and summer and wait for the fall of the leaf.  You are going to make it difficult for us if you do not allow that.&rdquo; As a former Minister, I know that this kind of gentle pressure can be applied. The Minister succumbed to it.  I regret that because his heart is in the right place but he did not allow either his heart or his head to speak for him on this amendment. All I can do from this side of the House is once again to make a strong appeal to the Minister to make history for himself by rejecting the suggestion from Heuston Station, by rejecting the suggestion from Kildare Street and in one strong decision indicating to this side of the House that he is accepting this stricture with regard to time for auditing accounts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1104" /> The Minister made one point with regard to the printers' strike.  There is a printing works in my constituency and I am making an offer to the Minister on their behalf that if he runs into trouble with the Government printers or with the printing establishment in the city of Dublin we will make facilities available to him for a consideration &mdash; in Cavan we have a reputation for having hard heads &mdash; and see that the printing is done. I am sure I can speak for many Deputies on this side of the House and on the Minister's side who know of efficient, modern, up-to-date printing establishments which will see to it that a Minister of State is not let down by being put into a position where he is breaking the law or the company is breaking the law with regard to the provision of the audited accounts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I should like to express my gratitude to Deputy Wilson and the other Members of the House for their contributions on this Bill.  I believe we have done a very significant job in bringing this Bill to enactment.  I should like to reiterate that the purpose of the Bill is to provide for the future of CIE and each of that company's component parts.  A very significant improvement has been brought about in CIE in the past four years.  I believe the reorganised CIE will be leaner and fitter, better shaped to serve the public whom they are there to serve.  It is my hope that the new companies will provide a completely new environment for the workforce of CIE and for the travelling public.  The end result.  I hope, will be a lesser demand and a consistently reducing demand on the public Exchequer from CIE, in line with what has happened in the past four years.  Secondly, I hope we will have even <Col N="1107" /> more efficient and friendly public transport services and, thirdly, that in due course we will have cheaper public transport services.</P>
      <P>These three aims are not unambitious, but they are achievable.  I am encouraged &mdash; and everybody else should be &mdash; in our confidence that those objectives will be achieved by what has already happened in the past four years.  I repeat that from 1969 to 1982 the CIE deficit escalated from £3.5 million to £109.2 million &mdash; seven times the rate of inflation.  If that trend had continued since 1982, where the deficit went up by a multiple of the rate of inflation, we would now be dealing with a deficit nearly twice what it now is.  That is what has been achieved in the past four years and it has been achieved without massive redundancies or massive cuts in services. The new trend has been one of reducing deficits in real terms, a very substantial achievement.</P>
      <P>I want to congratulate again the chairman, the board, the management and the workforce of CIE, who deserve to be recognised for what has been achieved.  I wish them well in the future.  I believe the legislation we have enacted has set the scene for a more vibrant and successful CIE in the future.</P>

      <P>Is mian liom cúpla focal a rá mar gheall ar an mBille atá comhair do bheith ina Acht.  Mar a dúirt an tAire bomaité ó shin is mian linn go mbeadh córas iompair againn a bheas éifeachtach agus níos saoire amach anseo.</P>
      <P>Tá a fhios againn sa Teach seo go bhfuil costas fuinnimh i bhfad níos lú i mbliana ná mar a bhí sé fiú amháin bliain ó shin agus i bhfad níos saoire ná mar a bhí sé nuair a bhí mise ag gniomhú mar Aire Iompair.  Is cuimhin liom gur chosnaigh i 1981 bairille ámh ola, crude oil, thart faoi $39½ an bairille.  Anois an mhí seo, cosnaíonn sé $14, trian den chostas ar ámh ola anois i gcomparáid leis an gcostas i 1982.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tugann sé sin an cúnamh don chóras agus do na comhlachtaí nua.  Aontaím leis an rud a dúirt an tAire go bhfuil moladh tuillte ag CIE mar go bhfuil sé ag déanamh <Col N="1108" /> iarracht an comhlacht a dhéanamh níos éifeachtaí agus chun seirbhisí nua fiúntacha a chur ar fáil do na cathróirí sa chathair agus faoin dtuaith.</P>
    <P>Ar an Dara Céim chuir mise an-bhéim ar fad ar fhiúntas na foirne.  Do luaigh mé an Dr. Tod Andrews a bhí i gceannas ar CIE ar feadh tamaill, go ndúirt sé gurb é an rud is tábhtachtaí ar fad i gCóras Iompair Éireann ná an gaol idir an bhainistíocht agus na gnáth oibrithe sa chóras sin agus aontaím leis.  Dá bhrí sin, is é mo thuairim go bhfuil alt 14 den Bhille seo ana-thábhachtach.  Nuair a bhíomar ag caint ar an gceist dúramar gur chóir béim do chur ar an alt seo.  I rith na díospóir-eachta sin, luaigh mise cás na n-innealltóirí i Sraith an Iarthair i staisiún an Phiarsaigh, is é sin, de réir mar a chuala mise &mdash; ní raibh mé ag caint leis an bpríomh innealtóir é féin &mdash; bhí CIE ag iarraidh ar oibrithe ansin athrú ón áit sin go dtí an North Wall.  Ní cóir iachall a chur orthu siúd é sin a dhéanamh gan an rud a bheith cíoraithe i gceart, gan díospóireacht a bheith ann idir na hoibrithe agus an bord.</P>
    <P>Tá súil agam nach bhfuil sé ar intinn ag an mbord rudaí den tsórt sin a dhéanamh idir an dá linn an fhad is a bheidh na trí comhlachtaí nua agus an bord ag dul i mbun oibre ar dtús, mar ní dóigh liom go mbeadh tosnú den tsórt sin ar mhaithe le CIE.</P>

Tá súil agam go n-éireoidh go geal le CIE, idir CIE féin agus na trí comhlachtaí.  Tá súil agam go ndéanfaidh an tAire stuidéar níos doimhne anois ar ainmneacha na gcomhlachtaí.  Dúirt sé go raibh se réidh é sin a dhéanamh agus go nglacfadh sé le hainmeacha dos na comhlachtaí nua, ainmneacha a bheadh níos oiriúnaí ná na cinn atá sa Bhille agus tá cumhacht aige sa Bhille é sin a dhéanamh.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the terms of the Memorandum of Understanding, on the establishment of a Secretariat for EUREKA, copies of which were laid before Dáil Éireann on 28th November, 1986.</P>
      <P>EUREKA is an association of Western European countries involved in international collaboration in the area of research and technology.  It was established by a Conference of Ministers of 17 countries, including Ireland, and members of the Commission of the European Communities, meeting in Paris on 17 July 1985.  These countries comprised the 12 EC member countries plus Austria, Finland, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland.  Since the meeting in Paris, Turkey and Iceland have been accepted as additional member countries.</P>
      <P>The objective of EUREKA is to raise the productivity and competitiveness of Europe's industries and their national economies on the world market.  This is to be done through closer co-operation among enterprises and research institutes in the field of advanced technologies.  The rationale behind this is to strengthen the basis for lasting prosperity and employment in Europe being faced with competition from the USA and Japan in the technology area.  At a meeting in Hanover on 5 and 6 November 1985 the Ministers of the 18 countries at that stage &mdash; Turkey having joined &mdash; and a member of the Commission of the European Communities approved a Declaration of Principles which would form the guidelines under which EUREKA would work.  The Declaration of Principles adopted at Hanover establishes the guidelines for the operation of EUREKA.  It does not involve the making of payments outside the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Ministers agreed at Hanover that a small flexible secretariat under the responsibility of the EUREKA Conference <Col N="1111" /> of Ministers would be established to enhance the transparency and efficiency of EUREKA.  The establishment of such a secretariat is in the interests of smaller countries like ours without which there is a danger that we would lose the opportunity to become involved in many of the research projects. If you like, the secretariat would be involved partly in a broking activity which would be of particular interest to smaller countries and those with smaller and medium-sized industries.  The main tasks of the secretariat would be to collect and disseminate information, thus offering the services of a clearing house; to assist enterprises and institutes in establishing contacts with partners for EUREKA projects: to give support to meetings of the Conference of Ministers and of the higher representatives &mdash; senior officials in the member countries &mdash; and to provide for continuity in the tasks to be performed.</P>
    <P>The secretariat comprises seven professional staff, one of whom has been designated head of the secretariat, and up to six secretarial and clerical support staff.  The professional staff, excluding the Head, will consist of three nationals of different EC member states, two nationals of non-EC member countries and one person from the EC Commission. Support staff will be nationals of any EUREKA country.  The professional staff will each serve for a minimum of two years or for a maximum of three years, at the discretion of the group of higher representatives.</P>
    <P>The professional staff posts will rotate between EUREKA countries in such a way that within a maximum period of nine years, all countries will have an opportunity to fill a post.  All professional staff will be nominated by the Governments of the EUREKA countries concerned or by the European Commission, after consultation with the head of the secretariat to ensure the appropriate range of skills necessary to the functioning of the secretariat.  It has now been agreed that for the first three years the head of secretariat will be a French <Col N="1112" /> national, and the other professionals will comprise Spanish, Dutch and Swiss nationals.</P>
    <P>The cost of the secretariat will be met as follows: all costs of professional staff &mdash; including salaries, pensions, expatriation and post-adjustment allowances, accommodation, travel on home leave &mdash; will be borne by the EUREKA member nominating each staff member.  Office costs &mdash; including rent, utilities, initial office equipment &mdash; will be borne by the country in which the secretariat is located.  All other costs &mdash; including the costs of support staff, travel by all staff on secretariat business, telephone and telex charges, office equipment after the initial stage, installation and the running of a computerised data base &mdash; will be borne by the EUREKA Governments and the Commission of the European Communities which for this purpose, is treated as another member state.  In that context Ireland's share will be about three-quarters of 1 per cent and, in the first full year of operation, 1987, we expect that to amount to approximately £12,000 or £13,000.</P>
    <P>A memorandum of understanding concerning these various matters in relation to the secretariat was agreed by the Conference of Ministers which was held on 30 June 1986.  The memorandum of understanding was signed by 18 of the 19 participating countries &mdash; Iceland having joined at that stage &mdash; and by the Commission of the European Communities. Ireland was not at that time in a position to sign.  The text of the memorandum appears to impose binding obligations including financial obligations on the State.  These obligations relate to the costs, other than costs of professional staff and office costs which, as I have described, are to be borne by the EUREKA Governments and the Commission of the European Communities. Because these other costs will involve payments outside the State and will be a charge on public funds it is necessary, in accordance with Article 29.5 of the Constitution to seek the prior approval of the Dáil for the terms of the memorandum of understanding.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1113" /> I commend this motion for the approval of the House.</P>

      <P>Níl deacracht ar bith agam cuidiú leis an rún atá molta ag an Aire Stáit.  Tugann sé an-seans dúinn leathnú a dhéanamh ar an tionscal teicniúil atá sa tír seo cheana.</P>
      <P>The establishment of a EUREKA Secretariat in Brussels hopefully will accelerate the organisation and co-ordination of research and development activities between European countries.  I am aware that negotiations took place between the member states as to where the centre of activity would be located.  Whilst we in Ireland should not be holding second place to anybody, I suppose that for practical purposes the secretariat will be set up somewhere in Europe other than here.</P>
      <P>I am aware also of the discussions that took place and the pressures that were being applied, particularly by the three larger member states, France, the Federal Republic of Germany and Belgium for its establishment in Brussels.  It eventually transpired that agreement was reached and that the secretariat will be located in Brussels.</P>
      <P>The provision for a review of the functioning of the secretariat after two and a half years will afford an opportunity to revise its operations, that is, if any such revision is deemed to be necessary.  That is a welcome clause.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The launching of the EUREKA initiative by France in April 1985 and its rapid development at two ministerial conferences, the one in Paris in July 1985 and, as the Minister of State said, the other in Hanover in November 1985, underlines the urgency many European countries attach to the priority of co-operation in the field of research and development. This is an area in which Europe lags behind both the USA and Japan.  In the future economic progress in Europe depends on concentrating on developing our technological capacity.  EUREKA is an association of western European countries and as already mentioned by the Minister, the European Commission.  It is good to see countries such as Austria, <Col N="1114" /> Finland, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey and Ireland showing an interest and becoming involved in this European structure.</P>
    <P>During negotiations on the basic structure of the project, it emerged that EUREKA will be a very loosely structured entity whose function will be to coordinate research and development activities of the private sector in the area of high technology.  It seems that with the emphasis on high technology, it is likely EUREKA will be dominated by the larger States and the firms who have the requisite resources and expertise.  I want to emphasise that in some of our activities in the European Community we have been too weak in negotiating matters on behalf of this country.  Some Ministers have adopted an attitude that I hope will not be continued in our representation in EUREKA.  During the negotiations, the smaller States including Ireland, were successful in providing for the participation of small and medium sized firms in EUREKA projects.  That offers scope for involvement in Irish firms.  It is particularly important given the need to boost the technology base for small and medium sized companies in our economy. It is absolutely essential that we combine with the smaller nations and stand against the bigger nations.</P>
    <P>It is clear that expertise in specific areas such as ordination and bio-technology needs to be increased.  If we do not concentrate on building up an adequate local base of expertise we will fail to attract multinational companies to this country and to adequately assist indigenous companies. It is necessary to emphasise again our success in attracting computer firms and high technology firms to Ireland during the years.  The setting up of EUREKA gives us an opportunity to build on that foundation.  In that regard we must help to boil down mundane measures such as upgrading and replacing obsolete equipment in our research laboratories. The Government must ensure as a corollary to the expenditure on higher education that spending on research and development facilities in our <Col N="1115" /> universities and research institutions be increased in priority areas.</P>
    <P>It is clear that if we are to plan for the long term development of our native electronic and computer industries in the short term we shall have to increase investment in research and development. I take this opportunity to ask the Government to sanction the £5 million expansion plan for our national micro-electronics research centre located in Cork.  We now have an opportunity of indicating our sincerity and our commitment to research and development in the field of high technology and we should immediately sanction what is already approved by the educational authorities and the various boards.</P>
    <P>Electronics, as we all know, account for a significant proportion of our exports.  In 1985 some 95 per cent of the output of the industry amounted to £3 billion in exports.  The sector continues to be dominated by foreign companies of which there are 300 compared with about 50 Irish companies.  We must concentrate on building up indigenous electronics firms.  The proportion of imported components is unacceptably high at 80 per cent.  We should redouble our efforts to produce these components at home and to service the manufacturing side of our electronics industry.  We are losing tremendously by not doing so.  It is an infant industry compared with the standards in other countries and we should give all the assistance and encouragement possible to produce the components that are at present being imported.</P>
    <P>It is not accidental that countries, such as Japan, the USA and Switzerland, who have consistently ploughed resources into research have higher levels of employment than their competitors in the EC. Unemployment is one of the major national crises in this country at present. We have an opportunity to make in-roads into that national problem by taking every advantage of the micro-electronics and computer industries.</P>

      <P>It is all connected with the establishment of the secretariat per EUREKA.  I am outlining how we should endeavour to take all the advantages available to us.  I am dealing with unemployment and it is extraordinary to be interrupted &mdash; I know the Ceann Comhairle has a job to do &mdash; on a matter of such national importance.  Technology-based industry will be vital in tackling our employment problem.  It is very worrying that despite generous State grants and incentives, the level of research and development carried out by industry is so low.  Irish investors need to concentrate more on investment in research and development if Ireland is to develop a strong indigenous industrial sector.  In 1985 the international programme of the National Board for Science and Technology secured £13 million of EC funding for research contracts.  In fact, Community funds now account for a significant portion of the total spending on R and D in Ireland.  Private Irish resources must be tapped if we are to strengthen the Irish research effort in line with Irish needs.  I should like to emphasise Irish needs within this new secretariat for the development of high-tech.  Indeed, Irish investors should be focusing much more on the development potential of the work carried out by Irish high-tech researchers.  The quality of Irish proposals under the various EC programmes was evident in the very high success rate achieved and revealed in the NBST report for 1985.  The opportunity is there for us.</P>
      <P>We should grasp it, work on it and develop it.  There were 215 Irish applications, 13 R and D and demonstration programmes, and 70, or 32 per cent of applicants were awarded contracts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the energy programme the Irish success rate was twice the average in the ESPRIT.  In the information technology programme the Irish success rate was 60 <Col N="1117" /> per cent compared with 25 per cent for other countries.  It is clear, therefore, that the high quality of the research carried out by Irish researchers deserves much more attention from Irish investors seeking long term investment opportunities. I am of the opinion that with all the State and semi-State bodies we have, those layers of bureaucracy &mdash; I accept that there is a Bill before the House to deal with some aspects of that multiplicity of activity &mdash; we are not making advances. We do not have a Minister or a Department to tie all the fragments together. The more we examine this matter the more it becomes abundantly clear that we have the ability and the qualified people to make advances but we prefer to see them leaving Ireland than employing them here to develop our own economy. It is a shame for any Government to allow that to continue.  I hope that what Members say in regard to this motion will be noted and acted on.  It is obvious that the country has a great potential.  We must take advantage of our expertise if we are to be serious about the trend that has been current in regard to unemployment.</P>
    <P>We have many people qualified from third level institutions ready for the Government to create the climate that will give them jobs.  At the level of the European Community while initiatives such as EUREKA are to be welcomed much more needs to be done.  The Community, it must be acknowledged, has undertaken a very wide ranging programme to foster European technological development and promote a European technological community. However, much more needs to be done to narrow the gap between Europe and her competitors.  The signs of weakness in Europe's technological capacity are clearly evident.  In that regard I should like to mention the successes in the US, Japan and Switzerland.  Since 1982 the annual growth in real terms in the production of high-tech goods in Europe has not exceeded 5 per cent while the rate in the US has been 7.6 per cent and in Japan it has been 14 per cent.  I am sure nobody in Ireland is waiting for the introduction <Col N="1118" /> of this motion to be told about the growth in Japan.  We have seen evidence of that in the past two decades.  The trade balance in Europe for output with high-technological content has been zero, or near zero, since 1979.  Yet in 1963 it was in surplus to the extent of about 3 per cent of GNP.</P>
    <P>Europe's performance in relation to information technology is poor.  In 1984 our trade deficit in the electronics sector was over £9 million and in 1985 it was estimated at £12 million.  That poor performance was logged in what is already one of the most important world industries which by 1990 is projected to be the most important manufacturing industry in the world.  It is clear that Europe's technological capacity will be improved when the Community enjoys one unified internal market.  It will be able to compete with the markets of the US and Japan and will replace the present fragmented market in the Community.  It is also clear that Europe needs to learn from the example of the US where venture capital is readily available for new high-tech business.  In Europe we have not concentrated on the investment needs of small innovative firms.  On the domestic front the need for that has been established and, if confirmation is needed, it can be obtained in the most recent ESRI report issued last night. According to that, the lack of investment there has had serious adverse effects on our economy.  The boom Ministers have spoken of so often has not materialised. We were told that a boom in consumer spending was around the corner and that, as we were told yesterday, consumer spending had increased by 2.5 per cent but the ESRI report contradicts that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>I am dealing with EUREKA and the need to expand our resources and technological abilities here.  While it remains to be seen how the EUREKA programme works out in practice, it is clear that a number of Irish <Col N="1119" /> companies have already committed themselves to EUREKA projects.  I should like to see a greater response from Irish industry to EUREKA in conjunction with foreign countries in deference to the need to boost our research and development capacity.  If those Irish firms are to become more involved in projects under EUREKA, it is only reasonable to expect that they will have the full support and confidence of the Government of the day.  It is difficult to expect Irish companies to be out in the forefront at a time when there is such a lack of confidence.  Some change will have to take place to restore this.  &ldquo;Más maith, is mithid&rdquo;, as I said earlier.</P>
      <P>There has been speculation about the possibility of a relationship between EUREKA and the American Defence Initiative, SDI &mdash;&ldquo;Star Wars&rdquo; as it is more commonly known.  It is up to the Minister of State whether he will refer to that matter.  We hope economic development and expansion will arise for us and for the other EC member states from EUREKA, but any connection with military activities or anything related to them must be given the serious consideration it deserves by Ireland.  We do not want to have hand, act, truck or dealing with military activities as a member of EUREKA any more than we do in the broader European Community. EUREKA is concerned to boost civil research activities in the EC and any indication that it will become involved with the US &ldquo;Star Wars&rdquo; must be resisted immediately.</P>
      <P>From our perspective, the two initiatives, military and civil, are not linked and we should not permit them to be linked. I pointed out earlier that it is glaringly obvious that Europe has fallen behind the two most successful economies, the US and Japan, in the matter of technological development.  With the concentration of massive resources aimed at boosting the US research effort, not purely the military aspect&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>I have put my concern on record.  It has been mentioned that there is a possibility of these matters being discussed in future in EUREKA and I want to make it abundantly clear that Ireland and its representatives in EUREKA must resist any military aspects of development in technology.  It is feared that Europe may fall even further behind in technological development. These considerations have motivated the EUREKA initiative and led to the proposed intensification of existing EC research efforts through the Framework Programme, 1987-1991.</P>
      <P>I welcome the EUREKA initiative. The Minister of State cited some of the memoranda which, he said, were laid before the Dáil.  I will make a few references to one document, paragraph 4 of which proposes that the secretariat will assist enterprises and institutions in establishing contact with potential partners for EUREKA projects and provide them with information derived from the data created by the secretariat to the extent that resources permit.  I said earlier that there is a danger smaller nations may be left behind or gobbled up and, because of the base we have in Ireland, it is important that all information to be derived and accumulated by our potential partners in EUREKA will be sought and made available to us as an equal member.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Paragraph 6 of the document states that the secretariat initially will consist of six professional staff and up to six <Col N="1121" /> secretarial and support staff.  The Minister of State indicated &mdash; it is in paragraph 11 &mdash; that each country through rotation of staff will have had an opportunity over nine years to fill a post on the secretariat.  I would not place much emphasis on that because it is only there as a safety measure, but paragraph 7 of the same document states:</P>
    <P>Six professional staff being at the head of the Secretariat will consist of three nationals of different member states of the EC, two nationals of different countries among the non-EC members of EUREKA and one person from the Commission of the European countries.</P>
    <P>Because of Ireland's success to date in the electronic field, we should make every effort to be in there with a representative from the very beginning and not wait for between five and nine years.  Why not have our representative there from the start to fight our corner?  The professional staff will be nominated by the participating Governments and it is indicated that there will be consultation with the heads of the secretariat to ensure that those nominated will provide the secretariat with an appropriate range of skills.  We have people qualified to represent us and contribute to what the secretariat is suggesting.  The grading of posts, the nationality of staff to be appointed initially and subsequently, will be approved by the group of higher representatives. If we do not have a member in this group we will be at a disadvantage in achieving posts in the secretariat.  We are well qualified and second to none of these countries.  We should be in there as fully qualified members of this sector.</P>
    <P>The reference to terms and conditions of employment in the memorandum are not detailed enough for me to make an observation on it.  The cost of professional staff will be borne by the member nominating staff members.  I find no difficulty with that.  The Minister made reference to the terms and conditions applicable to staff, including the two and a half years and it is only proper that <Col N="1122" /> these should form part of any such agreement or any such bringing together of nations.  I also see that the terms of the memorandum may be amended if the signatories so decide subsequently.</P>
    <P>The setting up of EUREKA and our membership of it is welcome.  I would strongly emphasise that we should be full members of EUREKA which is being set up to promote areas of high technology and micro-electronic activity of which we already have a good deal here.  We are a small nation and the small nations had to meet separately because the three larger ones, the Federal Republic of Germany, France and Britain, seemed to be dominating what direction this body would take and laying down the ground rules. I am pleased that smaller nations like ourselves have more or less challenged that aspect.  We acknowledge that these are larger countries and we acknowledge their greater wealth but we must be in there as equal partners.  At times I have seen representatives of this country in Europe, particularly in the Commission and in the Council of Ministers, almost apologising for being Irish.  I hope that that attitude will not persist into this organisation.  I must also say that nobody owes us a living.  We must make it ourselves and here is another opportunity, so let us grasp it because it is so important in the age in which we live, an age of change in technology.  We must be part of it.  We are getting the opportunity and we should grasp it with both hands and work diligently, in co-operation with the other members, to ensure the success of EUREKA economically and in the development of technology.</P>
    <P>We must resist becoming involved with Star Wars or any other military activity. Because of the special position that this country has and because of the presence of another member state on this island we cannot be involved militarily or be seen to be so.  Any suggestion of military alignment or military activity is out of the question.  The development of technology in the secretariat of EUREKA is not to be co-ordinated in any military direction until such time as we in this country would be able to take a different <Col N="1123" /> approach on any military activity.  We have a position in this country that we hold very dear and I hope that EUREKA will not in any way undermine that position. I refer to our neutral stance and our non-alignment with military organisations. I do not want to see EUREKA being the cause of our contravening that position.  Other non-aligned countries have also joined EUREKA.  I will refrain from mentioning our reasons because very soon I will have the opportunity to expand on that aspect when we discuss the Single European Act.</P>
    <P>Our involvement with EUREKA is for the development of micro-electronic technology and computer technology so that we can compete with other nations of Europe in the development of this technology, with the Japanese and with the Americans.  We need this coming together of the European countries.  I am pleased that it has happened.  We want to be able to use our membership of this body for the development of that industry here.  I have outlined that already.  Anything I say now would probably be repetitive, but I must emphasise that it is an economic community we became part of and that this development is for the expansion of that community.  I suppose I can conclude on the basis of a seanfocail we have sa Ghaeilge: Ní neart go cur le chéile.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to delay unduly the passage of this measure, but it affords an opportunity to put on record the necessity to be involved in the development of science and technology and related research activities over the coming years.  At the outset let me compliment some people who have been involved in the research area for some time and who have done some magnificent research in this area.  The National Board for Science and Technology have made a major contribution and within the limited financial resources at their disposal have been to the forefront of research and development here for some time.  Let me take the opportunity <Col N="1124" /> to press on the Minister and the Government the desirability of increasing substantially the funding available to agencies like the NBST to help them to undertake the enormous amount of research that needs to be done in a variety of areas and not least in marine-related activities and developments which have been sadly neglected and which have a huge potential relatively unexploited.  At present within the limits of the financial constraints on the NBST, we cannot operate even the one research vessel we have dealing with marine activities and marine research.</P>
      <P>It is well recognised that some of the major impediments to the development of industry, to the creation of employment and the development of enterprises over the coming years will be the rapidly changing technological advances which have been made and the difficulty of keeping skilled people capable of dealing and working effectively in this area.  Two major problems will hamper development in this area.  The first is to keep abreast with the developments taking place; technological changes are advancing at such a rapid pace it will be a major challenge to keep abreast of those changes.  Secondly, it will be an enormous challenge to our colleges and institutions to provide the highly skilled personnel who would be essential to be involved in this advancing technological and scientific area which is changing rapidly and where the scientific information and technological changes have overtaken themselves almost on a daily basis.  For this reason any involvement in that area will be beneficial to us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Lyons we are not becoming involved here in the Star Wars technology we see taking place in other countries at present.  We are speaking here about becoming involved in areas of research and technology, of having the basic skills and expertise here, keeping abreast of modern developments and being able to utilise them to the benefit of industry here.  This will allow us to become competitive in industry, agriculture, in fishing and in forestry and will enable us to embark on the areas of <Col N="1125" /> technological change which will benefit our economy, provide more jobs and enable us to compete with the best in Europe.</P>
    <P>There is no need for me to say here how seriously inadequate our research facilities are at present.  I draw the attention of the House and the Minister to the report which was published some time ago about the inadequacies of information technology, word processing and data base information.  That report indicates clearly the serious inadequacies there are even here in the Houses of the Oireachtas and the amount of time, energy and effort wasted in becoming involved in research and other activities which could be occupied very usefully had we a modern system of information available to us here in the House.  That applies equally to Government.  I suggest the Government are seriously hampered at this time by the lack of this data bank information services which would enable them to tune in to international developments and trends in business, economics and whatever and enable them to do the business of Government more effectively and efficiently.  It is fine to become involved in the new project we are speaking about today at Community level with the member states who have signed this declaration, but we must tackle the more fundamental issue of our own inadequate technological, research and scientific information and data bank services in our own State and in the House.  The very fact that we are so inadequately served in this area and the lack of facilities mean we are wasting time and effort here. Some attempt should be made to remedy this situation at the very earliest opportunity.</P>
    <P>It is equally important for the effective and efficient functioning of industry that we have these technical aids and efficient dissemination of information through a modern, sophisticated system.  It is well recognised across Europe that because of the inadequacies in the research and development area, European business is stagnating when Japanese and American industry is expanding rapidly.  Naturally, the anxiety across Europe is that we are <Col N="1126" /> not in a position at European level to keep pace with the developments which are taking place in Japan and the US.  We must recognise that a huge area here is relatively underdeveloped in Europe. Any action taken in this regard at European level will be beneficial and we should get the benefits from that here.</P>
    <P>At the same time I would like to put on record the work which has been done in a number of areas in pilot research and development activities here.  One of these is the microelectronics computer centre at Plassey attached to the NIHE in Limerick. Already some advanced technological developments have identified areas for job creation and areas where more involvement of technology, science and research could provide very valuable businesses.  Already there are indications that substantial job creation has resulted in the mid-west region, my region, from the work which has been done at that microelectronics computer centre in the NIHE at Plassey.  That development is welcome and must be encouraged and expanded.  I hope that our involvement in the understanding and the declaration which has been signed by the Government will enable further developments to take place in Plassey.</P>
    <P>We in Ireland at this time should be giving a lead in Europe in this whole area of new and exciting possibilities where now, because of our involvement with US industry in particular, we are as advanced as most countries in Europe.  I am alarmed at the fact that in this case the Government have not succeeded, for instance, in having the centre established here in Ireland.  What is wrong with the microelectronics centre in Plassey in Limerick that it could not be made the centre for the European agency which is dealing with this whole area?  We also have the national microelectronics centre in Cork. I am sure equal development is taking place in Dublin.</P>
    <P>We have had close contact with technological development in the US because of the number of American companies that have located in the Shannon Industrial Estate.  In Shannon, people like Westinghouse are to the forefront in <Col N="1127" /> technological developments and they are involved in many areas of research into various commodities.  Very wisely they centred a lot of their research activities in the Shannon region.  In the past, one of our criticisms of industry was that we did not get research and development in the subsidiaries of the multinational companies that have established here. Not only have Westinghouse established a certain amount of their research and development in the Shannon plant but they have encouraged young Irish people to replace the American personnel who set up those industries.  This is to be welcomed and it is a trend that should be followed by other multinational companies who have successfully established here.  They should encourage Irish people to take over the management and running of these businesses.  It is recognised that Irish personnel trained in the National Institute of Higher Education and in Dublin are capable and willing to take on these responsibilities and that they have the expertise necessary.</P>
    <P>We are losing out under this motion in that we are not in Europe at present involving ourselves in research and development.  We should be giving a lead in Europe for once, rather than coming in at the tail end as we have done in most other areas.  I notice from the Minister's speech that we were not in a position to sign the declaration when it was laid before the members in June 1986.  Why were we not in a position to sign the declaration then?  The principles contained in the declaration should be laid before the House so that we will be in a better position to speak and know exactly what we are getting involved in.  I am concerned, as is Deputy Lyons, that we may be involved in research into areas in which we would prefer not to involve ourselves.</P>
    <P>This motion is relevant because Article 24 of the Single European Act which will be debated here shortly provides for some new initiatives at European level in research and technology.  The Single European Act, title 6 on research and development part 3 of the EC Treaty, is <Col N="1128" /> being extended now to strengthen the scientific and technological basis of the European industry.  That will make the European industry more competitive in the international market and we, being part of the European industry, will benefit from that.  Some additional finances will be provided under the Single European Act for the development of the Community and this will benefit industry here especially in areas where we would not be in a position to undertake research ourselves.</P>
    <P>Pilot projects in this area will be undertaken. I direct the Minister's attention to this so that, when the Community evolves to a stage where scientific technology areas will be part of the budget of the Community, we will be able to avail of that and identify projects which would be eligible for funding from the Community. I direct the Minister's attention to a section which says that specific programmes will be developed at Community level in the whole area of scientific research and development.  Have any specific programmes been contemplated and, if so, will the Minister give some indication as to how this area will be exploited by us?  If Community funds are available for research and development we should know what we want, and we should have projects ready in order to get such funding.</P>
    <P>At every level of Community activity up to now we have missed out very badly on the funding available in a number of areas.  We have been at the very bottom of the league in the amount of aid which we have been able to draw from Europe to modernise our fishing fleets.  If there is to be a financial allocation for research and technological developments we should have projects ready for submission to Brussels so that we will not lose out as we have done already in relation to aids for the development of our fishing fleet, our fish processing industry and so on.  That equally applies to our agricultural industry.</P>
    <P>The Community will create a framework to develop a comprehensive policy in the whole area of technological developments.  We must ensure that we <Col N="1129" /> are to the forefront in that development. The Government as the agent who submits applications for aid should identify a plan of action so that we will be in a position to submit applications for funding for new developments.</P>
    <P>This motion is welcome although we have some reservations.  The principles of the declaration should be laid before the House so that we can see exactly what is involved.  A certain amount of work is already taking place here and it should be encouraged.  As well as being to the forefront in Europe the Government should put their own house in order and consider how research and development can assist industry, agriculture, fisheries and the general development of our economy. Also in this House technological expertise and availability are sadly lacking. That needs to be remedied very urgently if we are to carry out efficiently the duties we must undertake.</P>

      <P>I welcome the enthusiastic support this proposal has received from Deputy Lyons and Deputy Daly.

      <P>I will deal with some of the points raised in the contributions.  Brussels was chosen because of the clear possibilities it affords of interfacing with research and development work throughout the Community.

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>We need to use established networks and Brussels is suitable in that regard.  While, obviously, it would be nice to see agencies located in peripheral regions, in this case where it has a specific task in acting as a broker between industrialists and researchers, there is a strong logic in its present location.  I should also like to assure Deputy Lyons that Ireland took a leading role in ensuring that small and medium sized companies would participate in this initiative. We are still actively pursuing this.  We have insisted that a special study on the needs of smaller companies should be drawn up by the secretariat and this matter will be discussed by Ministers in Stockholm in December.</P>
      <P>I should also like to assure Deputy Daly that there is a high level of interest in EUREKA in Ireland.  He is right in saying that the principles have not been laid before the House but I can provide him with a copy of them if he wishes. As I outlined in my speech, the clear objective is to raise the productivity and competitiveness of Europe's industries in the face of an American challenge.  The way in which EUREKA seeks to achieve that is through the execution of specific projects by a consortia of industrialists, educational and institutional concerns.  It is trying to achieve partnership in these areas.  It does not have a fund which it allocates to specific projects; it is more in the way of a broker.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Projects are already under way in agriculture, medicine, transport, information technology, bio-technology and many branches of engineering and material science. Deputy Daly will be pleased to know that marine technology is specifically mentioned among the objectives set out by EUREKA.  There are about 130 proposals circulated to date and Ireland has already agreed to participate in two of them.  Negotiations are in progress in regard to five other projects in which Ireland may well become involved.  There <Col N="1131" /> is a significant degree of interest and progress already.</P>
    <P>The importance of EUREKA highlights the fact that we have a serious problem here in regard to research and development.  I had the opportunity yesterday to present the NBST awards for innovation.  In the course of that address, I drew attention to the fact that our spending on research and development is only about one-fifth of US and EC levels. Fewer than one-sixth of Irish companies have any research and development expenditure and fewer than one-twentieth have research and development departments.  This is an important initiative which will play its part in raising the profile of research activity in Ireland, especially in relation to smaller companies whom we have sought specially to involve.</P>
    <P>I disagree with Deputy Lyon's suggestion that in some way Government support has been wanting or that they have not drawn the strands together.  The whole thrust of the industrial White Paper published about two or three years ago was to recognise the deficiency of an approach which concentrated on newly established companies, mainly from foreign sources.  The idea is to shift emphasis from grant-aiding capital to the other, more crucial, needs of small and large Irish companies.  That includes research and development, marketing, design and so on.  It would be quite wrong of the Deputy to suggest that we have been ignoring this aspect.  He spoke in glowing terms of the micro-electronic centre and the NBST which are financed by the State.  Many other such bodies are also directly financed by the State in this area including the IDA who provide research grants.  Research institutes such as the IIRS, An Foras Talúntais, An Foras Forbartha and NIHE in Limerick are also financed by the State.</P>

      <P>The whole thrust of industrial policy in recent years has been <Col N="1132" /> to concentrate on the needs of the smaller and established firms so that they will have the internal strength to develop new products and to do the sort of thing which we are talking about today.</P>
      <P>One Deputy asked if SDI was linked with EUREKA.  The Hanover Declaration is very explicit on the point that EUREKA is concerned only with civilian research.  It includes countries which possibly are even more sensitive in the matter of neutrality than Ireland, including Switzerland, Sweden, Austria and Finland.  From the very beginning these countries have been enthusiastic supporters and participators in EUREKA.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The background of the evolvement of EUREKA is clear.  The French are specifically concerned about what they used to call the <i>débi Americair</i> as I remember from many years ago. There is a fear that European technology is falling behind in the race and possibly a new fear that big heavy research programmes like SDI could have a spin-off in the civilian end.  However, the thrust of EUREKA is specifically confined to civilian research.</P>
      <P>I should like to reiterate that the principles adopted in Hanover are available. During the course of my initial address I laid emphasis on the broad thrust of that declaration but I forgot to mention why we were not able to sanction this in London.  It arises specifically from Article 29.5.2º of the Constitution which says that international treaties involving commitment of public money to be spent abroad requires ratification by the Dáil.</P>

We are intimately involved in its operation and we are making efforts to ensure that small and medium sized industries get good opportunities.  A specific objective of ours was to establish a secretariat that would act as a broker to bring together the potential partners.  Those aspects are very important from an Irish point of view.  It would not be true to say we can set out a programme of projects.  As I say, there is no fund there from which we can call down money.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>Last Thursday while speaking on this Bill I advised the Minister not to interfere with CERT but to retain them and to allow them carry on their good work in the hotel and catering industry.  It is bad enough to hear that <Col N="1134" /> Bord Fáilte have closed down their offices in Manchester and in Birmingham, too, so far as I know.  Those in the north of England who want to make arrangements to come on holidays to this country have to phone London.</P>
      <P>I would impress upon the Minister that when we talk about CERT we are talking about a success story.  They have proved their worth over a long number of years in their particular sphere.  They have succeeded in placing the graduates they have trained.  Their trainee chefs, barmen and so on are fairly sure of jobs.  CERT are very much needed in the trade.  I hope they will be allowed to carry on their good work and will not be turned into a dull inefficient nonentity.  Fianna Fáil will be pressing that they be left alone.  We do not want a dead CERT, we want them to be retained as a virile and active organisation who will be allowed to do their own thing.</P>
      <P>I hope we would all work towards coordinating all the resources we have towards solving the big problem today in Ireland which I see and which the Minister sees is unemployment.  I am disappointed that this Bill is entitled the National Employment and Training Authority Bill, that education has not received greater emphasis.  To bring all sections with you, you must include education, training, at all levels as well as retraining, work experience and apprenticeships. We must also consider what we are training people for.  Are we training them to emigrate or are there jobs at home for them?  I can see some merit in a certain amount of emigration but 30,000 people a year are leaving this country. Many of these are in the United States illegally.  A Bill before the United States Senate, if passed, will mean that everybody who has been in the United States illegally since 1982 will be sent home. Perhaps we should use our good influences with the United States to impress on them that if they want to be friends with Ireland they should give us, not so much aid for the Anglo-Irish Agreement, but visas which might be more helpful than dollars.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It appears that up to now education <Col N="1135" /> and labour have been divorced from each other.  There has been a tug-of-war and an overlapping.  Everyone has been doing his own thing and has been intent on perpetuating themselves.  I mentioned that we allow more trainees to enrol in first year than we allow into second year because there are no spaces for them in second year.  That is wrong.  A conscious decision is made each year in most faculties that 50 per cent of those who have completed their first year studies will be failed because there are no places for them in second year.  It is not because they have not reached a particular standard but because even in a vintage year they have not finished in the top half.  As a result, they are to be turfed out.  That is soul destroying and it is not just.</P>
    <P>Where are the decisions made and where does the planning take place to provide the graduates we want?  There are certain types of people we want in Ireland today.  For instance, I am sick and tired of writing to the Eastern Health Board on behalf of people who are seeking orthodontic treatment.  There are good dental hospitals in this country offering opportunities for training but when the training is completed, the new dentists go abroad.  Not so long ago when there was pressure in the Dáil we had to bring stenographers with the required speeds from England.  We have the capacity in this country to provide our own experts in every field.  We should encourage people to opt for training in the spheres in which they are needed.</P>
    <P>This day last week as I travelled back from Amsterdam following a Council of Europe meeting I sat beside a very nice young man.  He was a Dutch expert in oil spillage at sea and in pollution.  He was invited to this country to deal with the problem which is still with us down in Cork.  He is the author of a book and he had his pocket computer with him.  He knew all about the different types of iron ore, heavy metals and heavy oils and the likely troubles they would cause.  He knew about our difficulties and about our rocky beaches compared with the sands around Amsterdam.  If we had our eye to <Col N="1136" /> business we would have such an expert here at home.  We have marine biologists on Sherkin Island who have been pioneers in monitoring red tide.  They are internationally recognised to the extent that people come from New Zealand, Australia and the United States to their laboratories each year.  We have never given them the support that was necessary. We should be in a position to qualify our own experts at home.  There is no reason for us not setting our sights on greater horizons.</P>
    <P>In my constituency I have seen great co-operation between the VEC, the adult education officers, AnCO, Manpower and all other agencies who are involved in a LINC programme.  That is a specific programme geared to our area of Kildare and also to Laois.  Regionalisation is the greatest hope we have of making a success of programmes and agencies such as these.  I would like to see a tie in between social welfare and labour.  When I was the Minister with responsibility for forestry I was conscious of the many people who were then unemployed, not as many as now but quite a considerable number.  I felt that we should be able to initiate a pilot project. It struck me that in an area such as Mountrath which is surrounded by forests we could easily get people who are social welfare recipients and who have a knowledge of forestry work to opt for the forestry work which needed to be done such as pruning, thinning and the extraction of timber thinnings.  This would have needed a certain amount of co-ordination between the Department of Social Welfare, the Department of Labour and the Department of Forestry but these people would have been paying their way.  I must say that there was a great reluctance among those bodies to cut through the red tape and to co-operate with each other.  I am confident that people in Ireland do prefer to work, if they get the opportunity, rather than draw the dole. This was an opportunity which was not availed of.</P>
    <P>I must compliment the Government for introducing the social employment scheme.  That is a good scheme but I saw <Col N="1137" /> a reluctance at Kildare County Council level to get involved in the scheme.  A whole year went by before we got involved in the scheme, for what reason I am not sure.  Other towns which are more tidy conscious than we are availed of this scheme.  The trade unions were very anxious to see that their corner was not interfered with and that people would not be employed on work which could otherwise have been done by county council workers.  That is a bad attitude to adopt.  There is a great deal of work to be done around the country and not enough people to do it.  In my county, general operatives are scarce but very highly qualified engineers are rather plentiful. There are a lot of chiefs and not enough Indians.</P>
    <P>I should like to see a change of attitude among county councils and trade unions in that respect.  Also, if we are going to employ people on social employment schemes, we must ask if that work is gainful, can those people taking part take pride in the work they are doing or do they consider it a dead end?  School caretakers and others have been taken on and after a year have been let go because someone else would have to be taken on. There is no continuity.  A lady who got a temporary job as secretary in a school with 400 pupils has been told that she will be let go in a short while.  There is plenty of such work to be done in a school with 400 children.  If a secretary were doing it, the teachers would be free to do the work for which they have been trained &mdash; to teach.</P>
    <P>On regionalisation, it is vital that we take a decision that Dublin will not be allowed to run the whole show if this Bill comes into force and the training authority is set up.  A Green Paper on Education emanated from Dublin which was to restructure the vocational education bodies.  I believe that there was a national rejection of this idea.  Kildare was to find itself in a region that included Kildare, Wicklow and Wexford.  I do not know who thought up that Joseph's coat of many colours, but it would be hard to see a region stretching from the Lily Whites down to the Yellow Bellies, from <Col N="1138" /> Leixlip down to Carnsore, from Brittas Bay over to Bracknagh.  It would be an unweildly, unmanageable entity and an unworkable coalition.  It was doomed to failure from the start.</P>
    <P>The local regions should be allowed to have a say and the counties are reasonably well established.  Perhaps the reason for their establishment does not obtain today, but they have a separate entity.  I am aware from my own experience with Kildare Vocational Education Committee that that is as good as one may get in Ireland.  I should like to think that we could link all the education establishments together at all levels.  I would welcome a great unity of purpose between places like the University in Maynooth, Carlow Regional College and all the schools, to see that those who graduate from such establishments will be given jobs at home.</P>
    <P>We should ask if Carlow Regional College is too crowded and if it has more pupils than we intended when it began. If one is not in a position to improve the services there, why not provide another regional college for the south or west of Dublin between Carlow, Athlone and Dublin?  Ideally, Kildare would be the place, where there is quite a large population. It is also vital that we provide in the area the education and training that fills the need of that particular area.  Up to recently, one-third of all the cattle killed in Ireland were killed in Kildare. There was a plant at Leixlip, now sadly closed, but there are plants at Sallins, Kildare and Athy.  In those meat factories, we have the nucleus of a meat industry, and education and training are needed in beef production, factory work, the meat trade, meat processing and marketing in all types of meat products.</P>
    <P>I got a great kick some years ago when I attended the Green Week in Berlin, to see sausages on exhibition made in Hacketstown by Duffy's.  These were supposed to be impregnated by Irish whiskey. When one can sell sausages to the Germans, one is on the way to success.  I hope somebody at some stage, will realise that we need training in such matters, <Col N="1139" /> that the jobs are there locally and that the need should be filled.</P>
    <P>In the midlands, there is the peat industry, and the post-peat industry is now being spoken of and the future use of cutaway bog, with the many facets and opportunities that that presents.  We would need to be thinking in terms of a whole peat training and post-peat training programme.  Many nurseries have grown up in that area; An Foras Talúntais have done very valuable work, as have Bord na Móna.  We want to see continuity of employment when Bord na Móna have moved on.  Some years ago, Bord na Móna put on a very successful film, the premiere of which we were invited to in a cinema in Dublin.  The film was called &ldquo;Inné agus Inniu&rdquo;.  I should very much like to think that there will be an amárach as far as our bogs are concerned.</P>
    <P>A special study could be done in our area on the equestrian science.  It is the home of the racing and bloodstock industry and also the breeding industry. Research is going on there now which is comparable with any in the world.  We have people involved in showjumping.  I should like to make particular reference to an apprenticeship scheme which has been started there, called RACE.  It deals with the training of racing apprentices and is based at the National Stud in Tully. Very good work is being done there.  The VEC, the Department of Labour, the European Social Fund and AnCO are all involved and we also have many voluntary workers in the racing board, trainers and owners &mdash; very busy and very successful people who are prepared to give of their time and expertise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">

      <P>It is very successful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>The Army are also included.  Research carried out there has proved that there is a capacity to provide 45 jobs every year, not alone as apprentice jockeys and the number of that 45 to be successful would be limited enough, but one needs people for stud farm management, for travelling horses, grassland management and all the facets of the <Col N="1140" /> racing and bloodstock industry.  At one time, it was reckoned that £1 million of investment in that industry would provide training and facilities for 45 jobs a year, that those jobs were secure and were needed in the industry.  That is not a pipedream, training people for jobs that just might be there.  It is a reality, the jobs are there.  The demand is there every year.  This is a viable, sensible, proposal, but so far I have seen no response to it at all.</P>
      <P>In my county, there is also a great tradition of military training.  It is unfortunate that in this year the Minister for Defence and his Department have decided to cut the intake of Army apprentices by half.  People say that when times are bad that is the time to paint the shop front but when times were bad, the white flag of surrender was hung out as far as the Army Apprentice School in Naas was concerned.  The people so trained, electricians and fitters, are excellent people.  There is none better and they are very sought after.  They sign on for the Army for nine years but many buy themselves out before that time has elapsed. They are of great benefit to the country. It was a wrong decision to take just because there was no money available or because some people leaving the Army, artificers and so on, were not needed. There could be a whole centre of military training there.  One has the groundwork, the artillery in the Glen of Imaal, a cadet school, Baldonnel.  The only thing that we need is a Navy and we would allow somebody else to deal with that.  There is there the nucleus of a headquarters where military training could be conducted and a greater emphasis laid on it.  With proper regionalisation, the local people could decide what they do best.  From my own experience as a teacher involved in the VEC and from a family point of view, I have seen all sides of education.  It would be helpful if local people, parents and the general public were allowed to make an input in their own region or county.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope the various Government Departments will become more flexible and that the Departments of Labour, Social Welfare and Finance will work <Col N="1141" /> with each other rather than as distinct entities.  I had a sad case recently of a man in receipt of £68 unemployment benefit per week.  He was anxious to start his own business and would have invested £5,000 of his own money in buying a bus.  He went to the section dealing with starting a business, offering to give up the £68 per week and take the £50 per week for six months so that he could get his business going.  He envisaged being self-employed at the end of that period. He was told there was no more money for the £50 per week payments but that he could continue to draw £68 per week if he did not work.  There is something radically wrong in that system, something sick about our country.  To give the Minister his due, I did get word after four months that the money was found and the man would get the chance to do what he wanted.  He should not have had to wait.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>There should be a free flow of money to train people.  History teaches us very sad facts.  We had a famine 140 years ago and schemes were thought up to provide relief work.  Roads were built which led nowhere and piers were started and left unfinished.  I see no great sense of purpose in some of the schemes now in operation.  People have a half-baked knowledge of a subject but a sense of discipline is missing.  Despite the drawbacks of the old apprenticeship scheme, <Col N="1142" /> there was a lot to be said for it.  Maybe the unfortunates had to work for many years for little money.  The White Paper on manpower policy expressed views about the apprenticeship system, saying that trainees should have the chance to be indentured in the private and public sectors.  It has been done in other areas and what has been successful in Germany and Switzerland cannot be too wrong. We may say they are hard-headed people and we look on ourselves as being easygoing &mdash; perhaps that is another word for lazy.  I remember speaking to a German whose job it was to ensure that every article made in his factory was up to a certain standard.  I said he must be the quality control manager but he replied that he stood for quality assurance.  We could copy that and consider returning to the old apprenticeship system.</P>
      <P>Apprentices always got work in the building industry when it was going well. There was also a tradition of employing apprentices in the motor industry.  These two industries have been crucified, perhaps by taxation.  Unemployment in the building industry is around 50 per cent and the motor industry is getting worse every year.  Any money invested in these industries or any loosening of the tax net would immediately result in more people being taken on.  It is amazing that only 6 per cent of those who leave school find their way into employment as apprentices. That was not the way years ago.  It is not the case in other countries which have been more successful in dealing with their employment problems.  There is no substitute for work as it is in real life.  If it is not possible to place all apprentices with employers, the block release system should be adopted.  We should encourage employers to take on apprentices without involving them in too much red tape.  If there is spare capacity in a factory or workshop, would it not be better to take on apprentices rather than leave it idle?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope that Manpower will expand and open more offices or utilise the labour exchange offices in each area.  We have spent some time talking about microcomputers. Why not have one reference or identification number for each person? <Col N="1143" /> Why not have one number for income tax, social welfare, PAYE and PRSI and enter that number into a computer?  This would go a long way towards defeating the black economy and it would make it easy to keep in touch with social welfare recipients and slot people into suitable employment.  The computer age has surely made this possible.</P>
    <P>Section 25 of the Bill explains that the levy is to be used for employment and training and any other expenditure which might be determined by the Minister for Finance.  It was thought at one time that the levy would be discontinued.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">

      <P>In the time of the old crusades women were left at home and had the benefit of a chastity belt.  Perhaps the chastity belt has been done away with, but in the majority of cases women are still left at home.  As far as the Army are concerned, some years ago there was a loosening up and women cadets were commissioned and others were taken into the non-commissioned ranks.  That has now come to a halt and the traditional male preserves are still intact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had hoped that 3 per cent of jobs in the public service would be filled by disabled people, but this has not happened. A father telephoned me last week explaining that his blind son was thinking of going to Waterford College to pursue legal studies.  He wondered if at the end of his studies there would be an opportunity for employment.  Are we serious about this most vulnerable section of our community?  I do not believe that 3 per cent of vacancies in the public service are filled by disabled people.  We talk too <Col N="1144" /> about training for early retirement and retraining people.  Night classes being held all over the country indicate there is a thirst for learning and an anxiety for training.</P>
    <P>This Bill is welcome but we have a duty to see that education, training and employment are co-ordinated.  Education has been ignored in this respect. We need to be positive and practical in our approach and give all types of work a dignity and status.  I blame Irish mothers for thinking that their children are not a success unless they earn their money by pushing a pen rather than doing manual work.  Why is it that Irish people are prepared to work harder away from home than they are willing to do here?  Policies are being changed in this Bill but we must all strive to change attitudes and restore the will to work.  We must match this willingness by providing training for work and the opportunities to earn a living. This is necessary to give our young people a genuine purpose in life.</P>
    <P>I grew up in Ireland during and after the last War and I did not realise then it was a very tough time when there was no opportunities at all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mrs. A. Doyle)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied that my Department's contingency arrangements for dealing with serious oil pollution have operated satisfactorily since they were brought into operation to deal with the twin threats posed by the <i>Kowloon Bridge</i> and <i>Capo Emma</i> incidents which have provided the first practical test of the arrangements approved by the Government in 1984 to improve our response capability.  The approved arrangements included the establishment of an operations group, drawn from Departments concerned and local and harbour authorities, to respond to major oil pollution incidents threatening or affecting shores.  The contingency arrangements will be reviewed taking account of the experience gained from these incidents, and changes will be made, if appropriate.</P>
      <P>The general position regarding compensation for damage arising from marine oil pollution incidents was indicated to the House by the Minister for Communications when dealing with a Private Notice Question on 25 November.  Costs incurred by my Department in dealing with oil pollution, including preventive and clearance measures, will be claimed from the owners of the ships concerned and their insurers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that recently the Irish nation was reduced to the position of an impotent spectator at the hands of foreign ship-owners with the Air Corps out of action, <Col N="1147" /> the advice of the Department not being taken, and the fact that the danger has not yet been mitigated, although a week has passed?  Would the Minister not agree that in view of all this the procedures and the system we have at our disposal are simply not adequate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. A. Doyle Mrs. A. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>The first few points made by the Deputy would be better put to the Minister for Communications.  I would not accept that our planning and our measures are inadequate.  We have proved over the past few weeks that we have the capability of coping with a disaster. This is the first time our contingency plans have been put to the test.</P>
      <P>The arrangements to deal generally with oil pollution incidents were last reviewed by the Government in 1984.  It was then decided to augment contingency measures which essentially relied on local and regional responses to pollution at the time by establishing the operations group which would exercise overall central direction and control of operations to deal with major oil spillages threatening or affecting our shores.</P>
      <P>The <i>Kowloon Bridge</i> and the <i>Capo Emma</i> incidents presented the first occasion on which it was necessary to call in the group.  Last Monday week while visiting the incidents headquarters in Bantry, I chaired a meeting of the liaison committee of this operations group and I have first hand knowledge of how it operates and the co-ordination among all interested departments and parties involved.  I should make it quite clear whose responsibility we are talking about.  The Minister for the Environment has responsibility in relation to incidents such as the <i>Kowloon Bridge</i> and <i>Capo Emma</i> and must deal with any oil pollution, as far as possible protect important marine life in amenity areas and arrange for the clean up of contaminated coastal areas.  The Minister for Communications has specific statutory responsibility for all matters relating to marine casualties including, where necessary, arrangements for the removal of fuel oil or oil cargo.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister agree that all these committees which she visited, chaired and so on are really a substitute for the kind of action we need? When we have a disaster like this at least our three Air Corps spotter planes should be in the air and in action.  I take the Minister's point that this is not her responsibility, but I assume she is speaking for the Government today.  Would she agree that, although a week has passed, the danger is still there and the services of the State have not been effective? Will the Minister make a statement on how the transfer of the oil to the salvage ships is proceeding?  Is it still going on at this moment?  When will the transfer be finished?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3, 29 and 35 together.</P>
      <P>Responsibility for all aspects of toxic and dangerous waste disposal rests with the local authorities and my main role in this area lies in the provision of the appropriate framework of legislation and regulations for the authorities in the discharge of their functions in relation to waste.  With regard to the disposal of hazardous wastes generally, I would refer to Deputy Boland's reply to a number of questions on the subject on 3 October last.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Asbestos waste in dust and fibre form is one of the 27 listed categories of toxic and dangerous waste which are subject to control under the European Communities (Toxic and Dangerous Waste) Regulations, 1982.  The county councils, county borough corporations and Dún Laoghaire Corporation are responsible under the regulations for the planning, organisation and supervision of toxic and dangerous waste disposal operations in their areas, as well as for the authorisation of storage, treatment and deposit of such wastes.  They are obliged to prepare special waste plans designed to ensure that toxic and dangerous waste is disposed of without endangering <Col N="1152" /> human health or harming the environment.</P>
    <P>The necessity to make arrangements for the landfill disposal of asbestos waste has been emphasised to local authorities by my Department on several occasions. The need for such facilities has become acute because of the prohibition on the export of such waste to the UK.  I am not aware of the existence of any problem regarding the disposal of asbestos waste outside the Dublin area where, I understand, quantities of asbestos waste are being stored temporarily because proper facilities for the disposal of this waste have not been provided.</P>
    <P>Pending the completion of special waste plans by all the local authorities concerned, precise information on the quantities of toxic wastes arising in this country and of the amounts being landfilled is not available.  However, the indications are that nearly 70 per cent of the wastes are incinerated or recovered by producers and that most of the balance is exported for incineration or recovery, leaving only a small percentage to be landfilled either here or abroad.  There is no evidence in my Department to suggest that large-scale indiscriminate dumping of toxic waste is taking place around the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has not replied appropriately to Question No. 3 which deals specifically with asbestos waste which is stored, pending a decision on a permanent site and a permanent disposal facility.  The Minister did not refer to the temporary disposal of asbestos waste.  I understand there are a number of sites where it is stored temporarily. I asked in the question that these be listed, where it is held, in what manner it is held and how safe it is.  The only information at our disposal is a report published in February which said that 20 tonnes of asbestos waste was being stored at the docks by Cape (Ireland) Limited.  Can the Minister give some further information in regard to the temporary storage of asbestos waste?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Information from <Col N="1153" /> Dublin authorities suggests that asbestos waste is being stored at particular locations in Dublin docks and at various other points throughout the country, pending resolution of the difficulty I referred to in the reply.

      <P>The surveillance of the temporary dumps is being handled by the local authorities concerned, in the main by Dublin County Council.  The advice of the Department of the Environment on asbestos waste disposal was set out in a circular dated 30 July 1982 at the direction of the then Minister, Deputy Burke. That circular requested local authorities to set up co-disposal facilities for industrial waste and advised that land filling was an acceptable and recognised method of disposing of asbestos waste, subject to certain specified requirements. We repeated that advice in a circular issued in 1985.  The position in regard to temporary dumping is being monitored by the local authorities concerned.  The Deputy can obtain exact details of the location of the temporary dumps if he questions the local authorities.  I regret I am not in a position to give the Deputy the locations of those dumps.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Dublin Corporation has the primary responsibility for arrangements in relation to road openings in Dublin city.  The recently-established Dublin Transport Authority has specific powers to issue directions to statutory undertakers and local authorities in this regard.  I understand that a meeting was held recently involving representatives of the corporation and the Dublin Gas Company with a view to improving arrangements for the reinstatement of road openings and that the Gas Company, in association with the corporation, is now undertaking a comprehensive survey on <Col N="1158" /> an area basis of road openings which have not been permanently reinstated with a view to early completion of outstanding works.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister comment on the present arrangements which make it financially remunerative and act as an incentive for utilities such as the Dublin Gas Company not to hand back to the local authority road works they have completed because they would then be asked to pay the bill?  Is the Minister aware that a sum of the order of £1.5 million is owing to Dublin Corporation by the Dublin Gas Company for works which in some cases should have been handed back a long time ago?  Will the Minister accept that the crying need is not so much for co-ordination but for a change in the incentive system which rewards those who hold on indefinitely to roadworks they have finished?  Does the Minister recognise that as a problem?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a matter for each local authority to order their affairs in such a way that they do not have large outstanding bills for lengthy periods.  The specific provision under section 40 of the Dublin Transport Authority Act will materially improve the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not go into the area of co-ordination.  Will the Minister accept that it is not a matter for the local authority to devise a system under which companies like the Dublin Gas Company will hand back, more rapidly than they do now, inconvenient and expensive roadworks? Such concerns are rewarded for those delays implicitly by not having to pay until a later date.  The problem is that that is not a matter for local authorities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">

      <P>I should like to remind the Deputy that section 40 of the DTA Act gives the authority power to give directions to statutory concerns and local authorities as to the period during which, the time at which and the manner in which roadworks can be carried out.  In using their power the authority will have <Col N="1159" /> regard to the need not only for co-ordination with the execution of roadworks but the need to minimise traffic disruption, the urgency of the roadworks and the extra costs involved by the direction. The DTA will have a specific role to play now in regard to the exercise of their powers under section 40.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Sports clubs, including GAA clubs are already exempt from rates on their playing fields.  Furthermore, rates relief is allowed by rating authorities on sports club premises, including those of the GAA, that qualify for such relief in accordance with the provisions of the Local Government (Financial Provisions) Act, 1978.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot recall but I suspect it was in 1978 or, at the latest, 1979. The legislation gives each local authority discretion to grant rates relief.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Foley</NameTxt>
      <P>In my question I asked the Minister to amend the legislation to exempt them from rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Sports clubs generally are, by legislation exempt from rates in relation to their playing fields.  In relation to other facilities such as club houses, sports clubs have the right to apply to local authorities seeking a waiver of rates as long as they fulfil certain reasonable conditions.  Various clubs have applied successfully to local authorities to have the rates in respect of their premises waived.  I should mention that that waiver of rates applies only to any portion of premises in relation to which a licence <Col N="1160" /> under the intoxicating liquor Acts does not apply.  It is interesting in the context of that to realise that the total amount of rates payable by GAA clubs is approximately £200,000 per annum but between 1984 and 1986 GAA groups received grants of £4.276 million from various Government Departments in addition to grants of approximately £486,000 from local authorities over the same period. When one compares the revenue from the rates that clubs pay to the substantial amount of Government and local authority grant-aid one will see that clubs are not exactly in a disadvantaged position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am conscious of the important part in the area of sport and community life which is played by the GAA, as are the Government.  That is the reason why grants of almost £5 million have been paid to GAA groups by the Government in the course of the last three years.  I should like to assure the House that playing fields owned by the GAA or other sporting clubs are automatically exempt from liability for rates.</P>

Loan finance is available from my Department to enable local authorities to carry out certain improvements including the provision of bathrooms or showers, or extra bedrooms, to their rented dwellings.

      <P>I should like to see this problem addressed.  As I said earlier today, loan finance has been available during the past number of years but Dublin Corporation have not drawn down the full amount available to them. I am particularly anxious that discussions in the local authority involving their allocation for 1987 would include specific allocations for living units which do not have bathing facilities.  There has been a recent corporation communication which outlines the problems facing them in relation to their inner city staff.  Unfortunately, there is no specific proposal in relation to the matter which the Deputy has raised in connection with any particular scheme.</P>

These houses and flats are located in areas of the city where the infrastructure of schools, shops, churches and bus services are available, and does the Minister not think it is desirable that these houses should be updated in <Col N="1163" /> such a way that the communities will continue to live in these areas, accordingly using the infrastructures provided at great expense by the State?  Would the Minister encourage Dublin Corporation to do everything possible in this regard to provide these facilities?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I have indicated that I think this is a problem that needs to be addressed urgently.  I indicated a considerable time ago to Dublin Corporation my desire to see specific proposals for a programme to upgrade the corporation's older housing stock, particularly in the inner city area, but no proposals of a specific nature have been put to the Department.  I would be most anxious to hear from the local authority about specific proposals to provide what I regard as basic facilities in the corporation's existing stock, bearing in mind the new units in the city that are unoccupied, some of them not even let for the first time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 and 20 together.  In an announcement of 20 July 1984 the Government detailed a comprehensive programme to provide accommodation and other services for travellers.  Within the context of that announcement, primary responsibility for the accommodation needs of travellers, whether by way of serviced caravan parks or housing, rests with housing authorities.  The capital cost of providing serviced sites and housing for travellers is met in full by the Exchequer.  This year almost £3 million has been provided specifically for sites. The maintenance and management of serviced sites, in common with that of housing, is a matter for authorities themselves.</P>
      <P>Twenty-six serviced sites for travelling families have been provided, with assistance from my Department, by local authorities throughout the country. Additional sites are under construction or at an advanced planning stage.  Details of the cost of the 26 sites are set out in a tabular statement, which I propose to circulate in the Official Report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I consider that the powers contained in the Local Government (Sanitary Services) Act, 1948 and Road Traffic Acts, 1961 and 1968 are adequate to control the erection or retention of temporary dwellings and to regulate the use of public <Col N="1165" /> carparks.  Their powers do not, however, enable local authorities to compel travellers to utilise any particular accommodation <Col N="1166" /> provided by the authority, nor do I consider it proper to legislate on these lines.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the announcement by the Minister about the amount of money he has provided.  In view of the difficulties experienced by many local authorities in trying to ensure that travellers will use those hardstops, and in view of the major difficulties those travellers cause for the settled community, would the Minister consider amending section 31 of the Sanitary Services Act, 1948 to give more power to local authorities to ensure that hardstops will be used?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that the Deputy is suggesting that local authorities should be given power to oblige travellers to use hardstops.  I suggest that on reflection the House might not consider it wise to enact legislation of that kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister accept that part of the difficulty in seeking to provide adequate facilities for the travelling community who wish to continue to live in caravans and for whom, therefore, hardstops are required is that unless the matter is tackled on a national basis those local authorities who provide these facilities will find there is an influx of new families, in many cases from local authority areas where provision has not been made for them, and that this has resulted in the best endeavours by local authorities being set aside in the sense that they had tried to provide those facilities for families traditionally living in their <Col N="1167" /> areas but found that the difficulty about travellers parking beside roadways escalated because the law does not support the local authorities who take steps to provide better facilities for the travellers. Court decisions, as the Minister is aware, have come down on the side of the travellers who continue to park on the roadside. Would the Minister therefore agree that there is need for him, as the only person who can do so, to tackle this problem on a nationwide basis?  Will he also give greater assurances of an adequacy of funds to be made available to the local authorities to enable a high standard of maintenance and management of the facilities to be provided on a continuing basis after the facility is open and in use? That has been another area of contention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government's policy in relation to this question was set out in the statement of July 1984 and there is no intention of diverting from that policy, a policy which assumes of course that each local authority have a role to play and will participate in playing their part in trying to provide a reasonable and humane solution to this very vexed problem. I appreciate that particular authorities, very often the authorities with responsibility for large urban areas, have additional difficulties.  But it can fairly be said that every help and encouragement have been given to the local authorities by way of advice from my Department whenever it has been sought, and it would be our hope that all local authorities would adopt and implement a programme in this regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>While I accept what the Minister has said with regard to his Department's involvement, will he accept that some local authorities are extremely reluctant to participate in this scheme of providing hard stands?  Have <Col N="1168" /> his Department any plans to ensure that all local authorities play their part in dealing with this problem?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister accept that part of the problem is that those local authorities who do provide hard stands for the number of families traditionally parking in their area find that, having provided proper facilities for them, there is a huge influx of other families from other areas, usually local authority areas that have not done anything for their travelling families, and that that is a cause of much dissatisfaction and discontent among the settled community who, having agreed to do something positive, find that the situation, rather than improving, in many cases deteriorates?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not particularly aware of that problem.  If that were the case it would be particularly unfortunate and would serve to emphasise the need for each of the local authorities to play their part in addressing this very real social problem so that the matter can be addressed on a fair and equitable basis amongst the local authorities generally.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Now that the Minister has been made aware that some local authorities are just not playing their part will he make it his business to try to encourage those who fall into that category to make some effort?  In regard to maintenance and management, this is not the same as housing stock.  There are specific difficulties in the maintenance of the sites.  They are a financial drain on the local authorities.  Would the Minister <Col N="1169" /> extend the financing not just to the provision of the sites but to the maintenance and management of them as well?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The House can rest assured that all authorities are being given every encouragement to participate in this programme.  The Minister of State in my Department has had a number of discussions with local authorities urging them to embark on this programme, but he has had only a limited amount of success. I hope that all authorities will face up to their responsibilities in this regard.</P>
      <P>Local authorities are responsible for the maintenance and management of their own housing stock and it is appropriate that they should be responsible for the management and maintenance of any facilities for travellers which should be regarded also as part of the housing stock.</P>

    <P>The manner in which the holder's signature is to be affixed to the licence is being considered in the general context of the need to ensure that a new form of <Col N="1170" /> licence is as forgery-proof as possible and that fraudulent use of licences is minimised.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment the steps which are being taken to ensure that the recent extreme flooding difficulties which arose along the course of the Poddle River, from Mount Argus to Parnell Road, Dublin will not be repeated in the event of future storms.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a matter for Dublin Corporation to bring forward proposals for the relief of flooding in the area referred to by the Deputy.  No such proposals are before my Department at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact <Col N="1173" /> that the Poddle River, which normall flows at a depth of 12 or 15 inches, flooded some of these houses to the extent that the whole of one room was filled and the water went to two feet on the second floor, does the Minister not consider that it is of national concern and that the local authority should be directed to bring forth a plan without any further delay?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The local authorities are constantly asking &mdash; I believe correctly &mdash; for additional powers and functions to be assigned to them.  It is clearly within the competence of and falls as an obligation on Dublin Corporation, in this instance, to implement any proposals which they have for the alleviation or the remedying of this problem.  If the Deputy is suggesting that every single problem of local authorities should be taken on nationally, that seems to be absolutely at variance with the often-repeated request from local authorities to have more functions devolved to them.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister consider that the very serious problem which arose because of the now not so recent hurricane can be repeated and that it would require a great deal of additional expenditure to sort out the problem affecting the Poddle and Dodder Rivers and that because it is a significant problem it requires departmental interest in the matter?  It is up to the Department to take such an interest.  The question would not have been permitted in this House if there was not some departmental responsibility in the matter.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if he is aware <Col N="1174" /> that the construction of community centres in Cherry Orchard and Rowlagh in Dublin, for which grants and plans have been approved by his Department, has been placed in jeopardy as a result of the refusal of the Construction Industry Federation to agree to the use of AnCO labour on part of the construction work; if, in view of the fact that the grants may be lost if substantial work is not in progress by December 31, he will extend the time limit for the start of the work; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>On 20 March 1986 I made grant allocations of £100,000 and £60,000 towards the provision of community buildings in Ballyfermot and Rowlagh, respectively.  The allocations were made on the basis that detailed planning and execution of the projects would be a matter for the local groups involved, under the general supervision of the local authority.  I understand that the Construction Industry Federation are objecting to AnCO involvement in the projects under the CYTP scheme.  I regret this development and I am taking up the matter with my colleague, the Minister for Labour, to see if the difficulties can be resolved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that in regard to the two cases I have mentioned it is now 3 December and plans had been made for AnCO to do the job?  They were ready to go ahead when the CIF objected.  If the objection is pursued now they will be unable to get the job done before the end of the year. Therefore, I have asked in the question whether, if the CIF pursue their objection and it cannot be overcome, the time can be extended so that another type of contract can be entered into.</P>

      <P>The conditions of the scheme provided that the grants should be paid in respect of works which are certified to be carried out before the end of this year.  In relation to one of the schemes I gather that the local authority involved will be in a position to certify <Col N="1175" /> works in respect of expenditure on the site generally.  In relation to the other scheme, no work has commenced and because of the nature of the scheme involved it will not be possible to carry forward unexpended allocations into next year.</P>

      <P>In view of the nature of this allocation, not just to Rowlagh and to Cherry Orchard but to this scheme which is running out on 31 December, and in view of the fact that many of the projects have received notification only in recent weeks, will the Minister consider extending the time limit into 1987 to allow the projects to get under way?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">

      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>Coming back on the latter point which the Minister is referring to and to Cherry Orchard, my understanding is that the local authority, Dublin Corporation, have in the last couple of weeks certified that the project was ready to go ahead and would fit into the criteria set down by the Minister.  Is that not a fact?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>My understanding is that work has not commenced on the Ballyfermot project.  However, if the local authority are in a position to certify expenditure during 1986 we will, of course, grant-aid that expenditure up to a sum of £100,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should mention in relation to the question asked earlier by Deputy Burke that the promoters of the projects which have been grant-aided had it emphasised <Col N="1176" /> to them that the expenditure must be incurred during 1986 in order to qualify.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the point the Minister makes in regard to notification, but let me say to him that many of them received their notification only in the last couple of weeks with the reallocation from Tallaght.  Is he not aware that many of them will not be able to make it before the end of December?  Is there no way that, despite the fact that it is voted capital, he can extend it for next year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I have explained the difficulty in relation to voted capital, but I have inquired in relation to this matter in recent days.  I understand that the majority of the projects will be certified by the local authorities.  To date the local authorities have indicated that they are in a position to certify the allocations for virtually all of the schemes.  In relation to the other projects I have arranged for an officer of my Department to contact the promoters directly in an effort to ensure that they will be in a position to have the money expended and vouched for before the end of the year.</P>

Under the terms of that scheme, capital, subsidisable at a rate not exceeding 80 per cent, is made available to authorities in respect of works involved.  Approval in principle to the corporation's proposals for Cherry Orchard issued on 14 August 1985, subject to the submission of the usual technical documentation, which is awaited.  Approval in principle to the Darndale proposal issued on 21 May 1986 and an estimate for a pilot project involving 81 houses was submitted to my Department on 20 November 1986, which is under examination.

So far that question has not arisen.

In this year's Estimate there is £24 million which will leave £224 million for next year.  Assuming that it takes from six to nine months for an application to be processed, these applications will be due for payment in 1987.

The Government will provide adequate finance for the continuation of this extremely successful scheme during 1987. I regret the Deputy has indulged in another attempt at scaremongering in order to frighten applicants who have applied to be grant-aided for improvement works under this scheme.  To date payment has been made in 21,000 cases at a total value of £19 million.  That breaks down to relatively small amounts for water and sewerage and chimney works, £0.4 million for bathroom grants, £2.2 million for extensions, £2.15 million for the fabric of the house, £10.3 million in relation to windows and doors, and £3.8 million in relation to pre-1940 dwellings. The extent of the work which has been generated is evidenced by the upturn in the activity in small builders throughout the country and in the provision of supplies by builders' merchants, evidence of which I was given by merchants a couple of days ago.

      <P>Since they took office the Government have pursued a threefold policy in relation to the construction industry. First, the general economic policies pursued by the Government have been designed to restore a favourable climate for private investment in construction. Secondly, public capital investment has been kept at the highest sustainable level; it showed an increase both in 1985 and 1986.  Thirdly, private investment has been boosted by a range of incentives such as the grants for house improvements, the £2,250 grant for new houses, the expanded publicly funded housing loan schemes, the redevelopment proposals for the Custom House docks site, and the inner city designated areas.

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that one major step to help the building industry would be a reduction in the VAT rate which was imposed on house building by the Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have explained on a number of occasions, Exchequer funding in relation to the construction industry now amounts to over 70 per cent of the total turnover of that industry.  Therefore, it will be seen that through a range of different measures the Government have identified the difficulties which the construction industry face and have endeavoured to provide in different ways capital investment being kept at the highest sustainable level.  It was increased this year by 5 per cent over 1985 which, in turn, showed an increase of 4 per cent over 1984.  The primary cause of the decline in the industry has been the slowing down in the level of private investment, not public investment.  As the Deputy is aware, when VAT rates were harmonised, and in relation to the industry increased by 10 per cent, compensating adjustments were made.  For example, the new house grant for first time purchasers was increased from £1,000 to £2,000.</P>

The decision that the £3,000 mortgage subsidy should be replaced by a grant of £2,250 available for all new houses was designed to provide a boost to the house building sector and to employment in the industry. The grant accrues to the benefit of purchasers of new houses.  I am satisfied that the new grant is a more effective instrument of housing policy than the mortgage subsidy and I do not, accordingly, propose any change in the arrangements made.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister accept that this is probably the most urgently required sewerage scheme in north County Dublin?  The lack of this scheme is holding up construction of local authority houses for those who are badly in need of such housing in the Rolestown area.  Because of the Minister's inactivity in relation to this scheme and because of his refusal to sanction it, he has condemned many young people to live in totally unsuitable accommodation in Rolestown. An immediate decision is required from the Minister to allow the <Col N="1185" /> scheme to start.  Does the Minister accept that Dublin County Council have included sufficient funding in their Estimate for 1986 to allow this scheme to commence?  Indeed, it could have been started by now if the Minister had sanctioned it.  If he was serious about the problems of the people of Rolestown, an area which he represents, he would have taken immediate steps to sanction this proposal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>This is my third bite at the cherry.  I welcome the Bill as it is a genuine effort to co-ordinate training and I hope it will lead to jobs and steady employment.  Costly duplication should be eradicated and a greater emphasis laid on the progression from formal education to training and jobs.  These matters should complement one another.  I hope that funding will flow freely for the new Authority and that there will not be a rigid compartmentalisation of existing funds.  The Department of Finance should play their part in providing the funds needed.  It all hinges on a very simple theory &mdash; pay people to work instead of being idle.</P>
      <P>Despite the fact that the Government are on the brink of involuntary liquidation. We should not despair because there will be a future for our young people if we can restore confidence in Government policies.  We must also try to change attitudes and restore the will to work.  That should be matched with training for work and the opportunity for young people to earn a living at home.</P>
      <P>I grew up in the forties when the war had just concluded and we were told that times could not be any worse.  I got married in the mid-fifties and, although it was supposed to be a terrible time, I did not realise it.  I took a chance and things worked reasonably well; maybe I was one of the lucky ones.  We should all be prepared to do the best we can to improve matters.  The feeling of despair will not last forever as there is good reason for hope.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>Like most Deputies who have spoken, I welcome the Bill and congratulate the Minister for introducing it. Fianna Fáil and I have been looking for <Col N="1213" /> a Bill of this kind for a considerable length of time because, at present, the system is a labyrinth through which many young people have to try to find their way before they understand the training facilities or schemes which are available. If this legislation does nothing else, it will at least combine the various agencies under one umbrella.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that unemployment is unacceptably high.  That is an understatement because it now affects every aspect of society.  The core of most of our problems is unemployment and it leaves its impact on many families.  It is responsible for a fairly high percentage of crime. Unfortunately, unemployment is an evil which has become part and parcel of the life of almost every family.  All of us in the House should place at the top of any list of priorities we may have the elimination of unemployment.</P>
      <P>I take exception to two phrases we have heard from Ministers over the past 12 months.  We should eliminate the following two phrases: &ldquo;that unemployment is levelling out&rdquo; and &ldquo;unemployment seems to be stabilising&rdquo;.  As the Minister and I know only too well the hard fact is that unemployment is still increasing.  I know this is not the Minister's philosophy but if one wants to play around with percentages certainly it might be stabilising but to the person who has lost his job it does not matter whether the percentage is levelling out, he is still unemployed.  Those phrases sound very hollow in the ears of any person who has the misfortune to be unemployed.  We should all make a firm vow not to use those phrases ever again.  Those people, particularly single people, who try to eke out a living on unemployment assistance do not take too kindly to being to being told that unemployment is levelling out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister in his speech stated that the attendance at training programmes for young people are at high levels since the introduction of the youth employment levy in 1982.  I accept that fully but I honestly feel that many of those who have been involved in these schemes are now no better off having completed them.  Many of these schemes are <i>ad hoc</i><Col N="1214" /> programmes designed to fill a temporary void without any concern for the young person's future or the ultimate situation in which they will find themselves.  I accept fully that working on schemes of this nature or on schemes which have little relevance may be better than being idle but the money which has been spent could have been put to far better use and could have in many cases set the young person on a definite career.  It could have given him or her a definite goal.</P>
    <P>This brings me to the question of education and where education should tie in with many of the schemes and programmes which have been in operation over the past few years.  There appears to have been a lack of co-operation and co-ordination between many of the schemes and the educational system.  In many cases AnCO have taken over almost completely the running of apprenticeships. I can only speak from a rural background but I can say that what has happened has been to the detriment of many small industries and small contractors in rural areas.  Let me give some of the reasons.  A number of small contractors &mdash; I know the Minister is interested in the construction industry &mdash; have had to let apprentices go on block release.  This meant in many cases that their workforce was substantially diminished. It meant that these young people would be away from home at a relatively early age attending the various courses.  It meant that many small contractors found themselves in the situation that they were literally afraid to take on apprentices.  A system similar to the one which was in operation where the contractors and the local vocational schools worked hand in hand, should be considered.  The vocational schools were ideally equipped for the promotion of apprenticeships, particularly in metalwork and woodwork. There was a tremendous rapport and understanding between local employers and the various teachers.  The apprentices were in a much better environment.  They lived at home and they had none of the problems they now have.  Parents are extremely worried, particularly in my own area, about letting apprentices go <Col N="1215" /> a minimum of 40 miles, in many cases further, rather than being at home at an age when they are most susceptible and when they should be at home in their own environment.</P>
    <P>AnCO have been responsible for many good projects, projects in which they could have given apprentices a far greater input.  I want to refer to a scheme which now appears to have run into problems with the Construction Industry Federation. In Charlestown a scheme of houses was constructed for old people. The scheme was built by AnCO, by young people under very good supervision. Those young people learned the trade from the bottom up.  They were there from the cutting out and pouring of the foundations right through to the finished house.  They received a very good apprenticeship and training but unfortunately because of some problem with the Construction Industry Federation it now appears that projects such as that are now no longer suitable under this scheme.</P>
    <P>In most of the schemes the supervisor has been a man but in some cases the supervisor has been a woman.  The value of the scheme both in output and in value to the young people who are employed depended on the supervisor.  Yet, in many cases the supervisors themselves were not trained and did not know how to deal with many of the problems which arose on the scheme and did not know the importance of discipline.  A case can still be made for the training of supervisors either under AnCO or the Construction Industry Federation who will take charge of schemes so that the young people will get the best value which can be got.  They will receive good training and learn the need for discipline.  One can see the difference between a scheme which has a good supervisor and the scheme which has not.  Very often people come to me and to other public representatives to complain about the behaviour of those working on some schemes.  One has heard of schemes where young people were out sunbathing and that is not good training for the <Col N="1216" /> future.  Perhaps AnCO could consider a scheme for training supervisors in order to ensure that young people on various schemes would reap real benefit in regard to the preparation for work.</P>
    <P>The educational scheme is out of line with modern day requirements.  We all knew that it was academically inclined but we felt there would be a change of emphasis.  Unfortunately that has not happened and the system has not come to grips with the needs of modern society. There is a tremendous need for new technology and a greater emphasis on engineering skills, particularly those needed in industry.  It is very sad to see young people with third level certificates or diplomas in architecture, civil engineering or construction studies who cannot get the work experience necessary to go further with their studies.  Many young people have come to me who are quite prepared to pay employers for some chance to get work experience so that they can take the next step in their education. That situation is abominable and it is a matter to which this new Authority must give their attention.</P>
    <P>I have one particular reservation about this Bill since I do not see the need to include CERT within the scope of the Bill.  Originally I was somewhat worried about the impact of CERT when they took certain courses from the VEC and centralised them, but experience shows that they have given a perfect example of how a training scheme should be run. They have identified a market and trained their people to fill the openings in that market.  The benefits are evident in the numbers of people they have been able to place.  In many cases other training bodies do not identify a market.  Many of them are there just to fill a void and train for training's sake rather than to fill a specific need.  CERT have provided the example of how training schemes should be set up and I earnestly ask the Minister to exempt CERT from the scope of the Bill and let them carry on their central role in the hotel and tourism industry. It is evident that those involved in the industry feel that CERT would serve <Col N="1217" /> their needs far better left as it is.  We must hope that the tourism industry will flourish in the years ahead but in that context we must engage in proper marketing, and not seek to withdraw Bord Fáilte facilities abroad, especially in England.  We can still attract a great number of tourists from the UK.  Finally on this point, we should leave CERT as it is and let it expand by itself.  It has proved itself since 1965 and is one of the few such organisations to have tied itself into the educational system.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke about the problem of long term unemployment.  It is degrading, disillusioning and discouraging. Many of the long term unemployed have no hope and see no possibility of getting worthwhile employment.  Unemployment is the great scourge of presentday Ireland to which we must all turn our attention.  It affects every aspect of Government policy from social welfare to education.  I do not think this legislation will help the long term unemployed, except that one section may make a little more money available.</P>
    <P>The Minister speaks at length about Manpower policy.  No State agency is prepared to use the Manpower services. Manpower are in a very unfortunate position. I know of a case where a Manpower office sent in 280 names for 50 jobs and were then asked to send more.  Rural Deputies know that many people who have put down their names with Manpower have had no communication from them for years.  They are never contacted even when Government or semi-State bodies have job vacancies.  There are so many names on file that it is not possible. All State and semi-State agencies should be made operate through Manpower. This is done to a certain extent but the Government should insist on it.  Also, where grants are being given to private industry they should be asked to operate through Manpower and grants should be available only if workers are taken on through the Manpower office.</P>
    <P>The Minister lists eight important developments in the White Paper, the first being the significance of the emerging <Col N="1218" /> change in the labour force structure as between different age categories. While he includes it later as a major item, he should also have mentioned in that first item that women are now becoming more and more important in the workforce. With regard to his second development, what definition does he give to industry as such?  Does it include all segments of industry &mdash; service and construction, or only manufacturing?  One would have to agree with his third point, the development of a more flexible, cost effective and relevant system of apprenticeship training.  I have given some examples of where training could be far more relevant if left in local areas rather than transferred to a central area.  That would be of much more benefit to the economy of many small areas.</P>
    <P>One of the most important developments listed is that the training necessary to meet the needs of the economy must be provided.  That emphasises the importance of leaving CERT as it is, because CERT had a look at what was needed for the economy and the needs of the tourist industry.  If we identify the training needs of our economy we will do a great day's work.  Quite a number of the training schemes in operation at the moment are there solely because, I am afraid I have to say, of empire building that has gone on for a certain length of time.  I am glad the Minister has felt the need to develop a comprehensive programme of action to improve the level of access and the range of options available to women in the labour market.  I hope women will not then find themselves in the same position as the majority of their male companions, with nowhere to go.</P>
    <P>The eighth point is the development of arrangements to decentralise and devolve the effective delivery of Manpower services to improve their effectiveness at regional and local levels.  All of us in rural areas would say &ldquo;hear, hear&rdquo; to that.  Quite frankly, too much power is evolving in the city.  Not only would we like to see the Manpower service devolved, but very many other services also.  We have felt for many years, not only through the lifetime of this <Col N="1219" /> Government but of other Governments, that far too much power is centralised in Dublin.</P>
    <P>We who represent rural areas and the people whom we represent have a much better understanding and appreciation of the problems of people living in rural areas than those who might draw up grandiose plans which are of relevance to the city of Dublin but have absolutely no relevance for rural areas.  For instance, in my area one could question the training facilities for forestry, for drainage &mdash; of which we need a considerable amount &mdash; and for the fishing industry, which has a tremendous potential.  Mayo has some of the deepest waters in the country, sometimes only 200 metres offshore.  In two or three places we have, within 200 metres of the shore, water deep enough to take ships of up to 200,000 tonnes.  That is a facility which is not being used.  Perhaps not to be harvested during my lifetime or that of many who are present here, but there are undoubted mineral resources off the Porcupine Bank.  Even at this stage I should like to see training facilities being set up along the west coast to cater for the needs of those who will at some stage in the future drill and take oil and gas from the Porcupine Bank.</P>
    <P>I am continuously approached by people in relation to the social employment scheme.  They see no reason why works of seemingly major importance cannot be done while others which they consider of minor importance are being attended to.  Part of this problem is connected with the trade unions.  The local needs are those which should be looked at and answered.  If a local community set out certain works in their own area &mdash; many of which will not be done by the present county council workforce for centuries because of the cash situation &mdash; there is no reason why under the social employment schemes drainage cannot be done, footpaths attended to and the cutting of bushes and various other operations carried out.  At the moment these works cannot be done in parts of Mayo. At many meetings with community councils and my own organisation, I am asked <Col N="1220" /> why cannot certain works be done which are of far greater importance to the local people than work being carried out.  This is probably something over which the Government have no real control but as a Parliament we should be directing our attention to it.  We should be spending money where it will give the best return to the community.</P>
    <P>I spoke before very briefly about some work which normally was done under the youth employment scheme and AnCO, which now seems to have been barred. Some of these works will never be undertaken. The Minister of State handled these matters early on and he knows the problems that arose.  He will agree there is no way some of these construction projects could take place &mdash; small projects for local clubs, such as GAA clubs in Mayo, soccer clubs and community councils. The local community have not the money to give to a contractor.  It is better to have them done under the aegis of the Construction Industry Federation, so that proper training can be given to the future carpenters, blocklayers, plumbers and electricians.  This training could be carried out and the job could be of tremendous benefit to the community.  I should like to see the Minister getting involved with the Construction Industry Federation.</P>
    <P>Some years ago two pilot projects were set up in north Mayo, one at Gweesala and the other at Glenamoy, the heart of the bogs.  Both projects were set up to find out what could be grown on the bogs, to what use could they be put. In Gweesala it was grassmeal and the products that could be made from it.  This project was very successful but it folded up.  There was some talk of this being bought and it was hoped an industry to make briquettes would be set up there. The point I want to stress is that this pilot project proved that farming could be carried on in boggy areas but it was allowed to lapse because when the experiment had concluded, we did not appear to want to divide the bog.  The only problem was drainage.  If machinery had been left there, co-operative farming could have been carried on because as long as the <Col N="1221" /> drains were kept open farming could have been carried on.  Ten or 12 extra families could have been settled in this area, because even at 100 acres each, there was a great deal of bog to be divided.  It is sad to see an experiment which gave good employment for a number of years being allowed fall through.</P>
    <P>Some years ago we were interested in biomass.  I suggest that we start planning now for the many areas which at present depend for employment on Bord an Móna and the ESB.  Turf is a diminishing product.  There was a scare recently that a number of men would be let go by Bord na Móna.  A large segment of north Mayo depends on the Bellacorick power station, the Oweniny bog project and the Bangor bogs for employment.  This year for the first time there was a threat to lay off a considerable number of the permanent staff of Bord na Móna and the people of those areas saw the stark reality of what could happen to that area if they were let go.  We must face the fact that in 20 or 30 years time those resources will be used up.  It is now that we should be planning for what will happen not just to a town but to a whole area &mdash; Crossmolina &mdash; Killala &mdash; Bangor &mdash; Ballina.  If the scare experienced by these Bord na Móna workers during the summer did nothing else, at least it woke the community up to what can happen if there is nothing to replace the existing industry. Planning must start now.  I do not pretend to know the lifespan of the bogs&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>May I talk about people setting up their own business?  This was a very good scheme, but I hate to have <Col N="1222" /> to point a finger.  These young people were encouraged to start their own businesses but nobody thought about what would happen in five or six months time. They were not given any training in business management.  Many of them became involved in setting up their own businesses because they were getting £x but they forgot about the rent, rates and normal running expenses.  Few if any had any training in bookeeping or any other similar skills.  For that scheme to be successful, these people must be properly trained and alerted to the problems they will face.  If a training course had been provided many of those people would not have had to go back on unemployment assistance.  This is an area that the Minister for Labour could have a hard look at.</P>
      <P>If the new Authority do nothing more than put money into a pool to help people in different areas, they will have done a good job.  It is ridiculous that the Minister for Finance can fork out £70 to an unemployed person while, at the same time, the Minister for Labour cannot give £50 to help that person do his own work.  If a person sets up his own business not alone does it help him retain his dignity but it also encourages the work ethic concept.</P>
      <P>The Minister should appoint a temporary chairman to the board and later the Authority should appoint a permanent chairman.  I accept that there will be a hiatus until the employees appoint their two directors.  I understand the Minister will also appoint the first director but that too should be on a temporary basis.  I accept that the idea behind this Bill is training, and a fair portion of the Minister's speech dealt with youth and youth training but the Minister should change the composition of the board and provide for two youth representatives rather than one.</P>
      <P>I hope, Sir, I have extricated myself from the difficulty I was in earlier.  I congratulate the Minister for bringing in this legislation which is long overdue.  This is a Bill many people have been looking for for a very long time.  Apart from my one major reservation about CERT being included, I heartily welcome the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I can identify with one of the comments made by Deputy Calleary when he says that he would be concerned at people who do not come from rural areas making decisions about rural areas.  As one who comes from an urban area, I often felt that people who do not come from urban areas make decisions about urban areas.  I suppose Deputies from rural and urban areas feel the same way.</P>
      <P>The concept of unity is good.  The idea of one authority or one responsible group in charge of training, job finding and equipping people for jobs is a very good thing.  I wonder whether the National Manpower Service have served any purpose at all.  I do not want to be unfair but it seems that the manpower service have been an unmitigated failure.  For instance, what have they done that the employment exchanges were not doing before they were set up?  Could the employment exchanges not have been developed to do the same work as that carried out by the National Manpower Service?  I do not want to be unfair; I want to be objective.  I only say this because I am genuinely concerned, as all other Deputies in this House are, about the large numbers of people unemployed.  I do not believe that the National Manpower Service have contributed greatly to solving unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope with the setting up of the new Authority that the whole role of the manpower service will be re-examined.  I am aware, as other Deputies in the House are, that the manpower service quite often send people to Deputies' clinics for help.  Perhaps that is due to frustration in the manpower service.  The new Authority should be given terms of reference from the beginning.  The various disparate groups should be brought together so that they could, <i>in toto</i>, pursue the maximum number of jobs for our young people.  They could cut through as much red tape as possible and set themselves targets which are achievable in a non-bureaucratic way.  This body must be made work.  It must be enterprising and it must succeed.  I wish it every success.  I <Col N="1224" /> think the setting up of one umbrella group will assist it in doing that.</P>
    <P>It seems, and I would like the Minister to comment on this, that there is some sort of unofficial committee within the Department of Labour which has the power, which this House does not have and which none of the parliamentary parties in this House have and which no member of the Cabinet has, to block schemes which could provide jobs for many young people in particular.  They could be put to work at such useful tasks as, for instance, tidying up Mount Jerome cemetery in my constituency.  There are many community projects which could be attended to, but it appears that a committee within the Department of Labour has the power of veto over schemes in that Department.  I would like to know who are the members of this committee, who appointed them, who are they answerable to, what are their terms of reference and what are their objectives? Are their objectives to retain the <i>status quo</i> whereby some people within the public service are paid good pensions and others outside the public service remain unemployed.  I would like to know what the work of this committee is.</P>
    <P>People within the Department and on this new board will have to determine from the beginning that there will be no nonsense with bureaucracy.  The objection to developing a facility such as Mount Jerome cemetery, about which I am in negotiation with the Department at present, and giving a dozen young people a job for a year or two years is that it is an asset and these people would be put to work developing an asset as if it was a piece of plant or machinery that could be sold the next day.  I never heard such nonsense.  If they developed that asset it would give 12 people a job for a year or two years and would make that cemetery, where the bereaved regularly visit the graves of their loved ones, more like a park.  It would give it some sort of sightly look that would make the people who pay the taxes happy.  Why is it not possible to put people to work on developing a cemetery which is centuries old, which has fallen into a disgraceful state <Col N="1225" /> of disrepair, and which is now being used by muggers to make their escape into adjoining areas.  We cannot allow such a scheme because some anonymous committee within the Department of Labour set down terms of reference which prohibit those young people from getting a job because they say they could be developing a plant or a capital asset.  That is nonsense.  If there is one scheme like that there are probably hundreds or thousands such schemes where young people could be put to work, could develop skills and could be taken off the streets while at the same time doing everybody a service. There is some bureaucratic tendency within the Department of Labour and its agencies to prohibit that.  That has to be stopped.</P>
    <P>There are many useful works which have been assisted by the Department of Labour and their agencies such as the community enterprise scheme limited or CESLI as it is known in what was the old, Everclear building on Rathfarnham Road, Terenure, in my own constituency and adjoining the Minister's constituency. A concept that could easily be encouraged in other parts of the city and country is to develop an asset in such a way that small units can be used to get people, who have just got employment, on their feet.  When they are on their feet they can move out and let somebody else take over the unit.  That has worked very well in Terenure and it is something which this new agency could study and develop.  There is much room for serving the community in ways which might not easily be identified.  For instance, there are many young people involved in the community against drugs groups.  They set up adventure sport clubs in a part of my constituency in Crumlin.  They could employ one or two full time leaders who would develop a programme of work. That could be repeated several times throughout that constituency, throughout the city and throughout the country. If we identify a need there is no reason whatsoever why we should not use the funds we are voting to give people work and not just give them money for doing nothing.  People want to work and people <Col N="1226" /> who have jobs want to see those people working.</P>
    <P>It is a question of order in society. There is huge unemployment in parts of my constituency where order will break down because young people and not so young people are hanging around doing nothing.  They do not want a society where people have nothing to do.  It is almost a need not just for economic survival but for order in society, for occupational therapy and for the dignity of having work.  It is to the benefit of the community that these people are put to work.  We should give priority to that.</P>
    <P>When we face this problem we find that we have an apartheid situation.  We have two public service pay rolls.  We have a pay roll which engages public service employees who have promotional opportunities, paid sick leave, overtime opportunities and all sorts of possible security and job satisfaction or at least job opportunities available to them.  We have also 240,000 people on the same public pay roll who do not have any rights or privileges, no paid sick leave or any hope for the future.  We pride ourselves on giving those in the public service a 7 per cent pay increase, an increase that is ahead of the rate of inflation, but that means we are continuing the policy of apartheid.  Many of the 240,000 on the unemployment register could have been retained in the public service if there was moderation in public service pay. However, those people do not have any rights and the sooner we realise there is a form of economic apartheid operating against those people the sooner we will be able to address this problem in the right way.</P>
    <P>We must maximise every opportunity to ensure that those who are on the poor end of the public service pay roll are put back to work.  Otherwise we cannot say we are tackling the problem seriously.  A suggestion was made by Deputy Calleary that the chairman of the new body should be appointed on a temporary basis and that there should be two youth observers on the board.  I do not care who is appointed to that board provided those appointed are successful.  The Minister <Col N="1227" /> should pick the best people and pay them the maximum bonus possible based on success.  We should judge their success on the number who get back to work.  I would not care if the chief executive officer was paid £1 million per year if he proved successful.  This matter is too important to our society not just in economic terms but in terms of the whole fabric of our society.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to pay the chief executive officer a good salary and a bonus based on success.  That is the only way we will get somebody to cut through all the bureaucratic nonsense that exists and serve the community well.  The person appointed should be given the incentive to make a success of the job. The new board should not be set up as a bureaucratic public service type body.  If the people appointed are paid a bonus on the basis of success there is every likelihood that they will succeed and will not take on the multi-coloured coat of the various agencies that have been amalgamated to form this agency as occurred when Manpower took up where employment exchanges left off.  I welcome the initiative and I hope it succeeds.  The Minister should give the people involved the incentive to reduce the numbers on the unemployment register.  I hope the agency will be in action shortly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. F. Fahey Mr. F. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and I should like to compliment the Minister on the work he had done on the White Paper.  We all agree that this measure is long overdue.  There has been a lot of negligence in regard to co-ordination of a manpower policy between all the agencies and the legislation represents the first important step in the implementation of an effective manpower policy.  While there are many fine objectives in the legislation the real test will be if the new Authority can get their act together in facing what is our most serious problem. I welcome the appointment of the new chief executive, John Lynch, and I am satisfied that he will prove a good appointment.  He has had a long and distinguished career and his performance <Col N="1228" /> with the IPC impressed everybody.  I am confident that he will succeed in this job.</P>
      <P>Unless the new Authority make fundamental changes in regard to manpower training and placement we will not solve our unemployment problem.  I hope the new Authority will not repeat the mistakes made earlier.  The plethora of training schemes and temporary work experience schemes militated against the creation of worthwhile sustainable jobs. We have squandered the £300 million we collected under the youth levy.  That levy should have been used for the creation of viable jobs.  I understand that the Government, and any Government, must operate with adequate finance but it was shortsighted of them to replace Exchequer expenditure with finance from the youth employment levy.  We must restore the amount spent on training prior to the introduction of the levy.  In future the manpower levy should be used for the creation of employment opportunities. I do not object to a small percentage of the levy being used for training purposes but unless we get away from the tendency to use the levy to keep people off the unemployment register we will make any progress.</P>
      <P>I have doubts about changing the youth employment levy to a manpower levy although I admit I am not familiar enough with this to condemn the change outright. I am concerned that the change that will result from the levy being used for all employment is going back into the trap we are trying to release ourselves from. It appears that again we will be using the levy to replace Exchequer expenditure.  I would prefer if the levy were used to help those under 25 years particularly in the transition from school to work.  Once and for all we should do something to help those who leave school or training to get a first break.  The amount of money collected from the levy could be usefully spent in that area.  Therefore, it should not be extended right across the board.  I look forward with interest to how the Minister will deal with this problem when he is replying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am concerned about the wastage of money in regard to training programmes. <Col N="1229" /> We must have much more efficient use of these programmes and I hope this new Authority will be the springboard for that, though I am sure of the importance of AnCO and those involved in it.  There is a need for re-assessment of many of the AnCO programmes, particularly their efficiency.  I will deal later with apprenticeships.</P>
    <P>Perhaps there is need for a new approach to the type and range of training being given and for a better response from AnCO towards opportunities. There has been criticism that AnCO continue to support the traditional trades, like jobs in building, without thinking of new employment opportunities throughout the country.  I will deal later with some of them.  One is marketing and international surpluses.  A key area for economic growth is our ability to produce top class marketeers.  We can look at the discipline of accountancy.  We have succeeded in getting an Institute of Chartered Accountants but we have not established marketing with the same status. An accountant must go through a much more extensive training period involving more skills than our marketing students. It is important that we make progress here.  Up to now the rate of our progress has been disastrous.  We must pay the same attention to international service industries where there is room for great growth and in which there is excellent employment potential.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce recently announced something in this regard.  Of course there is potential also in the field of international finance and insurance.  There is potential there for graduate employment.  We have had no worthwhile identification of the disadvantage of our geographical periphery which was militated against us in the past.</P>
    <P>These are all matters with huge potential for economic and employment growth but we do not seem to have copped on to it.  The amount of work we have succeeded in doing there has been successful and as a result some of our small business have benefited.  Our manpower policy must be tied closely with our economic and job creation policies. <Col N="1230" /> I was glad to see in the manpower White Paper that the Department of Labour will have a more central role in this regard.  It is a scandal that no Government have succeeded in paying proper attention to this.</P>
    <P>One of my main criticisms of AnCO is that they do not seem to have an open face and consequently we have massive squandering of money.  AnCO have been employing consultants and sending them to hotels in Galway, Tuam and elsewhere to give courses to graduates.  This must be stopped.  We must look at the strengths we have in regard to graduate training and ordinary community based training. AnCO are spending money foolishly in this regard.  I do not understand why they have to hold those courses in hotels and elsewhere.  We have many public buildings, schools and halls, in which these courses could be held to better advantage. In this respect I urge the Minister to pay particular attention to our third level colleges who could play an important joint role with AnCO in regard to graduate training.</P>
    <P>We can take UCG in which we have a number of people doing an important job among graduates, particularly in commerce, sciences, engineering.  The graduates can give the benefit of their skills to small businesses.  The Minister has been supporting the UCG initiative.  We have highly qualified people there who need only the resources to expand.  There should be a marriage of AnCO and the third level colleges and thereby young graduates could go out to small firms. This would be of mutual benefit to graduates and the firms concerned under the joint umbrella of the university and AnCO.  Professor Jim Ward in UCG is crying out for resources with which to expand the training potential but he cannot get them.  The sooner AnCO get into this through the universities and the regional technical colleges, the better.  It would be a way to bring about transition from school to work and it would mean full time productive work for graduates.</P>
    <P>Another criticism is in regard to the local base.  In County Galway, AnCO have a training centre which is limited <Col N="1231" /> because of its size and staffing ability. Limerick will be dealing with the external training programme for Galway, which seems a bit ridiculous.  The work being done by AnCO is good and the AnCO people who come along to give the courses are excellent.  But what is lacking is a local base.  My suggestion is that every location, founded on the VEC locations or even smaller as we expand, there would be established what I would term a community based training workshop, with the local community using its own strenghts to identify the training needs of the area.  An area's own strengths are, first, the people in the community where there is a whole variety of disciplines from bank managers to teachers to engineers to marketing people to production managers, right across the board but with the exception perhaps of the deprived communities which would have to be given special consideration.  There is there a plethora of expertise, of people who are anxious to lend their support. Those are the people who will form the local base for both training and placement. Second, there is in all communities the physical facilities which AnCO lack at the moment, and if they are not there it is possible for local communities to provide such facilities such as training centres, halls, schools and so on.  It is at that point, having pulled the local community together, and having had them identify what the needs of the community are, that one then gives them the opportunity to go to AnCO to tell them the training needs they have, and AnCO would then provide the expertise, the trainers, the instructors.  Here there would be a marrying of the local people and the statutory agency &mdash; AnCO in this case.  There is a crying need for that now. It is my one criticism of AnCO that they do not have a local base at the moment. I certainly look forward to this new Authority providing for that kind of development in the near future.</P>
    <P>In regard to the co-ordination of existing services, the Minister's main concern is to bring together the various agencies, <Col N="1232" /> AnCO, the National Manpower Service, the Youth Employment Agency and so on.  I welcome that development but I have a very serious worry about the effectiveness of the agency because of its size. it will involve quite an amount of very careful footwork on the part of the people involved to co-ordinate those services.</P>
    <P>There are a number of pre-requisites. The first is that the Youth Employment Agency should concentrate their efforts on long-term substainable jobs so far as possible.  Instead of the present widespread use of temporary schemes, we should give a very narrow base to temporary schemes, and the remainder of the work of the Youth Employment Agency should be in developing opportunities in long-term sustainable jobs.</P>
    <P>The second key element in worthwhile co-ordination is a new system which I believe must be brought in, that is, an integrated approach to the actual labour force.  It has been suggested that all people in the labour force should have specific identification.  This is a vitally important development.  Everybody in the work force should have a unique personnel number whether he is employed or unemployed so that the new central integrated computer system that is now being developed will be able to identify everybody, employed, unemployed and so on.  In addition to that being useful from the point of view of co-ordination among those agencies, it will be particularly useful to the Department of Social Welfare where there is an amount of duplication which results in people playing the system and getting money they are not entitled to.  Perhaps the Minister could tell us how far this development has progressed and what his future plans are for the development of this co-ordination.</P>
    <P>I would also suggest, in this context, that there be a link into the educational system.  Last week a young lady came to me for my assistance in gaining employment, and it was only when I informed her that she realised she should be registered with the National Manpower Agency.  I went to the Manpower office <Col N="1233" /> with this young lady to fill in a registration form.  It was my first time to visit a Manpower office and it was a chastening experience.  This lady, in filling up the registration form, had to fill out details of her past, simply off the top of her head.  It seems a bit ridiculous that there is not some follow-through from the educational system to the National Manpower Agency so that a file or disc would come forward automatically from the school giving the essential details of every students who finds it necessary to register with the National Manpower Agency. Here was a young lady with a break of five or six months filling up a registration form in the National Manpower Office off the top of her head.  She was trying to write down her past experience from memory.  There was a huge break there. This is the period when, particularly in areas where there are disadvantaged young people, the seeds of disaffection are sown.  I would like the Minister to consider in the co-ordination process, having some follow-through from the school system straight into the National Manpower Agency or AnCO or the Youth Employment Agency sector.  I know that will be difficult but it will be worthwhile.  We must be sure to keep close tabs on people, particularly those from disadvantaged areas &mdash; and I will deal with the social guarantee scheme in a few moments in that context.</P>
    <P>The levy and grant scheme which has been operating in AnCO has played an important part in training over many years but it is now agreed across the board that it has outlived its usefulness.  The whole approach to training must be looked at in a new light.  I am disappointed that the White Paper, while it has identified the problems, has not come up with any initiatives or alternatives.  I would like to put forward some initiatives that I feel are worth considering.  The levy and grant scheme is in need of being replaced.  There is a need for a much more flexible approach and this new approach should come from industry itself.  For instance, in the pharmaceutical and electronics areas, proposals were made by those sectors both to AnCO and <Col N="1234" /> the Minister for Labour, for a change in the levy and grant scheme but this change was not forthcoming because the flexibility they were proposing could not be adopted.</P>
    <P>The new approach should be the one that is recommended by the Confederation of Irish Industry and which has been very successful in a number of countries throughout the world.  That is the indenture system, where the emphasis would be on in-company training, on a training contract for all young people. I was just reading the most recent newsletter from the CII.  They say that in Germany, for instance, 75 per cent of school leavers are guaranteed a place in an industry for training purposes.  In Switzerland 60 per cent of school leavers are guaranteed a place in industry and in Ireland a miserable 6 per cent of school leavers are guaranteed a place in industry. That huge flaw in our system is the basic area we must tackle.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I propose that the way forward is in the indenture system or the in company training system whereby each company would provide a certain number of training places on the basis of a training contract of duration between one and four years.  The company would not be liable to that trainee other than as part of the training contract.  Therefore, it would not be an employment contract as such. Funding for this type of training could come from the company themselves but also from the State.  That would be a very useful way to spend the youth employment levy, or the manpower levy as it is now known.  I am confident that with proper development of the company, the training job could well become a fulltime, sustainable job.  Again I come back to the importance there of manpower policy and economic policy.</P>
    <P>I will give a little model which will illustrate what I mean.  Take the winners in this country in the small business sector, and I consider that there are quite a number of winners in the 800 strong small firms association.  Pick out the good companies in those areas and give them an indenture training programme.  Give them also the marketing training programme <Col N="1235" /> allied with an export facility. If you set up in Europe, for instance, marketing and warehousing facilities for the products of your small firms who are highly successful at home, I have no doubt that the potential those firms have for growth will ensure that the young people they have on this training scheme will in time be assimilated into the workforce of the firms as a result of their growth.  The combination of an effective marketing programme, an effective exporting programme and an effective training programme will ensure that the young people taken in under a training contract in many cases will continue as fulltime employees.  That kind of approach is sadly missing in this country to date.  One wonders what in the name of goodness people charged with responsibility for manpower training have been thinking about that they have not come up with a proposal such as that which has been so successful in Europe and which is so much better than attempting to train people in a training centre where it is not possible to assimilate the workplace situation.  I urge the new Authority to look carefully at this proposal and if it is not possible to implement it to give us good reasons for that.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the question of training for disadvantaged people and in that category I include people who come from a deprived background and people who are disabled.  I had the experience recently in my work in regard to youth policy of visiting the fourth floor of Ballymun flats to meet with Father Peter McVerry and five of the young fellows there who are homeless.  I wondered how in the name of goodness these guys could ever get a job, coming from the background that they come from.  We must pay special attention to those deprived kids.  There is no question that their only problem is the deprivation they have had to suffer in their short lives to date.  A special effort must be made in relation to those kids and industry itself more than anybody else has an important role to play in this.  A suggestion I feel could be of great assistance is that in addition to a <Col N="1236" /> greater effort being made to give those kids a better opportunity as regards education and training &mdash; to do that we must spend quite an amount of money &mdash; we should expand the youth encounter projects and so on which are doing quite well and expand also the training facilities which are in existence.  From there the most important step we can takes is to ensure that we provide the employment opportunities for these people.  Industry and in particular the leading industries have a role to play in this.  I would like to see discussions taking place between the Manpower Authority and the leaders in industry.  I am talking about the Smurfits, the Guinnesses, the Jacobs, the Digitals, the Wangs and other top firms.  It is time those firms were asked to take a quota of the deprived young people into their workforces.  I put it to you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, that the losses that are being caused to many businesses by the crime and vandalism which inevitably come from young people who are deprived could easily be made up by a greater effort on the part of those business people to provide employment places for many of those deprived kids. It is urgent now that discussions take place with those leaders in industry and this new Authority in an attempt to provide specific numbers of employment places for those deprived young people.</P>
    <P>The same applies to disabled young people and, indeed, to disabled people right across the board.  A new impetus is required from existing industry to provide a greater number of places for disabled people.  I know that some firms have made great progress in this regard but, having personal experience of assisting a disabled young person who had been through a very good training programme with the rehabilitation board, I realised that finding employment for that person was almost impossible.  Unless agreement is reached at a very high level between this manpower Authority and the various sectors of industry that a certain number of places will be made available, we are not going to go very far.  The training which will be vitally important <Col N="1237" /> to both those sectors will be useless unless employment is provided.</P>
    <P>This takes me to the question of job creation as part of the Authority's role and as a tie with the question of training. My criticism on a number of occasions in the House here of the Minister has been that we put too much emphasis on training and not enough emphasis on creating opportunities for sustainable jobs.  The link between the new manpower agency and the other agencies such as the IDA and the economic course of events that, we hope, will provide more jobs is vital. As much of the resources available as possible should be used to provide for expansion of jobs.  I have given two examples and the Minister and I during a short debate crossed swords on this question of the areas where jobs can be expanded.  I am satisfied that in this country now there is a clear possibility for the creation of thousands of extra new jobs, given the proper set of actions.</P>
    <P>I will outline some of the areas.  It is vital to this Manpower Authority that we should outline the areas.  I have mentioned the potential of the international services sector, of offshore banking and of international reinsurance.  If the Isle of Man can be successful, why cannot we?  I know we have to make decisions outside the Manpower area.  For instance, we cannot attract international services industries to this country while we continue to charge 50 per cent corporation tax.  To drop corporation tax would undoubtedly bring in more such industries.</P>
    <P>I mentioned food production.  The added value of our agricultural products, allied with a proper processing and marketing programme will create many jobs. We have on the shelf the 1983 IDA report on the food industry which identifies several areas of growth potential.  We can see how successful we have been in some food lines, for instance in the Kerry Coop. There is no reason why we cannot expand further into this area.  However, we are sadly lacking in people trained to process and market our food.  A former Minister of State at the Department of <Col N="1238" /> Agriculture told me he went to Germany to promote a number of small Irish firms who were exporting top quality beef. They had a massive highly successful display in a number of German supermarket chains but within six months each of the four chains they visited came back to this Minister complaining they could not get products delivered on time and that they could not get the same quality across the board.  It is scandalous that we, the prime beef producers in the world, cannot process and markets our beef and get it into supermarkets throughout Europe.  We have taken the easy way out: we have sold into intervention.  This is a huge growth area.  This is our huge natural resource, yet we have failed miserably to develop our raw materials in agriculture and to market them.  There is vast job creation potential here and a Manpower authority will have to do much work in bringing our workforce to the required level to compete with European companies. When I was not too long in the Dáil I brought in here a Danish appletart which I had bought in Gort to illustrate the point that it is so ridiculous one can buy in the west of Ireland a fresh cake made in Denmark and we cannot produce a similar product.  The reason why we cannot do it is because we have not kept up with technology in that area and have not used it to our advantage.</P>
    <P>We have not yet succeeded in developing the potential in traditional Irish industries and in convincing our people to support Irish industry.  Thousands of jobs could be created if Irish industry could compete with foreign products. That is not happening because we have not updated traditional Irish industries to compete with foreign imports and because we have not convinced the people that to be patriotic is to support Irish industry.  I do not suggest that anybody should buy an inferior Irish product but I have ample evidence that Irish products are not inferior.  The Government should assist traditional industries to develop in the disciplines in which they are weak and which is causing them to be unable to compete with imports.  There is no reason why industries such as the leather industry, the shoe industry, the <Col N="1239" /> furniture industry and so on should go to the wall if we eliminate the weaknesses and convince the people to support home industry.  I clashed with the Minister, Deputy John Bruton on the question of support for Irish industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>Employment surely relates to the creation of sustainable economic jobs.  This is my pet subject, although it is not the pet subject of very many other people.  If we could convince the people to support Irish industry, thousands of jobs would be saved and more would be created.  It is a scandal that companies such as Mattersons in Limerick and O'Dearest are going out of business.  A small example is the little co-operative set up in Westport where when the company went into liquidation the workers bought out the firm and now we have West Coast shoes.  I am wearing a pair of them and they are the best shoes I ever wore.  If we could convince people to support those products it would be a great thing.  We should put emphasis on that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have 800 firms in the Small Firms Association, the vast majority of which are doing exceptionally well though they lack the expertise to get into exports.  So that they can be successful in the export market we should provide the back-up to enable them to be successful.  We should provide a sales and distribution facility for them.  We should, for instance, set up a warehouse facility in central Europe which could be used for small Irish industries as a distribution point, backed up by <Col N="1240" /> a sales force throughout Europe.  The same should be done to encourage the other markets, the Middle East markets and some of the Third World markets. There is no reason why these companies which are winners at home could not be winners abroad.  I mentioned these four or five areas where there is potential but they are only four or five out of a larger number which are clearly identifiable.</P>
    <P>I wish the new Authority well in their endeavours and I am satisfied that there is a very difficult task to be done.  However, the ground work has been laid and the manpower policy set out in the Minister's White Paper is something with which I agree.  I compliment him on the work he has done in this regard.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the fact that the youth levy will be changed to a manpower levy.  I should also like to see an increased representation of young people on the Authority so that they will have a more adequate input.  However, the overall thrust of the policy and the legislation are welcome and we all wish the Bill well.</P>

      <P>I have been waiting for a long time.  I do not intend to speak for an hour or so although I wish to make a number of points.  We are in general support of the principle of rationalisation encompassed in the Bill as there is a need for it.  We recognise that there has been considerable waste and far too much complexity in the present system.  People have great difficulty in knowing which body is responsible for what as there are so many temporary training and employment <Col N="1241" /> schemes.  The people for whom they have been designed simply do not understand the system.</P>
      <P>Like all the speakers so far, I have considerable criticisms regarding the existing system.  Nobody seems to be satisfied with the present system involving AnCo, Manpower, the Youth Employment Agency and so on.  The only organisation with which people are satisfied is CERT.</P>
      <P>When the youth employment levy was established about five or six years ago, there were no objections from the PAYE sector, who would be paying it, because they recognised that a special effort was needed to create jobs for young people. They saw the need for hope for their own children and were quite willing to pay such a levy.  Unfortunately, it was not an employment levy, as was borne out by the Minister in reply to questions of mine last year.  When I made inquiries in regard to the amount of money collected from the levy and the number of permanent jobs created by it I was told that the sum collected was £253.433 million.  The Minister could not give an indication of any full time jobs created although he gave details of temporary employment and training schemes.  No permanent jobs were created as a result of the youth employment levy and that is still the position. The Minister indicated that huge numbers were trained and that some of them got temporary employment of up to six months or so but that only causes further depression because when people go into new jobs with great enthusiasm their despair is even greater when they are laid off.  The same applies to the Civil Service which provided 1,000 temporary jobs at £60 per week.  It is worse to be employed for a while and then to be laid off then never to have known what it was like to work.  People's hopes are built up but then they are dashed and they head for the boat.  Most of those who emigrated saw no prospect of ever getting temporary work in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is significant that this legislation is entitled The National Employment and Training Authority Bill and that under section 25 &ldquo;youth employment levy&rdquo; will <Col N="1242" /> be changed to &ldquo;youth employment and training levy&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">

      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry, the Minister is quite right.  The point I am making is that originally we had an employment levy which did not create employment.  It was really a training levy and now we are calling it an employment and training levy.  It is recognising a fact but there is nothing in the Bill which indicates a change of attitude, mandate or terms of reference which would place more emphasis on employment than on training.</P>
      <P>The youth employment levy was supposed to be applied to everybody. However, farmers and self-employed have, without odium being heaped on them, refused to pay it.  There has not been any publicity about this although I presume that their sons and daughteres are availing of AnCO and other schemes. They are reaping the benefits while other people pay.  In reply to a question, the Minister said that in 1982-83, £2.46 million was unpaid by the farmers and that £4.9 million was unpaid by the self-employed, that in 1983-84, £3.20 million was outstanding from farmers while £6.2 million was outstanding from the self-employed, that in 1984-85, £3.20 million was outstanding from farmers and £8.2 million from the self-employed, that in 1985-86 a sum of £3.80 million was outstanding from farmers and £9.5 million from the self-employed, making a total of over £12.8 million outstanding farmers and over £28 million outstanding from the self-employed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I say, they still availed of the facilities provided by the levy paid by PAYE workers.  It is a scandal and it is one of the things which make farmers feel so ashamed and embarrassed.  As a result, a group of farmers in Kildare said that they wanted to pay the land tax.  They said they wanted to make a contribution and that they were embarrassed by Joe Rea, by the IFA and by the farmers who do not pay income tax, the land tax, health <Col N="1243" /> levies or the youth employment levy but who still want all the handouts.  It is up to the various Ministers responsible, in this case the Minister for Labour, to insist that this money be paid by farmers and if it is not paid by farmers should not avail of the services for which they are refusing to pay such as health services and youth employment schemes.</P>
    <P>There were many criticisms of the existing system made by previous speakers. I have many criticisms also particularly with regard to the National Manpower Service who are regarded as a joke and a farce.  When somebody comes to you and asks if there is any chance of a job and you ask them about the National Manpower Service they will tell you to forget about them.  They register and that is the end of the story.  They go on to the employment exchange.  A previous speaker referred to the fact that before the National Manpower Service was set up these offices were called employment exchanges.  I think they are still called employment exchanges but they do not deal with employment.</P>
    <P>When they were employment exchanges they either told you that there was a job available or if there was not they paid you.  Now you go into a labour or an employment exchange and you are put on unemployment assistance.  A week later they tell you that you are not being paid as they believe you are not seeking work.  You are cut off and receive no money.  You have to prove that you are looking for work.  You say that you are registered with the National Manpower Service but they laugh at that and say that that is no proof that you are looking for work and they want you to prove that you are going around looking for jobs. You then have to proceed taking buses around the city, even out to a building site in Tallaght, to seek employment and to try to get a letter from prospective employers to say that you had called out to seek a job from them.</P>
    <P>No account is taken of the amount of money spent on bus fares.  The National Manpower Service are supposed to tell you where the jobs are.  Surely, it is their <Col N="1244" /> responsibility to have an idea of where the jobs are available?  If the jobs are available, they should tell you.  If you refuse to take a job, there is some justification for the labour exchange cutting you off but they cut people off despite the fact they are registered with the National Manpower Service and until they show at least three refusals.  If that is not a joke, I do not know what a joke is or what purpose or role the National Manpower Service have.  They do not keep a register of the jobs which are available; they do not keep in touch with employers and they do not inform people registered with them whether jobs are available or not.</P>
    <P>A previous speaker said that the National Manpower Service and AnCO may have some relevance to urban areas but have no relevance to rural areas.  I agree absolutely that they have no relevance to rural areas but I want to make the point that they have no relevance to urban areas either.  I am delighted that under the new system this may change. The role of the National Manpower Service was unbelieveably bad.  It was a grave mistake to set up AnCO and it was also a waste of funds.  They proceeded to set up a training system side by side with a system which already existed.  A system which existed in the VECs for educating and training apprentices was taken over by AnCO who built new premises and employed new teachers.  They set up a new course of training for apprentices. They hired private individuals and groups to provide training schemes for six to eight weeks in order to take young people off the live register.  Many of these courses are a farce and have no relevance to the ordinary working-class people who are taken off the live register.  AnCO developed this training scheme without relating it to what existed already.  This was a major mistake.  AnCO now have a staff of over 2,000 who do excellent work in the context of the mandate they were given.  The mandate which they were given is totally wrong and their terms of reference are totally wrong.</P>
    <P>The VECs had their own premises and teachers.  What is happening is that the VEC system is being deprived of <Col N="1245" /> resources.  The Minister in opening this debate on 27 November said that in 1965 with the exception of CERT and the vocational education schools that there was little or no training being done and AnCO were only on the drawing board. What was wrong with CERT and the vocational education schools?  The Minister went on to point out that at that time they were training 22,500 young people.  He made the point that this number increased following the youth employment levy in 1986 to 66,500.  The difference in the unemployment figure between 1981 and 1986 made it absolutely essential that something be done to keep them quiet.  Approximately 100,000 more people were out of work in 1986 than in 1981.  Therefore, these schemes were set up.</P>
    <P>CERT and the vocational education schools were engaged in training 22,500 young people before the Youth Employment Agency was established and when AnCO was still only on the drawing board.  Today the Minister said that AnCO is training nearly 15,000 people at any one time.  In addition, we now have comprehensive and community schools, regional technical colleges and the national institutes of higher education. The VECs who have provided training and education, particularly for working class children down through the years, have done an excellent job and have been in constant communication and association with the construction industry and with other industries such as the motor trade.  They applied their courses in accordance with the new technology which was being developed at all times for over 40 years.  The VECs have been deprived of resources both as a result of the development of AnCO and as a result of the development of the new comprehensive and community schools.  It has reached the stage now where the Minister for Education, according to the Green Paper, wants to wipe out the VEC system altogether.  This is an indication of the attitude of this Government.  Many speakers have referred to the deprived and disadvantaged areas which need to be helped.  These areas have simply become <Col N="1246" /> more deprived and disadvantaged in educational terms, as well as in the area of jobs.  The VEC system which provided education for working-class children right up to third level is now being starved of resources and is scheduled to be wiped out.</P>
    <P>AnCO should have been working hand in hand with the VEC schools.  In Ballyfermot the VEC school is across the road from the major AnCO centre.  They are less than 100 yards apart.  The principal of the VEC co-operates fully with AnCO but unfortunately AnCO are not allowed to continue that co-ordination or to develop the system which was assisting the school and AnCO.  AnCO must develop their own new courses with their own teachers.  As a result the jobs have been created in AnCO.  These are not jobs for young people but jobs for people engaged in training young people for temporary jobs.</P>
    <P>I have been talking about the waste of resources by AnCO which can be contrasted with the excellent example being given by CERT.  I support Deputies who have called for CERT to retain their identity and autonomy under this new system.  CERT train annually 7,000 people, while 15,000 are trained annually through AnCO.  CERT work with a staff of 72 while AnCO employ 2,300 people. How do CERT do this?  They do it through the VEC schools and the RTCs and by giving training courses in some hotels during the off season.  They are able to do all this without any new premises and in most cases without any new teachers.  They are using the resources which are there already and the premises which are available.  They have integrated into one industry.  This is the reason for the strength and efficiency of CERT and their success in achieving 100 per cent placement for their trainees. They know the industry in which they are involved.  There are approximately 11,000 establishments involved and 7,000 employed in the industry.  CERT are fully aware of what is going on.  They are aware of the different skills needed in the industry and they are in touch with the schools and training establishments to see that <Col N="1247" /> these skills are taught, if necessary through changes in curricula.  They know about the skills required and where the jobs are.  Thus they are able to achieve 100 per cent placement for full time students and 90 per cent from those taking courses from the unemployed.  They pay particular attention to the unemployed and what have been called the deprived and disadvantaged in working-class areas.  They are doing a tremendous job in a highly co-ordinated manner.  They are providing a guideline for AnCO and this new Authority.  Training should be geared to the needs of industry.  In the area of employment surely industry should be in touch with the State and semi-State companies in regard to expansion. The food industry has been mentioned and also expansion into subsidiary companies through co-ordination with the training authority to provide placement and employment for people in various areas.</P>
    <P>Incidentally, what happens to the National Department Corporation?  Is it still alive?  If it is, surely it has a role to play in co-ordination with the National Employment and Training Authority.</P>

      <P>A lot of people have.  If it is to have a role it should co-ordinate with this new Authority in establishing new industries or expanding existing industries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I emphasise the need for CERT to retain their autonomy and not to become lost within this new Authority.  CERT have a very special place and very high prestige.  They were established as a limited company.  Unfortunately the Bill refers to winding up CERT.  I hope this will not happen.  The council of CERT have put forward four points which seem <Col N="1248" /> to be reasonable.  They are, first, for CERT to retain their legal status as a limited company; secondly, that in the memorandum and articles of association of the existing CERT the Minister's position be assumed by the new proposed authority; thirdly, that the council of CERT report to the proposed new authority, and that they be under and responsible to that board; fourthly, that CERT work closely with the proposed new Authority to ensure the optimal use of resources and services.</P>
    <P>CERT are very important nationally through the hotels and tourism industry, but internationally they are also recognised and have a certain prestige.  It is important that that identity be retained and not lost in this National Employment and Training Authority. They recognise, as I do, that in the whole rationalisation process they must work together in all the training areas and placement areas of this new Authority.  It seems that the proposals made by them that the articles of association be changed to put the board and the new Authority in place of the Minister but that CERT be still retained as a limited company, keeping their name and reporting to the new board of the new Authority, should be followed.  If that is done, the new Authority will find they will learn and gain more from CERT and from the methods which CERT use than if CERT were wiped out or subsumed in some way into the new Authority.  I hope the Minister will agree to this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Prendergast</NameTxt>
      <P>Like all the other speakers and as somebody who has been personally involved in this area through the trade union movement, I welcome the Bill.  I congratulate the Minister, especially, for his imaginative approach to the need for a new manpower policy at this time in our history.  As he mentioned in his opening speech, it is 21 years since we last had a White Paper on Manpower Policy.  Indeed, as every young school leaver knows, the world has changed totally beyond what anybody could have conceived at that time.  It is absolutely timely and relevant that the Government should introduce an overall <Col N="1249" /> manpower policy and in the process of so doing co-ordinate or integrate the existing services which are mentioned in the Bill, the National Manpower Service, the Youth Employment Agency, CERT and AnCO, as a means of optimising all the facilities and resources at the disposal of the State.  The basic need is a harmonisation and gradual integration of training and education.</P>
      <P>The essential priority, the <i>sine qua non</i> of this whole scheme, if it is to succeed, is that we must know what we are training people for.  There is no point in spending valuable and scarce resources if we do not know what we are going to finish up with.  Will we have a highly educated and trained workforce with nothing to do?  In a different Department, in Education, under the curriculum development programme, it is essential that somebody should sit down and look ten to 20 years into the future and see where this country is going, what our strengths are and where we can work better to provide good worthwhile careers.  I am not just talking about jobs, I am talking about careers.  This can be done and the great value this paper affords us is that it will force the Government and all of us to concentrate on this aspect.</P>
      <P>I had the good fortune recently, as a member of the Oireachtas Committee on Public Expenditure to lead a deputation to Switzerland.  That is a small country of 6.5 million people.  They have an unemployment rate of only 8 of 1 per cent. There are only 30,000 unemployed out of 6.5 million people.  I am saying that to illustrate, that we can do things if we set about doing them properly, provided that we plan and structure our approach, that we set ourselves a target and a goal and move towards it.  It sounds like a cliché but it needs to be said &mdash; we now have the best educated and trained workforce we have ever had in our history.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the level of emigration is deplorable, if we cannot find worthwhile employment for our people here &mdash; which is the objective of all of us &mdash; it is essential that they be trained and equipped to be able to give themselves a career wherever <Col N="1250" /> they finish up, whether in Britain, in another EC country or elsewhere.  There is an air of gloom and hopelessness about at present.  My eldest son, a graduate from the NIHE in Limerick, is in London with many more of his colleagues, which is very sad.  The great advantage of this scheme is that it will, I hope &mdash; and I have not seen it spelled out clearly &mdash; ensure that somebody is looking at where we are going, at our manpower requirements and our training and education requirements.  Are we gearing our training towards our actual needs?  One of the criticisms that have been made of the existing institutions we are now proposing to merge is that they seem to be going around and around like a rudderless boat on a lake.  We must know where we are going so that people will have the morale and incentive to work effectively.</P>
    <P>Much has been said about the role of AnCO and as a former national president of a 32-county craft union, I welcomed the introduction of AnCO into the training arena.  Unions like my own were the traditional sources of training people within their own limited resources.  Many of them, with great foresight, set up schools, such as in the early part of this century in my own city of Limerick, but with very limited resources.  The State did not become involved.  AnCO are now providing excellent training, the quality of which is as good as anything in Europe. They caused ripples in the trade union movement at their commencement because they were talking about a year's off-the-job training which at the time was then an almost unknown concept.  The trade unions, naturally, felt their own position would be undermined.  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions mentioned in their comments on the Minister's proposals that it is important that there be the fullest consultations with the trade union movement.  Already, one can see an erosion of the traditional crafts in the output from the regional technical colleges over the past number of years.  They are doing excellent work, which has already been referred to by the Minister. They are releasing into the system a new <Col N="1251" /> species of animal &mdash; the technician.  There is no doubt but that the combined value of the technicians is going to release new knowledge, skill, resources, imagination and ideas into the economic system.  It is important, therefore that the traditional craft unions be brought along with that and that they have a big input into the planning and operation of the new scheme.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the fact that we are greatly indebted to our membership of the EC for the funds they supply by way of grants for training from the Social Fund.  This year alone we will get £120 million from the EC and I cannot think of any better way to spend taxpayers' money.  Let it be said loud and clear, and let the message be repeated every day in every school and college, that all worthwhile jobs and careers in the future will be knowledge based.  The day when somebody could walk away from school having completed sixth class primary level and hope to pick up a job is gone.  We must produce trained and educated people.</P>
    <P>I have been involved for the last 14 years in the VEC system which was set up under the 1930 Act.  This system was often sneered at and derided and it never received full recognition for the contribution it made to the economy.  That 1930 Act was one of the most far sighted ever introduced in this House.  There is the natural synthesis between thesis and antithesis.  Some of the teachers of the traditional crafts feel under pressure at what is seen as the expansion of the almost <i>lebensraum</i> tendency of AnCO.  I am not using that word pejoratively.  I know the wonderful work AnCO have done, but they will be aware of the inhibitions and the worries of some of the teachers in the VEC system about what has been happening in the past few years and what is proposed here.</P>
    <P>The Minister should ask the people on this committee to consult fully with the other training authority which has been with us for the last 56 years, the VEC, as distinct from the traditional classical education system of private <Col N="1252" /> schools.  That discussion can only be of benefit to all.  It might be timely to review some of the things that have been happening. At present in most of the VEC schemes the ESF fund runs for a period of two years.  I ask the Minister to see if that scheme could be extended to allow degrees of a technical nature to be taken through the third level colleges as distinct from the universities.  In my own city 74 per cent of the people attending third level VEC facilities, three out of every four, have free education for the first two years by way of European Social Fund grants and scholarships.  That is a magnificent democratic input into education, because traditionally the children of the working class &mdash; I am talking about the ordinary people working and living in corporation and county council housing estates &mdash; cannot get into the third level education system as applied by the universities. I think only about 4 per cent of such people manage to get into that system by some extraordinary circumstances whereas 96 per cent of university graduates come from the middle classes and whatever is better than that. This is a wonderful opportunity to redress that imbalance and to make provision for an extended application of the ESF loans, grant and scholarships to people who have the technical skill to make a great input into our economic requirements.</P>
    <P>It is very unfair that one section of our community, the farming community in particular, have refused to pay the youth training levy yet these farmers expect their children to benefit under the system and righty so.  Nobody is objecting to these children availing of the system because all children must be given equal access to training and education but a certain balancing mechanism should be introduced into the system.  The Minister for Labour is one of our more imaginative Ministers and this has been recognised by his peers in other Governments throughout Europe and by the OECD.  The entire nation would be in his debt if he were able to build into this system a correcting mechanism whereby anybody who wished to avail of the system should be allowed do so provided their parents had <Col N="1253" /> made a fair and equitable contribution to the system.  I want to emphasise that I am not speaking about imposing penalties on people who cannot afford this.  I am saying the very opposite.  There should be no free rides for those who can afford to pay.  The farming organisations have said they wish to follow the much maligned land tax scheme.  If the farming community want something for their children they should at least be prepared in natural justice and equity and in fairness to the PAYE sector, to make a proportionate contribution.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister for his personal commitment and input into the national manpower policy.  I was an Irish Congress of Trade Unions nominee to the board which considered curriculum development in my own region in the training centre at St. Patrick's Comprehensive School, Shannon Airport.  We looked at the need for relevant intervention in the learning process.  It is crucial that this should not just be a pious aspiration.  The Minister said the Department of Labour were responsible for manpower policy and for overseeing implementation of the range of manpower programmes.  He went on to refer to the transition to working life, to improve the transition from school to work by means of placement, guidance and relevant youth programmes.  I was involved in the mid-west region in the pioneer work which was carried out in 21 centres throughout Europe, four of them in Ireland.  This will be the key to the success of the programme.  We must decide where we want to go and then arrange our resources.  On the training side the Minister said we must ensure an adequate supply of highly qualified and skilled manpower for the needs of the economy, to improve overall skill levels and to motivate the labour force, to provide opportunities to acquire skills appropriate to jobs which are or are likely to become available, and to assist enterprises and workers to cope with occupational, structural and technological change.</P>
    <P>I have been involved, as we all have, with excellent people who did not have <Col N="1254" /> the opportunity, through strained home circumstances, to continue their education. They got jobs but they would obviously have benefited from higher education if they had the opportunity.  I ask the Minister to ask this body to have regard to second chance education for people with the natural talent and skill who were crippled by domestic circumstances and did not have access to the educational requirements necessary to bring them further in life and develop their talents.  They will now have had the advantage of working in a factory or in some other job and will benefit by access to second chance education.  I am talking about a new imaginative area.  Perhaps the employers would agree to release those people from work for six months or a year so that they could acquire additional skills.</P>
    <P>I hope I will be excused for being parochial but I am talking about the training and development centre for the unemployed in the NIHE in Limerick.  It is a new facet of NIHE's activities there. There is a pilot programme which is highly imaginative and responds to the needs of our times.  They need extra money but I do not want to get into any political row in the trade union movement. They have the facilities and the resources there which were paid for by the World Bank.  They have the personnel and the skill.  I say to the Minister who is now engaged in the preparation of estimates that people who want to go back to education should not be denied that opportunity for the wrong reasons.  I ask the Minister, through his Department and through the Department of Education, to have regard to that.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister.  He is one of the people who commands my respect because of his imaginative approach.  He gave guarantees to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and to everybody else that he would look at the whole national manpower policy.  Alvin Tofler, in his book, <i>Future Shock</i> said that we are moving through the median strip of history.  The person born in the first decade of this century saw more change in his or her lifetime than the world experienced since <Col N="1255" /> Our Lord or Julius Caesar walked the earth.  We are faced with massive adverse impacts of cyclical and structural unemployment to a degree that neither we nor the other countries of Europe or elsewhere have coped with.  It is a whole new pheonmenon.  We are experiencing the third industrial revolution.  We have to cope with that; we cannot run away from it or be overawed by it.  We should look at it systematically and imaginatively because the vision must always be finer than the view.  We have the capacity to be as good as or better than most other nations and I do not say that as a platitude. Our workforce with their inherent, latent talents and skills will take on the best in Europe and in the world.  I worked in Brussels and Strasbourg for 15 months with the socialist group in the EC Parliament on the very same subject that we are talking about here.  I am convinced, and I assert not in any petty or meaningless way, that the Irish youth, given a chance to release their energy and skills, will take over Europe in a few years time.</P>
    <P>It is supremely important that a huge section of our workforce, the females in industry and services, know what is open to them.  They have an unreleased torrent of energy, skill and knowledge.  On behalf of the ICTU I ask the Minister to deal with that and to spell it out clearly.  Again I commend the Minister and the Government for a very worthwhile and imaginative document.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one area of Government activity that has the goodwill of the Irish people and that is summed up in the title of this Bill, The National Employment and Training Authority Bill.  There is no doubt that there is a fund of goodwill towards new initiatives and the payment of the necessary price.  I never saw any objection by the public to having very sizeable sums of money spent on their behalf in training and job creation.  All they ask in response is that whatever system evolves from this House would be effective and efficient and that it would give good value for money.  The Irish people ask for nothing <Col N="1256" /> else.  They have given most generously during the years from their scarce resources.  Even in these pinching times it is still possible to go back to them if we have a formula whereby their children or their children's children will have gainful employment in the future.</P>
      <P>This cannot be seen to any greater effect than in the youth employment levy which is being altered radically in this legislation.  When that youth employment levy was placed on the workforce the expectation was that there would be some direct relationship between the jobs created and the amount of money allocated. It was preached at that time that this money would be specifically used for the purpose of creating jobs for young people.  The general public and taxpayers have some misgivings that this has not worked well.  They feel that if the £100 million they give every year was used properly for the stated aim for which it was collected, it should be able to return up to 10,000 permanent jobs per year.  I am using the yardstick for £10,000 per job.</P>
      <P>It was always felt that at least one full time job might be made available with that kind of expenditure.  If that were the case we could have provided by that 1 per cent levy, half the total number of jobs necessary each year to cater for our growing population.  All the other moneys that the Government might expend on training, in development corporations or in all the other enterprise agencies could have been used in any way as long as this levy money produced the jobs to match it.  That has not happened. It is a shame that the Minister now sees fit to change that levy and to call it the employment and training levy.  It seems like an admission of failure.  The money that ordinary people thought was going towards the direct creation of jobs for their children is now being channelled officially for the first time into training programmes, training programmes that are funded already by other agencies.  It appears there is a fundamental change in the whole question of the levy application.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are those who suggest that <Col N="1257" /> unemployment is endemic here but I do not accept that philosophy.  The record of the Government has been bad and the statistics being trotted out in the House will not make the Minister any more comfortable or make me feel any better. However, it is a pity that the Minister, if he has the innovation many of his colleagues give him credit for &mdash; in fairness to him he has been very active as a Minister although he may not have produced the goods in regard to unemployment &mdash; did not have the courage to reiterate the hope expressed by every Minister for Labour since the foundation of the State, that full employment is an attainable goal.  In my view it is an attainable goal but, unfortunately we are moving away from it.  Somehow we are condemning the population to an acceptance that we will have high levels of unemployment for all time and that we might as well prepare for it.  The view is that we should do whatever is necessary by way of training to accommodate these people, as suggested in section 4, in their efforts to get employment elsewhere in the European Community.</P>
    <P>I do not have any objection to well-educated and trained people going off to gain experience in other jurisdictions.  We have gained enormously from that practice in the past and it will continue irrespective of what we do.  If we had full employment here a sizeable number of the go-getters and more aggressive types would seek their fortune and more experience in other climates.  People who have left with that aim have returned and helped to boost our training process.  I do not have any objection to that.  However, full employment was the yardstick by which elections were won in the past.  We all heard the claim that full employment would be achieved.  Only a few years ago we had fewer than 100,000 unemployed, many of whom were unemployable.  Had the register been properly adjusted and had those who were unemployable or not willing to accept employment been removed it would be seen as close as possible to full employment that we could get here.</P>
    <P>I would have been happier had the <Col N="1258" /> Minister been more aggressive in stating that his wish and target was full employment. He would get some stick from the media if he said that he would be accused of making a pie-in-the-sky statement but it would not be viewed as such by the 250,000 who wish he would say it.</P>

      <P>The Minister should not because he was never one to shy away from the hard word, irrespective of how it was received.  If a statement stands up to analysis he should not be afraid to make it.  However, I will make the statement for the Minister.  Full employment is still the aim of our party and I would like to think it is the aim of the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems incredible in a country with 32 million acres and 3,500,000 people in the Republic &mdash; no more than there is in a medium-sized city in any other country &mdash; that with the variety of opportunities and resources we have in agriculture, fisheries, manufacturing and tourism we cannot provide 20,000 new jobs per year.  There is something desperately wrong if we cannot do that.  I hope the legislation before us will in some way redress that.</P>

      <P>It is hoped that the weaknesses in the system heretofore &mdash; the Minister has identified some of them but I am sure he has not identified them all &mdash; will be rectified by this legislation.  If he succeeds in doing that he will have carved a little niche for himself in his short time in the Department.</P>
      <P>The general public want to be assured that their money is being well spent.  They have a genuine grievance that the hundreds of million of pounds spent in recent years has not resulted in a good return in the form of new jobs or more permanent positions.  I am sorry that section 25 will allow all the money that is coming in under that heading to be swallowed up in the general fund.  It appears that money will be moving away from job creation to training for jobs.  I accept there has to be cohesion but the youth employment levy registered in the minds of people as a special fund for a special job of work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>If a person gets a job because he or she was trained, does that not justify the levy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Excellent, but we have already spent hundreds of millions of pounds and have had other agencies engaged in carrying out the training.  The intention was that the fund would create jobs for those who have been trained.  It was intended to use it in a special way or otherwise it would have been seen as extra tax on income.  It has been called a special tax on income but for a special reason that is being changed in section 25.  I do not like that.  It may be a small thing to the Minister but the thrust of the legislation is to change the original attitude.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before I make some comments about my area of responsibility, tourism, I should like to refer to a number of provisions in the Bill.  I have always held the view that Manpower offices were badly located.  Officials in them did a good job but I wonder why the Department did not locate such offices in the same building as the labour exchange?  For a system to work well, duplication must be eliminitiated and that is one of the reasons <Col N="1260" /> the Bill was introduced.  Having the two offices operating in different districts in towns or cities does not make any sense to me.  A person who goes in to sign on for unemployment benefit or assistance should be able to call to the Manpower or placement centre in the same building. That would eliminate a lot of tension among young people and the proliferation of small agencies being set up by trade unions, community associations and others in an effort to muscle in on the Manpower service.  That will diminish the strength that should be in the Manpower service.</P>
    <P>I have heard some criticism of the manpower service and AnCO but in my view those agencies operate to as high a level of efficiency as they are permitted.  The instructions they get from the Department will determine how good, efficient and cost-effective they are going to be. A plethora of small, smug agencies have been set up by organisations and groups but I am not sure that they are helping out in placements.  The Minister should contact the Minister for Social Welfare and come to an arrangement about the location of the various services that are relevant to the person looking for a job in one premises.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be glad to hear that is one of the intentions of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to hear that. I take it the Minister has the co-operation of his colleagues?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>She will have a nominee on the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Can we expect a location to cater for the whole range, including the agencies for which the Minister for Industry and Commerce is responsible? Perhaps it will be a good speculative type of thing from which advice would be forthcoming.  I welcomed the enterprise allowance scheme but I regret that its funds have been frozen.  I should like to see that position changed because the lack of finance does not make any sense. <Col N="1261" /> A person who was paid £30 a week under that scheme will now be paid £35 a week at another hatch, and that does not make sense.  Many schemes have been started by legislation but they were continued and they suffered from Parkinson's Law. Some schemes were continued <i>ad infinitum</i>, long after their usefulness had ceased.  If there is a scheme or an agency which is not making its way we should not continue to throw money into it. There are many enterprises into which money could be well put, but we should not continue forever to support agencies which are nothing but shams.</P>
      <P>There has been reference to the need for training.  There is no question about that and I hope the new board will be successful in carrying out their function in that regard.  A fair bit of stick is being given to the Government by disillusioned young people who have been disappointed with half jobs for half weeks for half pay.  I am afraid there has been too much preoccupation with reducing the numbers on the live register.  Part-time workers find it hard to understand why the Government would need them for six months or 12 months and then, though the need was still there, they were not kept on for longer.</P>
      <P>Consider, for example, the special employment scheme.  People have been asking why the £70 or £75 pay for half a week could not be topped up to make it £100 a week and the workers made permanent.  If the Minister says it is a question of money, there are many other enterprises where money is being spent more foolishly.  Much good work was done under that special scheme, like essential environmental work.  Many communities were grateful they were getting value for part of the taxes they were paying.  If there is £120 million available from Europe for other schemes, if the EC are really concerned about us as a peripheral region and if the less advantaged regions are to be developed, they should be prepared to spend some money and the Minister would be thanked if he could get that money.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>We are going in that direction and I hope the Deputy will convince Mayo farmers to support it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has their goodwill.  They are prepared to work. The office in Castlebar had more schemes approved and work done than any other similar sized town in Ireland.  The gratifying thing about that scheme was that when the people in Mayo had finished the work they were back seeking another chance in another scheme.  They are not layabouts.  There has been a feeling that small farmers in the west want only to suck from the State and are not prepared to work.  The Minister would be well advised to continue that scheme and I hope the existing staff will be well catered for.  To put it in simple terms, I understand they will maintain their Civil Service status.  The Minister should be a little more generous in respect of boards and agencies.  Changover periods were considered when other semi-State agencies were changed in the past.  There is also a big change in the PRSI and pensions contributions of some of these agencies. None of the existing staffs should be worse off financially.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>They will not be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to hear the Minister has arranged that compensation that is necessary for existing staff changing their status will not disadvantage those who have given good service over so many years.  If we are to build up the momentum the Minister is talking about and get the goodwill that I know is outside, it is important to have security of employment in place for these staffs because they are in some small dread that there might be a shedding of staffs when the amalgamation takes place.  If they had been covered by the Civil Service loss of office provisions rather than the redundancy Acts they would have been better protected.  The Minister might yet consider giving them that status.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The basic aim of the new legislation is to unify the principal agencies engaged in the work of training and of placement. <Col N="1263" /> There is a general belief that there has been a proliferation of agencies and that is why the goodwill is there now to see a change in this aspect of our training situation.  Whatever kudos we give out to the individuals involved in the existing agencies, let us not get carried away. There is quite an amount of scope for improved efficiency all round and for a shedding of the little schemes that were added for no good reason and which have not resulted in any worthwhile progress towards the national employment this Bill refers to.</P>
    <P>I would like to comment on tourism and on how this legislation impacts greatly on it.  There is no doubt but that a Manpower policy is essential for the development of the tourist industry. Hotel, catering and tourism training in general must be maintained at as high a level of efficiency as that which exists now, and it must be improved upon.  Perhaps that might not be achieved in the way suggested in this legislation.  It is intended that the existing CERT programme will be transferred to an industrial training committee.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>No, that is not exactly the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not exactly accurate but, by and large, that is what will happen and that would mean that there would be no more reporting of progress and development by the organisation known as CERT as there was heretofore.  There would be no more reporting directly to a Minister, and whatever we might say about organisations and their wish to separate or be divorced from the parent Minister, at the same time the fact that organisations that were responsible to and reported directly to Ministers had to keep up a high level of performance has stood us in good stead.  The situation will change radically now.  This organisation, responsible for training in the hotel, catering and tourist industry will be reporting to a committee who will report later to the head of training of the new board; they will report further down the line to the chief executive officer who <Col N="1264" /> will be nominated or designated by the Minister before he leaves office, and then the chief executive officer will report further down the line to the board of the new agency; after that the board would finally find their way to report to the Minister.  That is a pretty cumbersome bit of reporting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the Deputy quoting from, because no decision has been taken about structures?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am saying it is suggested that there will be an industrial committee in the new structure as a controlling agency for the place of CERT, and if that were the case it could only have that kind of reporting structure which, to me, seems cumbersome.  As far as I am concerned this must lead to a diminishing of the role of the organisation that has served the tourism industry well.  I have a particular interest in the tourism industry not just because I am the party spokesman for it but because I believe that that industry has not played the part in the economic development of this country or in the creation of jobs that it is capable of doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I would agree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it has achieved that.  We are inclined to be slipshod about it and say that it is the Cinderella industry anyway and let it roll on of its own accord.  It has never had the political clout to enable it to have its agency, Bord Fáilte, report directly to the Minister so that he could set down the guidelines for it and then demand the results so that we would not talk all the time about hundreds of thousands of tourists as if that were the only thing we were talking about.  I would love to see written down just once in a report the number of pure tourists who made their way into this country solely because of the expenditure of £30 million by Bord Fáilte last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to see a change as well in the amount of money from the £30 million that finds its way into the promotion of the tourist industry, for marketing and promotion, the real down to earth marketing that is necessary to create the numbers of pure tourists, not ethnic groups coming back.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>But this legislation will have a major impact on that industry because it cannot survive and improve unless it has this training available to it to cater for the demands that will be made on it in the decades ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no suggestion that the training element will in any way change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>There is, and I will explain why I think that.  This new industrial training committee to be set up as part of the structure and which CERT will somehow have to go through will have no real input into policy and it will certainly have no input into the funding decisions that will be needed for the training necessary for the tourist industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not really true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is like everything else. Unless one is in a position to formulate policy oneself, and unless one has the vote within one's own grip to allow one to implement that policy it gets dissipated down the road, particularly if it is a small fish in a large pond.  While CERT are aggressive and are a good agency they are not a piranha; they have not gone around taking chunks out of the other agencies to achieve their desired results. They have achieved them by being left alone, getting on with their brief and having good management.  Why the Minister would go to the trouble of trying to change that is beyond me.  It is not like him.  I would love to know what Minister, what colleagues are pressing him down <Col N="1266" /> in this matter when he knows that people in this House and in the agencies, people who are selling tourism, people who are offering services out there, the general public and politicians on every side do not want him to do this thing.  There is no climb down on the part of the Minister, no comeback from his stated aim for training.  He should introduce the amendment.</P>
      <P>If the Minister recognises that the general public, together with their representatives in the agencies involved in this industry, want him to change tack and are prepared to take the responsibility for it, why should he not conform to the democratic wishes on all sides and to the demands being made on him by the tourist industry in general?  They want the Minister to change his mind on this and they want me to impress upon him the need to have another think about it. This is not because they want him to make a major U-turn: there is no U-turn in this legislation, this is agreed legislation. We all agree with the stated principle the Minister has enunciated, but if there is an opinion outside that a better result in the end could be obtained if he does what I am asking as far as CERT are concerned, then I do not see why he will not make that adjustment and announce it here.</P>

      <P>Is the schedule agreed?  Agreed.</P>
      <P>The following motion was moved by Deputy R. Burke on Tuesday, 2 December 1986:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann, concerned about the repeated accidents at, and continuing discharges from, the Sellafield nuclear reprocessing plant and conscious of the dangerous threat it poses to the life and health of the Irish people and to the whole environment on this island, calls on the British Government to arrange for the immediate closure of this dangerous installation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Fianna Fáil have tabled this motion, because in the light of the recent remarks of the Minister for Energy it appeared it would be possible to get all-party consensus calling on the British Government to close down Sellafield, and that this would be expressed in a unanimous Dáil motion.  The Minister for Energy last Thursday described Sellafield as a &ldquo;dangerous monstrosity&rdquo; that was invading Irish sovereignty and undermining Ireland's integrity as a nation.  He advocated an international campaign to force the closure of the Sellafield nuclear reprocessing plant.  It is clear that the best foundation of any such campaign would be a unanimous resolution passed by this Dáil calling on the British Government to close down Sellafield.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We welcome the decision of the Government on this occasion to support our motion calling for such a closedown, although it is a matter of regret that earlier this year on two occasions when we had a similar motion before this House the Government could not see their way to support it.  The loss of time in the Government coming round to the right decision is something we regret because we feel that had the first motion been <Col N="1268" /> passed it would have been a step further along the way to having this very serious situation rectified.</P>
    <P>If the parties opposite were not prepared to make that demand on the British Government, then any international campaign to ask others to do that for us would lack all credibility.  It would be illogical and absurd to expect other countries less immediately threatened by the menace of Sellafield to demand its closure, if we were not prepared to demand its closure ourselves.  Trying to shelter behind others would be seen for what it is, moral cowardice.</P>
    <P>The Minister's remarks of last Thursday are a vindication of our campaign going back several years on this subject. From the Taoiseach down Coalition Ministers got it wrong, and they did the Irish people no service in repeating anodyne assurances from the British authorities. It is an admission that even their most recent position, to call for a European inspectorate, was a totally inadequate response to the problem.  There is no doubt that a clear Irish stand would enormously increase the pressure on the British government.  Last March the voting down of the Fianna Fáil motion in the Dáil resulted in disastrous headlines in British newspapers, for example &ldquo;Irish reject nuclear closure&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The latest leak of 50,000 gallons of radioactive waste into the Irish Sea is another in a whole chapter of accidents. These are manmade errors and obviously accidents much more serious than we have had to date could come our way in the future.  It must be obvious to everyone that there are things always going wrong and that Sellafield represents a major hazard to life and health on both sides of the Irish Sea.  It is quite impossible to have any confidence either in the competence or the truthfulness of the authorities in relation to plants like Sellafield. Again and again the public have been given false and misleading information and assurances.  Indeed, the position up to a couple of years ago was that the authorities at Sellafield were not obliged to announce incidents or accidents at all unless the amount of radioactive waste <Col N="1269" /> reached the limit they were allowed by legislation.  Had it not been for the fact that members from Greenpeace reported the incident &mdash; and this on many occasions was the first that the public heard about such accidents and such incidents &mdash; we would not know what was happening.  Only in the past two years have they now in, I suppose a public relations campaign, agreed to announce the information as soon as an accident occurs.  Still, the Minister answered me in this House that an incident on 5 February was not reported to him and that he had to inquire about it when he heard about if from some other source.  Again and again the public have been given false and misleading information and assurances. The nuclear industry is, to borrow a phrase from the British cabinet secretary, &ldquo;economical with the truth&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The effects of the Chernobyl nuclear accident are a vivid warning to us of the effects of a major nuclear accident.  That accident a thousand miles away nevertheless led to increase radiation levels over Ireland.  There was in parts of Britain and Europe heavy contamination of food chains to the point that certain crops had to be destroyed and certain products declared unfit for human consumption. We had the controversy, unfounded though the allegations were, in Brazil about Irish dairy products.  A similar accident at Sellafield to that at Chernobyl would have serious consequences for the Irish people.  If there was fall-out it is along the Irish coast that the effects would be seen most.</P>
    <P>I would like to comment on the recent report submitted by the Minister for Health about the incidence of leukaemia in Ireland.  The report is inconclusive in that it does not deal aetiologically with the cause of leukaemia.  There was a higher incidence in certain parts of the east coast and inland from the east coast. It is important that there be a major study going right back to 1957 to the major disaster at Sellafield, that there be an examination of the causes of leukaemia and that reports be available to people <Col N="1270" /> who want to study the incidence of leukaemia or other diseases which may be linked to radioactivity.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see the Government are supporting our motion tonight.  Calder Hall, one of the older stations the lifespan of which is 25 years, is now over 30 years old and it should be decommissioned immediately.  I do not think anybody could disagree with that because by the time a major accident occurs it will be too late.  Even if a major accident does not occur but the leaks and discharges we have experienced continue it is not possible to predict the long term effects. There are worrying indications of detrimental health effects not merely in Cumbria but in County Down and all along the north coast.  Indeed, radioactive substances have been picked up in Carrigkeen in a study that was carried out off the coast of County Down.  The Swedish Government are especially concerned about radioactive elements in their coastal waters traceable back to Sellafield and they contemplate taking legal action.</P>

      <P>The House will be aware of my concern over Sellafield and the possible health consequences for the Irish public.  On Monday last I received the report of a study carried out into the mortality and incidence of childhood leukaemia in this country.  I am arranging to have this laid before the House.  I have on a number of occasions raised this matter, notably at the WHO plenary session last May.  I raised it at that conference, not too long after the Chernobyl affair, and I did so in a very trenchant manner with my counterpart in the UK.  Since then I have raised it on almost every occasion when I have had such meetings.  The Taoiseach, the Minister for Energy and Minister for the Environment have also availed of every opportunity to express the serious concern of the Irish Government about this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1271" /> The background to this study is that in November 1984 an expert committee was convened at the invitation of my Department to advise on action which might be taken in response to professional and public concern about possible health consequences, in particular cancer risk, from previous and current levels of ionising radiation in the Irish Sea region. Sellafield, of course, was particularly in mind.  I will deal with this report later.</P>
    <P>The accident at Chernobyl has heightened public awareness and concern over the Sellafield plant and indeed other nuclear installations, particularly the old Magnox reactors, in the UK.  Chernobyl demonstrated that a serious accident at a nuclear installation can have effects on countries many hundreds of miles distant. It is, however, natural that we should be most concerned about the nuclear installations of our nearest neighbour, the UK. There is particular concern of course, over Sellafield.  Radioactive materials are being transported through the Irish Sea from around the world to Sellafield for reprocessing.  The possibility of an accident at sea cannot be ruled out as we know in relation to more recent events at home.  Sellafield continues to regularly discharge large quantities of radioactive waste into the Irish Sea.  While epidemiological and other studies carried out do not implicate Sellafield as a health hazard, neither can they entirely exonerate it.  Epidemiological studies cannot always be conclusive and much yet remains to be learned about the degrees of risk associated with various levels or radiation.</P>
    <P>There has been a long catalogue of incidents at the Sellafield plant, in many instances resulting in unplanned discharges into the Irish Sea.  The Minister for Energy has earlier given the House an outline of the incidents which occurred this year, the latest of which occurred on 27 November when the wrong tank of liquid was discharged into the sea.  The liquid in this tank had not been tested for its level of radioactivity.</P>
    <P>Showing patience, and bearing in mind that the Irish Government do not administer <Col N="1272" /> the plant and bearing in mind that the plant is subject to minimal levels of international supervision, the Government having made multiple representations clearly indicate at this stage that we do not have confidence in the safety of the operation of the plant.  The Minister for Energy has also chronicled the long and repeated efforts made by the Government for the setting up of a Community inspection force to reinforce the national inspectorates of member states with a nuclear industry.  These efforts we must confess have to date met with limited success but the Government are determined to continue their efforts at Community level and on a bilateral basis.</P>
    <P>Faced however with the continuing margin of uncertainty about risks posed by Sellafield, its continuing poor accident record and insufficient support at this time for a Community inspection force, I support the demand for the closure of the Sellafield plant.</P>
    <P>I welcome this opportunity of giving the House a summary of the study I referred to at the outset and its recommendations. It is, very relevant to the motion under discussion.  That committee which was a widely representative committee did outstanding work and I thank them for their work.  They advised that since a national cancer registry is not available a special study to establish cancer incidence should be undertaken in the first instance.  It was agreed that since the induction period of acute lymphoid leukaemia in children is relatively short, the mortality and incidence of this tumour should first be studied; consideration of the aetiological factors was not included in the terms of reference of this study since such research would have taken considerably longer to complete. Recent data on mortality and incidence from acute lymphoid leukaemia internationally were reviewed.  Since mortality rates vary with treatment, international comparisons of incidence are more valid.  Annual incidence rates of acute lymphoid leukaemia worldwide vary from about 30-35/1,000,000 children aged 0-14 years in North America and <Col N="1273" /> western Europe to about 15/1,000,000 black children in North America and Africa and Indian children.  The average annual incidence rate of 31/1,000,000 children found in the current study is similar to rates in other western populations.</P>
    <P>During the total study period, no excess of mortality or incidence was apparent either on the east or south coast of the country and distribution of high rates was quite random over the country as a whole.  Deputy O'Hanlon and I are well aware that this was the problem in relation to the cluster in the Dundalk area and we gave special attention to it. The fact that there were more areas with no cases in the west of Ireland than elsewhere may be a reflection of population density.</P>
    <P>More detailed examination of mortality rates showed a small excess in coastal strips approximately three miles wide on the east and south coasts for the period 1971-76 but not for the period 1977-82. Deaths were evenly distributed along these coastal strips and no particular area of coast had higher rates than another. On the east coast in 1971-76, an average of 2.7 deaths per year occurred, whereas 1.5 would have been expected if the rate there had been the same as the rest of the country; on the south coast an average of 0.8 deaths per year occurred, whereas 0.5 would have been expected.  A strip of approximately 18 miles deep inland of the coastal strip in both areas had fewer deaths than the national average prior to 1977, and when this was combined with the three miles wide strip death rates from acute lymphoid leukaemia in children there were identical to the national average.</P>
    <P>I stress that after 1977 the study found no geographic variations in mortality and incidence rates.  While we can say that Sellafield has no observable impact in relation to acute lymphoid leukaemia in children since 1977 we cannot, on the basis of this study, exonerate it prior to that date.  In the light of the findings of this report and in acknowledgment of the difficulties experienced in compiling the data on which it is based, the report <Col N="1274" /> makes the following recommendations: (1) a national cancer registry should be established to monitor cancer incidence; (2) a board, composed of representatives of appropriate Government Departments and scientific experts, should be established which would have statutory responsibility for the monitoring and control of all environmental hazards; (3) an epidemiological research programme inquiring into incidence, trends and causation of cancer should be undertaken.</P>
    <P>I am already taking measures towards the setting up of a national cancer register and discussions are continuing with the World Health Organisation and other relevant bodies.  I will also have the other recommendations acted on as soon as possible.  Studies are also being undertaken at present into the prevalence of Downes Syndrome on the east coast as compared with the west coast and also to determine if Donegal has a higher than average incidence of Downes Syndrome.</P>
    <P>I wish to assure the Opposition that over the past four years the matter has been under the closest surveillance at Government level.  We have kept in close contact with the UK authorities and the WHO and copies of the report which I received have been sent to my counterparts in Northern Ireland, the UK and to the WHO.  Unquestionably, there is support in the House for international monitoring and control procedures which are so urgently needed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>My purpose in speaking in this debate is to outline the attitude of the Government, from an environmental point of view, on this important matter. The House will recall that in February of this year the Taoiseach indicated our unhappiness in relation to the operation of the Sellafield plant and the concern of our people in regard to it at a meeting he had with the British prime minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1275" /> It was also announced at that time that the Government had decided to press the European Commission for the setting up of an inspectorate with authority to carry out inspection of nuclear plants throughout Europe.  At the first environmental council meeting which I attended in March, I pursued the matter with some difficulty.  The House will be aware that the traditional view taken at European level is that matters regarding the operation of nuclear plants are appropriate to the Council of Energy Ministers.  Up to the time of the March Council meeting there had never been a substantive discussion among the Council of Environment Ministers on the question of the health and safety of the individual person from the point of view of the nuclear system.  We made the point at the March Council meeting &mdash; and again at a Council meeting of the Environment Ministers held in Luxembourg in June &mdash; that public sensitivity in all the countries in the Commission to the environmental hazards posed by nuclear installations had become much more acute as time went on.  Indeed, the calls which we made at the March Council meeting were fully justified by the extraordinary and dreadful occurrence in Chernobyl shortly afterwards.</P>
    <P>We have since been following up this matter with Commissioner Clinton-Davis. The Minister for Energy and I had separate meetings to impress upon him the concern of the Irish Government and people regarding the question of the safety of the operation of nuclear plants generally.  At the Council of Environment Ministers which was held last week in Brussels, I again raised this matter and noted, with satisfaction, that the Commission came forward in August with specific proposals.  I am pleased to report that the Council of Environment Ministers, for the first time at the meeting last week, accepted and indeed demanded that environment Ministers had a particular role to play in this matter. As a result they issued a statement following their meeting stating:</P>
    <P>The Council had an exchange of <Col N="1276" /> views on the environmental aspects of nuclear safety.</P>
    <P>The next paragraph is of supreme significance. It states:</P>
    <P>The Council agreed on the primordial importance of protecting the public and the environment from harm through nuclear radiation both as a result of normal operations and in the circumstances of an accident.</P>
    <P>The Council agreed that, in addition to work in the IAEA, the Community which is already bound by the EURATOM Treaty and which will shortly be bound by new EC Treaty commitments on the subject of environmental protection, and which has acted as a pacemaker on international co-operation on transboundary environmental issues, has an important and complementary role to play, whilst avoiding unnecessary duplication of effort.</P>
    <P>The Council noted that in the light of today's discussion, the Commission will come forward soon with precise proposals for the protection of the public and the environment from the harmful effects of nuclear radiation.  It agreed that such proposals should be considered as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>The fact that the environment Ministers took that decision and issued that statement is a total vindication of the stance adopted by the Government earlier this year and pursued by the Taoiseach and various Ministers at European level since then.  As I said, the environment Ministers are now accepting they have a role to play in the matter of nuclear safety.  I would like to draw the attention of the House particularly to the second paragraph of the statement which I have read into the record and which states:</P>
    <P>The Council agreed on the primordial importance of protecting the public and the environment from harm through nuclear radiation both as a result of normal operations and in the circumstances of an accident.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1277" /> Implicit in that paragraph is an acceptance on the part of the environment Ministers that the public and the environment can suffer harm through nuclear radiation as a result of normal operations.  It has long been the contention of Irish Governments that the plant at Sellafield through its normal operations and because of its nature and age is a plant which is a threat to public health and safety.  We have been demanding that that plant be closed as soon as is practicable.  The fact that this statement was agreed by all of the environment Ministers under the Presidency of the British Minister is an absolute vindication of the stance we took earlier this year.  Indeed, I am pleased to report to the House that there has been a substantial change in attitudes on the part of environment Ministers from a number of European countries in the course of 1986 in relation to the entire question of nuclear safety.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already outlined to the House the attitude which I have taken consistently since becoming Minister for the Environment in February and which I outlined initially at the Council of Ministers meeting I attended approximately two to three weeks after becoming Minister for the Environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>What did the Minister say at that meeting?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>That stance was that the Irish Government believed that this important issue was based on three beliefs: first, that nuclear safety and its supervision has an important transnational interest, secondly, that the Community has a part to play in improving nuclear safety in addition to the efforts of member states and the IAEA and, thirdly, that more specific Community proposals must be brought forward quickly especially for a strengthened regime of inspection to provide greater safety and reassurance for our citizens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said, at that first Council meeting <Col N="1278" /> in March the point was forcibly made that this was not a matter appropriate to the Council of Environment Ministers and yet some six or eight months later at a Council meeting of last week the environment Ministers unanimously outlined and stated that they did and do have a role to play and that they intended to see that role being exercised.  In addition, the Commission through Commissioner Clinton-Davis indicated very strongly that the Commission now wanted to become involved through the environment Council of Ministers in promoting the entire question of the safety of the general public and of the environment in the context of the operation of nuclear plants.</P>
    <P>To turn again to the statement which was issued, the fact that the environment Ministers enunciated that the public and the environment can suffer harm through nuclear radiation as a result of normal operations of plants is a major and important step forward and vindicates all we have been saying regarding the operation of Sellafield.  Indeed, one of the extraordinary things in connection with many of the nuclear plants is that their siting in many countries happens to be proximate to the borders or boundaries of adjoining countries.  Consequently, they have an important transnational aspect attached to them.  The major step forward which has been achieved at European level in convincing our European colleagues with responsibility for the protection of the environment of the role they should be playing and in convincing the European Commission of our duties and obligations in this regard will bear fruit and has already shown a marked change in attitudes through the issuing of that statement following the meeting of the Council of Environment Ministers last week.</P>
    <P>It is for that reason, in particular, that the Government amendment to this motion has been entered.  The amendment refers to the demands made by the Government in the course of the last year for the establishment as a matter of priority of a nuclear inspection force. <Col N="1279" /> Until that force is established by the Commission I do not think that the assurances, however well meaning, that may be given by any of the member states which operate nuclear plants will be accepted lightly by other member states or by the general public.  The stance of the Irish Government has played a major part in changing the attitude at European level towards the protection of the environment and of the public.  I look forward in the coming months to the implementation of the proposals first put forward by the Taoiseach, and by the Tánaiste and I in February and March of this year.</P>

      <P>A significant amount of time has been taken up in this Dáil session by discussing what have come to be called questions of political morality.  We have experienced this on the so called social legislation questions and we have questions of political morality raised when we discuss our financial affairs.  People say these are moral questions in terms of the extent of the tax and debt burden which can be passed from one generation to another. It seems that there is overwhelming political immorality in a decision of policy makers of one generation to decide on terms of cheap power for themselves and the price to be paid by future generations in terms of damage to their quality of life and to the environment.  On that issue Fine Gael have taken a very strong stance traditionally.  As a party we have set our face against the nuclear option but that does not represent the end of the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many parties in this House would now set their face against the nuclear option though not all of them would have done so quite so recently.  As we have been reminded in the most chilling fashion recently nuclear power does not stop at national borders.  The fact that we have chosen not to travel the nuclear road does not exempt us from the fact that we live alongside neighbours who have made other decisions and find ourselves with installations in some instances as close as <Col N="1280" /> 60 miles away.  It does not allow us ignore the fact that some of those installations are now well beyond their original life-span &mdash; the early magnox reactors which were expected to last 25 years now have had that and more &mdash; it does not ignore the concern which understandably exists with regard to Sellafield.</P>
    <P>That requires a response and the particular response, as the Minister for the Environment has indicated, from the Government has been to seek to internationalise the problem.  It seems to us unthinkable that Irish people should have to rely on the goodwill and judgment of the operators.  If one were to describe their management record as laidback, one would be generous.  It has been so laidback as to be horizontal.  There have been 300 incidents at Sellafield alone. There have been a series of incidents this year alone.  Therefore, we have sought to internationalise the issue, and in particular to involve the European Community believing that the Commission has a substantial role to play.  The Minister for the Environment has indicated the extent to which progress has been made on that and he mentioned some of the difficulties we faced such as the initial doubts as to whether the Commission had the legal authority to do that.  With the assistance of the Attorney General and his staff we were able to convince the Commission's legal services that such power existed under chapter 3 of the Euratom Treaty.  We continue to press that road.  We continue to play a role within the international Atomic Energy Agency who have responded post Chernobyl though the response was concentrated on what happens after an incident.</P>
    <P>Therefore, there have been two conventions agreed, one dealing with early notification and the other dealing with mutual assistance.  Admirable as they are, it seems to us to represent only part of the picture.  Concentrating on what happens afterwards is fine but much more important is to be in a position to reassure people that the optimum level of safety <Col N="1281" /> is being applied.  Therefore, we have pressed at every level open to us to internationalise and most specifically we have pressed to involve the European Community and to persuade the Commission to exercise the power it now accepts it clearly has under the Euratom Treaty.</P>

      <P>Inspection, of course, is only part of the problem.  It remains the case that people are concerned and feel threatened.  Given the manner in which these installations, particularly the one we are talking about, have been run people will continue to feel threatened as long as they are there. Therefore, we said close Sellafield at the earliest possible moment but in advance of that we want inspection and we want that now.</P>

      <P>It is very interesting to hear the Government tonight say how enthusiastic they are about the approach we have been proposing to them for quite some time.  Indeed, it sounds a little like yet another conversion on the road to Damascus.  We are of course delighted to see the Government coming to support Fianna Fáil, even though they wish to add a minor amendment to the end of the motion in order to save face.  The Fianna Fáil motion is as follows:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann, concerned about the repeated accidents at, and continuing discharges from, the Sellafield nuclear reprocessing plant and conscious of the dangerous threat it poses to the life and health of the Irish people and to the whole environment on this island, calls on the British Government to arrange for the immediate closure of this dangerous installation.</P>
      <P>The Government would add:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>and urges the European Communities to decide as a matter of priority the <Col N="1282" /> establishment of a nuclear inspection force.</P>
    <P>In March this year the Government had an opportunity to come around behind Fianna Fáil and join all parties in this House in calling on the British Government to close Sellafield and to put matters in order.  By that stage it was becoming abundantly clear that there were serious problems at Sellafield and grave problems developing in the Irish Sea.  Perhaps it is the threat of execution hanging over the heads of the Government which is concentrating their minds so wonderfully on this matter and bringing them to support the Fianna Fáil motion.  This is, in effect, what they are doing.</P>
    <P>The Government's approach has been weak, cavilling and apologetic.  There is no need to be apologetic.  The evidence is there to show that there are serious problems and we should not apologise to the British or anybody else for our stand on this issue.  I know that Ministers and the Government generally would gladly have stood with us on this matter, but they were too weak to do so earlier in the year.  Now they are taking up a different position.</P>
    <P>In the whole complex of nuclear facilities, Calder Hall must be singled out for special mention.  It is a very old and, in nuclear terms, dilapidated and dangerous facility which has the potential to become another Chernobyl, albeit on a different scale.  It should be shut down without delay.  Any time I have discussed those facilities with technical people, Calder Hall has stood out as a terrifying prospect. If there were any responsible management in British Nuclear Fuels it would certainly have been closed by this time.  It is a matter of criminal negligence to allow that time bomb to remain.  It is well past its depreciation and should not be allowed to continue in operation.  I join with the general call in the motion, particularly on the question of closing Calder Hall.</P>
    <P>We are very much dependent on the Irish Sea, which is one of our greatest natural resources, both in terms of our <Col N="1283" /> fishing industry and recreational activities. It is not only important to our citizens for recreation but also in relation to the development of tourism and the use of our seaside resorts.  I was horrified earlier this year to discover that the rate of silting around Bull Island is being determined on the basis of the radioactivity levels in the lagoon.  We are told that these levels are not so serious as to constitute a health hazard according to the current standards, but it is not acceptable that leaks of radioactive material are causing silt to build up on our shores. This has become so regular and reliable an occurrence that it can be used to measure the level of silting.  Researchers can now confirm from radioactivity tests the yearly rate of silting deposits on our shoreline ever since Sellafield was opened on the north west coast of England.  It has been building up over that long period.  I came across that information accidentally as I went to look for the stakes which were used to measure the level of silting. I discovered that the stakes are not used any more because the leaks from Sellafield are so regular and so definable that they can be used to determine the rate of silting.  It is time we called for this to stop. There is also a disturbing threat to our fine bird sanctuary right in the heart of Dublin and potentially to the whole community.</P>
    <P>Medical experts will argue about the time at which the potential becomes serious, but we should not be in this business. There is far too much leukaemia and cancer in the Dublin area particularly. People are concerned about it.  I know that it will not be possible to prove objectively that there is a direct connection and there will be great argument about it.  It is an argument we could do without. We have too many of these fatal diseases and we should be eliminating anything in the environment which even potentially contributes to the ill health of our community.</P>
    <P>The implications of the threat from Sellafield should transcend party politics and I am happy to see that the Government have agreed to an all-party <Col N="1284" /> approach on this matter.  It is not the first time this kind of thing has happened. Denmark has called on Sweden to close its nuclear plant.  This motion gives us a unique opportunity to come together and say something in the name of all the Irish people.  We must speak loudly and clearly and unequivocably.  We must not be weak or afraid.  History will show that we were right to take this step and those members of the Government who have decided to come across and join us on this motion &mdash; albeit with a minor variation at the end of it &mdash; will be glad in time that they took this step.  We welcome the Government's decision and we trust that this will lead to a co-ordinated and cohesive approach to this problem, resulting in a sustained effort to bring about the closure of these plants to ensure that the environment is made safe for our people.</P>

      <P>One of the most important duties of parliaments and governments today is to struggle to save humanity from nuclearisation. There is a generally welcomed admission of this duty, especially in so far as it pertains to nuclear armaments. At the United Nations we are happy to join in expressions of anxiety and abhorrence as we contemplate the dramatic and fatal consequences of what I think is the inevitable use of inhumane nuclear weapons.  We are a party to recommendations requesting the prohibition of radiological weapons.  Accordingly, I have for years found it very difficult to understand &mdash; indeed I found it inexplicable &mdash; how the Government here were happy to live in the shadow of what to me is one of the most dangerous radiological weapons there could be &mdash; that is, the ageing nuclear plant at Sellafield.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1285" /> Straight away, we know that British Nuclear Fuels, indeed the British Government and until last night our own British-subservient Government, have said that Sellafield is not intended as a weapon of destruction, that Sellafield has social and economic considerations and that we should be very careful, as was said to us by representatives of the Minister of State's Government last year, not to be alarming the Irish people of dangers that only existed in our imagination.  One is happy to note the deathbed conversion of the Minister of State, the Minister for Health and the Minister for the Environment. One could ask in respect of the history they have given of their interest, when did any of those three Ministers announce publicly before what they have said here tonight?  I see no evidence of that, none whatsoever.</P>

    <P>There is no doubt that in deference to that traditional, characteristic attitude of Fine Gael Governments towards our neighbours, they were slow to rock the British boat.  It is only now, when a Minister of the Labour Party exerted belatedly his feelings about Sellafield, that they are rowing in with him.  It can be the only reason they have remained so oblivious to the dangers there; it can be the only reason that Minister of State Birmingham and the Deputy on the far <Col N="1286" /> side voted against the same resolution that we had in this House only some months ago.</P>

      <P>The votes are what count in this House.  Words are cheap.  The Deputy is recorded in the Official Report, as are all the other people, as having withstood our efforts to get the Government to draw the attention of the British Government to that horrible nuclear radiological weapon that they have sited within 60 miles of our coast.</P>
      <P>I am thankful that at the eleventh hour our Minister for Energy has, as it were, broken ranks and refused to respond to the exortations and perhaps the ordinances to which he has been subjected. Because this Government have been fearful to upset our British colleagues, they have thrown into the Fianna Fáil republican motion a little addendum about Europe.  Blame Europe.  Ask Europe to do something about it.  I appreciate that our membership of the EC has a function in this but, initially, our attack must be on that Government who presumed to place so near to us, 30 years ago almost, this plant which has an average of one accident per month, the incidence of those accidents increasing to an alarming degree in the last few years. I note that the Minister for Energy has told us that the average radiation dose is only 5 per cent of what is regarded as acceptable.  There is no radiation dose that is acceptable to me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, we must discover, in respect of the average dose, if that one in respect of Sellafield would include the people of the western islands.  Has a survey been taken in respect of those people on the eastern coast who are, as we all know, in greater danger than anybody else in respect of Sellafield?  I must admit to what history has shown me in <Col N="1287" /> respect of any assurances that can be given by any British Government or agency and their capacity to distort and to indulge in what I would regard as the politics of convenience and give us assurances that we know cannot be sustained. I am appealing to the Government, if it is the last thing they do while in office, to make known to the British Government the view of this House, in circumstances where there is absolute agreement by all parties now, that Sellafield must close.  We do not want any further surveys; we do not want any further assurances from the source we know cannot be relied on.  I do not think we are being overdemanding in that respect. I notice that that Government presumed in the last few days to send here their Attorney General to require of us to prohibit the publication of a book which they felt could be dangerous to them.  Bearing that in mind and having regard to their attitude towards us and their preparedness at all times to accept reciprocity, I do not think they can charge us with being over-demanding if we, in deference to the regard we must have for the safety of our people, not to mention the effects on tourism and other industries, ask them to accept now the evidence that is there and which is admitted by them.  Perhaps the evidence can be doubled to get the reality of the situation. Without any accident at all, Sellafield's presence is a danger to the people of this country.  Naturally, that consideration must take precedence over all else.  In addition, Sellafield is dangerous to fauna and flora and there is no doubt &mdash; bear in mind what happened at Chernobyl &mdash; as to what would be the consequences of a serious accident at Sellafield.</P>
      <P>I know that at this stage we cannot alienate any of the new found support we have received now &mdash; third time lucky. We thank the Members of the Labour and Fine Gael Parties for the conversion referred to by my colleague, Deputy Woods, as being comparable with that of St. Paul on the road to Damascus, but which I regard as the death bed conversion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support very strongly the motion before the House calling for the closure of Sellafield. Nuclear power as a source of energy has taken on great significance over the past few years.  Nuclear power as an energy source has also taken on great significance from the point of view of its danger to mankind over the past few years and, unlike anything else, the more we know about nuclear power the more fearful of it we become.</P>
      <P>I have had an interest in this issue for quite some time because, as everybody knows, Carnsore, County Wexford, was the site chosen for a nuclear powered generating station for the ESB.  The ESB bought about 200 acres of land in the Carnsore area and carried out initial tests on durability of concrete etc., at that time.  They subsequently applied to Wexford County Council for planning permission.  As a member of Wexford County Council during that period I can say that the council and its officials investigated as far as was possible for lay people in the nuclear field, the whole nuclear energy issue.  Officials and councillors went to see nuclear installations in Britain, Germany and the USA.  There was a great deal of anxiety expressed at the time, but Wexford County Council were prepared to give the proposals every consideration.  In other words, we did not allow an anti-nuclear bias to throw it out. It was considered properly.  In this debate and, indeed, in all the discussions on the issue, let us be very clear in our minds that any decision we arrive at will be arrived at for the right reasons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This country must now be aware of the consequences of nuclear power as an energy source.  The terrible fear of the people in County Wexford, and indeed in the rest of the country is heightened by the failure of the management in Sellafield to control the plant.  The assurances that Chernobyl could not happen, that Three Mile Island could not happen, that Sellafield could not happen, are so <Col N="1289" /> hollow.  The assurances that tighter controls would be imposed at Sellafield following Chernobyl only served to heighten anxieties and fear.  Surely this was an admission that they had not control, and since then, and very recently, there have been more serious leaks which show that literally, those people are fooling around in the dark.  The assurances from the operators, British Nuclear Fuels, and the British Government cannot be taken seriously anymore.</P>
    <P>The cover-ups, the deception, the gross incompetence, that is part and parcel of Sellafield cannot be accepted by us any longer, and I am delighted that this Government have at last agreed that Fianna Fáil were right in calling for the closure of Sellafield last March and May. At that time the Government had the audacity to suggest that we were being alarmists.  It is interesting to note and very desirable, that they have swallowed their pride, that they have admitted their mistake and that for once, this U-turn obsessed Government have made an acceptable U-turn and they are now calling for the closure of Sellafield.  Let me plead with the Government whose credibility rating is at zero, who are the laughing stock of the world, who buy votes from their backbenchers at any price for survival, to stay on the course they have now adopted.  Deputies Cluskey, Taylor and Skelly have been purchased, as has the U-turner supreme Deputy Michael O'Leary.  And Deputy Alice Glenn &mdash; what is her price?  The shenanigans in the lobbies will be interesting to watch.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach in answer to a Private Notice Question to Deputy Haughey said on 1 February, and I quote from the Official Report:</P>
    <P>I will be urging the British Prime Minister that there should be a thorough review of safety procedures at the Sellafield plant.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste and Minister for Energy in Private Members' Time on 6 May 1986 said: &ldquo;The Minister for the Environment and the Minister of State at my Department, Deputy Collins and I have had <Col N="1290" /> separate formal discussions with Commissioner Clinton Davis on this matter.&rdquo; We all know how seriously both the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste were taken in those discussions: The subservient attitude adopted by our Government to Britain leads us to believe that we can expect no response to such demands from the present Administration.  The Tánaiste went on to say in that same debate that the levels of radio activity were carefully monitored by the Nuclear Energy Board.</P>
    <P>Yet, it is well known that this very amateur outfit, the Nuclear Energy Board, have been so far out in their predictions that they no longer have any credibility.  On 30 April 1986, when speaking about the Chernobyl disaster, the Nuclear Energy Board stated that &ldquo;Prevailing weather conditions were unlikely to carry contamination in the direction of Ireland in the immediate future.  Yet three days later, contamination arrived.  As the levels peaked over the following week the Nuclear Energy Board claimed that the radiation did not present a significant health hazard. Now, six months later, the Nuclear Energy Board have not completed their analysis of the amount of radiation absorbed by the Irish public from the Chernobyl fall-out.  Who could have confidence in the Nuclear Energy Board, in the Tánaiste or in the Government?</P>
    <P>The experts are disagreeing with one another.  Dr. Ian McAuley, senior lecturer in Physics at Trinity College claimed that no adverse effects would be found in the short or long term as a result of the Chernobyl fall-out, but Professor Karl Morgan of the Nuclear Engineering Faculty at the University of Georgia, winner of the Nobel Prize for Physics, and former chairman of the International Commission for Radiological Protection claims that the impact of Chernobyl on Ireland will be 24 cancers, 12 of them fatal, <i>The Irish Times</i> 1 December.  This must be accepted as clear proof of the terrible uncertainty of nuclear energy.</P>
    <P>The Sellafield reprocessing nuclear plant is now an uncontrollable monster. The more assurances we are given, the <Col N="1291" /> more accidents and leaks there are.  It is a greater potential threat to this Island than war.  Its leaks of radioactivity to the atmosphere are put in proper perspective when we consider the Chernobyl catastrophe. If the Chernobyl cloud could travel more than 1,000 miles east, it is frightening to think what the consequences might be if a similar accident occurred at Sellafield which is less than 100 miles east.  This 30 year old ramshackle nuclear waste reprocessing plant at Sellafield has a proven record of disaster after disaster so bad in fact they had to change its name from Windscale to Sellafield.  The Germans began a publicity campaign to sell nuclear to their people saying &ldquo;Sellafield could not happen here&rdquo;.  Sellafield in its present condition could not operate in West Germany &mdash;<i>The Guardian</i>, 5 May 1986.  Sellafield or Windscale or what ever they chose to call it, must be shut down immediately because not alone is there danger from the plant itself, but there is continuing pollution of the Irish Sea, almost 1 million gallons of effluent everyday from Sellafield.  The Irish Sea is the most radioactive in the world.  The other threat comes from the shipping on the Irish Sea of the waste nuclear fuel from plants in Spain, Italy, Switzerland and Belgium.  The British have a cheek in the light of their terrible safety record to impose this triple threat on the people of this country as if they had the God given right to ride roughshod over us.</P>
    <P>Is it not an accepted fact that there are strong links between radiation and cancer?  Is it any wonder that those of us on the east coast are concerned at the high levels of cancer there?  Is there a connection, or is it a coincidence?  The <i>People Newspapers</i>, Wexford, recently investigated cancer levels in a coastal area of County Wexford with alarming results.  There is no way such people will believe other than that Sellafield is the cause.  To the ESB I say forget you ever thought of nuclear power as a source of energy.  Use Carnsore for something else.</P>
    <P>Because of my concern I am travelling to Sellafield tomorrow, to meet British <Col N="1292" /> Nuclear Fuels and energy officials.  This trip has been arranged for a month.  To conclude the nuclear safety record is appalling.  The experts conflict, the reality is that Nagasaki and Chernobyl are death, a living death.  Cancer levels here are higher than average.  There is deception and cover-ups.  Because we are sitting ducks we demand the closure of Sellafield immediately.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;extremely concerned at the consistent British policy of discharging nuclear-related wastes into the Irish Sea from nuclear establishments such as Sellafield (formerly Windscale), Hunterston, Wylfa, Berkeley, Hinckley Point, Dounreay, Chapel Cross and Calder Hall and</P>
      <P>&mdash;conscious of the threat to the wellbeing and environment of all the people on this island, as evidenced by the fact that the Irish Sea is now the most radioactive stretch of water in the world;</P>
      <P>&mdash;calls on the Taoiseach to arrange an urgent meeting with the British Prime Minister, to insist on the immediate closure of Sellafield plant in particular, and to insist also on an immediate end to the policy of dumping nuclear-related wastes into the Irish Sea or other Irish waters;</P>
      <P>&mdash;and further demands that the Government initiate an urgent campaign of political and diplomatic activity at European and other international levels as appropriate, to ensure that this wholly unacceptable dumping policy is brought to an immediate end.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats have on numerous occasions called for the closure of Sellafield nuclear reprocessing plant and an end to the dumping of nuclear waste into the Irish Sea.  Up to recently the response of the Government has been <Col N="1293" /> to seek improved international inspection of this plant with a view to tighter controls and higher safety measures.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats are pleased the Government have finally recognised that it is necessary to have this dangerous plant closed down completely and that there is now unanimity among all parties in Leinster House that the demand be made of the British Government to close down Sellafield.  The motion in Deputy Brady's name calls on the British Government to arrange for the immediate closure of Sellafield.  On behalf of the Progressive Democrats I moved amendment No. 1.</P>
    <P>If accepted by the House it will require the Taoiseach to raise the question of closing Sellafield with the British Prime Minister, Mrs. Thatcher, at the earliest possible opportunity.  That opportunity can arise in the immediate future at the next scheduled meeting of both leaders.</P>
    <P>The Government amendment to the main motion accepts the demand for closure and calls for an EC nuclear inspection force.  This is an important debate in that it marks the complete agreement among all parties in Dáil Éireann in condemning the authorities in charge of Sellafield, British Nuclear Fuels Limited, for their inefficiencies and incompetence in the management of this dangerous plant and for the urgent need now to have the plant closed down before a major disaster occurs.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats' amendment recognises that the threat to the safety of our people is not confined to the Sellafield plant but is also posed by at least seven other nuclear establishments which are also discharging either waste or water from reactors and so on, into the Irish Sea.  These include a number of nuclear power plants such as Berkeley, Hinckley Point and Wylfa among others, along with Chapel Cross, Calder Hall, Springfields and other British nuclear fuel establishments which are involved with aspects of nuclear power and which also use the Irish Sea as a dumping ground.</P>
    <P>It is important to state that the waste being dumped both in the Irish Sea and <Col N="1294" /> off the south-west coast contains potentially lethal amounts of radioactivity which, if carried back to humans by sea currents or the marine food chain, could lead to dramatic increases in the incidences of such diseases as cancer and leukaemia for years, and perhaps generations to come.  Dumping at sea is completely ostracised by many countries around the world including the Netherlands, West Germany, Italy, France, the United States of America, Sweden and many others who oppose outright such ecological vandalism.  Britain, however, has plans to extend its reliance on this form of nuclear waste disposal in the future and its dumping ground area close to the waters of this country.</P>
    <P>It is clear that the British Government have been acting in a highly irresponsible fashion in the manner in which they are disposing of their dangerous nuclear waste.  It is astonishing to think that Britain is responsible for 90 per cent of all worldwide nuclear waste which is dumped into the sea and of this 75 per cent of it goes into the Irish Sea. However, the Irish Sea is not the only problem; this country has apparently passively agreed to the dumping of lowlevel radioactive waste some 350 nautical miles south-west of Counties Cork and Kerry, the only site in the world where ocean dumping of radioactive nuclear waste is still being conducted, a form of dumping notoriously difficult to monitor.</P>
    <P>Again there is a popular myth that the radioactive waste is embedded in steel drums and concrete; in fact, the purpose of the drums is to protect the handlers. The drums actually contain leakage points to allow water to enter as they descend to the seabed site 4,300 metres below the surface, in the pathway of the Gulf Stream as it flows towards Ireland.</P>
    <P>With the discharges from Sellafield and the other nuclear establishments mostly located along the west coast of Britain and the amounts of waste that have been dumped in the south-west it is not surprising to find that radioactive caesium is now over 100 times greater in Dublin Bay than in Galway Bay.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion before the House.  I welcome the fact that the Government have at last seen sense on this issue.  It is a pity they did not accept a similar motion which was before the House in March of this year when exactly the same problems existed and exactly the same threat to the health and life of the Irish people existed. Nevertheless, a late conversion is better than no conversion at all.  It should be recognised that while the nuclear power station at Sellafield is the most obvious and immediate threat to us there are other power stations on the British coast which we know virtually nothing about. In an amendment we sought to move we sought to ensure that the Government would immediately initiate a round of talks with countries in a position similar to ours with no nuclear installations of any kind.  A treaty should be established to ensure that countries with these installations should be obliged to notify their neighbours and the United Nations immediately of any accidents.  They should be obliged to ensure that the plants are kept up to scratch.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to recognise that the problem is wider than the Sellafield issue. There is an additional threat to the health of the Irish people.  The Irish Sea has become the nuclear submarine highway in Europe with submarines from virtually all the nuclear power stations in the <Col N="1296" /> United States, the Soviet Union, France and Britain constantly travelling on the Irish Sea.  Efforts should be made by the Government to achieve a treaty which would ban such traffic from the Irish Sea. There is a further problem of warships calling to Irish ports.  We accept the word of those who arrive here that they do not carry nuclear missiles or nuclear weapons of any kind.  Given the state of the world and the arms race, it is no longer acceptable that we, as a neutral country, should allow such ships to call here without a categorical assurance that they are not carrying weapons of that kind.  We should insist on the right to inspect ships that come here to ensure that they do not have that kind of weapon on board.</P>
    <P>While I welcome the efforts of the Government to establish a European inspection force, in view of the failure of that effort to date the Government should, at least as an interim measure, insist on the right to inspect the Sellafield installation.  As I said in the debate last March, there is no room for complacency on this issue.  There is no room for taking a reasonable attitude and having discussions over a cup of tea.  We must insist that the plant close but we must also insist that we have the right to inspect such installations in view of the threat they pose to the people of this State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I support one part of Deputy De Rossa's speech in relation to the use of the Irish Sea by submarines.  He used the words &ldquo;submarine highway&rdquo;; I would describe it as a submarine low-way. As Deputy De Rossa said, we had a visit by an American warship recently, the <i>SS Nitro</i>, an unhappy name, and that vessel was berthed in Dublin Bay for almost a week.  I called on the Taoiseach &mdash; I was going to call on the Government but I did not because I did not think we have a Government &mdash; to ask the American Ambassador to identify to the Irish people whether that ship had nuclear warheads aboard.  Of course that call was met with silence but I am convinced that nuclear warheads were on that ship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am a member of the Campaign for <Col N="1297" /> Nuclear Disarmament and I represent a coastal constituency that takes up a large part of Dublin Bay, stretching from Merrion Gates to the Dublin-Wicklow border.  It concerns me that 60 miles across the Irish Sea we have Sellafield leaking almost daily.  I am concerned that nuclear waste is being dumped into a precious asset, the Irish Sea, which is being ruined through the efforts of mankind. We must accept some of the blame for what is happening at Sellafield because we have not been determined enough as a nation, led by the Government, in our efforts to get the British Government to close down Sellafield in their interest and in our interest.  The damage done by Sellafield has not been properly calculated.  We have had reports and analyses giving different views and there is no agreement about the risks from the Sellafield plant.  As Deputy Molloy said, to suggest for one moment that the drums dumped in different oceans of the world do not leak is dishonest. The fish stock in the Irish Sea is at risk and people cannot bathe along our east coast because of dumping from Sellafield.  That coast from Wexford to the North of Ireland is at risk.  The west coast of the United Kingdom has been polluted by Sellafield.  I have heard people referring in a jocose way to Sellafield salmon glowing in the dark but how right they are.</P>
    <P>The many bird sanctuaries along the east coast from Booterstown marshes to Dalkey Island, and the beautiful coastline from Merrion to Shankill, are at serious risk.  Not only is Dublin Bay being polluted by fall-out from Sellafield but it is being polluted with sewage.  This is contributing to the demise of a tremendous national asset.  We have succeeded in destroying the forests of central Europe with acid rain and in destroying one of the finest river systems in Europe, the Rhine.  It appears that poison released from a factory in Switzerland destroyed all the life in that river from its source to its estuary.  That is the type of contribution mankind has been making to the environment since the beginning of the so-called industrial revolution.  It is a <Col N="1298" /> great tragedy.  What happened following the accident at Three Mile Island is an example of the damage that can be done to our environment.  Closer to home we have the littering of our streets and countryside which is nothing less than a national disgrace.</P>
    <P>I accept that in the motion we are concerned about pollution from the Sellafield nuclear plant but we have been haphazard as a race in our attitude to our general environment.  I regard this as one of the most important motions to have come before the 24th Dáil.  This island belongs not to this generation but to future generations.  We hold the island, and the Irish Sea, in trust for this and successive generations, our grandchildren and great grandchildren, until judgment day, if there is to be a judgment day.  We have been told there will be and we have to accept that.</P>

I do not think we have been doing enough to ensure that we hand on this country and its precious natural assets in good condition to the next and successive generations. They are entitled to have these precious natural assets handed on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important that there should be unanimity on this.  Such unanimity in a debate like this has a strong moral dynamic.  It will be pursuasive in international fora particularly when it concerns a country like ours that does not have any nuclear history.  Hopefully we will not have a nuclear future.  I hope that we will look for other pure sources of energy.  We must accept that many sources of energy are not being tapped. The Americans may be this and that in the context of their war machines but mankind owes them a debt for their technical developments.  I do not think it is beyond the ability of those involved in American or Russian technology to <Col N="1299" /> switch finance from the war machine to search for other natural sources of energy.  I do not think the answer is nuclear.  We have not tried to use wind or waves as a source of energy.  We must try to find alternatives to the Sellafields of this world and I hope we find them soon.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that there is unanimity in regard to this.  I am privileged to have had an opportunity to contribute to the debate and I should like to assure the House that I will continue my fight for a clean environment on land, sea and in the air.

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - National Employment and Training Authority Bill, 1986: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Earlier I endeavoured to convince the Minister of the need to agree to deal separately with training under the new Authority.  I said there is a great need for an efficient training system for the hotel, catering and tourism industry.  I explained to the Minister the general desire, which is universal outside and in the House, that the Minister would alter his attitude towards his stated aim to abolish CERT and have it assimilated into the Authority.  I hope I will be able <Col N="1301" /> to convince the Minister of the impact this legislation will have on tourism.</P>
      <P>For that reason, it will be necessary for us to maintain an efficient manpower training system for the industry.  To do that it will be necessary to allow CERT to continue their work under the present structure through which they can continue to develop.  Tourism is in the doldrums. It can make a far bigger contribution to the economy and can promote bigger job opportunities if it is allowed to grow.</P>
      <P>Therefore, the industry must not lose its manpower training body because this is a critical time for tourism considering the depressed conditions that exist in all sectors involved.  To withdraw the manpower training organisation from tourism now would deal it a further blow which would increase the depression that exists.</P>
      <P>The needs of tourism are many, one of them being the essential training structure that exists.  To dismantle CERT now would do a disservice to the tourism industry.  Tourism revenue needs to be increased and it must try to stimulate Irish holidays at home and improve its competitiveness by increasing the level of demand.  All these things can be put in place but will be more difficult to achieve if the organisation which provides trained personnel to enable the tourism industry to be developed is dismantled.</P>
      <P>Today we were told by Bord Fáilte of the outturn for 1986.  Overseas revenue for the year is down by 6 per cent, a loss of about £28 million.  There has been a decline in overseas visitors of about 4 per cent and there has been a 20 per cent drop in the number of American visitors. The US market is down by £14 million this year.  Therefore, it is nonsense for us to be uttering the usual platitudes towards the tourism industry because by dismantling CERT we are taking from the industry the basic training organisation which helps tourism to generate the necessary growth.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately, when you submerge this organisation in the conglomerate being created by the legislation, the effectiveness of CERT will be diminished and there will be a consequent loss of efficiency in the tourism industry. We do not doubt that the Minister's intentions are good.  We heard the Director of Bord Fáilte today say that tourist numbers from Britain and Europe are down this year.  Bord Fáilte spoke about the need for an increase for marketing of £3 million which would bring £32 million to the State in revenue.  We all realise it would be useless to provide extra money for marketing if at the same time we removed from the industry its basic training structure.  It is clear that the Minister appreciates the importance of CERT.  He says he does not want them to lose their effectiveness but he is endeavouring to change their structure.  He has not put forward statistics to any argument for the dismantling of CERT.  We need a special organisation for the special job that has to be done for tourism development and potential.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>CERT are the oldest of the manpower training bodies in Ireland &mdash; they are older than AnCO and have a better record.  Whatever failings AnCO might have that might be redressed by some of the actions proposed in this legislation, <Col N="1303" /> the failings are not endemic in CERT and it does not need to be altered to provide a better service.  CERT was set up by Bord Fáilte about 23 years ago.  It developed an organisational structure to deal with the complexity of the total catering and tourist industry.  That is a fairly difficult job to do because of the complexity and variety that exists in the tourist industry.  CERT had as its founding father Bord Fáilte; Bord Fáilte is still in existence and still requires the services of that training organisation.  It has lived up to the expectations of Bord Fáilte and has far exceeded some of them.  It is the one single training agency in this country that is totally cost effective.  It is a well designed organisation for meeting the needs of the tourist industry and the hotel and catering industry.  It is essential that CERT be allowed to carry on this vital work as efficiently as it does at present.</P>
    <P>The record of CERT as it operates in the tourist training area is there for all to see.  It is a success, and is it not unique in many ways for us to be in a position to come in here and record that we have one agency at least that is recognised by both sides of the House and by the industry it serves as a success.  There is nothing that can not be better, but certainly for the amount of funding available to it and for the terms of reference it has, it has been that success, and we would like to thank them for their efforts in that regard.</P>
    <P>It has a good relationship with the social partners and with the Department of Education, with which it has very close ties.  It has a significant record in so far as placements are concerned.  I know of no agency or semi-State body in the training and placement arena that can boast in excess of 90 per cent placement in employment of trainees.  CERT has given very good value for the small amount of money invested in it each year.  To seek to change that successful situation does not make sense.  For that reason we must press the issue on the Minister to amend the legislation.  The Minister himself goes some way to making the argument for us. Let me refer to the Official Report of <Col N="1304" /> March 1986, where the Minister said that CERT was a model of co-operation and enthusiasm and had very good morale among its staff.  We agree with all that. But what I would like to draw attention to more than any thing else is the fact that the Minister, in answering questions from our spokesman on Labour, Deputy Ahern, said that CERT was an example that all of the other training agencies could follow.  What he was saying in effect was that there were deficiencies and failures in all the other training agencies but that CERT was the model that should be placed before them all.  Here the self same Minister, who was so loud in his praise in the spring of this year of the efforts being made by CERT and who was quite solid in his opinion that nothing would be done at anytime in this House to upset the progress being made by CERT, for whatever reason &mdash; I was going to say for whatever subversive reason that exists somewhere in the bowels of the Department or elsewhere &mdash; seeks to impose a change of heart now, and methinks that he is not doing it with a good grace, and for that reason perhaps he finds it a little unpalatable to listen to the truth now and has left temporarily.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Far be it from me to embarrass the junior Minister; I have the greatest regard for him.  Indeed, I have a sneaking regard for the senior Minister as well.  But he fails to pursue the line of thought which he himself was preaching to this House earlier on in the year.  The merger is opposed by all interested groups and parties involved in the tourist industry outside the House.  It is also opposed by the hotel industry and catering <Col N="1305" /> industry and not just by the principal of those industries but the management and the unions also.</P>
      <P>The industrial committee status intended for CERT when it is dismantled condemns CERT to nothing more than a training committee, and a training committee is no more or no less than an advisory committee without resources, and certainly without the means or the freedom to develop its own policies. Without that facility CERT cannot hope to develop its structures or the services that it might wish to give hereafter to the industries involved.  The Minister withdraws that from it and places a supervision on it that will smother it.  It is an infant.  It is a small fish in that big pond. It is not of the piranha type and it will be gobbled up by the monsters from the manufacturing industry agencies who have always used the existing training agencies as their plaything and will continue to do so and, unfortunately, to the disadvantage of the tourist industry.</P>
      <P>If the Minister is serious about tourism playing a bigger role in the development of our economic strength and job creation, he must allow it to have its own manpower agency.  It has to maintain its identity and it has to have a special reporting facility available to it, directly to the Minister.  To do otherwise dissipates the effort and diminishes its strength of reporting.  Unless it can report direct to its master, it cannot in return receive the guidelines and regulations to satisfactorily work under.  If the Minister persists in this matter we will force him over the line and deny this to him.  We are concerned that CERT will be submerged and that its small staff of 72, with a £5 million budget, will not be able to stand up to the enormous Goliath of AnCO with its 2,304 staff and a budget of £133.5 million.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>This will be the biggest embarrassment of all to this Government when they go to the people.</P>
      <P>As far as I am concerned, this little organisation, with a small staff and a small revenue, cannot hope to compete with the other enormous agencies by way of staff and by way of expenditure of moneys available to it.  CERT's reputation goes further than that, which I have just mentioned.  It was always a highly effective organisation in the way it runs its business, it has always used the resources available for training as provided by the vocational education committees. It is the only organisation here that has utilised that basic source of training in the vocational schools, or the technical schools as they were known in the past.  It has used the seasonal hotels for training purposes.  How many seasonal hotels, open for only six to eight weeks &mdash; the shortest season in the world &mdash; could survice without those CERT training courses operating in their premises during the lean winter months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>CERT was always conscious of that.  It was not just training for the service; it was utilising the existing hotel structure in the leaner times of the year.  CERT has never duplicated the work of the other agencies.  That cannot be said about the other three agencies that we are talking about dismantling here.  CERT has confined its business strictly to the tourism product, strictly to the catering and hotel <Col N="1307" /> industries, and has never got embroiled in arguments of policy or the distribution of money as far as the other agencies are concerned.  It confines itself strictly to the catering and hotel industry and has never become embroiled in arguing the policy of distribution of money in so far as the other agencies are concerned.  In a word, they mind their own business.  They also enjoy a considerable reputation as a means of entry to the catering and tourism industry.  I put it to the Minister that the name CERT is synonymous with training for tourism and they cannot maintain their individuality if they are merged at this time.  The thrust of this legislation is to snuff out their individuality and to bring them under the umbrella of the much larger operators in training.</P>
    <P>CERT has an enviable record in the placement of trainees.  No other organisation can put forward the case for recognition in that that CERT can, and if we are to use the yardstick of &ldquo;What can you show for the record?&rdquo; as the means for giving support, then CERT have proved beyond yea or nay that this record stands up to scrutiny.  I am not so sure that all elements of the other agencies could stand the same heat of the same kitchen. CERT's reputation can be put to the test, analysised and scrutinised.</P>
    <P>A critical appraisal of how CERT are doing is given by both their employers and employees: the employers who work in the tourism industry, all the 80,000 employees who operate there and all the other agencies involved all have a magnificant relationship with the management, the unions and the staff of CERT.  All these other agencies have not been kept at arms length by CERT; they have been invited to contribute to the development of CERT's policies, training procedures and curricula.  They have also been asked to participate in the recruitment and placement structures. We do not hear of too many other agencies inviting in outsiders to help out in developing their policy structure, but so strong are CERT on delivering the goods to the tourism industry that they invite <Col N="1308" /> all the agencies and all those who wish to contribute to participate in their policy development.</P>
    <P>CERT have an international reputation. They are internationally known in the hotel world associations.  The training organisations overseas and the hotel schools around Europe and America recognise CERT as the one organisation on whom they can rely to give them suitably trained people for further training. International placement agencies worldwide recognise the training and level of education provided by CERT.  There is tremendous co-operation between the Department of Education, the VECs and CERT.  They have established a national curriculum and certification board with the Department of Education, the VECs and the whole industry involved.  They are producing trainees who meet the needs of modern industry and, thank goodness, they are moving away at last, and are probably the first agency of any kind to move away, from the old UK curricula which are now out of date and not suited to the needs of a purely Irish tourist industry.</P>
    <P>If we are to develop our individuality, to be able to say to tourists worldwide: &ldquo;Come to Ireland.  We have something unique and special to show you and something for you to do, not just nice scenery, not just an unspoiled, unpolluted environment, not just the Irish welcome, but standards being put in place&rdquo;, the people we can rely on to create that international reputation for us must surely be the management, training and manpower agency who service the industry.  We would be much better advised to strengthen CERT, to give them a wider brief and then, as the Minister said in March, they might serve as the model for all the other training and placement agencies operating in the economy.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that great importance attaches to specialist training for tourism.  We are dealing with a sophisticated industry and a sophisticated international clientele who demand more, and the reason they demand more is that they have the choice.  There was a time when people thought that they <Col N="1309" /> would come to Ireland anyway, Ireland of the welcomes and the beautiful scenery. But, with the greater mobility of peoples around the world now and the greater amount of disposable income available to a wider range of peoples, they have the choice and we must create the environment that makes it necessary for them to choose Ireland.  The only way we can do that is by retaining our Irishness, by giving importance to standards and having the right tourism product at the right price.  Value for money is what it is all about in worldwide tourism now, and CERT are living up to the demands placed upon them in creating that environment for us; yet this Government and this Minister would seek to dismantle them.</P>
    <P>Let us take a look at the new Authority the Minister wants to develop.  That Authority must be dominated by the requirements of the other industries.  I am not stating that these other industries are any more major, because too often in the past it has been suggested that tourism was somehow the Cinderella of our export industries.  Tourism has an importance away beyond the recognition given to it in politics today.  It is our third largest revenue earner and, £ for £ invested, it returns more to the economy; yet we seek to detract from it down here by setting up this new Authority.  The needs of tourism will be smothered unless CERT is retained with sectoral policy control.  Tourism is not the poor relation as regards training policy and funding.  It has a specified need and is complex in that it varies greatly from one sector to another.  Tourist training should have recognition similar to that afforded to agricultural training as given under ACOT, for instance.  ACOT have a training mandate in the agricultural sector of industry, but why should the tourist industry not have available to it its own training structure?  What is so sacrosanct about maintaining this conglomerate so that they will impose their will on all surrounding them?  Manufacturing industry and its agencies here have sufficient clout so far as numbers and money are concerned.  They have always been able <Col N="1310" /> to impress their will and influence on the powers that be, but they will not do so on this occasion.</P>
    <P>We have a strange kind of double think from the Government at this time.  We spent the last few weeks breaking up a major organisation known as Córas Iompair Éireann, the transport authority, and we were told that it had to be done to create a more efficient system and give a better and more effective service to the whole country.  It seems that that could best be achieved by smaller organisations. We were asked this week to confirm that in legislation, and in the same week we are told that we must cancel out all the other smaller organisations in the training arena and bring them in under one head.  That is the kind of duplicity which we have become accustomed to during the lifetime of this Dáil, but it stops here tonight.</P>
    <P>Somebody can ask me, justifiably, what the great need is for autonomy in this organisation, CERT.  I say that there is need for that autonomy.  I do not want this organisation dominated by the needs of manufacturing industry.  I do not want them dominated by the needs of the IDA in regard to manufacturing and processing requirements because they will have to be satisfied anyway.  If we are going to give new political status, new emphasis and revenue support to the tourism industry to create the thousands of new jobs that we expect it to do, then we do not wish to see it submerged under the control of organisations that have their main thrust in support of other industries.  We want the organisation to be able to respond to the needs of tourism. We want CERT to influence tourism policy for job creation and manpower policy.  If I were a Minister for Tourism I would like to be able to call on CERT to do a specific job, to help out a new initiative in tourism development but I would be denied that opportunity as Minister if the organisation did not report directly to me.  Under the new industrial committee that will be structured into the new Authority, CERT will have to go four times around the mulberry bush <Col N="1311" /> before they even get as far as the board to enable them to pass on their report to the Minister.  The budget of CERT should be related to tourism training needs.  CERT have gained an international reputation in relation to training for the industry.  Does the Minister want to dismantle their reputation and put in their place a miserable committee that will downgrade it and submerge it to the wishes of other major industries?</P>

      <P>I do not know why the Minister is so anxious to defend this by barracking me across the floor when I am suggesting that it is not customary in the setting up of any new Authority for the Minister to nominate the director general. The Minister may nominate the chairman and he may pack the board with his own lackeys and hacks but it has always been left to the board to nominate, from those applying for the position, the director general.  For the first time we have an instance where the Minister is determined, even though he is leaving office, to smother the board's activity by having his own nominee in place to pull strings hereafter.  We do not want the Minister to do that.  We want the Minister to leave a correct board behind him because he has our goodwill for what he wants to do in the training sector.  To achieve the basic fundamental thing in the Minister's mind about the setting up of this new training Authority, he should put down an amendment that would satisfy our requirements to maintain CERT as an individual body.  If the Minister does not put that into the Bill <Col N="1315" /> we will have to change it afterwards ourselves.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not take up the time of the House by going into further detail on CERT as it has been covered adequately by Deputy Flynn in his ardent and passionate speech.  Because of the good record of CERT and because of their fears and the need to expand tourism, the concerns of CERT must be taken into consideration.  CERT should have autonomy.  Perhaps the Minister could ensure that while maintaining their autonomy they could fit within the umbrella of NETA.  CERT should get further training amenities so as to further build up their reputation and help their students.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Deputy agree that a good case has been made for their survival?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>The survival of CERT is very important because they have shown their ability to expand their training methods.  Deputy Flynn elaborated on this and I will not take up the time of the House by going over the same ground.  I should like to think that what the Minister is attempting in this Bill &mdash; and which I hope he achieves &mdash; will not just apply to CERT but also to the other agencies.  All training grants should be based on a more selective and strategic approach and CERT have used their grants to get the best results.</P>
      <P>The Minister said he hoped there would be practical arrangements to achieve greater co-operation between the education and manpower authorities in the transition from school to work and in the provision of vocational preparation. That is the foundation on which all employment and training must rest. There has been a conflict between where official education ends and where training begins.  This is a matter of grave concern and it was debated at length during the setting up of the Youth Employment Agency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Employment should be guaranteed by the education system and its support <Col N="1316" /> structures.  The policies to be adopted should take that into consideration.  I should like to refer the House to the September 1984 <i>National Youth Policy Committee, Final Report,</i> page 80, 8.7, which states:</P>
    <P>It is important to note the continuing correlation between class or socioeconomic background and educational participation and achievement at all levels, a phenomenon which Ireland shares with other countries.  A study of class and family-cycle inequalities published by the Economic and Social Research Institute in 1982 outlined the influence of the social class of one's parents on both the type of school one attends and the likelihood of one pursuing third-level education.</P>
    <P>A further ESRI paper has suggested that &ldquo;it is through restrictions on social mobility that closed social groupings emerge which are characterised by disparities in material and cultural resources, contrasting work experiences and residential segregation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is well known and a crying shame that our social mobility is one of the narrowest in Europe.  After 60 years, it is time to do something about it.  Education, status, privilege and indeed disadvantage are so deeply entrenched in the system that the Minister will have a Herculean task in changing things.  One of the most important things on the agenda will be to use the available resources in a selective and strategic way to try to get rid of the unemployment pattern which is written into some people's lives before they even reach the stage of being trained and which marks them even when they secure places on training schemes.  I hope that many of these matters will be addressed on Committee Stage and that the broad thrust and principles of the Bill will be taken into consideration.  The Authority resources may have to be taken by way of guidelines in regard to the provisions of the Bill which the Authority will be responsible for implementing.</P>
    <P>There should be very clear and explicit instructions and guidelines laid down in regard to achieving equality.  AnCO and <Col N="1317" /> the Youth Employment Agency have adopted equality of opportunity programmes and the setting up of this new Authority is a tremendous opportunity to continue the good work.  During a recent seminar organised by the Youth Employment Agency, which the Minister attended, the theme was &ldquo;50-50 is not equality&rdquo;.  I will elaborate on that point. Pilot programmes dealing specifically with women will not succeed unless the people administering them believe in them.  That is why, almost ten years after the passing of the Employment Equality Act, we have not achieved equality.  This is not because there are many people of bad will trying to hinder equality &mdash; I am sure that not many people are hostile to the idea of equality &mdash; but equal opportunity policies are needed and they must be implemented.</P>
    <P>There is what is known as the hidden curriculum.  People have either been conditioned to the hidden curriculum or they have traditional beliefs that this is the way it should be.  Career opportunities are still offered on the basis of sex stereotyping. It can start by making people believe that opportunities are not in the non-traditional areas.  It can be carried on, as young women &mdash; I am particularly talking about equal opportunities for young women &mdash; move into the areas where they may be seeking specific training under the agencies we are talking about.  That hidden curriculum will continue to operate to the extent that young women will still choose or be allowed to choose or not be guided into anything other than traditional jobs.  The Minister for Labour has a tremendous commitment to this section and to the long term unemployed.</P>
    <P>What I would ask of the Authority in the implementation of their policy is that our commitment to the long term unemployed would not mean we would guide young women presently in training into situations where they would find themselves part of the long term unemployed as that would be counterproductive to everything we are working towards. Therefore, we have to come right up <Col N="1318" /> front and say that yes we are going to have a positive policy and we are not going to apologise to anybody for it.  Not alone are we going to put it into our policy but we are going to implement it right down the line and when the Authority are reporting that is one of the areas which will be monitored every time.</P>
    <P>In fairness to some of the agencies such as AnCO and the Youth Employment Agency they have had modules, models and programmes of equal opportunity. Both those and others which have not yet been tried should be included and should be part and parcel of this policy.  Guidelines must be laid down.  Quantifiable goals must be set and assessed.  Investigations must be carried out if those goals are not achieved.  With the talent and the expertise available within these agencies it will not be beyond the bounds of possibility to analyse and assess very clearly why those goals have not been achieved and what improvements can be made. Let me give one instance which has either not been taken seriously or which has not been seen as a serious problem. It is one which many people in charge of training might be trained in themselves and skilled to deal with.  This has to do with the question of sexual harassment either in training or in the workplace.  If the trainers themselves need skills and training within new areas which they have not been trained in it should be part and parcel of the policy that they should have the opportunity to receive such training.</P>
    <P>AnCo have taken on equal opportunities programmes and one of the programmes which I welcome and which I would fight for its continuance is the return to a work course for women which is geared to integrating women back into the workforce.  I saw that as an initiative by AnCO and a course which may have put them over the boundary as far as their narrow terms of reference are concerned which are to do with training towards placement.  That is the kind of initiative we should expand on.  In saying that I also want to say that the programmes are to be welcomed so long as they are not seen as pilot programmes or programmes exclusively to one grouping.  I am aware <Col N="1319" /> that European Social Fund funding is available for pilot programmes for women such as women in technology etc.</P>
    <P>What worries me is that pilot programmes funded by the European Social Fund would be seen as doing their bit for women but not as progressing or expanding on it any more.  Pilot programmes must be seen as pilot programmes which receive special funding in order to enable us as a national Government to ensure that they are carried through, if proved successful, into the general system.  Why do I say this?  We still have figures which are disturbing.  We do know that positive affirmative action is needed and now is the time to sow it into the setting up of this Authority.</P>
    <P>Despite what I have said about the initiatives which have been taken by AnCO and of the awareness which exists within AnCO of the need for equal opportunity and positive affirmative action for women in 1985 68 per cent of trainees were male, 32 per cent were female and 99 per cent of apprenticeships were male.  These figures are disturbing ten years after the introduction of the Employment Equality Act.  I hope the Minister and the agencies under this Authority will recognise the urgent need to use this opportunity to build into the policy of the Authority achievable goals and aims.  They should implement a positive action programme which we are not ashamed of and which we will come out openly about.  They should ensure that we do not put other objectives before it and place it further down the agenda just because people say that with enough time we will grow into it or it will come about by itself.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  I hope it achieves its objectives which all of us welcome. Underlining and underpinning every single one of the principles, priorities and policies which will eventually come about, the bottom line must be the removal of inequality and the lack of opportunity either based on social reasons, gender reasons or historical or traditional reasons.  I would like to think that, with all-party support for this Bill, when looking <Col N="1320" /> back on this Bill we will recognise that possibly for the first time in an integrated way we set up an employment and training authority whose first priority and guiding influence was the removal of inequality and disadvantage and to bring about what we say, in lip service at least, that each person born in this country should have equal opportunities. If we can set and monitor the goals and ensure that everybody working within the Authority does not ignore but embrace them we will have achieved something that the Minister can truly feel proud of.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The interest shown in this Bill from the beginning must make it very clear to the Minister that many Members of this House are very concerned about its contents.  I am sure the Minister will heed the views expressed by Members, not just from this side of the House but from the back benches of his own party and the Labour Party.  We are all involved in this legislation because all of us have close contact with AnCO, CERT and the National Manpower Service. I know the Minister will not be offended if I say the Youth Employment Agency is a non-runner.  It is of no great significance and that is a pity.  Regarding the National Manpower Service, people who are unemployed register with them as being available for work and if a vacancy arises a number of people on the register are sent for interview.  It must be a most frustrating place to work because the success rate is so low.  The same people are calling day after day, week after week in the hope that the service will be able to do something for them. They are met with courtesy and kindness in most cases but at the end of the day they are still unemployed and not hopeful about the future.</P>
      <P>This legislation hopes to bring four agencies under the one umbrella &mdash; AnCO, CERT, the National Manpower Service and the Youth Employment Agency.  I hope the Manpower Service will be given something positive and definite to do so that they can help those depending on them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1321" /> While I can on occasion be critical of AnCO and CERT, they are to be complimented on their efforts to fulfil their responsibilities.  AnCO are an organisation who have served this country very well, especially in recent times of recession.  In the mid-west region and the Limerick area my interest virtually overlaps into the territory covered by three AnCO centres at Limerick, Shannon and Tralee.  The Tralee centre is the one nearest to my home.  During my years in this House both in Government and in Opposition I have seen AnCO grow in stature, performance and reputation at home and abroad.  In the mid-west region when people both young and old are in difficulty they talk about going to AnCO to get some additional training in order to be better equipped for the next interview that may come their way.</P>
    <P>Meeting my colleagues from other administrations in Europe, I have been surprised and delighted to hear the praise of AnCO.  AnCO have a high reputation for producing training programmes and new methods of training.  We were proud and pleased to learn of the experience of AnCO at Louvain.  I did not have the opportunity to visit Louvain but I will do so at the first opportunity.  I compliment the Minister and those involved on doing an excellent job and on the way the success story was presented through television to the Irish people.  The programme was presented by Labhras Ó Murchú.  The Minister participated, as did the AnCO people and Tom Hardiman, the director general, as well as John Burke from the Bank of Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>And Malachy Sherlock from AnCO.  I must add that the Deputy would be made most welcome at Louvain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister. The programme was recorded for me on a video tape in my home since I was absent when it was first shown.  I keep the video tape in my library because I value it as a very worthwhile programme. I thank the Minister for his statement that I would be welcome in Louvain.  We <Col N="1322" /> should all do anything we can to help that kind of project.  It is great to see our young people in a new environment ready to take on the best that the mightier nations of Europe have to offer.  I have no doubt that the success story will grow as more people participate.</P>
      <P>AnCO have been generously treated since over half their training costs come from the Social Fund in Brussels.  They earn foreign currency for us because the 50 per cent grant probably would not come to us unless we could convince the Commission that the money was being well spent.  AnCO have received £250 million over a period of five years. Foreign earnings of this amount are to be welcomed for other reasons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>AnCO will train this year about 40,000 people.  They are also responsible for training employed people.  I know from personal experience people in their thirties or forties who, through no fault of their own, found themselves unemployed and redundant.  It was a shattering experience with which they could not cope.  I know of one or two people whom I thought nothing could rattle until I met them accidentally, when they had lost their jobs, were unemployed and felt as if they were being discarded, going to be shifted quietly away from the mainstream in which they had served a useful purpose. It had a shattering effect on their morale.  One very able person having lost his job could not admit to his family for about six months that he no longer had a job.  He left home every morning at about 8.10 a.m. pretending to his wife and two lovely children that he had a job to go to. He was at his wits' end when he came my way accidentally.  One or two of us advised him and tried to help him and we went to AnCO.  That man was very successful on the AnCO course and nobody in this House could give sufficient praise to that organisation for the excellent job they do in this area.  They helped the man to recover from the downward, slippery slide he was on, gave him back his pride and dignity and that little extra whatever it is that we all need now and again to face up to reality.  That man has climbed up again and is on the road to <Col N="1323" /> success, but he would not have had that second chance but for the fact that AnCO were there.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I know we do not differ in what I have said just now about the role that AnCO play.  I shall come to CERT in a few moments.  They are in a different area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but I am just making the contrast.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that.  I shall make the point later that CERT in their own way have a most valuable role to play and I talk as someone coming from the mid-west region where tourism is one of our most important assets and one that we must protect.  I shall leave it to my friend and neighbour, Deputy John O'Leary from Killarney, to tell the House how important CERT are to the area he represents.  I am on the fringe of that area and the Minister knows that.  I am not disagreeing with him in any way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>AnCO have played and are playing a major role working with the IDA and in my region, the mid-western region, working with the Shannon Free Airport Development Company, in training all the people employed in new industries. As a party, we support the idea of one Manpower agency and I accepted this in principle as something that could only be of value having regard to the different layers of bureaucracy that were there. But above and beyond all that, having regard to what I as an ordinarycitizen and taxpayer could see, we are not getting a fair and proper return for the money being spent.  It is easy to be the hurler on the ditch and to criticise.  I do not want to be unfair to anybody.  There are people in all the agencies, even those of which I was critical earlier on, particularly the Youth Employment Agency, who are genuinely doing their best.  However, <Col N="1324" /> where I must be critical is regarding the value for money to the State, the Exchequer and the taxpayer.  That is highly questionable.  I was at a seminar arranged by SFADCo and the Youth Employment Agency at Newcastle West a short number of months ago and I was not at all impressed &mdash; I will leave it at that.  I felt there were so many other things that one could have been doing on that evening that would have been far more beneficial.</P>
    <P>When I saw the Bill which the Minister introduced and listened to his contribution on how the new organisation, NETA, were going to be set up, I began to wonder if he was going about this in the right way.  Although I admired the speech of my colleague, Deputy Flynn, I differ from him in parts.  He dealt with tourism and the House will recognise he is one of the most knowledgeable people in the country on that topic.  There is a need for a more positive approach to tourism than we have had up to now.  I am not blaming anybody for that.  There is need for a place in Government for a Minister with sole responsibility for tourism. We must now face the reality that the tourist world does not owe us anything, that we have to go out and prove to the market that it is in their interests to holiday in our country.</P>
    <P>We have a very highly successful body like AnCO, a large organisation with over 2,000 employees.  Nothing could be further from the truth than that AnCO would want in any way to take CERT under their wing and make them a poor relation, as it were.  I have received no indication whatsoever from anybody connected with AnCO that they would want to smother or take to themselves the small organisation of CERT who are doing an excellent job.  I would not think that would be so.  AnCO are a powerful organisation and have a powerful reputation here and throughout Europe.  They are quite capable of going the road on their own and being allowed to continue. I cannot see anything in it for AnCO in amalgamating with a failed organisation like the Youth Employment Agency, nothing whatsoever, unless it is to throw <Col N="1325" /> the lifebelt to that agency, a cosmetic election gimmick set up by the Coalition in 1982.  Now their role and the purpose of their levy are being abandoned, which shows that the failure is being admitted and that is good.  At least, the Government are now publicly recognising they made a mistake.  I would not want that mistake to be made into a greater one, damaging AnCO when they are being made to amalgamate with the Youth Employment Agency, which the public at large know have achieved nothing. This amalgamation is being rushed through with a certain haste.  If this debate has achieved anything to date &mdash; and I hope it has &mdash; it has achieved its purpose in giving the House, the Minister and the Government and also the public an opportunity to dwell on the contents of the Bill, and to see if the public interest is being served, and if it will be served in the future if the Bill is enacted.  I am not sure that the public interest is being best served.  I have read the Minister's speech. I have heard what our spokesman had to say.  I listened to as much of the debate as I could, and I read what was carried in the newspapers.  I believe the general interest being shown here will lead to more interest being taken by the ordinary people outside, the taxpayers, and those who have a relationship with the agencies involved, particularly AnCO and CERT.</P>

I will not make a meal of this because I know the Minister did not mean it and, even if he did, he had better pretend he did not <Col N="1326" /> because <i>The Irish Times</i> would not be as forgiving as I am.</P>

      <P>I am not giving advice because, Lord knows, I have enough trouble advising myself.</P>
      <P>I do not always agree with editorials, that is natural.  They get it right most of the time, and there are times when they do not.  But this time I believe they did get it right.  I will deal with the contents of the editorial later.  It is good that in our democratic system the introduction of a Bill should attract such attention as to merit the principal editorial in <i>The Irish Times</i> on a Saturday morning.  It must be an important subject to merit editorial comment.  One might not agree with the contents but the fact that it merited comment by <i>The Irish Times</i>, a quality newspaper, on the most important morning, Saturday morning, is a good thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>That point is well taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that.  I am quite sincere in my compliments to the Minister when I say that some of the arguments for co-ordination he has made in this House, and that he has written, are very compelling.  They are good arguments. I could quibble with them and say some are incomplete, but on the whole they are good arguments.  The Minister knows me well enough to believe that, if I did not mean this, I would not say it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When Fianna Fáil were discussing this legislation we seriously considered some of the Minister's suggestions, but our conclusions were not the same as the Minister's, that is a natural result.  The Minister <Col N="1327" /> knows that if we were introducing this legislation we would have omitted CERT.  This has been said by almost every Member of this party and by a number of Government backbenchers as well.  The advertising personnel, the marketers, the sales persons, have in recent times come up with a slogan which successfully promoted ideas, that is that small is beautiful.  That applies to CERT.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">

      <P>Does it apply to the Labour Party?</P>

      <P>On the Bill please.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>If you will forgive me, I will keep to the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought the Deputy's logic might be consistent&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a very clever interjection by the Minister because if I said yes, the same could not apply to my party, which is bigger than the Labour Party, and, if I said no, he could say that if I applied this logic to a small organisation I should also apply it to his party. However, I had better keep to the Bill.</P>
      <P>I am very satisfied that CERT, a small organisation, 23 years in existence a long established organisation, is accepted by everybody, including the Minister, as an organisation which works extremely well. The hotel industry are satisfied with its services and it does not infringe on industrial policy and industrial development, important though the hotel and tourist trades are to Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our party approach to this issue would concentrate on the agencies and bodies concerned with Manpower services for industry and commerce and all its aspects.  I am talking about the Government's paper on industrial policy. How can we link manpower policy and industrial policy?  Where does educational policy fit in with the developments in new technology in the engineering schools and universities? What reference or consideration is being <Col N="1328" /> given to the major commercial technological advances on the campus of NIHE, Limerick, which contains some of the brightest young people in the country today?  One must ask how this new umbrella organisation, NETA, will infringe on the RTCs.  One should ask if part of the training work of BIM fits into the new Manpower Authority?  Where does the training role of ACOT fit in?</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>We took a conscious decision to exclude agriculture, including fisheries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>And wisely so.  The fact that their inclusion might have led to a very big Bill should not have been the reason for excluding them.  I am sure it was the Minister's intention to omit those agencies from the Bill because, quite properly, they were not appropriate to be included.  I accept that, but I make the case that CERT should also have been excluded from the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One could argue that fishing and all downstream prospects for processing are industrial commercial activities.  One could argue for second phase enterprises on farms, for members of the family who might not be getting the family farm, or for a second child on a farm.  These people could become involved in the manufacture of cheeses, yoghurts or jams.  These are commercial activities to say nothing of product development and processing in the food industry.  One could make that case.  One may ask what role is there for the county development teams.  Perhaps the fact that this debate has developed into a debate in which many people have shown great interest will give the Minister an opportunity to have a fresh look at the matter. I want to think and believe that our future depends on building on the proven strengths of organisations such as AnCO, ACOT, our universities, the NIHEs, the regional colleges and the county development teams.  The work of these organisations, properly co-ordinated in a well planned way, can capitalise on developing and supporting the young people <Col N="1329" /> and their talents and they are Ireland's greatest strength and hope for the future.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister is now convinced, from the tone of the comments made in the debate to date, that this party will very willingly give him full support for the Bill if he is prepared to examine the suggestions that are being made and which command such widespread support throughout the country at present.  There is no difference between the Minister and me in our views on the success story of CERT.  I was glad of an occasion to be the Minister's guest at CERT headquarters.  I was very proud of the way visiting dignatories from other States within the European Community were treated by people who are being trained by CERT.  I know the Minister was proud, too; otherwise the function would not have taken place.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>We are all proud of what CERT have achieved to date.  Some of us are more in touch with CERT than others because of the regions we represent in this Parliament and because of the tourist industry in the particular regions.  God was very good to certain parts of this country &mdash; the south-west, which is very ably represented by my colleague, Deputy John O'Leary, and myself, and the mid-west.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MattBrennan" hpid="Mr. M. Brennan Mr. M. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>What about the west?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I will leave the west to Deputy Brennan.  I have no doubt that he will more than ably see to it that its interests are properly represented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will admit that he had to come to Dublin to proclaim how good he was to the west.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>How good I was or how good Deputy Brennan was to the west?  In the south-west which includes Kerry, west Cork, Clare, Limerick and also north Tipperary because of the inability of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle <Col N="1330" /> to sell his wares in the House this evening, tourism is a vitally important factor.  In the mid-west region the value of tourism has an exceptionally high economic significance. In 1985 there was in excess of 750,000 tourists in the mid-west region, almost 200,000 of whom originated from North America, 125,000 originated from Britain, approximately 100,000 originated from Europe and the remainder, almost half of the entire total, from the other parts of the country.  The value of tourism in direct revenue is estimated at £78.7 million.  Nobody will doubt but that this is a highly significant contribution to the economic activity of the region.  I can assure the Minister &mdash; not that he needs assurance on this &mdash; that the benefits of the economic uplift to the region from tourism are felt throughout the entire region, urban and rural, and within every parish in the mid-western area.</P>
      <P>Tourists and tourism revenue generate employment.  This benefit is well advanced in the mid-western region.  The region employs people in a wide variety of tourism related jobs, and at all levels of skills, in hotels and guesthouses and, in particular, farm guesthouses.  Many small family farms are no longer able to provide an income for the family and so the housewife, as the Leas-Cheann Comhairle knows, has to supplement the family income by running a nice family guesthouse.  Publicians, those involved in the catering and entertainment business, car rental people, shops, airports and historic houses all benefit from tourism.  In our part of the country the horse-drawn caravan industry is an extremely important success story and is very popular with the French, the Germans and other continentals.  In the North Tipperary area as well as in my county there are cruising facilities on the Shannon.  These are also exceptionally popular.  In the mid-western region of Clare, Limerick and north Tipperary approximately 10,000 people are employed in tourist related jobs.  That is a colossal figure.  There is great room for improvement in that area.  We must be watchful of what we are doing to attract tourists and to develop our potential.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1331" /> I agree with what Deputy Flynn said earlier in the debate, that the tourist public are now more mobile than ever before.  We have to attract more people to our country.  There is a greater obligation on us than ever before to encourage more of our people to holiday at home.  I mean that very sincerely as one who has made a habit and a practice of holidaying at home as I am aware also does the Minister.  I wish he could influence some of his colleagues in Government to give a better example in that respect.  I say that without any rancour and I am not point scoring in any way. That does not help.  I appreciate how important it is for a member of Government to have a holiday with his or her family having regard to the very difficult task, physical and otherwise, of being in Government.</P>
    <P>One of the better ways to encourage more people to become involved in the tourist industry is by giving them better value for money.  I am not just talking about hotels.  There are very few Irish people who can go on holiday to the Grade A hotels for two weeks or even for a week.  It is a shame that prices are so high.  Most couples who have children are not in a position to holiday in grade A hotels during the holiday season. However, we are fortunate in having a second line hotel system that can accommodate families &mdash; farm guesthouses and private houses.  Many Irish people stay in such accomodation.  I know of one beautiful guesthouse on the south west coast of County Kerry, in Deputy O'Leary's constituency, that is run by the wife of a fisherman.  At times that woman can accommodate up to ten people.  The income from that business is very necessary for that family because during the long winter months her husband cannot go shell fishing, which is his only occupation. The lady of that house takes great pride in preparing food for her guests. She gives them the best of fish from the sea, presenting an all-fish menu each day. She ensures that the bedrooms, the living room and sitting room are spick and span. Her house is a credit to her.  I accept that <Col N="1332" /> it is important that she should have her accommodation in good condition because they depend on that business for their survival in the winter time and it is good to know that they are so successful. In fact people who come intending to stay for one night often stay for three or four days.  Being shrewd, like most Kerry people, they cater very well for their guests.  The husband often invites guests to accompany him on his fishing trips.  It is that added attraction that helps guests enjoy their stay.  Some people get tired if they do not have something to do during the day.  I could not spend two weeks lying on a beach.  I would lose the little balance I have if I was asked to do so, but I enjoy going to sea on a nice day fishing with that gentleman.  It is wonderful to share the pleasure of lifting the string of a couple of hundred lobster pots, pulling in a few nets or throwing out lines to catch bait for the following days fishing.  Money could not buy that type of holiday.</P>
    <P>CERT should encourage more people to get involved in that area, whether they are owners of guesthouses or the owners of farm house accommodation.  Children who accompany their parents on holidays at farm house accommodation can play with the animals on the farm.  We have tremendous potential in regard to tourism. One of the greatest challenges any member of a Government could be given would be to be appointed Minister for Tourism.  That individual would have to ensure that the cobwebs are shaken off that industry, and that needs to be done in a big way, and that tourists get value for money.  It is important that those who visit this country are well catered for so that when they return home they will encourage their friends to visit here. Tourism is the third biggest earner in our economy but there is no reason why it should not return to the position it held some years ago, second in importance. We should make the effort.</P>
    <P>We should try to do something about cleaning up our countryside on an individual and a community basis.  We should not depend on local authorities or agencies like CERT and AnCO to do that <Col N="1333" /> work for us.  One black mark against us is that we are so reckless and careless about our environment, which is about the best thing we have going for us in terms of selling the country as a holiday centre.  I have a good knowledge of the activities of CERT in the mid-west region and in Kerry.  I live within easy reach of Killarney and the popular Kerry beaches.</P>
    <P>We appreciate that the CERT offices. in Limerick and Kerry are so accessible to us.  The Shannon College of Hotel Management is one of the success stories of that region, a success story that is the envy of many nations.  The college was one of our first training colleges in hotel management and I know many of the managers who graduated from it in the early sixties.  One criticism I have of them is that at that time they were playing for the higher market and forgetting the home market which is so valuable.  Some years ago I had occasion to question a manager who did not welcome a group of Americans I brought to his hotel because we were not wearing neckties. We were delayed on our journey and we did not have time to get properly attired for the evening meal.  We would be more than welcome now.  I hope we have learned from that period.</P>
    <P>I have more than a passing interest in the hotel industry in the mid-west region because of close family involvement and involvement by my in-laws and I know how valuable CERT have been to the hotel industry.  As a person who spent some years in the educational field&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I remember.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;I know how valuable CERT have been to young boys and girls.  Many young people were given training in hotel management and catering and helped carve out a worthwhile career for themselves in the tourism industry.  Recently I went to a political function in the Neptune Centre in Cork. A young woman asked me if I remembered her.  I did not, and told her so.  She said, &ldquo;You should, I was one of your students in earlier days.  Now I am an assistant manageress in one of the Cork <Col N="1334" /> hotels&rdquo;.  That girl would not have had the opportunity to get so far if it were not for the existence of CERT to provide a course for her when she had completed her second level education.  I remembered that that girl at the age of 14 had to cycle 14 miles to and from the second level school where she was educated. That was before Donagh O'Malley introduced the free bus transport scheme.  If anybody deserved to be successful, she did.  We wish her well.</P>
      <P>CERT was the mechanism that opened up opportunities for such young people. It had everything going for it.  As an organisation it had the personal touch. Its personnel were able to make decisions spontaneously and immediately.  It gave immediate help to people who had problems in the industry.  Nobody has said in the House that CERT has not been a success, and we are genuinely worried because CERT may not be as successful in future under the umbrella of this new big organisation.  CERT will be part of a huge complicated structure whose board will be comprised of 15 people and a chairman: There will be four representatives of ICTU, four of FUE, three representing social welfare, education and youth, two to be nominated by the Minister and two by the trade unions.</P>
      <P>As part of that huge organisation, CERT may lose much of the ability it has had to deal with the problems of the industry.  At the moment it is free to make its own decisions, does not have to look over its shoulder, it is a small organisation which has a staff of 72. Because it has been a nice small unit it could make its decisions and stand over them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have gone to reasonable rounds to show the Minister how valuable tourism is to Ireland, particularly in the region I represent.  It generated revenue of £80 million in 1985 and neither I nor the Minister would want anything to happen that would interfere with that success story.  However, there is colossal scope for improvement.  Of course those involved in tourism must be careful; our weather had a dampening effect on Irish people taking their holidays at home two <Col N="1335" /> summers in a row.  With our tourism people working hand in hand with CERT &mdash; there has been a close relationship between them &mdash; our efforts to help the industry to grow will be successful. Therefore, my fear is logical: that if CERT is brought into this huge organisation we will run the risk of damaging our tourism industry.  I am open to be convinced that the move is the right one. At the moment I am not convinced.</P>
    <P>I hope that, as it goes on, this debate will attract more and more public interest.  I do not know if there is a representative of RTE here.  I should like to see a full programme on our national television station on the contents of this Bill, with the different interests involved letting us know what they think would be in the best interests of the industry.  I would hope that in such a programme we would have representatives of the hotels federation and of guesthouse owners to give us their views.</P>
    <P>This is a non-political Bill as far as I am concerned.  We are talking about two very important organisations, AnCo and CERT.  I do not think the other two involved in the new organisation are as important.  The Minister and I can agree to differ on that.  I have made my case fairly because it is so easy to upset people. The beneficiaries of AnCO training and those involved with CERT should be involved in a public debate on this subject. Would it not be nice to have a programme on radio and television of the kind I have suggested rather than to be going back again and again over the social welfare issues we have been debating in the House for the past couple of weeks?</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not implying that the Minister has not gone as far as he could within the limits of his office to consult vested interests on this issue.  The <Col N="1336" /> Minister will agree that public interest in White Papers in minimal as far as the man in the street is concerned.  People ask: &ldquo;What is a White Paper but a plaything of civil servants who have nothing to do but sit down, think and then put it in a White Paper&rdquo;.  I am not being in any way offensive.  I am not talking about the Minister's officials but God help me if I ever have to go to a manpower agency to sign on.  The Minister knows what I am trying to say.  I am not being in any way discourteous to the civil servants.</P>

I am deliberately not saying whether it was he or she because they were both there.  I was sitting at my fire-side and champing at the bit watching the television set and thinking what an opportunity I would make of that if I was there, so I sat back and drank my cup of tea&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not.  I am trying to make the point that public awareness of what is involved in this Bill, and other Bills, is not what it should be.  There is room for a worthwhile dissemination of information on the issues.  It should be put before the people to let them decide. <Col N="1337" /> I say this because it is non-political. Everybody in the country would want to see any organisation set up to help the community in any way being a success. Many of these successful organisations now being organised and managed differently under new authorities may find that it has an adverse effect not just on their operations but on the industry they cater for.  In these circumstances we need a greater public input into these discussions. I am not suggesting that the Minister arrange for himself and my good self to debate this matter on a television programme.  There are others more knowledgeable than I who could debate the matter with the Minister, but I have a genuine fear that this is not a change for the better.</P>

      <P>There are a few other points I wanted to make, although I have spoken a little longer than I had planned.  I ask the Minister to have another look at the matter. The arguments that have been made are fairly good.  I think the Minister is man enough to take on board a good idea from any side of the House, particularly if it is non-political and is put forward out of concern for a worthwhile industry with fantastic potential and which could, if properly developed and nurtured along the way, provide an economic life-line for many of our communities.</P>

      <P>This Bill proposes to amalgamate a number of agencies concerned with training and employment.  I do not agree entirely with this proposal for a number of reasons which I will state.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The writing was on the wall for CERT when the Government's White Paper on tourism was published on 27 September 1985.  There is no reference whatever to CERT in that document.  I would have thought there should be some reference to them because they play such a vital <Col N="1338" /> role in the tourist business here as well as in the catering business.  I do not know if a decision had been made at that stage to incorporate CERT in a wider organisation.</P>
    <P>We in Kerry are very happy with AnCO.  Since its establishment in 1972 over 6,000 trainees and apprentices have been trained at the AnCO training centre in Tralee.  Training is provided in traditional areas such as construction, metal fabrication, fitting, general engineering and hairdressing.  Sponsorship by industry for apprentice courses in 1986-87 is exceedingly high at 71 per cent, one of the highest figures in the country, and it reflects industry's satisfaction with AnCO training in Kerry.  AnCO are also very important to the area of new technology. All trainees and apprentices attending the AnCO training centre in Kerry have a computer appreciation input in their training courses, thereby preparing them to meet the demands of new technology in their future careers. Allied to this there is a business computer studies course for unemployed adults. Courses in electronics, servicing, updating of skills in such areas as hydraulics, pneumatics, electronics, and robotic technology were established in 1984 and during 1985 AnCO in their Tralee headquarters, introduced computerised machines for tool-making, and high pressure plastic welding will be included in the advanced welding course.  Recognising that small businesses will provide many of tomorrow's jobs, AnCO in Kerry have already expanded their activities into the area of product development. This Kerry training centre has always been in close contact with the industries surrounding it so that it knows their training problems, their needs, the challenges they have to meet, and their opportunities.  It is an acknowledged fact in business that training can never be static, and AnCO's response to the community is never inflexible and their dealings with the industry are never routine.</P>
    <P>The community youth training programme has been of tremendous assistance to AnCO.  Through this scheme AnCO give unemployed young people, <Col N="1339" /> redundant apprentices and craftsmen an opportunity to acquire new skills and continue their training on projects which are of benefit to the community.  At present 13 projects are in progress in Kerry under the community training programme.  For example, on Valentia Island a scheme of repair work is being carried out on the homes of elderly people in conjunction with the Southern Health Board and in Waterville there is the building of a fishery hatchery and there are improvement works on national spawning beds.  In Tralee there are a number of projects such as the building of a sportsfield dressing facilities and of surrounding walls in the recreation area of the new Marion Park Development Association.  In Tralee, too, the old windmill is being reconstructed to working conditions.  In Causeway we have the building of a sportsfield dressing room by AnCO and again in the Tralee-Fenit area AnCO are actively engaged in the repair and reconstruction of part of the existing railway line so that a steam locomotive with carriages can be run as a tourist amenity.  In Ballyferriter we have the construction of a community care centre.</P>
    <P>These are some of the many schemes being carried out by AnCO in Kerry under the community youth training programme. In my town of Killarney they are engaged in building an extension to existing offices for Kerry Dioceasan Youth Services and renovating an old monastery building for a handicapped workshop.  In Glenbeigh they are involved in the construction of a dressing room on the sportsfield. AnCO continue their support for the community workshop in Tralee which caters for young people under the Government's social guarantee programme and 50 people are in training there at the moment.</P>
    <P>The travelling people's workshop in Killarney is moving into an IDA advance factory with male and female workshops combined.  The workshop will be working towards being an enterprise workshop totally.  The areas concerned will be needlework, leatherwork, ironwork, forging, basket weaving, repairing furniture <Col N="1340" /> and enterprises related to the area. Twenty people are in training at the moment at this centre.</P>
    <P>On the community response programme archeological surveys are taking place in Cahirciveen, Castleisland and Listowel under the supervision of qualified archaeologists and assistants.  These programmes give young people the rare opportunity of sampling skills in this field and finding out historical information relating to their area.  The survey teams will each bring forward a book on their findings.  Expert advice is being given through Professor Monk from UCC.  At the moment I have a proposal for carrying out an archaeological survey in the Killarney area and I would like to see this being assisted by AnCO and carried out by the Killarney Historical and Archaeological Society.</P>
    <P>AnCO in Kerry are committed to working closely within the community and with industry in the Kerry catchment area.  The training centre staff are in touch constantly with every local effort on various fronts.  The Kerry training centre is one aspect of AnCO's presence in the county.  The county spirit in any field cannot be beaten and I would not like to see this broken up in Kerry.  AnCO here have an external training division which is a training advisory service related to the people in industries in their own locations and that is also a great asset to the community.  AnCO training staff assist firms in Kerry in all training matters.  The work of the training advisory service includes company visits, promotion of levy grant schemes, consultation with industrial training committees, co-ordination of training facilities, responsibility for apprenticeship training and regulation of training grants for the IDA.  Close on 200 companies with a wide variety of industrial sectors in Kerry are availing of this service at present.  The external training division of AnCO by utilising suitable external training agencies provide an extensive range of high quality training programmes for unemployed persons throughout the Kerry area.  Typical programmes include &ldquo;Start up your own <Col N="1341" /> business&rdquo;, product and material control, management development, overseas marketing and business promotion.  It would be a crying shame to upset the treamendous programme being implemented by AnCO in Kerry.</P>
    <P>The staff at all levels attached to the AnCO training centre in Kerry are most co-operative and helpful to any individual or organisation who may approach them on any matter.  Their skills in the training and development of young apprentices are well known and appreciated.</P>
    <P>I turn to tourism and CERT.  Coming from Killarney and from Kerry which is the Mecca of tourism here, I would like to make a few points.  It is not right or fair to the hotel and catering industry to take CERT out of their present context and away from the great work which they are doing at the moment and to move them into another arena.  CERT are 100 per cent successful and any organisation who are 100 per cent successful should not be touched except for grave and compelling reasons.  The Government seem to have doubts in their minds about the future of CERT when in their White Paper on Tourism Policy published on 7 September 1985 there is no mention of the role which CERT will play in the future of tourism.  I will give figures to prove the importance of CERT to this industry but first let me say that tourism and Killarney would seem to be synonymous. County Kerry has a long tradition as one of the prime tourist areas boasting such famous beauty sports as the Lakes of Killarney, the Ring of Kerry, the Dingle Peninsula and some of the finest scenery and beaches in Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately, the tourist season in the county is of short duration and many of the people employed in catering and in other areas involved in tourism have no option at the end of the tourist season but to resort to the employment exchanges.  Many of our hotels, guesthouses and restaurants, particularly in seaside resorts close for <Col N="1342" /> the winter.  In some of our larger towns, particularly in Tralee and Killarney, efforts have been made and continue to be made to extend the tourist season through the promotion of festivals, conferences, seminars, race meetings, sports meetings and so on.  Much success has been achieved and Kerry is recognised as a location which has much to offer in these-areas.  Kerry has an outdoor educational centre at Cappanalea which is open all the year around and which is very well supported not only by outdoor pursuit enthusiasts but also my many schools.  With the ever growing demand for outdoor pursuits facilities at home and abroad it is expected that the Cappanalea centre will not only continue to function but will expand its capacity to meet that demand.</P>
      <P>To prove the need for the retention of CERT and the training they give at the moment let me say that Kerry is well known and recognised as a centre for conferences, seminars&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The development of a proper conference centre in the county would be of considerable benefit in any promotional plans.</P>

      <P>In relation to the proposal to remove CERT from their present status and to place them within the ambit of a proposed new organisation, I will give some facts and figures for the Cork-Kerry region which has the second highest employment level in the hotel and catering sector.  The region is treated as one unit by CERT.  In the region there were 11,477 people <Col N="1343" /> employed in the hotel and catering services in 1984.  Some of the organisations involved in the hotel and catering trade in the south west would not be able to employ trained staff were it not for CERT.  In hotels 4,326 people were employed and in restaurants there were 1,320 employed in 1984.  In hospitals and institutions which also draw from CERT there were 3,136 employed in the Cork-Kerry region.  There are quite a number of people employed in the bar food outlets, in delicatessens and take-aways in industrial catering and in guest houses. There are 137 hotels and 69 guest houses registered with Bord Fáilte in the region. These employed 4,924 people or 37 per cent of the total number employed.  This figure does not take into account persons working in unregistered establishments.</P>
      <P>The demand for places on CERT training courses in Kerry is extremely high. To cater for that demand CERT should expand their training role particularly in relation to basic skills for unemployed young people.  I am concerned that sufficient funds are not being made available to CERT for training purposes especially when one considers that the hotel and catering industry is an integral part of the tourist industry which has such an enormous growth potential.  We must remember that the tourist industry will be the greatest growth industry in the world between now and the year 2000.</P>
      <P>In assessing the training activities of CERT in County Kerry I recommend that an increased allocation of funds be made available to them to meet current and projected training needs.  A second basic skills programme should be run each year in Killarney and CERT should be asked to investigate the possibility of running its preliminary CERT course in other centres in the county.  CERT should be asked to run their &ldquo;start your own business&rdquo; course in County Kerry.  This course would be relevant here because of the counties high dependence on earnings from the tourist industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>CERT expects a 2 per cent growth in employment in the hotel and catering industry in 1987.  The hotel and catering <Col N="1344" /> industry in Kerry is very much dependent on tourism and many of the hotels, guesthouses and restaurants operate on a seasonal basis and seasonal and casual employment levels are higher than in most other areas.  The demand for trained staff is high in County Kerry during the summer and many establishments have extreme difficulty in recruiting suitably trained staff.  It is hard to get trained kitchen staff, chefs and cooks.</P>
    <P>The hotel and catering industry provides attractive employment for young people as is evidenced by the high demand for places on CERT courses. CERT will hopefully expand the training provided for young people in Kerry which has a tremendous potential for development in tourism which will create a demand for employees in the hotel and catering sector.  CERT should consider, as a matter of urgency appointing a full time regional training adviser for County Kerry.  At the moment one adviser serves both Cork and Kerry.</P>
    <P>An organisation like CERT which is 100 per cent successful in deplorable economic conditions should be left alone. CERT is easily identified with the hotel, catering and tourism industry.  They have served the Cork-Kerry region well over the last 23 years.  We look forward to CERT continuing their involvement in the further development of the tourist industry in the region.  The proposed merger of CERT with other bigger and less responsive agencies causes serious concern to those involved in tourism.  Virtually all interests in the industry oppose this merger.  CERT has an excellent success record and I would ask the Minister not to interfere with their role.  As Deputy Collins said, small is beautiful.  If something works well it should not be changed.</P>
    <P>CERT fulfills an important role in tourism in Killarney and in the whole region. Apart from the services it provides and the wonderful opportunities it gives to students to gain worthwhile employment, it is important to the tourism industry. They use our hotels in the off-peak season for training purposes.  The social impact on the town of young people undergoing <Col N="1345" /> training courses during the winter is very good.  It generates a certain amount of confidence that something is happening and will continue to happen in the coming season.  Killarney and CERT complement each other in many ways and we are proud to be able to present CERT with a choice of first-class hotels to house their students during off-peak seasons, for training purposes.  We can provide CERT with accommodation for practical and theory classes.  The hotels are in a good state of repair and there is adequate accommodation for the numbers to be trained.  It is a serious error of judgement on the part of the Government to remove CERT from its present role and integrate it into a new organisation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I sincerely thank you for allowing me to raise this matter and I also want to thank the Minister for coming in to reply.  I wish to allocate some of my time to Deputy Treacy.</P>
      <P>I raised this matter in the Dáil on 18 November and I asked the Minister for Agriculture if he would have discussions with the management of Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann to avert the scaling down of operations in the Tuam sugar factory. The Minister of State, Deputy Hegarty, replied as follows:</P>
      <P>When the Government decided in December 1983 that the proposal of Siúicre Éireann to cease production of sugar at Tuam should not then be proceeded with, they indicated that a substantial saving in the cost of operating the factory must be achieved and that this would involve a significant reduction in the workforce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the Minister did not answer the question I asked in regard to having discussions with the management and, even though I asked two further supplementary questions in relation to the <Col N="1346" /> scaling down of the factory, the Minister did not give any guarantees.  The Minister said, sarcastically, that he was sure I paid rate heed to what the management said.</P>
    <P>At a recent meeting of Macra na Feirme in Galway, the Chief Executive Officer of the Sugar Company said that unless the Tuam factory was closed down the sugar industry would collapse by 1990.  The Minister of State, who attended the conference, said that the Tuam factory would not be closed until an alternative industry could be located in Tuam.  That was not a very helpful statement by the Minister because over 2,500 people are unemployed in the greater Tuam area and it is not just a question of alternative employment but of providing a new industry.</P>
    <P>I have noticed over the last few years that efforts have been made by the management of CSET to scale down operations in Tuam.  Earlier this year, it was closed temporarily for two months, twice as long as the factory in Thurles, but that was the longest closure in the history of the company.  Can the Minister say if there will be further closures of a temporary nature in 1987 which may last for three or four months?  There is no representative from Tuam or indeed from any part of County Galway on the board of CSET; 140 jobs have been lost in the Tuam factory over the last four years and none of the £70 million capital which was voted in the Houses of the Oireachtas in 1982 has been spent in Tuam.  There has been no plant modernisation and there has now been a hasty decision to let 200 workers go when they were expecting a Christmas bonus.  These people are mainly farmers who have already suffered cuts in their pay cheques as a result of the drop in beet yields because of bad weather.</P>
    <P>The money voted here in 1982 gave confidence to farmers and, in 1983, beet acreage increased to 8,500, double the figure of the previous two years. However, the sugar company constantly knock Tuam and refer every year to a cost penalty of £3 million.  Could the Minister find out why a cost penalty of £3 million is quoted every year by the management <Col N="1347" /> when this year there has been a smaller throughput of beet and costs have been cut in the factory over the last couple of years?  It is about time that the company stopped using this figure, as local accountants and those on the workers' committee know that it is not true.</P>
    <P>A hasty decision has been made to finish the beet campaign in Tuam.  Beet was available for such a campaign to continue and the Minister should ensure that the factory in Tuam is treated in the same way as other factories.  The campaign was supposed to continue until 12 December and, as late as last Friday, according to <i>The Tuam Herald,</i> sugar beet was dumped in the Tuam factory, weighed, reloaded and transported to Thurles. This was deplored by the unions who had fought strenuously to continue the beet campaign.  It also amazed the local Minister of State, Deputy Connaughton.  Who thought that the campaign would continue. Indeed, this was the view of all the public representatives in the east and west Galway areas.</P>
    <P>It is time that a firm line was taken with the sugar company and that some of our questions are answered.  It has been a particularly cruel blow to have a campaign lasting slightly longer than two weeks when, normally, it would continue up to Christmas.  Hauliers have been told not to bring sugar beet to Tuam and to divert it to other factories which is a further indication of the scaling down of the factory in Tuam.  I understand that samples of beet are being sent to other factories.  I should like the Minister to give a guarantee that there will be no more temporary closures and laying off of staff.  I understand there are proposals to reduce the office staff to eight employees by Christmas.  A firm line must be taken with the sugar company because the Tuam factory is very important to the farmers in the areas who should be encouraged to grow beet.  It is also very important to the workforce, business people and the whole community. The factory has given great employment and we want that to continue. Will the Minister have talks with <Col N="1348" /> the management regarding the scaling down of the company and try to ensure that the factory in Tuam will not be run down?</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity of raising this matter and I support my colleague in our collective efforts to ensure that something can be done, even at this late stage, to change the discriminatory decision that has been made by the managing director of the sugar company without any Government intervention.  This is obviously an effort by the management of the sugar company to close down the Tuam factory. Recently, a member of the Government party, Professor Tom Rafferty, attended the national Macra na Feirme conference in Galway and stated that the factory should be closed down.  So far as I am concerned that is a total disgrace from a Galway man whose family have supplied beet to this factory for many years.  The following evening at the same conference the managing director of Irish Sugar, Mr. Chris Comerford, a man who prior to his appointment was very much in favour of the Tuam sugar factory but who now, with the reins of office and in a safe seat, if he is in a safe seat, stated that the Tuam sugar factory was not viable and should be closed.  That is a disgrace coming from a public servant, a man paid by the tax-payers of the nation, paid by the major shareholder in that company to supposedly work in the interests of all the people of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to illustrate the reasons we are very suspicious of the serious situation prevailing in the west <i>vis-à-vis</i> the Tuam sugar factory.  On Saturday 22 November, 150 loads of beet totalling 3,200 tonnes were brought to the factory. On Monday 24 November the intake was 110 loads totalling 2,200 tonnes and on the following day 120 loads totalling 2,300 tonnes were brought to the factory.  On that very day Mr. Comerford and the management in Dublin gave directives to the management in Tuam, to the people on the weighbridge in Tuam and to the hauliers that no more beet was to be taken from outside County Galway into <Col N="1349" /> the Tuam sugar factory.  Not alone that but all hauliers from outside the county were given specific instructions on Tuesday 25 November that they were to take no more beet into the Tuam sugar factory, that it was to be taken instead to Carlow.  Farmers in County Offaly, even in some parts of County Galway and in other counties in the traditional Tuam sugar catchment area were given instructions by the staff of Irish Sugar and CSET that their beet should be taken to the Carlow factory.  That was at a time when there was over 2,000 tonnes of beet a day, 3,000 tonnes on certain days, coming in to the Tuam sugar factory.</P>
    <P>Despite that situation the following day 2,184 tonnes or 116 loads of beet came into the factory in Tuam.  After that the effects of these directives began to take their toll.  Only 800 tonnes or 80 loads came in on Thursday 27 November and on the Friday, the day the announcement was made by Mr. Comerford to terminate the campaign in Tuam, only 700 tonnes or 66 loads of beet were taken in.  We accept that there have been two disastrous years <i>vis-à-vis</i> Irish agriculture and I would like if the Minister of State would listen to these facts.  We know that yields have been down 30 to 40 per cent but that is not the fault of the farmers in the west or of the workers in the Tuam sugar factory, it is due to the weather conditions prevailing in our country. Despite the bad weather of two years ago and also this year, 8,500 acres of beet were contracted for in the Tuam sugar beet catchment area.  Despite the inclement weather 7,500 acres were sown.  We should contrast that with the efforts made in 1981 when only 4,000 acres of beet were grown in the Tuam sugar catchment area.  There has been a 100 per cent increase in sugar beet growing in our area in the past three to four years but the Government have failed to acknowledge this.  Neither has there been any acknowledgement of it by the management of Irish Sugar.  We have had a campaign this year, starting on 3 October, of only four weeks, normally it is eight weeks.</P>
    <P>There is a major shortage of pulp because Tuam has been the traditional <Col N="1350" /> pulp producing factory in the Irish Sugar group and only 3,500 tones of pulp will be produced this year.  There is a demand for a further 10,000 to 11,000 tonnes of pulp.  It is impossible to get it.  The fact is it is not being processed or produced in the other factories.  On the way to the Dáil on Tuesday I was held up in Athlone for half and hour because of three articulated trucks, each carrying 30 tonnes of beet, travelling from the Tuam sugar factory to Carlow.  They were holding up traffic and taking beet from an area in which there is a factory able to process that beet and which should have that beet.  Today, 25 articulated trucks each carrying at least 30 tonnes of beet have left the Tuam factory.  It is an absolute joke in modern times where we need proper, efficient and effective financial management of our affairs that on one side of the entrance to Tuam are tractors and trailers and lorries of beet from County Galway while on the far side big articulated trucks take out 1,000 tonnes of beet a day from the Tuam sugar factory.</P>
    <P>Mr. Comerford has made serious statements. He has said that the amount of beet in the Tuam ara could be processed in Carlow or in some factory in Europe in two and a half to three days.  He is not comparing like with like because the Tuam factory does not have the benefit of the type of investment in modern technology which went into the other factories in the Irish Sugar group.  All this has happened since Fianna Fáil left office in 1982.  When we were in office in 1982, as my colleague Deputy Kitt said, we made that money available but when the Government returned to office they reneged on that decision.  As the major shareholder in Irish Sugar they have reneged on the farmers in the west and on the sugar factory and have not invested money in modernising the plant.  Therefore, we are not comparing like with like.</P>
    <P>The position in the Carlow factory at present is that they are chock-a-block with beet.  It is not able to take the beet coming in from Tuam.  There are hold ups and delays and the only place where that beet should be processed is in Tuam <Col N="1351" /> where traditionally it would have been processed.  It is obvious that the Government are allowing the management and the managing director of Irish Sugar to slowly but surely wind down the Tuam sugar factory and grind it to a halt.  Last Friday I went to meet the workers in Tuam.  I can tell you that it is a very sad place to be.  The people are totally demoralised and frustrated.  All the temporary workers have been let go.  They have suffered a loss in wages of something in the region of £1,000 to £2,000 each. Small farmers, many of whom are unemployed and many other people who have no land at all, have to go home for the winter with 100 per cent less income than they had this time last year.  The permanent workforce will lose in the region of between £800 to £2,000 in their wages as a result of the management decision.</P>
    <P>Last Saturday the management of Irish Sugar went to Tuam to discuss proposed redundancies in the Tuam sugar factory. There is now talk that 80 per cent of the permanent workforce will be made redundant for six months.  There are 155 permanent workers in Tuam.  Between 1981 and 1982 there were 100 voluntary redundancies in order to make the Tuam factory efficient and viable.  There has been 55 years of total industrial co-operation without any strikes in Tuam.  There has been a total commitment from the farmers in the west and there has been total discrimination.  Last week, there was a decision of the management to suppress information and news to the farmers, the workers and the people of this country when specific instructions were given to prevent RTE and the media from going into the factory to see the beet being processed, to see the intake of beet and to see what was happening. That is obvious discrimination.</P>
    <P>It is a disgrace that the Minister of State, Deputy Connaughton, is not in this House tonight.  He is representative for that consituency.  He is the man responsible for western development.  He is probably listening in the cosiness of his office to this debate.  It would be more fitting for him to show some commitment <Col N="1352" /> and at least to contribute to this debate on behalf of the workers and the farmers in east County Galway and the west generally. His voice should be heard in this House on their behalf.  I compliment my colleague, Deputy Kitt, and also Senator Hussey who are here for this debate tonight.</P>

They may not sound too nice but I am calling on the Minister of State to make a plea immediately to the Taoiseach and the Government to rescind the decision of Irish Sugar, their managing director and board of directors to terminate the processing of beet in Tuam and to direct immediately that the campaign in Tuam be continued forthwith, that the temporary workers be taken back and that positive support be given to the workers, the farmers, the hauliers and everybody involved in the processing of beet in Tuam.  This must be done for the sake of Irish Sugar and for beet growing and agriculture in the west.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Hegarty)</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies are well aware that this year's beet campaign has been very difficult.  As a beet grower myself I am very aware of it.  The difficulty has arisen from a combination of two factors.  One is the low beet yield because of the exceptionally bad weather during the growing season.  That applied nationwide.  The other is also due to the weather.  Since harvesting commenced it has been exceptionally difficult to get into many fields on many days.  The Deputies may have seen on television farmers in <Col N="1353" /> the Tuam area trying to go into fields in appalling conditions.  This has, of course, interfered with deliveries to all factories and has prevented the build-up of sufficient stocks to keep them operating satisfactorily.  The problem of continuity of supply has been facing the company all through the campaign so far at each of the factories.  Normally stocks of beet build up in the yard and people are screaming for dockets.  This year they almost take the beet off the harvesters. The Tuam factory is the most seriously affected.  The campaign did not begin there until 4 November, a number of weeks after it began elsewhere.  Even since processing commenced &mdash; and this was deferred twice to allow farmers to harvest sufficient quantities &mdash; supplies of beet delivered were well below requirements.</P>
      <P>The other three factories have also been badly hit and by the evening of 27 November &mdash; last Thursday &mdash; in no case was there more than one day's supply of beet on hand for processing.  This was a very serious situation.  To put it into perspective I should say that four days' supply is the minimum requirement in normal circumstances to ensure a reasonable prospect of uninterrupted processing. In the case of Tuam there was at that stage only 400 tonnes in the yard.  To operate to capacity the factory needs to process about 2,000 tonnes per day.</P>

      <P>Having regard to the fact that the factory had been running well under capacity since the campaign began, that supplies of beet had almost dried up and that there was little prospect of a sufficiency being harvested in the immediate future, the company had to take their decision in the light of the situation facing them at that time.  That decision was to terminate the campaign two weeks earlier than planned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the abnormal circumstances which confronted them at that stage the company were obliged to take measures to safeguard the campaign as a whole &mdash;<Col N="1354" /> in all of its factories.  This entailed the transfer of the limited quantity of beet available for processing in the Tuam area to other factories.</P>
    <P>I have visited the Tuam factory many times and in the past I represented growers. I regret as much as any other Deputy in the House that this decision had to be taken.  I regret, in particular, the loss to so many temporary workers and the continued uncertainty for the permanent staff.  Nevertheless, we cannot fly in the face of reality, and the reality is as I have outlined it.  Indeed, the company's decision reflects the type of day to day operational responsibility which the Government devolve on any State-sponsored body.  Siúicre Éireann is a commercial body and is obliged to act in a commercial manner and in the national interest, including the interest of the tax-payer. It would be inappropriate for me, or for my Department, to seek to get involved in day-to-day operational activities such as those we are now discussing.</P>

      <P>Since the decision to terminate processing at Tuam there has been some improvement in the weather. This enabled the other three factories to operate at full capacity this week, so far. However, I understand that the amount of beet coming from the Tuam growing area has been less than 1,000 tonnes per day and, even with the addition of this beet, the continuing supply position of the other three factories cannot be guaranteed.</P>
      <P>The problems affecting the sugar beet harvest &mdash; and I do not remember worse &mdash; provide further evidence of the impact of this year's disastrous summer on the agricultural industry, and on the beet industry in particular, and it is the responsibility of all parties interested in the future of the industry to ensure that this latest difficulty is tackled in a practical and realistic way.</P>

      <P>A grant of £200,000 was allocated on 20 March 1986 under my Department's programme of assistance towards the provision of community, leisure and amenity facilities, in respect of the renovation of this swimming pool. Arising from representations made by Dublin Corporation on behalf of the promoters, the grant arrangements were modified so as to transfer £50,000 of the grant towards a recreation centre provided by the same body with £150,000 available towards the swimming pool.

      <P>In the case of works being financed either wholly or partly from public funds, which at present comprises 70 per cent of total building output, I am satisfied that the existing controls are adequate to ensure that, as far as possible, only building materials of a suitable standard are being used.

      <P>I am aware of the extent to which imported building materials are used. However, under EC regulations public authorities are prohibited from taking action which would discriminate against products manufactured in other member states of the European Community.  The importance of ensuring that Irish manufacturers of building products are not discriminated against in public sector construction contracts has been brought to the notice of all public authorities, including State Departments, local authorities, health boards and semi-State bodies and they are well aware of my views in this regard.</P>

On receipt of the affidavit, the computerised national vehicle file may be amended to show that the person concerned is no longer the actual owner of the vehicle.

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Question Nos. 31 and 38 together:</P>
      <P>The Government's policy statement entitled <i>The Reform of Local Government</i> which was issued in May 1985 outlined the scope and content of the reform programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Implementation of the first stage of the programme was provided for in the Local <Col N="1192" /> Government (Reorganisation) Act, 1985.  This included the rationalisation of the boundary between Dublin city and county, the setting up of three new electoral counties in County Dublin, the extension of the Galway city boundary and the upgrading of the city to county borough status.</P>
    <P>The recommendations of the independent electoral commissions, established to advise the Government on revised boundaries for local electoral areas, were also implemented: the 1985 local elections were based on the electoral areas recommended by the commissions. Legislation is currently being prepared to complete the structural reforms in the Dublin area.  Three new county councils coterminous with, and consisting of the members of, the three electoral counties, will be established. This legislation will also provide for the setting up of the Dublin Metropolitan Council as well as enabling distict councils to be established in each of the four local authority areas in Dublin.  This Bill, which is being drafted at present, will be published early in 1987.</P>
    <P>Legislation is also being prepared dealing with the general reform of the local government system.  It will deal with the broader issues of structures, organisation and powers of local authorities.  It will also provide for the establishement of a boundary commission to review urban boundaries.  A central feature of this legislation will be the conferring on local authorities of an enhanced role in the social and economic sphere.  In this regard, provision will be made for a modification of the <i>ultra vires</i> principle with a view to enabling local authorities to play a fuller role than heretofore in the development of local communities.  This Bill will be published in the first half of 1987.</P>
    <P>A major programme of devolution of functions to local authorities is being undertaken as part of the reform process. The policy statement outlined a series of commitments in this area and set out a number of objectives with regard to a progressive devolution of functions to local authorities which will take place <Col N="1193" /> either directly or on an agency basis.  A devolution implementation group under the chairmanship of the Minister of State at the Department of the Public Service is working to promote, co-ordinate and generally facilitate devolution.  Despite the organisational complexities of implementing the devolution proposals and the need to ensure that the measures taken are cost-effective, progress on the implementation of the devolution programme has been satisfactory.</P>
    <P>Finally, the question of reduction of central controls relating to local authority programmes is being examined.  Legislation providing for the general reform of the local government system which is being prepared in my Department will address these issues and provide for a significant loosening of controls over local authority activities.</P>

      <P>Such delays in inspections as have arisen are attributable primarily to the very high number of applications received for house improvement grants &mdash; over 126,000 to date.  Since the introduction of the scheme, various measures have been taken to increase the capacity to carry out inspections, including the engagement of about 80 temporary inspectors and the operation of a bonus scheme, which is in the nature of overtime for the permanent inspectorate staff.  Inspectors are deployed on a regional rather than a county basis and are redeployed as necessary to cope with any delays beyond the normal that occur in having inspections carried out in particular areas.</P>

I have also been informed by BIM that the difference between the grants which have actually been approved by BIM and those which are stated in the document to have been so approved may be explained as follows.</P>
      <P>The expenditure programme which was originally approved by BIM for the company in question amounted to £1,030,981.  When the company submitted their application to the EC, for grant-aid the expenditure programme was revised upwards to £1,174,094.  BIM then indicated that they would consider an additional 10 per cent grant of £14,311 towards the additional expenditure planned by the company subject to the overall parameters of the Mariculture grants scheme.  The grant of £117,409 referred to in the document appears therefore to be made up as follows:</P>

    <P>I understand that a short-term repayable grant of £71,902 was also approved by BIM but that no loan amounting to £234,818 as alleged in the document was made.  I should add that under the mariculture grant scheme the total financial facility granted to any one company cannot exceed £175,000 and this upper ceiling will also apply in this case.</P>
    <P>Apart from the foregoing I am not in a position to comment on the figures quoted by a private company in the document referred to.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy will appreciate grant payments are made retrospectively on certified expenditure and are phased, as <Col N="1200" /> is the company's programme, over a number of years.  Thus grants in this case, as in most cases, do not normally fall due to be paid within one calender year.</P>

      <P>EC policy in regard to animal health is <Col N="1208" /> aimed at the achievement of the highest level of disease freedom in member states.  While the Single European Act will facilitate the harmonisation of national provisions, it also prescribes that EC Commission proposals for this purpose must be based on a high level of protection.  There is also a safeguard provision authorising member states to have recourse, if necessary, to Article 36 of the Rome Treaty which allows the possibility of national restrictions on the grounds of animal health provided they are not a means of arbitrary discrimination or a disguised restriction on trade between member states.</P>
      <P>The Single European Act therefore, contains adequate safeguards against disimprovement of our animal health status.</P>
