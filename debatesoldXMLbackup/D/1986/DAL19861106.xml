    <Title>Supplementary Estimates, 1986. - Vote 50: Energy.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Minister for Energy (Mr. Spring) Dick Spring">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Energy (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £1,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1986, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Energy, including certain services administered by that office, and for payment of certain loans, subsidies, grants and grants-in-aid.</P>
      <P>I have, on previous occasions, indicated to the House the need to provide extra resources for the Nuclear Energy Board in the current year.  Since Chernobyl, the demands on the NEB's monitoring services have continued to expand at a dramatic rate in the following areas which, prior to Chernobyl, required no monitoring at all:</P>
      <P>(a)  import of foodstuffs,</P>
      <P>(b)  domestic foodstuffs,</P>
      <P>(c)  exports,</P>
      <P>(d)  beef, lamb, dairy products and cereals going into intervention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1594" /> As the board were no longer in a position to meet demands on the basis of their existing staff and equipment and in order to protect the health of the Irish people and to meet the requirements of the agricultural export market, the board were authorised by the Government to acquire additional staffing and equipment.  They were also instructed to proceed with plans for alternative premises and a new laboratory to overcome the serious lack of laboratory and staff facilities.</P>
    <P>The supplementary sum required for the funding of these additional resources is £427,000 and, since this amount can be found within my Department's Vote from additional receipts of £80,000 and by the use of savings in Subhead P. FEOGA &mdash; Western Aid Electrification Scheme, only a token Estimate of £1,000 is necessary.</P>
    <P>All the additional receipts arise from the operations of my Department in the petroleum and minerals exploration sector.</P>
    <P>The saving of £346,000 in Subhead P arises from the fact that the full allocation of £1.43 million provided for in the original Estimate will not be spent in the current year.  Because of the nature of the scheme, precise estimation of the amount required in any particular year is extremely difficult since it is impossible to gauge exactly the number of prospective applicants in the year.  I would like to make it clear, however, that there is no question of reducing the overall amount of £12.76 million which will be made available from this Department's Vote to the scheme over its lifetime.  Deputies will note there is a consequential reduction in EC receipts now estimated for the current year but, as in the case of the money voted by the Dáil for this Department, there will be no reduction in the amount of £6.38 million which the EC is prepared to make available for this scheme over its lifespan.</P>
    <P>I recommend this Supplementary Estimate to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept and support this token Estimate for £1,000.  I am glad to see the Minister has managed to make <Col N="1595" /> some savings along the way.  We on this side of the House welcome any additional expenditure or resources placed at the disposal of the Nuclear Energy Board to discharge their duties.  We have all learned the lesson of Chernobyl.  There are heavy calls on the resources of the Nuclear Energy Board to give additional certification for agricultural purposes which are very necessary when we remember the threats made against it when some of our competitors in South America tried to use our situation to give us a bad name on our export markets.  We all realise how important our agricultural exports are to the economy and so we are only too delighted to support any additional resources for them.</P>
      <P>Has any progress been made at European level in regard to the setting up of a European inspectorate to monitor safety standards at Sellafield?  The situation there cannot be mentioned often enough.  When the disaster at Chernobyl happened, the dangers even at 1,500 miles were brought home to us.  Let us contemplate for a moment what might happen if a similar situation occurred at Sellafield.  I hope the Minister will be able to give us some idea as to what progress he is making at European or international level in regard to that inspectorate.  I recall reading that the subject was taken off the agenda at the Council of Ministers meeting last June.  I would like the Minister to let us know if it is on the agenda for the meeting to be held later this month.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are all too well aware that the plant at Sellafield is part of the same family and age group as Chernobyl.  It is 30 years old.  Irrespective of the standards of maintenance, supervision or otherwise, undoubtedly when a plant gets to that age there will be problems with maintenance, there will be leaks, there will be disasters, and some day it will be too late.  That is why I renew the call from this side of the House that the Government should realise that that plant is of the same family and because of its age and the notoriously bad record of the British nuclear energy industry in managing it. <Col N="1596" /> with one disaster after another, one leak after another, there is justification in calling on the British Government to do something about it.  Our experience over many years has been of cover-ups and not enough information coming through. That has improved somewhat in recent times, but we are still at their mercy in regard to getting information.  Because of the age of this plant, because of the ongoing danger to the environment and the health of our own people, I am renewing my call to take this matter up.</P>
    <P>I recognise it is not a simple matter. We have to be seen to ask first but this Government have not taken that first step yet of asking the British Government about this matter in response to the genuine fears of the Irish people for their health and environment.  We are a small island.  If anything like that should happen, then the problems we have today in our economy would certainly look very small in relation to the problems we would face then.</P>
    <P>I want to take this opportunity to refer to some other items on energy.  My colleague, Deputy Kitt, will be dealing with aspects he has a special interest in, such as FEOGA and Bord na Móna, so I will not dwell on those areas.</P>
    <P>One area I want to discuss is the ongoing crisis and saga of the Dublin Gas Company.  It is never-ending.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, as the Deputy refers to broad areas of my Department, I refer him to Standing Order No. 124.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I was about to draw the Deputy's attention to the fact that the debate is confined to items for which money is sought in the Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I submit that in this crisis Dublin Gas seeks money from the Vote of the Department directly and indirectly, and because we have only a token Estimate here I have to submit that nobody knows at this stage where that Estimate will finish.  I have a few specific things to mention and they are relative <Col N="1597" /> to the Supplementary Estimate.  I would ask the Chair to bear that in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Standing Order No.  124 reads as follows:</P>
      <P>In the discussion of a supplementary Estimate the debate shall be confined to the Items constituting the same, and no discussion may be raised on the original Estimate save in so far as it may be necessary to explain or illustrate the particular Items under discussion.</P>
      <P>I am bound by that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>This is only a token Estimate of £1,000.  There are savings in many areas.  More money will be required at the end of the year.  I want to be cooperative about this Estimate.  I am not going to oppose it, but I want to take the opportunity of asking the Minister where moneys will arise between now and the end of the year.  It is enough for him to come in here and shake his head and try to sidestep.  These are just a few issues. If you do not want to do it there is no point in having discussions on Estimates at all.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has it before him and he can raise anything that arises under additional receipts or deficiencies as outlined there and that is all.  It may be frustrating from the Deputy's point of view.  Nobody bothers about these Standing Orders, as to whether they should be amended, extended or scrapped, until such time as they are sought to be applied here and then they want to change them <i>instanter.</i></P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>

      <P>Will the Chair listen to this?  The Chair said that I could correct what the Minister said.  The Minister said I had presided, apparently helpless, in the autumn of 1982 over a row involving rival groups seeking control of the company. Under any of the statutes a Minister has not the authority to get involved in a private company that is controlled by shareholders and only the shareholders of a private company can decide in relation to the boardroom battle.  Will the Minister be decent enough to withdraw the innuendos he made.  that I had a personal interest in what happened in Dublin Gas, because I never had?</P>

I have been stopped from talking about the problems of Dublin Gas which will have a detrimental effect on the finances of the Exchequer because of the dispute that has arisen between Marathon and An Bord Gáis.  Perhaps the Minister will tell us his plans in regard to the dispute and the implications it has for receipts from the gas, mineral and exploration areas.

      <P>In relation to petroleum leases, can the Minister say how many holes will be drilled in 1987 arising from existing leases?  When does he expect the next hole to be drilled in bloc 49.9?  I asked the Minister and his Department some time ago to look at early production systems and to let me know if they had been tested.  What investigations have taken place and what results, if any, have emerged in relation to the employment of early production systems in the Celtic Sea?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A reduction of 6 per cent in ESB prices does not in any way reflect the savings <Col N="1611" /> that should be made to the industrial, manufacturing and commercial areas of the economy which are carrying an additional energy burden of 20 per cent for electricity compared with their competitors in the EMS.  In a full year that amounts to a sum of £40 million.  Interest rates are very high and this is putting an additional load on our manufacturing industry which is becoming less competitive every day.  I have spoken on the subject many times in the House and of the necessity for the Government to ensure that whatever savings are made should be passed on to manufacturers.  I accept that a decrease of 6 per cent is a start but there should have been further decreases by now.  The ESB will hold on to everything they can.  Although they predicted a huge loss last year it turned out to be very small.  Their accounting practices are not used in any commercial concern; they employ a device called double depreciation which means ordinary depreciation as is the case with any commercial company and they also have an amortization charge.  In the early days of the ESB it provided a fund for development, bearing in mind that the company operate under statute which says they must break even and that they do not make a profit.  They had to find some mechanism whereby they could build up a fund for future development.  I submit the ESB will not be engaged in any major development works in the foreseeable future.  Moneypoint is now coming on stream which will be the only development for a long time to come.  The Minister should take a serious look at the system of double depreciation in ESB accounts because we are talking about a sum of £40 million or £50 million every year.  I do not have the figures with me because I did not intend to discuss the ESB but I was pushed in that direction.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I have watched the Minister's inactivity, ineptitude and bad handling of various affairs in the Department over the past three years.  The whole area appears to be irrelevant to the Minister.  I have asked him to comment on Marathon.  I also want to ask what plans he has to ensure that receipts do not decrease and that he will not be called on for more money in relation to the receivership of Dublin Gas.  In the next few weeks the shareholders of Dublin Gas will look for an extraordinary general meeting to petition the courts to wind up the company.  Can the Minister <Col N="1613" /> tell us what he proposes to do about this potential crisis which could have been staved off if the Minister had acted in time.  Last April he spoke of nationalising the company but has done nothing since. He did not re-appoint the chairman or four directors who had resigned from the board.  Had he done so he could have blocked that decision.  Since then, we have had one crisis after another.  Over £100 million of taxpayers' money has been put into the company and taxpayers will find themselves greatly exposed because of the Minister's failure to act.</P>
      <P>I put down questions which the Minister admitted deserved answers but when I read his replies I found I did not get the answers.  I will list the six questions and hand them to him after the debate and I hope that between now and the next time I come back into this House I will have received from him straightforward answers.  These questions relate to the activities of the receiver and to those questions the Minister chose not to answer.  Perhaps he might reconsider my request to have a full scale debate on the company in this House because the problem has risen to critical proportions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed at the way we are being restricted this morning but I will not dwell on that point.  I have mentioned in this House before that the Government have been very complacent as regards providing resources for the Nuclear Energy Board.  I am glad even at this late stage that some money is to be provided for them although I am disappointed that that money is being taken from the FEOGA western aid electrification scheme.  The Minister is robbing Peter to pay Paul because this FEOGA package is one of the most successful schemes ever to be operated in the west.  Under this Supplementary Estimate we are taking money from that scheme as part of the Department's policy of giving money to the Nuclear Energy Board.  While I welcome the fact that the board at long last have received money, it is a disappointment to see it coming from this source.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have raised in this House with the Minister on a number of occasions the question of making the FEOGA scheme more flexible.  It was a flexible scheme up <Col N="1616" /> to 1983 when, after consultations with the EC, the Department told us they had to restrict benefit from the scheme to certain categories of people.  Any son or daughter who was building a house in a rural area would not automatically receive benefit from the scheme as there were problems with off farm income and where the young person building the house was not the owner of the land. The Minister should tell us if he had any success in his efforts to have the scheme made more flexible and if more money will be provided.  I note in the Estimate that money is being taken out of the FEOGA package and it is my view that one of the reasons for doing that is that the scheme is impracticable and not flexible enough for western areas.</P>
    <P>I note from figures I obtained from the Department that 1,444 applicants benefited in 1984, that 699 farmers benefited in 1985 and that up to the end of October this year only 339 applicants had been approved.  I note that only half of the money provided in 1986 has been taken up, leaving £711,000 available still.  Will the Minister indicate if that money will be taken up or carried forward to 1987? The fact that so few applicants are being approved is an indication that the scheme is too restrictive, as many western Deputies have been claiming.  We need to allow more people into the scheme.  I suggest that local authorities involved in building houses in rural areas should be allowed to benefit from the scheme.  It is sad to think that this year fewer people than last year will benefit under the scheme and that at the end of 1986 money will be left over.</P>
    <P>When the ESB communicate with people about their eligibility, or otherwise, under the scheme they mention the great reductions they are offering on immersion heaters and cookers, but there is little point in offering those attractions to people who do not have an electricity supply.  I would like to see the quotations being reduced.  The scheme operated up to 1983 was very successful but the changes introduced are too restrictive.</P>
    <P>I understand that the ESB who are using milled peat in their power stations <Col N="1617" /> in the midlands are transporting it from Roscommon and Galway areas.  Local people are disappointed that that milled peat is not used in the manufacture of briquettes at the factory at Derryfadda. I understand that 200,000 tonnes, almost all the milled peat harvested in that area, has been transported to the midlands.  I am not blaming the Minister for that decision because it was the present Minister for Finance who told us in 1983 that the Government would not be forced into making a hasty decision on the Derryfadda project.</P>
    <P>Three years have elapsed since that statement and it is disappointing that a decision has not yet been announced although £15.4 million was provided for it in the Book of Estimates in 1984. However, of that figure only £4.6 million was spent on the project.  We have not heard anything about that project since. There does not appear to be any enthusiasm in the Cabinet for the project.  We have been told that there is little likelihood of EC aid being made available for it but I wonder if the Government have applied for such assistance.  We have been told by the Government that an IDA grant of £3 million for the project has been approved but that approval was in principle only.  There is a shortage of briquettes throughout the country, particularly in western areas, and the Western Health Board who organise a free fuel scheme are finding it difficult to get briquettes, one of the most popular types of fuel among elderly people.  Will the Minister consult with that health board about the shortage of supply?</P>
    <P>The 1984 annual report of Bord na Móna stated that the expenditure on the proposed briquette factory at Derryfadda had amounted to £29.5 million up to 1 March 1985 and that should be sufficient to encourage the Government to proceed with the project.  The Irish Transport and General Workers' Union have said that the employment envisaged in the construction stage would be 75 jobs rising to 180, and that the factory in full production would employ 110 people or a yearly average of 300 jobs on the bog and in the factory.  Is it not economic madness <Col N="1618" /> not to proceed with that project, bearing those figures in mind?  The ITGWU state that the two year delay has cost £3½ million so far and that, if the delay is allowed to continue for a further year, the cost will rise to almost £4 million.</P>
    <P>While the Government are delaying in making a decision on this project, they are permitting imports of lignite briquettes from Germany.  The Government have not bothered to apply to the EC for assistance to help the board exploit our peat resources and process peat briquettes.  I hope the Minister will have some news about the review his predecessor undertook to carry out.</P>
    <P>Like other western Deputies I am concerned about the hasty decisions and reactions in the past two years of Bord na Móna on proposed lay-offs.  Last year the board said they would be laying off 800 people but that decision was deferred.  This year the board announced that they would be laying of 2,300 people, but we have been told in the past few weeks that that figure will be reduced to 400.  Instead of laying off workers Bord na Móna should be taking them on.  It appears that the board do not have any contingency fund or plan to deal with problems that arise from poor weather conditions.  In my area the board proposed to lay off 20 people at Derryfadda in addition to the 100 laid off last year.  I understand that they proposed to lay off 47 people at the Attymon station.  In effect, that would have meant that the station would be almost closed with only five people to maintain it.</P>
    <P>Those lay-offs are occurring at a time when there is a need to develop bogs at Derryfadda, Cluain Caoin and Derrydoo. It concerns me that, in addition to laying off workers, there is no commitment to develop our bogs.  The Minister will have to give a direction to Bord na Móna to continue that development.  The Board own those bogs but we should insist on a commitment from them to develop them.</P>
    <P>One of the important factors in the area of energy is the question of competitiveness, particularly among business people.  The price of electricity to industrialists <Col N="1619" /> here is 30 per cent higher than that charged to industrialists elsewhere in the EC.  It is time the Minister announced the proposed reduction in ESB prices.</P>

      <P>I am sure the Opposition will agree when I say that, where there are scarce national resources, it is wrong for four commercial semi-State bodies to play roulette with public money.  They are competing against each other with their hands under the table in the one till which is the taxpayers' pocket.  Some of these bodies are placing costly advertisements. That would be all right if there were free competition and if the taxpayer did not have to pick up the tab.  Since we cannot afford to waste scarce national resources we should ensure that the best possible use is made of them.</P>

      <Col N="1623" /> I intended to talk about incineration and what has been done in Denmark.  A city in Denmark twice the size of Cork, Aarhus, introduced its own incineration scheme.

We should eliminate waste in the public sector and use any scarce moneys we have to create.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a whole new dimension. There are indications of an alarming increase in acid rain on the east coast, which makes it more urgent and necessary that additional funds be provided to deal with the rapidly deteriorating situation. Unfortunately, the way in which the Minister is dealing with this matter is <Col N="1624" /> inadequate and is a piecemeal method of dealing with a very serious situation. Everybody knows there is a lack of staff and facilities, that the Nuclear Energy Board are totally incapable as at present constituted of dealing with this major issue.  The funds being provided here are totally inadequate.  It is essential that every effort be made to have structures, finance, staff and resources available. While today's proposal is useful, it will go no way towards dealing with the crisis we are now facing.</P>
      <P>The FEOGA scheme has been a success in so far as it has been able to operate but there have been very serious restrictions on its operation.  I understood from the Minister earlier this year that some proposals were submitted to Brussels for changes in the scheme which would make it applicable to some of the people being denied aid.  The Minister will be aware that some old age pensioners living along in isolated rural areas are being denied this aid.  Funds should be available to provide electricity for such people, but we find the Minister cutting back on such funds.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>He should push ahead with proposals for the extension of the western package to the people deprived of aid under that scheme.  There seems to be money available for this purpose.  Also many young families have been deprived of aid under this scheme in the western areas.  Some families have been faced with bills of £5,000 to £6,000 for the installation of electricity, and aid under this scheme is being denied to them at a time when they cannot afford the cost of installation.  I do not wish to delay the passage of this Estimate unduly, but the Minister must address himself to these very serious issues.  He should look into the restricted terms for qualification for aid under this scheme.  Would he see that, through the European scheme, assistance is given to these less well off and deprived people?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. J. Leonard Mr. J. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be very brief <Col N="1625" /> and I shall ensure that Deputy Treacy will have an opportunity to speak.  As the previous speaker said, additional funding is needed for equipment, staffing and whatever else is required to ensure that the Nuclear Energy Board will do their job.  There has been a serious fall-off in the demand for produce in certain areas, including my own county, due to the fears and threats following the Chernobyl disaster.</P>
      <P>The Minister states that there will be no reduction in the amount of £6.38 million which the EC are prepared to make available under the FEOGA scheme during its life span.  However, we cannot accept the proposed delay in payment.  This is a ten year scheme from 1981 to 1991 and we are told we will get aid within a few years.  Funding was made available and should be used, especially for western development.  We ask the Minister to reduce the restrictions on the electrification scheme under FEOGA. When it came out first, it was fairly liberal and domestic supplies could be arranged along with farmyard and other agricultural supplies.  However, it has become very restrictive in recent years.  I ask the Minister to examine the issue of the aged who cannot afford electricity installation costs.  I brought this matter before the local authority, the health board and the Department suggesting that for houses where the supply has been approved under the housing aid for the elderly, the Minister's Department should initiate some scheme which would cover installation costs.  I ask the Minister, in conjunction with his colleagues. to follow that suggestion.  It is worthwhile and would be a good day's work.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to condemn at the very outset the reduction in this Estimate for the western package by £346,000 this year.  This is a serious situation. I have continuously said here that, since this Government came into office, the rules have been changed and people have been denied assistance which heretofore they were getting.  I have letters here from the Department of Energy <Col N="1626" /> refusing people assistance on the grounds that there was another house on the farm, despite the fact that the new house had been built by a son who was currently working in agriculture and was prepared to stimulate work in that sector.  Does the Minister want the local authorities to be forced to build houses for people on farms in rural Ireland instead of people helping themselves?  It is an absolute disgrace and I am asking him to review the situation and ensure that people will not be prevented from working full time in agriculture by him or his Government.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bord na Móna positive decision to reduce the lay-offs from 2,356 to 400.  However, there is no reason why 400 should be let go because there is plenty of development work to be done in the bogs, in my own area at Clonkeen Clough and Derrydoo.  In the Attymon group of bogs, at Lesmanny in Clonfert and at Ballyforan there is plenty of opportunity if the Department and the Government are prepared to put the resources at the disposal of Bord na Móna and allow them to proceed with development.</P>
      <P>When we were in Government in the eighties we negotiated under the <i>ad valorem</i> programme a large amount of money which would be made available for indigenous peat resource development. One of the first things the Minister did when he came into office&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £8,280,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1986, for the salaries and expenses of the Garda Síochána, including pensions, etc., for payments of compensation and other expenses arising out of service in the Local Security Force; for the payment of certain witnesses' expenses; and for payment of a grant-in-aid.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I propose to discuss the Supplementary Estimates for the Garda Síochána, Prisons and Courts together.</P>
      <P>The Supplementary Estimate for the Garda Síochána is required to meet additional expenditure on six subheads of the Vote &mdash; salaries, wages and allowances, travelling and incidental expenses, postal and telecommunications services, clothing and accessories, station services and radio and other equipment.  The total additional expenditure amounts to £8.83m million but £0.55 million of this can be met from savings elsewhere on the Vote.  The net additional sum now sought is, therefore, £8.28 million.</P>
      <P>The additional funds required are to meet expenditure of an unforeseen nature that has arisen since the original Estimate was prepared.  In summary, an additional sum of £1.2 million is needed for salaries and allowances and an extra £1.6 million for overtime, all under subhead A, and an extra £6 million is needed to meet extra costs under the other five subheads.</P>
      <P>The cost of additional payments in respect of salaries and allowances under subhead A, which was not provided for in the original Estimate, is £1.2 million. This sum is required mainly because payment of certain allowances relating to December 1985 was not claimed by members of the force until January of this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The additional funds required to meet the cost of overtime worked by the Garda Síochána this year arise mainly from extra security measures introduced following the Anglo-Irish Agreement. intensive investigations into a number of serious crimes and security arrangements for special events during the year, such as visits by foreign dignitaries.  Garda overtime has been the subject of much exaggerated comment both in the media and, indeed, in this House and I would <Col N="1630" /> like to take this opportunity to put the facts again on record.</P>
    <P>The original provision in the Estimates for Garda overtime in 1986 was £12 million.  As expenditure in the first four months of the year was running at a very high level, the Garda authorities undertook a detailed review of expenditure on overtime so as to ensure that the best possible return was being got from it. This review, together with a general reappraisal of Garda deployment, led to some changes in the use of resources. That was as might be expected.</P>
    <P>As I pointed out in this House on 1 July last during my contribution to the debate on Garda overtime, the fact is that the money provided for overtime is one element only in the total provision of Garda resources.  It would be entirely misleading to regard a high incidence of overtime working on its own as any kind of reliable or valid measure of the effectiveness of policing.</P>
    <P>I also assured the House in the course of that debate that adequate finance for any necessary overtime in the Garda Síochána would be provided and that no essential Garda duty would be left undone for want of the necessary finances.  I am now providing a further £1.6 million for Garda overtime to meet the cost of additional overtime worked by the Garda Síochána this year, in the circumstances I have just outlined.  This demonstrates, if any further demonstration is needed, the Government's commitment to ensuring that as far as our resources permit the necessary funds will be made available to the gardaí to enable them to meet the policing needs of the community in an efficient and effective manner.</P>
    <P>I will now give details of the funds required for services other than pay and overtime.  An additional £0.98 million is required under subhead B.1 for travel and incidental expenses.  A sum of £0.7 million of this is required because expenditure in respect of compensation awarded by the courts is running at a higher level than anticipated.  This is an area where it is very difficult to predict accurately the amount of compensation <Col N="1631" /> likely to be paid out in any one year. The balance of this sum, £0.28 million, is required to meet unforeseen expenditure on travel arising from extra Border security measures and also to cater for an increase in subsistence allowance rates which has recently been authorised for gardaí, in common with other public servants.</P>
    <P>Extra funds amounting to £0.39 million are required under subhead C in respect of telecommunications.  The additional expenditure arises because of increased usage and higher charges.</P>
    <P>A sum of £0.9 milllion is required under subhead D for the purchase of clothing and accessories.  The original allocation for this purpose has proved to be inadequate to meet the accounts for uniform cloth, the making up of uniforms and the purchase of accessories that are being received and which will fall due for payment this year.  The relatively high level of expenditure this year arises as a result of efforts to secure early deliveries of materials to enable the proposed new Garda uniform to be introduced as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>An additional £0.125 million has been included under subhead E.1 &mdash; station services &mdash; to continue the programme of replacing obsolete furniture at Garda stations, to improve the filing systems available at stations and to provide vandal-proof, fire-retardant mattresses in station cells.  Also, an additional £0.38 million is included under this subhead for extra expenditure on cleaning, fuel and electricity for Garda stations due to factors, such as the number of new and extended Garda stations and the additonal electrical and telecommunications equipment installed in stations.</P>
    <P>The original provision in the Estimates subhead for Garda equipment &mdash; subhead H &mdash; was £2.535 million of which £1.62 million related to Garda radio equipment.  This later amount was sufficient to cover leasing repayments in respect of the equipment which it was intended to acquire in the current year. There are, however, economic advantages to be gained if this equipment is <Col N="1632" /> purchased outright rather than leased. On further consideration it has been decided to exercise the purchase rather than the leasing option.  The purchase of the equipment requires the provision of an additional sum of £3.255 million which, together with original £2.535 million provision in this subhead, brings the new subhead total to £5.79 million. As I indicated, this increased expenditure in the year will mean that there will be considerable financial savings in the longer term.</P>
    <P>This Garda radio communications network is an expensive item &mdash; over £11 million has already been spent on it &mdash; but it is an essential operation tool which the gardaí must have if they are to carry out effectively the vital work which is entrusted to them.  The provision of the network is being guided by a committee of experts who are giving most generously of their time and expertise.  I am satisfied that what we are getting is not alone a system that is totally up-to-date and tailor-made to meet Garda needs but one that represents very good value for the money spent on it.  It should give excellent service to the Garda Síochána for many years to come.</P>
    <P>The new radio system is already operating very effectively in all Garda stations outside of the Dublin metropolitan area. The provision of a new, more effective radio communications system for the DMA is now in progress.  While the gardaí in the DMA have been using radio communications to good effect for many years, their present system is no longer adequate to meet Garda needs having regard to the growth in the size and population of the city and the fact that more than 4,000 gardaí, roughly one-third of the force, now serve in Dublin.</P>
    <P>Work on the new system is well advanced, and the equipment for the radio element of the system is being delivered and installed at present in the 43 Garda stations throughout the city. Recently, I signed a major contract for a computerised command and control system which will act as an essential backup to the new radio system.  It will be installed in the new DMA control room <Col N="1633" /> which is now being fitted out.  The new command and control system will ensure that all incoming calls from the public, particularly 999 calls, get the necessary Garda response with the utmost speed. All messages passing through the system will be recorded so as to be available in case of any follow-up inquiry.  The system will also provide valuable management information to senior Garda officers regarding, for example, the time taken to respond to calls for assistance or the pattern of crimes being experienced in particular areas at particular times so that it will allow for better planning of the use of Garda manpower and other resources.</P>
    <P>While on the subject, I want to make one further point about this command and control system.  Contrary to what has been suggested by certain media commentators, the new computerised system will not in any way infringe on the civil liberties or the privacy of individuals.  The system will simply provide a better service to the public by ensuring that every call for Garda assistance is received, recorded and responded to with the utmost efficiency.</P>
    <P>The integrated communications system for the DMA will be one of the most advanced metropolitan police systems anywhere in the world and I am confident it will be of real practical value to the gardaí on operation duties, to their officers in the discharge of their managerial responsibilities and, above all, to the public who will benefit from a more effective response to their calls for Garda assistance.</P>
    <P>The Government fully recognise that the maintenance of order is essential for the development of society and are committed to taking all possible measures to reduce the incidence of crime in our community.  Since the sixties there has been a gradual change in both the incidence and pattern of crime.  Not only is there more serious crime today but it is being committed by better organised. more professional criminals who make the job of detection more difficult for the gardaí.  It is, therefore, all the more important that the Garda be given the necessary resources and manpower to <Col N="1634" /> enable them to tackle these criminals effectively.  That is what they are doing.</P>
    <P>In 1984 there was a decrease of 2.6 per cent in national crime figures.  This downward trend continued in 1985 with a further decrease of 8.5 per cent.  Last year was the first time for some 24 years that there was a reduction in recorded crime for two consecutive years.  I am informed by the Garda authorities that the decrease in the recorded level of serious crime is continuing this year.  The present indications are, therefore, that the level of recorded indictable crime will decrease for the third year in a row during this Government's term of office.  By any objective standard, I think this must be regarded as a remarkable achievement. It is worth mentioning that if this third decrease in a row occurs &mdash; and I have no reason to doubt it at this stage &mdash; it will be the first time that such an event occurred since crime figures began to be published in their present format in 1942.</P>
    <P>There are many reasons for the falling trend in crime.  Some of them are to be found in the increasing public awareness of methods of crime prevention, an awareness developed with the assistance of Garda crime prevention officers throughout the country.  Some of the reasons are to be found in the increasing realisation by more and more people that some forms of crime, particularly drug-related crime, are so dangerous and so corrosive of society that they must be shunned and that we ourselves must educate people, particularly young people, away for them.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons for the reduction in the crime rate is, quite simply, that the gardaí do a good job with the resources at their disposal.  We should not forget that and we would give credit where credit is due.  I have found, at all levels in the Garda Síochána, a very strong commitment to the development of the capabilities of the force and to the further improvement of its service to the public. I should not be the only one to say this: many Members of this House share my view, and I would like to hear the representative bodies of the Garda Síochána <Col N="1635" /> give more frequent public expression to this view, which I know they share also.</P>
    <P>The decline in crime levels, which has now extended unprecedentedly over a period of three years gives the lie to a particularly nasty message on one of the recent gutter-snipe Fianna Fáil posters &mdash; a poster designed to capitalise in the most cynical way on the understandable fears of vulnerable sections of our community. I can tell the Fianna Fáil backroom handlers and poster merchants that people today can feel safer in their homes and on the streets than they did three year ago because both the Government and the Garda Síochána have done their job well.</P>
    <P>During the course of a recent debate in this House, Deputy Haughey wondered if he were seeing the emerging shape of an election campaign.  He did not like it, he said.  I suggest that he and his colleagues look into their own backyard, and apply their tender sensitivities to the activities of their corner-boy poster-pasters.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course the best solution to the crime problem would be to prevent crime in the first place.  The Gardaí have been devoting increased attention to crime prevention in recent times.  In both economic and social terms it makes good sense to devote greater amounts of resources to crime prevention.  During 1985 the Government funded a publicity campaign to promote neighbourhood watch schemes which enable the community to work more closely with their local gardaí for the purpose of preventing crime in their areas.  The response of communities has been most encouraging and there are 280 schemes involving some 81,575 households in operation at present.  Other schemes, such as Community Alert, developed by Muintir na Tíre, have been initiated in rural areas. The community relations section of the Garda Síochána are currently undertaking a formal evaluation of the neighbourhood watch schemes and, while it would be premature to speak in definitive terms at this stage, I am confident the evaluation will show that the schemes are playing a big part in reducing the incidence of crime and fostering improved relationships between the gardaí and the community.</P>
      <P>The Government, of course, will not relax their efforts in the fight against the criminal.  It is clear that the policies being pursued are beginning to bring about the desired result &mdash; a reduction in the level of criminality in our society &mdash; which must be reassuring for the many people, particularly the more elderly among us, who have been worried and have felt threatened by the crime situation which has obtained in recent years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I turn to the Prisons Vote.  The total <Col N="1638" /> additional expenditure required on the Prisons Vote amounts to £9.754 million under the subheads for salaries, wages and allowances, travelling and incidental expenses, buildings and equipment (both capital and maintenance), prison services and the Prison Officers' Medical Aid Society.  Savings elsewhere on the Vote, amounting to £393,000, reduce the net additional amount required to £9.361 million.</P>
    <P>The main areas where additional funds are being sought on this Vote are subhead A &mdash; salaries, wages and allowances and subhead D &mdash; buildings and equipment. The additional amount required for salaries, wages and allowances, including overtime is £3.827 million.</P>
    <P>The net increase of £3.827 million in subhead A arises from additional expenditure on overtime which reflects extra demands which have arisen in the prisons. For example, it has proved necessary to provide higher staffing levels at Portlaoise Prison following last November's unsuccessful escape attempt.  New security works are being put in place there at present and when these have been finalised they will have implications for staffing levels at the prison.  Another area of difficulty has been the need to segregate offenders who have been identified as having AIDS antibodies.  This wholly unwelcome development has necessitated additional staffing which in the short term had to be provided through additional overtime working.</P>
    <P>These two examples of additional demands which have arisen in the prisons over the past year or so must also be seen against a background of an increase of over 50 per cent in the prison population over the past four years.  The House will already be aware that this increase reflects the Government's determination that those convicted of serious offences should serve the sentences imposed on them by the courts.</P>
    <P>The Government are equally determined to reduce the level of overtime working in the prisons.  I have already indicated my concern about the present <Col N="1639" /> high level of overtime in the prison service and a number of measures are being taken to deal with this matter.</P>
    <P>Before outlining those measures I can assure the House that I accept a reduction in overtime working is necessary not only from the point of view of the actual operation of the prisons but also because of the wider social issues involved.  In particular I believe that given our serious unemployment problem, we should appoint additional staff to carry out work for which there is likely to be a demand in the long term where this can be done at a cost equal to or less than that involved in having this work done on overtime. Current attendance systems are unsatisfactory in that they have, in effect, a built-in element of overtime working. This is clearly undesirable and discussions about revised rosters are at present taking place under the conciliation and arbitration scheme.  The House will appreciate that, as proceedings under that scheme have to be treated as confidential to the parties involved it would be inappropriate for me to make any further comment on this matter at this stage.</P>
    <P>It is also the case, of course, that urgent needs which arise in the prison service have to be responded to in the short term by recourse to overtime working pending a full review of staffing needs.  These reviews are complex and inevitably take some time given the need to take into account factors such as the actual staffing levels found necessary to cope with a new situation and an assessment as to whether that situation is likely to persist.</P>
    <P>Such a review of all prison staffing was recently concluded in my Department and, as a result, the Government agreed to the creation this year of an additional 184 posts for the prison service.  This figure is the highest number of extra staff which I consider it possible to recruit by the end of this year.  The question of the further provision of extra staff during the course of next year is now under active consideration.</P>
    <P>I think it will be clear from what I have <Col N="1640" /> said that I accept the basis for some of the concern which has been expressed about the high level of overtime working in the prison service and I am conscious of the demands being made on staff as a consequence.  I hope it will be equally clear, however, that with the substantial number of additional staff who have recently been sanctioned the review now being carried out and the attempts being made to introduce new rosters, appropriate steps are being taken to deal with this matter.</P>
    <P>I should mention that, given the operational requirements of prisons, the factors which have to be taken into account in devising the best way of meeting staffing requirements are complex. It has, for example, proved more cost effective in the past to use overtime for certain areas of work arising in the prisons. I make this point because some publicity has been given recently to calculations which, by dividing the overtime bill by the average cost of a prison officer allegedly give an idea of the number of full time jobs which could be created in the prison service if the money were spent in this way instead.  I am sure the House will appreciate that calculations of this kind are so crude that they have no meaning in reality.</P>
    <P>An additional £246,000 is being sought for subhead B.1 &mdash; travelling and incidential expenses &mdash; in the light of expenditure trends so far this year on this heading.</P>
    <P>The second major additional sum being sought on the Prisons Vote is £4 million for the Capital Programme.  This year £12.74 million was voted for the capital programme for prisons and places of detention.  It was envisaged that something in the region of £10 million of this amount would be expended on the new place of detention currently under construction at Wheatfield in County Dublin for 320 young male offenders.  Work on the custodial buildings has been in progress since September 1984 and is due for completion by the end of 1987.  Considerable progress has been made.  The structure of the buildings is now virtually completed. The installation of the mechanical and <Col N="1641" /> electrical services is very far advanced.  In 1984 and 1985 progress with the buildings was slightly slower than expected but a momentum was gained in 1986 which, combined with the recent very favourable building weather, has largely overtaken those earlier delays.  At this stage, in mid-contract, outlay is at its heaviest and it is now apparent that an expenditure of £13.5 million, rather than the £10 million expected, will be incurred this year.  This, I stress, is not an overrun on the cost of the undertaking.  Expenditure in respect of work done is within the costs provided for in the contract and the heavier expenditure in 1986 will be offset by correspondingly less expenditure in 1987. An additional £4 million is being sought for the unforeseen expenditure on Wheatfield and also for more expenditure than was envisaged on other building projects &mdash; such as the replacement of part of the perimeter of Mountjoy Prison and similar work in Cork Prison &mdash; which, largely because of recent good weather, have also progressed much faster this year than was expected.</P>
    <P>A sum of £581,000 which is being sought for subhead D.2 &mdash; maintenance and equipment &mdash; arises mainly from additional security works at Portlaoise and Limerick.  In addition, work on the adaptation of Arbour Hill and the separation unit at Mountjoy which has had to be undertaken was not foreseen when the original Estimate was being framed.</P>
    <P>The requirement of £825,000 on subhead E &mdash; prison services &mdash; arises mainly on clothing, bedding, furniture, etc., and medical services and reflects expenditure levels to date this year and a review of existing commitments.  The amount includes provision to cover the expected cost of innoculations for staff against hepatitis B.</P>
    <P>An additional provision of £275,000 is being made under subhead J &mdash; Prison Officers' Medical Aid Society &mdash; in anticipation of agreement being reached with the society in relation to payments in respect of previous years.</P>
    <P>The gross additional requirement of £9.754 million is offset by projected <Col N="1642" /> savings amounting to £393,000 on a variety of headings.</P>
    <P>The total additional expenditure required on the Courts Vote amounts to £264,000 under subhead B &mdash; Travelling Expenses etc., which is partly offset by a surplus of £158,000 in Appropriations-in-Aid. Savings elsewhere on the Vote, amounting to £105,000 million, reduce the net additional amount required to a token £1,000</P>
    <P>This is a token Estimate.  It is estimated that there will be savings and excesses in a number of subheads in the Vote and these are expected to balance out.  The Supplementary Estimate is required to authorise the necessary adjustments between the various subheads.  The main variables on the original Estimate are in subhead B &mdash; Travelling and Incidental Expenses &mdash; and subhead D &mdash; Appropriations-in-Aid. The original allocation in subhead B was £847,000 million.  It is clear that, based on the level of expenditure for the rest of the year, there will be an excess of some £264,000 on this item mainly because expenditure on home travel will be greater than anticipated. Appropriations-in-Aid are expected to exceed the estimated provision by some £158,000 mainly because of an increase in the value of fines collected and in fees collected by the office of the General Solicitor for Minors and Wards of Court.  These extra receipts, combined with small savings in some other subheads, are expected, as I have indicated, to offset any expected excesses.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>There is plenty in the Supplementary Estimate to keep our attention. This is the second Supplementary Estimate which the Minister for Justice has presented to Dáil Éireann this year. The figures which the Government presented at the beginning of the year were totally inadequate and seriously under-estimated the amount required by <Col N="1643" /> the Minister for Justice to run and properly service his Department.  The Minister got his figures wrong to the tune of £22 million, comprising the £4.4 million Supplementary Estimate agreed by the House on 27 June, and the further £17,642 million requested now.</P>
      <P>We fully support the allocation of these extra moneys, principally to the Prison Service, and the Garda Síochána, as we supported the June Supplementary Estimate. We take the view that no effort should be spared to crack down on the criminal, and put him behind bars.  There are still far too many criminals walking the streets, free to prey on innocent citizens. The Minister will have our full support. When he casts aspersions on us here, he would do well to remember that we support his efforts to deal with crime and, consequently, support the Supplementary Estimate here today.</P>
      <P>The Government have had and will continue to have our support in providing the resources needed to tackle the present high levels of crime and vandalism, and to restore a sense of security to our homes and communities.  Our concern is with the Coalition's misrepresentation of the resources provided by the House, and with their misrepresentation of the position of the gárdaí and the prisons.</P>
      <P>To prove these points, I draw the attention of the House to three facts which have recently emerged:&mdash;</P>
      <P>First there was a &ldquo;revolving door&rdquo; in operation in Mountjoy Prison.  As a result prisoners were being released at an unprecedented rate to make space for new commitals.  The most recent Prisons Report 1984 was withheld until 21 October of this year, and was released on a day when the Minister knew that the country was distracted by a broader political issue.  This report revealed that 1,920 prisoners were fully released without supervision in the course of the year. This means that almost one in every two prisoners sentenced was being released prematurely.  This confirms what the Gárda and the prison officers were saying at the time, but the Minister was denying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1644" /> If those who commit crimes are detained in prison and are not allowed out on this very early release basis, the amount of crime will decline.  This House was pressing the Minister at the time to stop the practice of the revolving door. The media were raising it day after day, and the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Noonan, was telling them they had their figures wrong.  That is all on the record. We had, very recently, a report which confirms that that is actually what was happening.  Obviously once that was stopped, the amount of crime had to decline.</P>
    <P>Second, there was a serious problem with the money provided for Garda overtime this year.  It was short of the real needs by £1.6 million.  The Minister caused a scare when he spoke to a conference of Garda chief superintendents last May, and warned them that the current level of expenditure on overtime was too high.  As a result instructions for severe cuts were issued to local superintendents. These had later to be withdrawn because of the chaos which ensued.  Meanwhile, the Minister continued to misrepresent the real situation in public.  Now it can be clearly seen that just as the Garda and we in the Opposition suggested, the money provided for Garda overtime for 1986 was totally inadequate, especially in view of the major commitments which the Coalition had made to the Border areas as part of the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  No extra provision was made in the Estimates for Border security.</P>
    <P>Third, there was a gross underestimation of the workload of prison officers and of the financial provision required to meet this need.  This Supplementary Estimate is calling for an additional award of £3.827 million which is a 45 per cent error in the original Estimate as presented by the Minister to this House as recently as last June.</P>
    <P>The Minister and his predecessor said that the extra money required for Border security would be provided.  We have the Minister's speech which deals with the question of overtime.  He said the money was adequate and that the Minister was <Col N="1645" /> prepared to provide any extra resources required.  What we do not know is how much of the basic £12 million, and now of this extra £1.6 million, went on Border security and how much went on dealing with and tackling crime in the cities.  As I understand it, a very large part of the total allocation for overtime is going on Border security.  That is a matter for the Government and we do not want to pry into it, but we want to know that the Garda have the flexibility and the resources they require to deal with crime in the cities where it has been most prevalent.</P>
    <P>We cannot tell from the Minister's figures what has happened as regards Garda overtime in the cities.  We know from the Garda that their overtime has been very severely cut and that consequently when communities look for Garda assistance they are repeatedly told the Garda do not have any money for overtime and therefore that the men or ban-gardaí cannot be provided.  The Minister's speech does not help us in this area.  It shows there was a problem but it does not show how much of that problem was generated by the Government's decision to increase security in the Border areas. I understand a major part of the overtime provision has been spent in the Border areas and not in the cities where crime is on the increase.  That is very unsatisfactory. It would be better if we could just look at the normal policing work of the Garda.</P>
    <P>There was a gross underestimate of the workload of prison officers and the financial provision required to meet this need.  This Supplementary Estimate is calling for an additional award of £3.827 million, a 45 per cent error in the original Estimate presented by the Minister to this House as recently as the end of last June.  At that stage he must have had a fairly good idea&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Minister is working on the total figure.  We all know the quotation. &ldquo;lies, damn lies, and statistics&rdquo;. The Minister is expert at that but it will not work in this case.  On the original Estimate the error is 45 per cent.</P>
      <P>The Minister knew the volume of work involved.  Yet, he failed to avail of the opportunity either to make adequate financial provision or to provide additional jobs.  This problem did not occur only in November 1986.  The Minister should have anticipated it.  In his speech he says he recognises there is a problem about the number of jobs.  Yet, he makes nasty remarks at anyone who tries to calculate a figure without all the data or staff the Minister has at his disposal. The Minister now says he knows what the situation is and that he will try to get more staff by the end of the year. I do not entirely blame the Minister because obviously it is Government policy to use the money provided for Garda overtime but not to provide extra jobs.  Now he comes asking for more money.  This is the result of Government mismanagement.  The Minister should have faced this problem earlier in the year because it was clear to most people that such a problem existed.  This refusal to face up to reality has been a hallmark of this Minister, his predecessor and the Coalition Cabinet for the past four years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They were prepared to pay up to £20,000 in overtime per man rather than use this money to create another job, even on a temporary basis.  Total prison overtime is now admitted to have risen <Col N="1647" /> to £13.6 million for 1,600 officers, or an average of £8.500 per man per annum.  I understand that only about 1,000 officers work overtime.  Therefore, if we wanted to be realistic the figure would be approximately £13,000 per man per annum.  The Minister, I am sure, has detailed figures to hand and he will explain the position to us.  No matter what he does with the figures, £13.6 million has been spent on overtime for prison officers.</P>
    <P>The confrontation tactics employed by Minister Noonan in 1983 seriously undermined public confidence in the prison service and have now culminated in a doubling of the annual overtime cost during the past two years alone.  That is bad financial management and bad personnel management.  The Minister referred at some length to overtime in prisons, and rightly so.  He accepted that a reduction in overtime is necessary. Anyone can see that at this stage.  We have a Minister to manage the Department and to anticipate problems.  He should have done something in the early stages and not wait until the end of the year to say he finally accepts there is a problem and that he is now prepared to do something about it.</P>
    <P>The Minister said discussions and negotiations were taking place under the conciliation and arbitration scheme and that we should not say anything about this area.  I do not want to interfere with the Minister's discussions under the concilliation and arbitration scheme and we will support him as we have always done in that respect, but there are areas which concern this House.  When we see £13.6 million being spent on overtime at a time when there are 238,000 people unemployed we have to ask how the Government and the Minister are running that Department.  We would not be doing our duty if we did not ask such questions.</P>
    <P>When we look at compulsory overtime and the arguments it leads to, we must ask ourselves what can be done to remedy the situation.  Of course we leave it to the Minister to negotiate, and we will stand out of the way while that is going on, but <Col N="1648" /> we must be concerned about the broad parameters of this area.  We read headlines in the newspapers about prison overtime and the fact that prison officers are very upset about conditions and the burden of continuous overtime.  In a letter circulated on 17 September they said that the stress and tension associated with prison work in bad physical conditions with chronic overcrowding was self-evident.  In addition, they said the requirement to work compulsory overtime placed a further intolerable burden on prison staff.  They went on to say that the effect of excessive overtime on prison officers, their families and offenders in custody, was extremely serious.  They said serious cases existed of domestic and marital difficulties and that chronic alcoholism, psychiatric problems and the general mental and physical fatigue of prison officers was a serious cause for alarm in their view.</P>
    <P>The ongoing effect of these problems has a direct bearing on the quality of the prison officers' duty performance and a consequent effect on the standard of treatment of offenders.  The security of institutions can hardly be maintained by exhausted prison staff.  We must take cognisance of this organisation's views.  I know the Minister feels they are exaggerated and that will have to be his position in any of the negotiations in which he is involved.  However, work in the prison environment is difficult and tense. It is clear there must be an element of compulsory overtime and that the Minister must control it.  However he should consider placing an upper limit on the compulsory overtime allowed to each officer in normal circumstances.  I accept there are difficulties in rostering and in running over-crowded prisons.  In these circumstances prison officers are under pressure and there is an onus on the State to ensure that there is a proper balance.</P>
    <P>Although I support the required financial provision set out in this Estimate I reject the underlying approach and malpractice. In 1986 the Estimate planned that a prison officer can earn 45 per cent on top of his gross salary in overtime but the outcome was that the prison officer <Col N="1649" /> earned 60 per cent on average over his gross salary in compulsory overtime.  This indicates that the prisons are still potentially explosive and that the Government have failed to manage the prison system. The Minister belatedly intends to appoint an extra 184 prison officers but given the £30 million spent on overtime this year that is clearly inadequate.  The Minister will have to seriously reconsider this whole question.</P>
    <P>Apparently it will not be too long until the Wheatfield project requires extra staff.  I support the Minister and the Government in getting a reasonable schedule of appointments in that area to substantially reduce the amount of overtime. The extent to which overtime can be reduced is a matter for the Minister and his Department as only they have the details available on which to make the necessary calculations.</P>
    <P>The Minister is also seeking a 31 per cent increase over his original Estimate for buildings and equipment.  What is the purpose of this extra £4.58 million?  The Minister has said that in 1984-85 progress with buildings was slightly slower.  That is an understatement as building was almost at a standstill on the major projects during that time.  The Minister said that the recent very favourable building weather has meant that the delays are being overtaken.  If it does not rain we will have prisons but if it does they will be delayed.  How could the Minister be so far out in his original Estimate?  What happened during the year that required such a large increase?  Does this include the cost of his predecessor's debacle regarding Spike Island for which Minister Noonan refused to account?  In his reply perhaps the Minister will give us the estimated cost of the damage to Spike Island or of the refurbishing of Spike Island. Has he finally realised the wisdom of the approach taken by Fianna Fáil and made a further urgent commitment to Wheatfield?</P>
    <P>The sequence of prison capital expenditure over the past number of years is a damning indictment of the Coalition's handling of the prisons.  The following figures set out the position.  They show <Col N="1650" /> the extent of the cutback in prison capital in 1983 and 1984 and then the Government's scramble to catch up again in 1985 and 1986.  Having realised their mistake and the consequent damage that ensued, they now plan to complete Fianna Fáil's programme, albeit with some amendments.  The pattern of spending on prison buildings following the revised Estimate for 1986 is as follows: in 1980 the Estimate was £3.9 million and expenditure was £4.2 million; in 1981 the Estimate was £10.9 million and expenditure was £11.5 million; in 1982 the Estimate was £15.5 million and the expenditure was £15 million.  This is where the change took place.  We can see from that a rising level of expenditure to meet an identified need.  We could say that the explosion of crime which occurred in the eighties should have been identified much earlier, but it was identified and was being provided for until the Coalition Government came in to office. They revised the original 1983 Estimate of £17.5 million down to £11.5 million and then spent only £10.5 million.  This is where the slow-down came.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Mr. Woods Mr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Where is the £22 million coming from now?  In 1984 the Government estimated an £11.5 million expenditure and only spent £5.5 million.  That is when the revolving door was swinging at a fierce rate, as shown in the 1984 prisons report released recently.  Then the Government found themselves in trouble.  They found that their policy was wrong and that Fianna Fáil proposals were wise and should be pursued.  In 1985 the Government decided to continue with Wheatfield prison.  The walls were there but nothing was happening inside. Now according to the Minister the mechanical and electrical work is well under way.  In 1984 the walls were left standing. The contractor's name was left outside and that is the way it stayed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>There were a few fellows walking around wheeling barrows to give the impression that things had not stopped altogether.  Now it has all come out in the wash.  In 1984 the actual expenditure was £5.5 million.  In 1985 the Government realised their terrible mistake, a mistake made by impractical and inexperienced people.  They allocated £12.1 million to this area and spent £11.7 million.  In 1986 the allocation is £13.1 million and the Minister now wants to expand that to £16.7 million.  The Minister is back on target.  Perhaps when he was Minister for Finance he held back his poor colleague, his predecessor in the Department of Justice, but he is determined that no one will keep him down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has a great imagination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the factual sequence.  It is very much along the lines which the Minister has spelt out here.  I should like to hear the Minister for Justice telling the Minister for Finance that, if the weather is good he will spend £10 million and if it is bad he will spend £5 million&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government realised that they made a mistake in slowing down the project but it is now getting under way and has our full support because it is an urgent and necessary part of provision for prison capital.</P>
      <P>Another surprising disclosure is the under-estimate of 128 per cent for radio and other equipment for the Garda Síochána.  One must ask where was the extra £3.255 million spent?  Did the Minister make a blunder or was it intentional?  It looks like an attempt to mislead the House by reducing the figures for budgeting purposes at the beginning of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1652" /> After all, the 1985 outturn for radio equipment was £3.9 million and the original estimate for 1986 was £1.62 million. Was this a part of the Government's general diktat to Departments?  The Minister will probably be able to answer that because he was Minister for Finance at the time.</P>
    <P>Perhaps it was the responsibility of the Minister for Justice to demand further cuts.  The figure of £1.62 million looks suspiciously low and is now being trebled to £4.875 million.  The Minister has given an explanation for this development but how was there such a major miscalculation at the outset?  Was there a change in policy, as the Minister suggested, in regard to leasing?  Did they prefer to purchase?  Was leasing introduced as a short term device to reduce the original estimate even though the Minister must have known that this was an expensive remedy?  We are talking about a very large sum, but the Minister says that there are economic advantages to be gained if the equipment is purchased outright rather than leased.</P>
    <P>Is the Minister suggesting that his predecessor did not recognise the advantages of purchasing outright in this case?  He said increased expenditure will mean that there will be considerable financial savings in the long term.  Perhaps he will tell us what those savings are likely to be and how his predecessor did not recognise that at the beginning of the year when the Estimate was prepared.  The Minister must account for the enormous increase and for the policy and management decisions involved.</P>
    <P>The House is now providing a further £17.64 million to the Minister for Justice for his Department.  This brings the community's contribution to tackling the crime and vandalism epidemic to £377 million in 1986.  The taxpayer has a right to expect value for money and to know that it is spent wisely.  Despite the heavy commitment to law and order there is a real sense of fear and insecurity.  The Minister must be aware of this and that it is important to overcome such fear.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1653" /> The most significant feature of present day crime is the increase in crimes of violence and the widespread use of guns and other weapons.  Early figures this year show a further increase of 14 per cent in the number of armed robberies and armed aggravated burglaries.  People fear for their lives and personal safety. The Minister said the figures for crime reduced over the past three years, but he forgets that they increased so much in recent years that it will take a long time to get back to those of 1980.  In 1980 there were 72,782 offences recorded and in 1985 the figure was 91,200.  The Minister neglected to say that in 1983 the highest ever crime level was recorded and it is one of the three years to which the Minister referred.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not.  I referred to 1984, 1985 and 1986.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I see.  The Minister avoided speaking about the bad year.  I accept that the Minister is referring to two years and is giving his view on what he thinks the figures will be at the end of this year.  The year 1984 was not very different from 1983; the figure came down from 102,000 recorded crimes to 99,700.  I know the Minister is very interested in figures and statistics and we can all obviously take heart from the latest figures.  Nevertheless the crime level is much higher than 1980.  Worse, the incidence of armed crime, physical violence and other frightening crime is still on the increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Indictable crime covers items stolen from cars, larceny and so on, but a person could be injured, shot or beaten up and that has a terrible effect on the person concerned.  Physical attacks and fear for personal safety must be tackled.  People are afraid to walk on streets or in parks at night, indeed even in the daytime. They are afraid to visit local banks, shopping centres, or post offices because of the frequency of armed raids.  I had a difference of opinion about this recently <Col N="1654" /> with the Minister but even during the past week there have been three raids close to where I live.  There is no point in talking to people who have experienced that sort of crime about the niceties of statistics.  They know all about crime and its violent nature which is a very disturbing element.  The community have shown their willingness to co-operate with the Garda in neighbourhood watch schemes but ordinary people cannot deal with violent crimes.</P>
    <P>The Government must tackle the problem but so far they have failed to show the necessary commitment to tackling violent crimes.  Their approach has been negative, waiting for the problems to resolve themselves.  They have shown no urgency or flexibility and have failed singularly to provide any special resources for this purpose.  They have no positive programmes to restore law and order to hard pressed communities and businesses. Centre city shopping areas and suburban shopping and residential areas are bearing the brunt of crime and valdalism. House, business, school, community and sporting premises cannot meet the spiralling cost of insurance arising from crime and vandalism.  It is extremely difficult and outrageously expensive to obtain insurance for fire and theft on motor vehicles.  In some instances companies will not provide cover at all.  Even private homes must now be secured like Fort Knox before insurance companies will provide cover.  The Government should act now and provide the community with the peace and security it needs.</P>
    <P>The Minister will have to take his management responsibilities seriously.  He will have to tackle the management structures of the Garda Síochána, the prisons and the courts.  Almost four years have gone by without any action from the Government.  Three substantial reports have been produced on Garda training. This is fundamental to any future developments but to date no action has been taken.  The first of these reports was published by the Select Committee on Crime, Lawlessness and Vandalism in <Col N="1655" /> June 1985.  Two further reports were produced by the Garda Commissioner's committee on traning.  These comprehensive and forward looking reports provide the basis for a major advance in training and in the future management of the force.  The Minister must pay attention to these reports as they are fundamental to the future development of the Garda Síochána.  The reports deal with the prevention of crime, crime detection, the protection of life and property and the preservation of public safety and tranquility.</P>
    <P>The Select Committee on Crime, Lawlessness and Vandalism have also produced a report, albeit in draft form, on the objectives of policing in Ireland and on the direction which should be pursued in the future.  That report highlights the need to develop the area of crime prevention. This will involve taking the initiative and becoming involved in the community rather than merely responding to events.  The Garda Síochána have been stressing over the years the need for change in this area.  They have produced various reports indicating the directions which they feel are the right ones.  It will also mean the Garda Síochána working with social agencies and the setting up of crime prevention committees.  A lead has been given by the setting up of neighbourhood watch schemes.</P>
    <P>The Whitaker report of July 1985 indicated the way forward in the development of the prison system.  Yet, again no action has been taken.  It is also time for a major review of the administration of the courts given the enormous increase in volume and complexity of modern crime. These steps are essential and are urgent to shape the future development of the fight against crime.  In the short term the Minister must take immediate action to tackle the present wave of violent crime. The existing crime squad are very effective but far too weak in numbers.  Their numbers should be doubled immediately to allow them to provide flexi-squads to back up and support local gardaí in high crime areas.  We must show the thug, the vandal and the violent criminal that he <Col N="1656" /> will not be tolerated.  At the same time there is a need for a Boys Town for young offenders and for a development of the juvenile liaison scheme and the probation and welfare service for youth.  Family liaison officers should be appointed to deal with young offenders with special problems.  New approaches must be taken to provide for very young persons for whom the present educational system cannot cater and who become drop outs at an early age.</P>
    <P>The Minister should show his commitment in this area and tackle these tasks openly and seriously.  He will have our full support in tackling them.  If he is successful, as he may well be, he will come back into this House and say he did it all on his own, that he had no help from this House or the Select Committee on Crime, Lawlessness and Vandalism. When the Minister mentioned the neighbourhood watch schemes I was disappointed he did not mention that the Select Committee on Crime, Lawlessness and Vandalism were the first committee to publish a report on that project and press for its initiation.  The Minister says that project is going very well.  We are very thankful for that.  When the Minister receives support from Members on all sides of the House he should be big enough to recognise and welcome that support.  But in his speeches the Minister for Justice never makes references to that support.  Perhaps, as he is not long in his post he will correct that in the future.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>We cannot be complacent about drugs. The Minister referred to the problem as levelling out.  That is dangerous talk.  We must be constantly vigilant against further developments in drugs.  We must <Col N="1657" /> tackle the present very serious drugs problem.  The fact that the problem is not increasing at present is welcome.  Those who are suffering need to have the resources available to them.  The cocaine market in the world is flourishing.  A new and dangerous drug called &ldquo;crack&rdquo; has now appeared.  It is high purity basic cocaine and its effects are five to six times as strong as conventional drugs.  The high is immediate and lasts for 12 to 15 minutes and is followed by a deep depression.  Dependency is almost automatic. The Minister should be vigilant and prevent cocaine which is available in abundance throughout the world becoming a major factor here.  We cannot afford to be complacent about this.  The Minister should not allow any relaxation of the drive against the use of cannabis.  No responsible person can support the use of those drugs by adolescents.</P>
    <P>Too little attention has been paid to the needs of women who abuse drugs. The Minister should try to find some new method of dealing with them because they need special treatment.  They have received the same treatment as men but they need special consideration such as not being separated from their children. The Minister should show his commitment and tackle his tasks openly and sincerely.  If the Government do not have the will or the energy to tackle these problems it is time they moved and let us take over and show how it can be done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  The size of the Estimate, £8.28 million, with the volume of legislation to be brought before the House from the Department of Justice, are an indication of the greater role the Department play in the lives of our people.  That is not a voluntary role and for the most part it arises as a result of the steady deterioration in law and order which calls for increasing State investment to protect the lives and property of our people.  There is concern as to where we are going socially and economically and that is not surprising when one considers the huge amount of public <Col N="1658" /> funds that must be provided annually for the Department.</P>
      <P>It was encouraging to hear the Minister declare that crime was on the decrease. I should like to join with Deputy Woods in assuring the Minister that we will do everything we can to support him and the Government to ensure a continuation of that trend.  However, it is important to stress that Deputy Woods and other Fianna Fáil members who contributed to debates on matters relating to the Department of Justice in the past four years always displayed a sense of responsibility and concern.  We welcome the reduction in the level of crime but I wonder if the Minister's figures can be regarded as accurate.  I am sure the Minister is aware from his experience in the Department that society has adjusted itself into accepting a crime level which up to now would not have been tolerated here.  I am sure he is aware that a huge number of petty offences are not reported to the Garda Síochána.  Crime statistics do not take such cases into account.  Unfortunately, we are too complacent about this.  Ordinary citizens no longer report petty crimes to the Garda Síochána although five years ago they would have done so.  It is my view that the statistics the Minister glibly announced in the House for the purpose of supporting his case do not reflect the true position.</P>
      <P>This new tolerance and acceptability of a certain level of crime in our society is something the House must guard against. We are setting up a breeding ground and creating a kindergarten for more serious crime to develop.  The Minister should create an awareness among the public and his Department about this problem and stress the importance of not ignoring any type of crime.  If petty crimes are ignored, a disservice will be done to the Garda Síochána because they will not be able to identify an area of crime that inevitably will lead to more serious crime. The person who gets away with a small crime will move on to more serious crime. later.  I must sound a word of warning to the Minister that it would be dangerous for people to ignore petty crimes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was disappointed to hear the Minister <Col N="1659" /> resorting to a level of political debate unworthy of a Minister for Justice.  His comments can only be interpreted as a method of casting a smokescreen over the seriousness of the problem of the deterioration of law and order here.

      <P>The Minister may be tempted to make a glib off-the-cuff reference to the Leader of our party and our policies but when one finds such an attack written into his speech one cannot help but believe it is an organised attempt by the Minister to try to discredit any creditable opposition that comes from this side of the House.</P>

      <P>If the Minister is sensitive to the fact that Fianna Fáil are offering solutions to problems he and the Government have failed to deal with, then he has exposed his thoughts and, by his actions, revealed his own guilt in regard to the administration of his Department.  I would not expect the Minister to give any credit to Fianna Fáil.  He is not in that line of business but if he does not believe what Fianna Fáil are saying I invite him to study a report published by the Irish Conference of Professional and Services <Col N="1660" /> Associations entitled &ldquo;Security, Health and Safety in the Workplace&rdquo;.  In addition to that he should read an article headed &ldquo;Reality&rdquo; in the <i>Garda News</i> volume 5, No. 8, October 1986.  In the course of that article it states:</P>
      <P>Governments have failed to grasp the nettle of fighting crime.  In that regard the report is in no doubt.  In fact all that has happened has been the introduction of cosmetic measures accompanied by the ususal blast of publicity and when they inevitably fail and fade from the scene they add yet one more nail to the coffin of respect for the forces of law and order.</P>
      <P>If the Minister read the report he would see that it spelt out in no uncertain terms the deterioration in urban life &mdash; the fear of citizens to walk the streets, the mass of broken telephone kiosks, the bus shelters wantonly destroyed, the attacks on the elderly and defenceless and so on.  If the Minister does not want to believe what Deputy Woods said or the Fianna Fáil publicity posters which he chose to comment on, surely he will give some credence to the official view as expressed in the <i>Garda News</i> last month.  He can read there the reality in relation to the performance of the Government and the way they have handled the crime problem. Even if the Minister wants to disregard what we say, he should not show the same scant disregard for the very important report prepared by the ICPSA and a commentary on it by the Garda representatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The level of lawlessness in society is a reliable barometer of the success or failure of the Government's social and economic policies.  I have no doubt but that the frightening level of crime at present reflects Government failure in these areas.  While one cannot condone in any circumstances a deterioration in law and order, the motivation behind such acts, particularly in the large urban areas with high unemployment and social deprevation, is easily understood.  I put it to the Minister that law enforcement is no substitute for inadequate social reform <Col N="1661" /> and, indeed, has led to revolution in many societies.</P>
    <P>We are sitting on a time bomb in relation to the unrest which is growing among the massive unemployed population. The Government should direct their energy and thoughts towards introducing some kind of effective programme which would restore confidence in our people.  Wearing my hat as a member of the Oireachtas Committee on Public Expenditure I believe the volume of public finance now compulsorily channelled into the area of law enforcement would not be necessary if there had been a positive and long term commitment given earlier to economic and social reform.  We are now crudely treating the disease rather than attacking the cause.</P>
    <P>The Estimate before the House is a reactionary one and, by its nature, is a condemnation of the Government's economic and social failures.  I am sure the Minister will agree that unemployment is a highly inflammable area which could be the basis for social unrest unless it is tackled at the earliest opportunity. The present level of unemployment and the complacency with which it is accepted is regrettable.  At the recent Ard-Fheis the Taoiseach referred to unemployment and said 1,000 temporary jobs were created in the public service.  He said he would do the same in 1987 but before he did so he would have to lay-off the 1,000 people who were employed last year.  Is that a credible way in which to tackle the problem of unemployment?  For too long we have been tinkering with job creation policies, most of which in recent years have been of an unsustainable and artificial nature. I fully support the concept of training and work experience programmes.  They are essential in the evolution towards permanent employment but they are no substitute for sustainable jobs based on production.</P>
    <P>It is important to acknowledge the dedication to duty of the Garda.  They do an increasingly difficult job on behalf of the nation.  I sometimes feel that these <Col N="1662" /> expressions of goodwill &mdash; they are sincere &mdash; sound hollow in the light of our failure to create the environment in which the Garda can operate effectively and in the light of our failure to provide the resources which they need.  Deputy Woods referred to the delay in dealing with the training and equipment of gardaí.  It is a source of deep regret that after four years we are still talking about reports on Garda training and that no effective action has been taken by the Minister in relation to this important area.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to prison officers.  They are an essential and respected arm of State security: sometimes they are a much maligned arm of security.  They do a very difficult job.  I am glad the Minister had made a proposal in the Estimate to deal with the problem of compulsory overtime in the prison service. Many prison officers work long difficult hours and do not want to be part of the compulsory overtime system which has existed for too long.  I am sure the Minister will agree there are prison officers who are anxious to be part of that overtime system.  He should bring in a regulation which would offer a degree of flexibility to prison officers.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that there was a 50 per cent increase in the prison population over the past four years.  That is an indication of the kind of pressure which has been put on the prison service and on the personnel who manage the prisons.  We must be as sensitive and as supportive as we can be to the people who are doing this very important job on our behalf.</P>
    <P>Again, I should like to agree with Deputy Woods in his tribute to the members of the drugs squad for their efforts in tackling this very serious problem. They have been very effective, particularly in the past 12 months.  While we have concentrated our efforts and energies in recent years on dealing with the hard drug problem, I suggest to the Minister that the problem of alcoholism, which has received-very little attention in this House, is now becoming an even greater problem.  I know the Minister has plans to bring legislation before the <Col N="1663" /> House to regularise in some way our licensing laws, but from the number of representations being made to all of us and the views being expressed by the many social organisations throughout the country there can be no doubt that we will have to deal in some way, within the limited capacity available to us in this House, with this increasing national problem.  It is a problem for individuals and for families.  It is a by-product of the society which we in this House have created.  Young people are seeking refuge in the doubtful comforts of alcohol because they cannot find employment, they cannot find rewarding work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>That will be sufficient because I do not intend to deal with any broad issues but with specific issues related to my constituency.  First, there is the problem of adequate accommodation and equipment for the Garda Síochána in Cavan town.  For a number of years they were housed in a 19th century former RIC building, a barracks as it was then called.  This was totally inadequate and, in fact, quite dangerous and they abandoned it for a private house in Cavan town.  Even in normal circumstances this would have been adequate but circumstances are not normal and there are large numbers of gardaí operating out of that private house.  I gather the situation regarding a basic service such as toilet accommodation is extremely serious in that station now.  The Garda have been very patient and long-suffering with regard to that accommodation and the whole question of the provision of a new Garda station for them is exercising not <Col N="1664" /> merely the minds of the Garda but of the public in that area.</P>
      <P>I know there is a site available with which the Office of Public Works played around for a long time and Cavan Urban Council took it back because nothing had been done.  Now I understand there is some dilemma about deciding on a price for that site.  The Department have to purchase the site back from the urban council.  I hope there will not be undue delay in coming to a business-like conclusion. We all come in to put our cases here and we can, on occasion, be accused of exaggeration but it is no exaggeration to say that the huge number of gardaí operating now out of a moderately-sized private house in Farnham Street in Cavan is ridiculous and a situation out of which we should get as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>My other comment is on Cavan Courthouse. Considerable hardship has been experienced by the community because Cavan Courthouse has not been available since a near fatality, causing the collapse of the roof of the building some time ago. This is a plea for a speed-up in the repairs to the courthouse.  I know I have only four minutes&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mrs. A. Doyle)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Supplementary Estimate now sought for Vote 10 arises for a number of reasons. First there was the decision of the Oireachtas, with the passing of the Canals Act, 1986, to transfer responsibility for the Grand and Royal Canals from CIE to the Commissioners of Public Works.  The sum of £650,000 included for the canals in the Supplementary Estimate is the unexpended balance of the 1986 allocation to CIE for that purpose.  There will be a corresponding saving under that heading in the Vote for Communications, so no extra cost to the Exchequer arises from the transfer.</P>
      <P>Just over half of the £650,000 is required for the salary and wages of the 78 canals staff transferred from CIE.  The balance of the money is needed to cover some expenditure on works, services and supplies incurred by CIE but not paid for before the transfer, and also similar expenditure by the OPW since that date. Works undertaken by the OPW include replacement of some defective lock gates, major repairs to a breached weir on the Barrow navigation, repairs to and tidying up of sections of canal banks as well as routine day-to-day maintenance. Arrangements are also in hand for the purchase of essential transport vehicles, equipment and supplies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad to inform Deputies that a <Col N="1667" /> detailed engineering survey of the Grand Canal by the OPW engineers has commenced and consultants are engaged on a major study of the entire system, taking into account the vast amount of interest in and views on the canals manifested by local authorities and members of the public since the transfer.  The consultants' report on the study, which will be available early in 1987, will provide advice and guidance to enable the OPW to formulate a programme for the future management and development of the canals as a public amenity in accordance with the terms of the Act.</P>
    <P>Another reason for the Supplementary Estimate is the purchase of Agriculture House for a sum in the region of £7.9 million by the commissioners on behalf of the State.  Agriculture House is a large modern office block fronting on to Kildare Street beside the Shelbourne Hotel.  It houses the headquarters of the Department of Agriculture and has a total of 165,000 square feet of office space and forms an integral part of the Government Buildings complex.  The building, which was held on a long term lease was due for rent review in the current year and the purchase price represents what would amount to about eight years rent following the review.  Given the size, condition and prime location of Agriculture House the purchase is considered a sound economic investment.  It is in the block broadly referred to as Government Buildings.</P>
    <P>The additional provisions being made in subheads E, F.1, F.2, F.3 and F.4 are for certain works and charges which arose after the allocation for the subheads had been settled.  There were identified savings in the Votes for the Departments for which the services in question were required.  The Departments concerned will surrender amounts to the total involved, so that, again, there will be no extra cost to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>The additional sum required for subhead F.5 covers essential maintenance work at Galway Courthouse undertaken by the commissioners on behalf of the Minister for Justice.  The cost of this work <Col N="1668" /> is recoverable from the local authority.</P>
    <P>The reduction in Appropriations-in-Aid is to cover an expected shortfall in moneys due for the maintenance of completed drainage and coast protection schemes.  The amount which had been budgeted for the current year was £5.5 million but the rate at which payments have been coming in does not hold out hope that the figure is going to be realised.  It is, in fact, estimated that there will be a shortfall of £3 million.  It is necessary to adjust the Appropriations-in-Aid provision downward by that amount to ensure that the commissioners are not deprived of funds which they need to discharge their functions.</P>
    <P>There is a statutory obligation on county councils to meet the costs of maintaining drainage and coast protection schemes.  The funding of county councils for this purpose is, of course, a matter for the Department of the Environment. The existing arrangements for funding and execution of drainage maintenance is one of the subjects covered in the Review of Arterial Drainage, which is being submitted to Government by the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasMcEllistrimJnr" hpid="Mr. McEllistrim Mr. McEllistrim">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McEllistrim</NameTxt>
      <P>Earlier this year, after the introduction of the budget, the Estimate for the Office of Public Works for the entire year including the Supplementary Estimate now before us in the sum of £12,156,000 amounted to £104,811,000.  That is a sizeable amount of money and demonstrates the importance of the Office of Public Works and the finance they required in order to carry out the work they undertake each year. When I served as Minister of State in that office I often mentioned the fact that there were three or four other Departments which handled a lesser amount of money annually than did the Office of Public Works.  That office should be well catered for by the Government and the Minister for Finance when the annual Estimates are being prepared.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first matter with which I should like to deal is the purchase of Agriculture House, a fine building which encompasses all of the sections of the Department <Col N="1669" /> of Agriculture.  When I first became a Member of this House the Department of Agriculture were located in Merrion Street.  Because the various sections of that Department were located all over the city, Deputies, the farming community and others had to go to different office blocks to discuss their problems. We welcomed the fact that the various sections of the Department were brought under the one roof in Agriculture House in Kildare Street, convenient to Leinster House.  It was my experience during my term of office in the Office of Public Works that all Government Departments were anxious to have their office space sited around St. Stephen's Green, near Leinster House, so that civil servants would be readily available for discussions in this House.  The purchase of this building, costing £8,245,000, signals a change in policy on the part of this Government &mdash; to purchase buildings to house Government Departments.</P>
    <P>Bearing in mind the present financial position of the country, when we hear daily of shortages of finance in all Departments, this is a refreshing change.  I have always favoured the Office of Public Works purchasing sites within the vicinity of St. Stephen's Green to house as many civil servants as possible and that they own their own office space.</P>
    <P>When last in Government the Fianna Fáil Party had embarked on a policy of decentralisation, transferring certain sections of Government Departments to provincial towns.  At that time we purchased sites in 12 different locations and a 13th site in my own town of Tralee for a block of offices to house civil servants in County Kerry.  At that time also we invited tenders and had discussions with the building construction industry and financial institutions about the erection of such buildings in different centres.</P>
    <P>We also had those buildings designed by architects, some of them by architects from the Office of Public Works and some by private architects.  At that time we had designs for 12 buildings for Civil Service Departments down the country in order to carry out our decentralisation <Col N="1670" /> programme.  There was a great need for a boost in the building industry, as there is at present.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;between decentralisation and the purchase of a Civil Service building here in the city.  I will not dwell on it for very long.  Our decentralisation programme at that time would have given much needed employment in the building industry.  If the Government spent this £8 million on a decentralisation programme it would be much more beneficial and a much better investment than spending it on the purchase of a building when finances are so scarce.  It would also afford an opportunity to many of our civil servants to get jobs in their own towns or in other cities rather than having them all housed in Dublin.  We all notice the numbers of people who travel by private and public buses and by train with <Col N="1671" /> CIE each weekend, civil servants who are anxious to go down the country for the weekend.  If the Government invested the £8 million on a decentralisation programme it would enable us to cope with the numbers of people in Dublin.  The streets of Dublin would not be as crowded and it would ease traffic in the city.  I always advocated that the Office of Public Works should own all their own property, whether in Dublin or in the country.  At present the money would be better spent down the country.</P>

      <P>In all we were going <Col N="1672" /> to transfer 3,210 civil servants to the country.  That would have made 800,000 square feet of office space available in Dublin.  It would be a much better investment for the Office of Public Works to spend that £8 million on decentralisation or by having portions of Departments transferred to the country which would bring Government to the people in the provinces.  The Department of Agriculture could be transferred to County Cavan or some other county in the centre of Ireland rather than have it in Dublin where there is very little agriculture other than in rural Dublin.</P>
      <P>Under subhead E &mdash; New Works &mdash; where there is an extra expenditure of £312,000 I would like to ask the Minister if a new Garda barracks for Ballyheigue, County Kerry, is included in that.  A site was purchased in 1980 for a small Garda barracks.  That area is very scenic in the summertime when there are about 5,000 to 6,000 extra people in the village.  A new Garda barracks is very necessary in that village.  An office block is also needed for civil servants in Tralee.  This has been planned by the Office of Public Works.  I wonder is it included in the £312,000.  A site was purchased in Tralee, when I was in the Office of Public Works, with a view to housing all the civil servants in one office block.  The Revenue Commissioners in Tralee have increased their staff considerably since 1980.  They are housed in four prefabricated buildings in the town.  The same pertains to the Department of Agriculture.  They have a big number of people employed in Tralee.  They moved into an office block about ten years ago &mdash; I cannot remember the exact date.  When I served as Minister of State in the Office of Public Works we had to spend a considerable amount of money on the floors of that building because the weight of the files caused the floors to sink about six inches and they were in danger of collapsing.</P>

      <P>I hope she will honour her word but I assure her that I will be back to her in a very short time if it is not advertised before Christmas.  The civil servants in Tralee are kicking up a hell of a row, especially the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Agriculture officials, to have some proper space made available to them which will be as good as Agriculture House which was purchased recently. Civil servants in the Department of Agriculture in Tralee deserve the same type of office accommodation as they have in Dublin.  We would welcome it down there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under this heading of £312,000, is there any allocation of money for the Land Commission offices in Merrion Street here in Dublin?  There is a great deal of office space there.  I do not know the square footage, but every public representative in the Dáil knows about this <Col N="1674" /> big building, known as the Land Commission building.  This building has been almost closed.  As far as I know only a skeleton staff operate in it.  When in Opposition you have not the opportunity of checking those things, but I think it is the only other office block the Government own in Dublin city: I am open to contradiction on that and they may own a few more.  Money should be allocated to have that office block renovated and made available for offices.  It could not be nearer to Leinster House.  Earlier this year there was an allocation of money for some renovation to the Department of Lands office block.</P>
    <P>There is an allocation of £641,000 for waterways.  The canals have been included in our inland waterways and have been taken over by the Office of Public Works to be looked after.  I would like to pay a compliment to the OPW for the way they have handled the navigation of the Shannon for the past 18 years or so since I came into politics and I hope in the future they will handle the Grand Canal and the Royal Canal just as effectively. The Vote here is for £641,000.  I understand from the Minister's speech this is mainly for wages and salaries. When the Royal Canal and Grand Canal were taken over by the OPW we were led to believe we would have a planned programme to develop those two canals into grand waterways.  I know that will be a hefty job which will cost a great deal of finance and possibly will run over a ten year period.  I am disappointed to see that there is no allocation of money for the development and improvement of the canals.</P>
    <P>When I was coming to Dublin this week I came, as I usually come, by the Grand Canal.  I noticed that somebody was putting down a pathway on the side of the canal and it was being tarmacadamed and rolled by a roller.  Those pathways were used at one time when the barges which went up and down the canal were pulled by horses.  The Office of Public Works might know this strip of land adjacent to canals and rivers as the mat road.  The Ceann Comhairle, the Minister of State and some TDs probably know what I am <Col N="1675" /> talking about because the mat road area is the area near a river where arterial drainage has been carried out.  The OPW have a certain authority over such pathways when arterial drainage has been done.  I took it on myself to find out who had permission to have a roadway made adjoining the Grand Canal and I found out that the OPW did not know about it. Was permission given to Dublin County Council or Dublin Corporation?  I do not know.  I am not a member of those local authorities.  It is important at this stage of development of the canals that at least the mat roads or pathways, whichever you want to call them, be preserved.  We may need them in the future.  The local authorities, the county and urban councils in the different counties, are anxious to co-operate with the OPW in the development of the canals as waterways and amenities.  That will be very beneficial for the people of the towns through which the canals flow, especially the young people, and in the attraction of tourists to those areas.  Those towns and Dublin itself could develop the canals for boating, walks and swimming and possibly have them stocked with fish.  Studies will have to be done on that, but at least the OPW should have an allocation of money and a plan for the development and improvement of our canals.  They should get suggestions and co-operation from the different local authorities through whose territory those canals flow.  When we stand up here again to talk about the Estimates for the OPW &mdash; perhaps there will be a change of Government in the meantime &mdash; maybe some plan will have been prepared for an allocation of money for that purpose.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1676" /> The amount of money in the Estimate for the OPW has been substantially reduced this year.  A Cheann Comhairle, in case you say that I am deviating from the Vote, I raise this because we had two big floods during the year and promises were made.  The Taoiseach and other members of the Government who visited flooded areas promised that they would step up the arterial drainage programme.  Yet there is no provision in the Supplementary Estimate introduced here today for arterial drainage.</P>

      <P>On a point of order, the Minister seems to be contradicting herself.  The Minister said earlier in regard to arterial drainage that the existing arrangements for funding and execution of drainage maintenance are covered in the review of arterial drainage which is being submitted to the Government by the Minister for Finance, and the Minister tells us it is being done under what is already there.</P>

      <P>The design stage of the four rivers mentioned by the Cabinet recently is proceeding.  No extra money is needed.  The review of arterial drainage, which the Deputy's Government mentioned in October 1982 is being completed. We are talking about two different things altogether.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasMcEllistrimJnr" hpid="Mr. McEllistrim Mr. McEllistrim">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McEllistrim</NameTxt>
      <P>When Fianna Fáil were in power they had a progressive policy on arterial drainage.  We did a cost analysis benefit on rivers that were to be dredged.  That has been discontinued by the present Government.  A cost analysis benefit must be done on every river before drainage takes place.  We were doing this for each river which might be dredged in the near future.  The Government discontinued it.  We ask that it be started again, especially in the areas that experienced flooding this year.  There is nothing in the Supplementary Estimate for it.</P>
      <P>There is £10,000 for courthouses.  The local authorities are responsible for the courthouses.  It is only when they neglect their duty &mdash; and we in Kerry repaired our courthouse and did not neglect it &mdash; that the Government must step in.  The Department of Justice, in co-operation with the Office of Public Works, should be responsible for the maintenance and provision of courthouses in every county. I know the Minister will probably say they are looking into this and that it will be done in the near future, but everything is being put on the long finger.  Many of the courthouses are historic buildings with good architectural features and they should be preserved.  The Office of Public Works are the office to do such work. I ask the Minister of State to ask the Government to ensure in future that maintenance and provision of courthouses will be a Government concern rather than a local authority concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. A. Doyle Mrs. A. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasMcEllistrimJnr" hpid="Mr. McEllistrim Mr. McEllistrim">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McEllistrim</NameTxt>
      <P>I note also that £10 million has been spent on the Royal <Col N="1678" /> Hospital in Kilmainham.  It is only open two days a week because a board was put in charge of it.  It would be much more beneficial if the Office of Public Works were in charge of it.  Since £20 million has been spent on it, it would be more appropriate to have it open every day of the week, rather than just two days.</P>
      <P>In regard to maintenance and supplies, it is important that the Office of Public Works should use Irish materials.  We should be giving an example to the rest of the country.  I know of several cases where Irish materials were not used by contractors who built buildings for the Office of Public Works.  The Office of Public Works should note the condition of some of the buildings erected in recent times, particularly the Garda barracks in Tralee which was built of brick which has turned white.  I questioned why our Irish brick was turning white.  I got the answer from a builder recently who told me that, when the plastic was removed from those bricks and they are left out in the rain, the white would come out on the brick afterwards.  I suggest that in future when the Office of Public Works are putting up public buildings they should insist that the contractor keeps the bricks covered until they are put up and then there would be no white on the building.</P>
      <P>In regard to increases in salaries and wages, there was a vote of £9,000 for the Office of Public Works.  I am surprised at that, in view of the fact that so many people have been laid off from other sections of the Office of Public Works to do arterial drainage.  The number of people employed in arterial drainage has been cut by 50 per cent in recent times, so I would have thought there would be no demand for increased wages and salaries.</P>
      <P>Some of our public buildings are in a bad state, for example, the Employment Exchange in Tralee and the Department of Agriculture in Tralee.  It is the duty of the Office of Public Works to maintain these buildings and to provide the facilities that are required in them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the purchase of Agriculture House, could the Minister tell me if all the sections of the Department of <Col N="1679" /> Agriculture are now housed in Agriculture House?  I am not against the purchase of buildings for housing civil servants here in Dublin or against the erection of buildings here in Dublin.  I have always advocated that sites should be purchased here in St. Stephen's Green.  What I do question is the £8 million spent on the purchase of a building when it could be spent much more effectively and much more beneficially down the country on a decentralisation programme and would give much more employment in the various towns I have mentioned.</P>

Since then, the Government have approved the acquisition by Aer Lingus of two new Boeing 737-300 aircraft which will be introduced on the Dublin-London route in late 1987.

However, it is a misrepresentation. I said that no option can be ruled out in considering the Aer Lingus fleet replacement needs because of the magnitude of the funds involved, and the associated capital needs of the group in the coming ten years when the national Exchequer was never in a worse position for investing in areas like that. It would be wrong for us to rule out any option that might facilitate the future growth and expansion of Aer Lingus.  I am anxious that everybody keeps an open mind on this.

If Deputy Andrews wishes to share in the general credit for bringing about an announcement in relation to Dún Laoghaire Harbour we welcome him to the band of Deputies who deserve some credit for that, including the four Deputies in his constituency, but it is a bit much having wanted this announcement to be made to start cribbing about the motives.  The Taoiseach accepted an invitation some months ago to address Dún Laoghaire Chamber of Commerce on 30 October.  In the Green Paper on Transport Policy published earlier this year the future of Dún Laoghaire harbour <Col N="1684" /> was specifically raised.  Three possible options were cited for its future.  One was to incorporate it in a new overall ports authority; the second was to have a separate harbour authority for Dún Laoghaire; and the third was to continue with the present situation.</P>
      <P>My Department decided that a new harbour authority was the best arrangement in all the circumstances.  It is important to have some effective local participation in running the harbour.  The memorandum to that effect was circulated to Departments many weeks ago. As a former Minister, Deputy Andrews will know that it takes some weeks to arrive at these decisions, so it had nothing to do with the placing of his question. The memorandum was circulated long before that.  The legislation will be complex and will take some time to bring forward.  The Taoiseach hopes that the legislation will be enacted during 1987, regardless of whether or not there is a change of Government.  It will be complex because it means taking people out of the Civil Service and transferring them to a new authority.  There are also many property issues to be addressed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13 and 20 together.</P>
      <P>The proposals from Caneire Developments Ltd. are just one option for the development of a transportation centre orginally proposed in a report submitted to CIE in 1975 by Skidmore, Owings and Merrill.  Two other options &mdash; both from Irish interests &mdash; have also been tabled with CIE.</P>
      <P>In the case of the Canadian interests, they want an exclusive option, that is to say that the Government would be irrevocably committed now but the promoters would have six months to decide whether or not to commit themselves. During that six months, they would then see if financial backing could be arranged for the project and check in detail to see if their proposals are viable and feasible. Discussions have been held with CIE and their views will be taken into account. The House can be assured that the only basis for decisions will be the merits of the proposals.  In the case of the Canadian interests, the Government have indicated that, within the next few weeks, they will decide whether or not to pursue that particular option at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not normal to publish proposals which are under consideration at Government level but, in any event, as the House <Col N="1701" /> will know, this matter has been the subject of extensive media attention and controversy.</P>

      <P>Who put forward those proposals?  I understand that Caneire has been in existence for one year but the proposals were put forward about 12 months before that company were established.  Who put forward the proposals first and what other Ministers, or Departments of State, were involved other than the Department of Transport?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot remember any issue that has been so confused with statements that are erroneous and claims that make the mind boggle.  A few weeks ago we were given the impression that the Government were getting a gift of a tunnel under the Liffey and a transportation centre that would create thousands of jobs.  We were told that somehow or other we were looking a gift horse in the mouth, but everybody understands that it was not a gift horse. These proposals have been in existence since 1975 and the Canadian interests first got involved &mdash; from memory &mdash; in October 1984.  What is called a letter of intent was lodged in July of last year.  The person or persons involved subsequently constituted themselves as Caneire Developments Limited sometime earlier this year.  That is when that company came on the scene.  An impression has been given that I have had these proposals before me for years but a letter of intent was only submitted to CIE in July <Col N="1702" /> of last year.  I should like to add that in November of last year CIE indicated that they were not happy with the proposals but, nonetheless, I felt that they needed deep consideration.  I appointed consultants to look at the overall plan because of my concern to rejuvenate Dublin, something everybody is concerned about.  The consultants reported to me on 29 August last.</P>

The consultants started work on 1 May and reported on 29 August.  A memorandum dealing with their report was submitted to Government in September last.  It was agreed then to ask for the comments of the Canadian proposers on that consultants report.  We got them three weeks later, about 14 October.  We have now said that in the light of all the information available and the discussions which took place in recent weeks which included representatives of my Department, the Departments of Finance and the Environment, and the Office of the Attorney General, a decision on this option will be taken in the next few weeks.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that there is a difficulty since the report has not been published.  Quite frankly I should like to publish the report, given the media speculation and all the comments that have been made.  I have remained very quiet on this.  It is normal for a Government to get proposals and to treat them confidentially.  They are given calm, quiet consideration before public announcements are made on them.  I was asked to do that by the Canadians many months ago.  I have remained quiet despite the fact that they and many others have not remained silent.  When the Government make a decision on it it is my wish that the proposals will be made available.  I hope we can bring that about.</P>

      <P>Deputy Wilson's question gives me an opportunity to state the facts.  This plan was a CIE one based on the 1975 report by the consultants Skidmore, Owings and Merrill.  Since then CIE have been acquiring property as the opportunity arose in that location. One would be forgiven for forming the impression that what was an overall objective of CIE has been hijacked.  One of the Irish proposals was discussed at length by CIE and they decided some time ago it was not propitious to proceed at that stage with the proposal.  In view of the controversy that Irish group came back and asked if it was propitious now because they were anxious to discuss their proposal.  The controversy has also prompted a second Irish group to come forward with an interest in the project based on the original Skidmore, Owings and Merrill proposal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The reply which the Minister gave is what I would call a lumpen reply and I want a detailed breakdown of what are talked of as the social costings of CIE.  The &ldquo;in&rdquo; word is transparency. There is no transparency attaching to the words &ldquo;rail £80 million&rdquo;.  What I should like to know and what the House would expect to know, is how that £80 million is allocated in circumstances in which there is a claim that CIE are making a <Col N="1708" /> profit.  I agree totally with the above the line payments but should like to have a breakdown of the above the line payments. For example, how much of that is a social service payment?  To which area is it ascribed in each case?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not what the question asks.  It would be helpful if Deputy Wilson would table a question which asks what he intended to ask.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">

      <P>A breakdown.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Nonetheless, it would be very difficult to answer that question. When we came to review the financial situation of CIE in early 1983, we considered in great detail how to approach the quantification of the social dimension of CIE's role.  There was talk about getting a few hundred statisticians and others who would look at every bus route and train route throughout the country and say that is 50 per cent social and the other is 30 per cent social.  I thought that was not the way to do it, that that would prove impossible.  Having considered everything, a general assessment was made and the Government decided they would consider one-third of every CIE service as social and, therefore, that they would be responsible for one-third of CIE's expenditure.  That is the general quantification of the social role of CIE.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister not agree that if the accounts of CIE are to have any credibility in this House, the House would have to be informed of what it is paying for individual services, old people travelling on their tickets, etc., and not to get a statement here that of the £115 million, £80 million will be given to the railways, without having any view of where in the railways that money is being spent.  It is current cost, not capital &mdash; that is a separate bill.  In view of the Minister's appeal to us to try to buttress the morale of CIE, to make a different company out of it from what we have had.  I ask the Minister that the accounts be transparent.  In other words, if an annual account says that CIE made a <Col N="1709" /> profit of £4 million or £5 million in 1985, but the social payments amounted to £115 million, this House should know specifically &mdash; there is no use in talking about one-third &mdash; what each amount of money is used to pay for.  It would be the same as with the Minister for Social Welfare for subheads for unemployment assistance, unemployment benefit and so forth.</P>

      <P>Next week we shall be having a major debate and discussing the CIE reorganisation Bill and I shall certainly make every endeavour to provide in my speech as much breakdown of the subsidy as possible.  The subsidy on DART system, for instance, for every passenger is £1.92</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Inclusive of capital charges, in the Minister's estimation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, inclusive of all charges.  In relation to Dublin city bus service, the subsidy is only 10p, that is one-nineteenth of the subsidy on DART. I shall try to get similar figures for the railway.  That is before any social welfare payments are considered.  The Department of Social Welfare pay for the free travel of old age pensioners and holders of invalidity pensions, etc., but that is quite separate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that not separate from the £115 million?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  There is a subhead in the Vote for the Minister for Social Welfare.  That is quite separate.  I am saying all this because it is right that the matter should be debated in great detail in the House from time to time.  The important thing is that since 1982 the overall cost, the overall deficit of CIE, has been reducing in real terms every single year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The running costs have <Col N="1710" /> declined in real terms in each of the past four years.  CIE have exceeded their target in respect of last year and are on target for this year.  That follows 13 or 14 years of escalating deficits by a multiple of the rate of inflation.  There is a very considerable turn-around in the affairs of CIE but that company are still, of course, costing us a considerable amount of money.</P>

As I stated in reply to a previous question by the Deputy on 19 February 1986 &mdash; Official Report, Volume 363, columns 3120-3122 the cost of the project will depend on a variety of factors yet to be determined, such as the configuration of the satellite network, the number of satellites to be launched, launch and insurance costs etc.  The project will clearly cost several hundred million pounds, which will be the responsibility of the promoters.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously what Deputy Leyden has put before us are possibilities. Clearly, there would have to be proposals from Bord Telecom Éireann or Radio Telefís Éireann and those proposals would have to be considered.  The result would depend on a number of things. Apart from whatever Government sanction would be needed, it would also depend on their coming to a reasonable arrangement or agreement with the owners of the satellite.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister as enthusiastic about this project as he may have been at the start?  Does he feel it is a viable project and has job creation potential here?  How many jobs does the Minister feel will be provided at the end of the day by Atlantic Satellite and what will be the final location for input into the satellite?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am as enthusiastic as ever before.  This whole satellite proposal reflects very well not only on the Irish public service but also on the political parties, on this and the previous Government, in the way it was handled.  Deputy Wilson set up the satellite committee in his short term as Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  That committee excelled themselves and produced an excellent report within a short period of months. The civil servants in my Department analysed and dealt with the question very expeditiously, as did the Government. This means, quite frankly, that we have got ahead of many of our competitor countries in the way this has been handled. Some of this dates back to 1977 when civil servants negotiated that deal for this country.  So while there is a lot of criticism of political parties and the public service, here is a sterling example of very high quality service for which credit should be given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope we can make an announcement in regard to this in the very near future. It would be wrong to say it will create <Col N="1712" /> hundreds of jobs or anything like that. We know there is a major potential in this for this country and it affords us an opportunity to get ahead of other countries. I do not know whether that potential will be realised because of the high risk nature of the project and also because it is very new technology.  There is a lot of work remaining to be done. Even if we do give the go-ahead, funding has to be raised, there will be the launching of the project, the building of the satellites, the configuration of satellites and so on.  Therefore, there is much to be done but, hopefully, the next stage will be resolved in the very immediate future.  Then we can go ahead looking towards a possible launching.</P>

      <P>About my principles, I can say they will not be compromised. The Deputy can be assured of that.  I hope we can bring legislation before the House which will withstand the test of time.  In this regard I look forward to having Deputy Leyden's assistance. When talking about expediency he might think about relaxing his own.</P>

    <Title>Supplementary Estimates, 1986 (Resumed). - Vote 10: Public Works and Buildings (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £12,156,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1986, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of Public Works; for certain <Col N="1737" /> domestic expenses; for expenditure in respect of public and certain other buildings; for the maintenance of certain parks and public works; for the execution and maintenance of drainage and other engineering works.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>In the course of his contribution Deputy McEllistrim referred to a project in Tralee.  If I interpreted the Minister of State correctly she interjected to say the Deputy's party had plans for there in October 1982.  In interjecting in that manner the Minister of State made Deputy McEllistrim's point.  The Minister of State seems to have forgotten there was a general election in November 1982, that her party has now been in power for four years and in all of which time the project about which Deputy McEllistrim spoke has merely been gathering dust.  The Minister of State now tells us that there will be some action taken, that there appears to be a stirring and, according to her, tenders will be advertised shortly.  I hope the Minister of State will forgive me, but my suspicions are that the movement that has occurred has something to do with the forthcoming general election whether that takes place before Christmas 1986 or Christmas 1987.  It would appear that an impending general election will have moved that project along somewhat.</P>
      <P>When one takes into account all of the promises and commitments given by Ministers in recent times, the various announcements made at private and party meetings throughout the country, it would appear that the next Government &mdash; which will probably be a Fianna Fáil one &mdash; will have to pick up a tremendous bill.</P>
      <P>I welcome this limited opportunity to discuss this Supplementary Estimate.  It is of such a significant amount that had it been introduced by a Fianna Fáil Government we would have been assailed with cries of financial recklessness, cooked books, inability to estimate properly and similar accusations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1738" /> Like most other Deputies I welcome the decision to transfer responsibility for the Grand and Royal Canals from CIE to the Office of Public Works.  It is only logical and sensible that the Office of Public Works, with all their expertise in water and water control, their knowledge of plant life and so on, should have control over these canals.  I should like to compliment whoever is responsible for the tremendous work that is being carried out at Kilcock, a marvellous example of what can be achieved on our canals.  What has been achieved there amounts to a wonderful amenity.  However, I am somewhat puzzled that it should have been felt necessary by the Office of Public Works, or the Minister of State, to appoint consultants, and here I might quote from the remarks of the Minister of State when she said:</P>
    <P>... a major study of the entire system, taking into account the vast amount of interest in and views on the canals manifested by local authorities and members of the public since the transfer.</P>
    <P>One would have thought that the enormous expertise of the Office of Public Works, with the landscaping and maintenance of various parks and so on throughout the country, would have enabled them to carry out this work in conjunction with the detailed engineering survey of the Grand Canal which is under way.  The Office of Public Works would know best how to manage and develop the canals as a public amenity given their enormous and undoubted skills in this whole area as manifest by all the major parks and lakes which they control.</P>
    <P>It is with somewhat mixed feelings that I should like to discuss the purchase of Agriculture House.  It is a very welcome purchase and is something which people have looked forward to for a long time. They like to see the Office of Public Works constructing their own buildings rather than renting them.  I might add in passing that I do not see any reduction in the Estimates for rent for this year; rather it has increased as we can see from the Supplementary Estimate.  Perhaps the <Col N="1739" /> Minister would clarify that position. When I think of the benefit this £8 million could have been to the economy of many rural areas, I wonder whether it is the sound and economic investment the Minister thinks it is.  Is she aware that this sum would have constructed the proposed offices, which were cancelled by her Government, at Ballina, Sligo and Cavan?  Could she attempt at this stage to quantify the tremendous and enormous benefit that would accrue to the economy of these regions, all of which are in stagnation because of the policies of the Government?</P>
    <P>The town which I represent &mdash; Ballina &mdash; is haemorrhaging slowly.  It is losing its young people and its unemployment rate is one of the highest in the country.  The construction of an office of the Department of the Environment there, with over 200 salaries being paid each week into the economy of the local area, would make an enormous and significant difference to the economy of the whole area.  The plans are in the Minister's office.  They were carried out by OPW architects.  The sites are there and all that is needed is the political will to give all areas equal treatment.  The Government do not have that political will.  While one welcomes the purchase of Agriculture House, one wonders whether that would have been done if Agriculture House was in Ballina, Galway or Nenagh.</P>
    <P>As you know, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, that is one of the areas which would benefit from the whole decentralisation programme but I will not go into that because I accept your ruling. The £8 million would have been far better spent in improving the economy, particularly in the five areas to which the first section of that decentralisation programme referred and for which tenders were sought and obtained for leasing and renting, for rent and buy, or simply for construction.  All the options were included in the tender.  I had a great interest in the programme, having nursed it all the way through for two years.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the item in the Supplementary Estimate in relation to the <Col N="1740" /> £100,000 for the provision of necessary repairs to a courthouse.  I know that the Minister has been a member of a local authority and, as such, she will know the frustration and anger caused to very many members of local authorities by the inaction of all Governments in relation to the maintenance of courthouses.  The local authorities feel, and rightly so, that buildings for which they have no functional responsibility should be in the care of and maintained by the Department of Justice.  One feels a certain sympathy for Galway County Council and their rate-payers who have to foot a bill for £100,000 as stated in this Supplementary Estimate. It is a very arbitrary decision that anyone would move in and carry out repairs and then ask the local authority to carry the burden.  It is a function of the Department of Justice and it should be carried out by them under their budget.</P>
    <P>One of the most significant points in the Minister's speech, one which gives an indication of the disastrous financial state of local authorities, is her admission that the appropriations-in-aid will be down by approximately £3 million.  It is highly significant in that the appropriations-in-aid should not be taken out of the £14 million but out of the figure of £5.5 million which she gives.  That will give an idea of the dire straits in which all local authorities find themselves, particularly those who have to fund major drainage maintenance schemes or major coastal protection schemes.  I know the Minister, as a member of a local authority with a major problem of coastal protection, does not relish the idea of that local authority having to foot the bill for maintenance, if the work is ever done on coastal protection in the general Wexford area.  That figure is an indictment of the manner in which this Government have crucified local authorities over the past four years in relation to their financing. I see the Leas-Cheann Comhairle looking at me.</P>
    <P>Local authorities, as you know a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, are supposed to refund the contributions spent on drainage maintenance and coastal protection. <Col N="1741" /> Because of their dire financial straits they are no longer able to do so to the extent that was budgeted for.  The Minister's admission that only £2.5 million out of a budgeted figure of £5.5 million will be paid shows the dire straits most local authorities are in.  In fairness to all of them, as long as they could meet those responsibilities they met them.  I talk in particular of my county which has major drainage works and which found itself saddled with a demand for a certain sum of money each year for work which had been put into it and over which it had no say on how or where that work would be done.  At a time when various Governments had imposed a limit on the amount of money the county could raise by rates and had allowed a percentage increase only, it found itself having to reimburse the OPW for drainage maintenance. While I accept there have been some changes which are welcome, the problem is still of such a magnitude that many local authorities will not be able to meet their responsibilities under the subheads, and the fact that nearly a quarter of the Minister's speech referred to this is an indication of the enormity of the problem.</P>
    <P>Deputy McEllistrim made the point, rightly with the tremendous number of men being laid off in drainage, one looks at the drainage Estimate and sees that it is down from last year on the full Estimate, and one wonders about salaries and wages is over and the necessity for extra money.  The Office of Public Works no longer have responsibility for school building.  The Department of Education have had that function for some time. Those of us who try to get information see how difficult it is.  It must go through the Minister of State's office and there is a bottleneck.  I have a personal problem which I will hand to the Minister of State afterwards and I will be grateful if she will try to do what she can about it.</P>
    <P>The Supplementary Estimate is an indication of the tremendous difficulty that local authorities are having.  For my part while one sees the sense of purchasing Agriculture House, the money <Col N="1742" /> could be better spent on the decentralisation programme.  If the Fianna Fáil plan had been commenced that £8 million would have gone a fifth of the way towards the total and complete decentralisation programme which would have done a tremendous amount for very many areas, would have improved the economy of many areas, and would have been a far more sound economic and financial investment than the purchase of Agriculture House at this moment.</P>

      <P>It is a pity the Government have not only two and a half minutes but one must accept that as long as the numbers are there we have to wait for another while.  I do not even need two and a half minutes for what I have to say. I reiterate that the space the Minister of State gave in her speech to the whole question of the reduction of the Appropriations-in-Aid indicates the state of the finances of many local authorities.  It is also a warning sign to the Government that they will have to change their attitude in relation to local authority financing. They will have to try to help local authorities, not give them extra problems, such as asking them to fund drainage maintenance and water protection schemes.  This should be examined by the Government with a view to changing it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>In many ways this Supplementary Estimate demonstrates the disastrous consequences for the country of the decisions taken by this Government and their failure to take other decisions.  We are dealing here with a total Estimate of £105 million and a Supplementary Estimate of over £12.4 <Col N="1743" /> million.  In the first instance a Government who claimed they were going to adhere to fiscal rectitude programmes have a great deal to answer for at this stage of the year in bringing before the house a Supplementary Estimate in one Department of £12.5 million which is almost an eighth of the total original Estimate. If that does not demonstrate a lack of planning, control and discipline I cannot think what else does.</P>
      <P>We are being told now that this Government are spending considerable time and effort planning the Estimates for next year.  We are being led to believe from the leaks and sources &mdash; only now not just Government sources, it is Fine Gael sources and Labour sources, trying to distinguish themselves from one another &mdash; that they are bending their efforts and applying their knowledge such as it is to reducing and controlling public expenditure for 1987.  While apparently that is the exercise they are engaged in for 1987, they come in here now at this back end of 1986 to introduce a Supplementary Estimate for £12.5 million for one Department, the Office of Public Works.  Like so much else about this Government, their actions demonstrate that their words are meaningless.  This action today demonstrates that all the suggestions of careful planning, prudent control and determined reduction of public expenditure means nothing when the actions demonstrate quite the opposite.</P>
      <P>When this Government took over in 1983 they made a great virtue of reducing the capital programme particularly for the Office of Public Works.  I, and each one of us here, remember well that this was presented by this Government in 1983 as being evidence of their determination to demonstrate they were going to control public expenditure on both the current and capital sides.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had a bit of that nonsense from the Minister.  Deputy Mitchell, already.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure we did and <Col N="1744" /> we will hear it despite the fact that the proclamations are very different from the actions.  Among these matters introduced as evidence of the Government's determination to achieve control of public expenditure in 1983 was the decimation of the public capital programme particularly as it affected the working of the OPW which was being done and planned by the previous Fianna Fáil Government in a comprehensive, planned, five-year programme.  It was a five-year programme relating to all public buildings and particularly, as my colleagues have understandably and properly underlined, a decentralisation programme of Government offices.  The amount of money to be expended in that first year, 1983, on that programme, which was planned, designed and already financed as the first stage of a five-year programme, was £5 million to cover the areas that our spokeman Deputy McEllistrim referred to in the first year.  That involved consultants' fees, site acquisition and the development of sites across the whole range of the areas in which Government offices and Government buildings were to be placed around this country, to demonstrate that the country does not begin and end in Dublin.  This Dublin-dominated Government, as was not so surprising considering the general attitute and orientation of the Taoiseach, cancelled that programme and claimed to make a virtue of doing so.  You and I, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, among others are conscious of the disastrous impact it had in certain areas including our home town of Nenagh which was part of a major decentralisation programme for the Revenue Commissioners including a triangular development with Limerick and Ennis involving 250 jobs transfers. Those programmes were cancelled with no thought except to give a false demonstration of fiscal rectitude and determination to control expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, four years on, the Government bring in a Supplementary Estimate a very considerable portion of which is for the purchase of the offices at present occupied by the Department of Agriculture in Kildare Street.  Over £8 million will <Col N="1745" /> now be spent to nail down, once and for all, the Department belonging mostly to the country, to rural Ireland.  A major programme was being planned for Cavan in respect of agriculture.  Now the Government are ensuring the prevention of decisions being taken by a succeeding Government to maintain and develop a decentralisation programme, particularly for agriculture.</P>
    <P>I am not saying we should immediately shift the Department of Agriculture from Kildare House, but is this the time to acquire, on a permanent basis, extra office accommodation at a cost of over £8 million when we have long term plans for effective Government through decentralised departments?  Anyone who knows anything about the problems of the economy at the moment, particularly in relation to the location of Government offices, knows that it is vitally important that we have a really regional economic programme for Government.  This Government's extent of regional awareness seems to begin and end with Dublin 4 and Dublin 2, and beyond that all is a desert.  This is not so.  In fact, these areas have become so congested that we are seeing the environmental consequences and the dissatisfaction of so many public servants who are obliged to live and operate out of a Dublin environment when they should be able to operate, through decentralised departments, from around the country.  It is sad but not surprising that this Government not only confirm their previous reduction of our decentralisation programmes but are trying to damn whatever other Government follow and prevent them for reviewing some of the decisions now being taken.</P>
    <P>The Committee on Public Expenditure, of which I am vice-chairman, spent considerable time looking at the procedures of the Office of Public Works. Nothing I am saving or that the committee are saying is in any way an indictment of the staff of that office but rather of the way Government have failed to manage in the past 15 years.  Amongst other things we recommended that, in each case involving new or additional accommodation, a study should be <Col N="1746" /> undertaken as to the most cost effective decision before any action was taken. There is no evidence in what the Minister has said today that any such study was undertaken before the decision to purchase Agriculture House was taken.  In fact, the decision seems to be based, according to the Minister of State, on the fact that the building, which was held on a long term lease, was due for rental review in the current year and the purchase price represented what would amount to about eight years rent, following the review, and that given the size, condition and prize location of Agriculture House, the purchase was considered a sound economic investment.  I wonder if it really is.</P>
    <P>Is it satisfactory for a Minister of a Government in the almost penultimate moment of their lives as such, to make a bland statement like that without explaining the other options that might have been considered, the costings, the other locations and so on?  The justification is on the basis of what would amount to eight years rent following the review.  How do we know what the rate would be following the review?  A rent is what a willing purchaser is ready to pay and a willing vendor ready to accept. It is clear that the rents for the huge proportion of public offices in this city are inordinately high.  The Government themselves are the main customers for this accommodation because business activity in this city is so depressed that there is no demand from them for office accommodation.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the Government are creating the upward trend in the price of property.  The various Departments are forcing prices beyond what the market could reasonably demand at this stage. Then they complain this is the price they have to pay.  About 40 per cent of all office accommodation in this city is occupied by the Government.  Instead of following the planned and disciplined programme of decentralisation we started in 1981-82 which would be in the national interest, in the interests of this city and in the interests of saving expenditure, they react from day to day in the <Col N="1747" /> absence of any comprehensive plan, as in everything else they have done.  The total decentralisation programme which would have covered 12 centres throughout the country&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The total decentralisation programme, which would have covered 12 centres, would have cost £40 million over a five year period.  In one fell swoop it was cancelled and the Government now come in gaily to ask this House to sanction one fifth of that just for one office block.  Is there any reason in that kind of attitude?  Is it not clear that what was planned then is even more necessary now?  We knew then that office accommodation in Dublin was much more expensive, and would be increasingly more expensive, than in the rest of the country.  If we had adopted that long term comprehensive plan, after three years we would have reduced the cost of Government office accommodation. If anything has proved us right, this Supplementary Estimate has done so.  One office block is costing one-fifth of the cost of the decentralisation programme we had in train but which this Government cancelled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of areas where sites were available and consultants' fees had been paid &mdash; upwards of £3 million &mdash; as well as the prison programme, were all set at nought by this Government who wasted money in the name of saving money.  This Government should answer to the public for wasting at least £5 million by not going ahead with our decentralisation plans and our prison programme.  We see the consequences of that action every day.  We are making a mockery of our courts and court houses.  There is no prison accommodation for the people who are sentenced because in 1983 this Government <Col N="1748" /> cancelled the four unit prison development programme we sanctioned.  We can see the consequences of this action all around us.</P>
    <P>It is not surprising that a Government who introduced <i>Building on Reality</i> two years ago, which is being rejected by the Government now, in their last breath are asking us to please sanction an extra £8 million for the acquisition of one office block in this congested city.  Everyone knows that in terms of office accommodation there is only one direction the Government should go and that is a renewal of regional and national economic development.  This Supplementary Estimate demonstrates the difference between the Coalition Government and Fianna Fáil.  Inevitably we will be changing places in the near future and there will be no more nonsense like this.  We will introduce a comprehensive programme for Government buildings and decentralisation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Our spokesman, Deputy McEllistrim, has covered the broad outline and philosophy of Fianna Fáil with regard to the expenditure by the Office of Public Works and I will confine myself to specifics.</P>
      <P>I am glad a detailed engineering survey is being made of the Grand Canal.  When the Bill was going through the House I spoke about CIE giving the Grand Canal to the Office of Public Works.  I said there was great potential for profit for the Exchequer in the development of the Grand Canal, as well as the other canals. I repeat that today and hope it will be the OPW's objective, not just a <i>laissez faire</i> policy but a strong marketing policy, to have the Grand Canal equipped to take visitors and to make a profit for the country. On one occasion I visited the Norfolk Broads where thousands of people go thinking they are boating.  The space is very confined but the number of visitors is so great that there is no great comfort. Our canals have tremendous potential and I hope the objective of the Office of Public Works will be to develop that potential to the benefit of the country and the Exchequer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1749" /> I could not agree more with my colleagues who condemned the scrapping of the decentralisation of Government buildings and the purchase of Agriculture House for £8 million.  In a marketing sense it may be a good purchase at this stage, but there is no doubt in my mind that the decision we took to decentralise was the correct one.  The Minister mentioned the condition and prime location of Agriculture House.  I hope she is right. I am a member of the Committee on Public Expenditure and there I discovered there was no proper inspection procedure of certain public buildings.</P>
    <P>Setanta House cost the State a tremendous sum of money but the brickwork lifted away from the shell of the building. This was a scandal.  When I put questions to certain experts before the committee I discovered very little care was taken for the safety of the public.  I hope this is not true of Agriculture House.  I hope the most minute and careful inspection took place.</P>
    <P>I believe our policy of decentralisation was the right one.  Admittedly, I have a vested interest in the sense that Cavan was one of the areas chosen for part of the Department of Agriculture, but it is regrettable that that scheme did not go through.  More than 3,000 public servants would have been stationed in various rural areas.  All one has to do is go to Parnell Square or O'Connell Street at the weekend to see many people going to the country.  Locating these people in rural Ireland would have had a tremendous social and demographic effect on these areas.  The last census showed that there were 3,000 fewer women than men in County Cavan.  This is a strong indication that our policy was the correct one.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned coastal protection. The money provided for coastal protection has been drastically reduced. I cannot understand how the Minister would allow that to happen because I visited her county and they have a big problem with coastal erosion.  There is a statutory obligation on county councils to meet the cost of maintaining drainage and coastal protection.  That is an obligation <Col N="1750" /> which county councils are unable to discharge.  This is disastrous for small drainage schemes in rural areas.  The Minister mentioned a review of arterial drainage.  We have had reviews of the Erne until the river is almost turning around.  The European Social and Economic Committees and other experts and consultants have been pushing for the drainage of the Erne for some time. There is a scheme in place in the Office of Public Works but nothing will be done about it as of now.  This is a great disaster for my area.</P>
    <P>A very mean, beggarly and skimpy approach was taken by the Office of Public Works to the finalisation of the Boyne drainage scheme.  The Kells-Upper Blackwater section of that river was left undone although the rest of the scheme was completed.  This was scandalous neglect by the Office of Public Works of a very important area where the people have been suffering for some time.</P>
    <P>We in Cavan are waiting for a Garda station.  I mentioned this on the Votes of the Department of Justice.  We are also waiting for a military barracks for which a site has been purchased but there is delay and procrastination.  Both of these facilities are badly needed in my area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>This Supplementary Estimate has given us an opportunity to comment but I do not go so far as other groups in the country who suggest that the Office of Public Works should be abolished altogether.  I emphasise the importance of decentralisation.  Deputies from the Government parties obviously realise that now.  Decentralisation is the popular thing to talk about in the run-up to a general election.  I am gratified to note from the recent comments of Government Deputies that they have been converted to the Fianna Fáil policy of decentralisation.  My only regret is that they were not converted sooner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Upon entering office the present Government dismantled the Fianna Fáil decentralisation programme.  I mentioned this recently outside this Chamber and I was challenged on it.  In case of a further challenge, I can quote from a <Col N="1751" /> letter from the Department of Finance, dated 16 September 1986.  It says:</P>
    <P>Dear Sir,</P>
    <P>I am directed by the Minister for Finance to refer to your letter dated 26 August addressed to the Department of the Public Service regarding the decentralising of Government Departments.</P>
    <P>The Decentralisation Programme was cancelled by the Government and an announcement to this effect was made in the context of the 1983 Budget.  There are no plans at present to re-introduce the Decentralisation Programme either in whole or in part.</P>
    <P>It was bad enough to scuttle the programme but it is worse that as recently as 16 September last they had no plans to reintroduce decentralisation.  The ridiculous behaviour of some Members of this House who are clamouring in their constituencies for decentralisation should be ended and they should take it up with the Government at parliamentary party meetings.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will have an opportunity to reply and I hope she will reply adequately when I have finished.  In 1980 the Fianna Fáil Government drew up decentralisation plans.  We intended to move sections of the Revenue Commissioners to Limerick and Ennis, sections of the Department of Social Welfare to Waterford, Sligo and Letterkenny, some sections of the Department of Defence were to be based in Galway, sections of the Department of Justice in Killarney, sections of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs were to go to Nenagh and Dundalk and sections of the Department of the Environment to Ballina.  The Department of Agriculture were to be partly located in Cavan, the Department of Education in <Col N="1752" /> Athlone and An Foras Forbartha to Merchants Quay in Cork.  Not only did the Government halt the Fianna Fáil decentralisation plans but they sold sites acquired for relocating sections of the Civil Service.  This action flew in the face of all social and economic wisdom.</P>
      <P>It is an irrefutable fact that by OECD standards we have an exceptionally centralised State, with central Government accounting not only for a very high proportion of total national spending but for total public expenditure.  A major OECD survey published at the end of September pointed out that of the 22 countries surveyed we gave least autonomy to local authorities to make financial and other decisions.  The high level of centralisation damages decision-making by public representatives and civil servants alike, while it places an enormous strain on the metropolitan area.  In 1926 Dublin city and county had a population of 17 per cent of the total population and today it has a population of more than 30 per cent of the total population.  The European average for a population in a metropolitan area is 20 per cent.  The headquarters of only five out of 80 Government Departments and State bodies are located outside of Dublin.  The National Economic and Social Council have pointed out that the services sector, which is forecast to provide the bulk of jobs in the future, is now located disproportionately in Dublin and they have warned that this situation will continue unless the centralisation trend is reversed.</P>
      <P>This was the situation we addressed in 1980 when we started to implement plans for decentralising the Civil Service.  The Coalition Government undid our work, ignoring the valid socio-economic arguments in favour of regional development and administrative decentralisation.  The Government ignored the fact that centralisation can be successfully reversed as shown in other countries such as Sweden and France who implemented measures which arrested the drift of population towards metropolitan areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Coalition's ill will and indifference towards decentralisation is destructive <Col N="1753" /> when one considers that the most successful countries, the U.S., Canada, Australia, West Germany and Sweden all organise decision-making at a relatively decentralised level.  The centralised nature of our bureaucracy is reflected in the failure of the Coalition to devise integrated regional development programmes to exploit the available money in EC aid.  In this way EC money which could be used to fund local development potential, especially in small and medium-sized enterprises and local job creating initiatives, is not being taken up. Recently there was a proposal from the Government for the restructuring of the health boards on an even more centralised basis.  This marks a further effort by the Government to concentrate power at the centre at the expense of local peripheral areas and a further erosion of people's rights to representation at local level.</P>
    <P>I also wish to refer to the proposed location of a new dental school in Dublin. I do not object to its provision&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnJRyan" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle John J. Ryan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>I am referring to decentralisation and I am merely making a passing reference to the hospital.  I know a new dental hospital is required in Dublin but the Government should have taken note of the report of the Committee of Public Accounts.  It is a threat to the future of the Cork Dental School and displays a deplorable insensitivity to the ravaged economy of Cork city and the sufferings endured by Corkonians over the past four years.  This side of the House are well aware that centralisation of decision making has contributed to a stifling of enterprise and initiative as well as a failure to devise a coherent regional policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Supplementary Estimate is principally for the purchase of Agriculture House and I do not object to that because these buildings should be the property of the State rather than the State paying <Col N="1754" /> enormous rents.  However, it is a pity that the money sought &mdash; £12 million &mdash; could not be put to better use by decentralising many activities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>We are frustrated with the failure of the Government to provide adequate finance in any of the areas of public service, especially in the Office of Public Works.  I welcome the decision of the Government to purchase Agriculture House and I cannot understand why it was not purchased initially.  It is a sound investment to put capital into bricks and mortar.  It was a tragedy that the Royal Hibernian Hotel, with the same architectural facade of the Dáil, was knocked down instead of being acquired to provide more office space in close proximity to Dáil Éireann so that we could give a better service to our constituents. Indeed, private developers took it over and its architectural qualities have been lost.  There is a modern office block in its place.</P>
      <P>Under subhead F1, maintenance and supplies, there is a major shortfall as the type of maintenance needed in rural areas under the arterial drainage scheme is not being done.  As a result of a Government review notified to me by the Minister for Finance, it was decided that a review of arterial drainage policy should be carried out and that a report should be prepared and submitted to the Government.  My information is that this report has been forwarded to the Government and has been on the desk of a Minister &mdash; if not the Taoiseach &mdash; for the past six or eight months.  No action has been taken on the report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the west the Shannon has destroyed thousands of acres of land.  I raised this matter on a number of occasions and, indeed, the Minister of State &mdash; for which I thank her &mdash; supplied me with figures on 4 March last which indicated the average monthly ordnance data figure for the level of water on the Shannon in 1985. As Ardnacrusha provides 4 per cent of the nation's electricity supplies, there is no reason for the level of water on the Shannon at the various locks being retained at their present very high levels.  The <Col N="1755" /> Minister of State made various visits to the west.  She was in my constituency recently looking at various projects but I did not hear of any positive decision having been made as a result.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture and his Minister of State have consistently given commitments that they would set up a Shannon drainage authority but that has not been done.  Why give commitments and do nothing?  We should ensure that the various locks, particularly Victoria Lock, are removed or that the levels at least reduced on a more permanent basis to alleviate flooding which has destroyed thousands of acres of land in south east Galway in Woodford, Rossmore, Portumna and right down to the banks of the Suck and to Ballinasloe as well as on the other side of the river right up to Athlone.</P>
    <P>Vast amounts of money are expended by the Department of Justice on permanent Garda security at these locks in case some frustrated person might decide to remove them.  It is sad that money has to be expended on this instead of the Office of Public Works and various Ministers honouring their commitments by ensuring that progress is made in providing employment.</P>
    <P>The same applies to the Dunkellin River.  Why did the Minister of State visit my constituency recently?  She looked at old monuments and graveyards but gave no commitment in regard to Portumna Castle which would give employment to 40 or 50 people for five years&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In my county people who have been employed since the fifties recently got redundancy notices from the Office of Public Works which is under the control of the Minister of State.  They are employed by the OPW on arterial drainage and maintenance and are being let go.  We have appealed to the Minister and to the Office of Public Works to transfer those people and their expertise to working on the Dunkellin River.  That is relevant to the Estimate.  Those people at 60 years of age have tremendous professional experience in arterial drainage and maintenance and their services could be utilised.  We have lost vast sums of money in Europe through the reduction in quotas because the productivity levels in the west have not been up to a sufficient standard to ensure that such quotas would be made available to them.  The Minister, the Minister of State and the Government have constantly cut back on the amount of revenue to the Office of Public Works.</P>
      <P>There is no point in having cutbacks right across the board and spending money on capital investment when it should be spent in areas of greatest need. No justification has been given for the decisions which have been made.  Consequently, the taxpayer has to carry the brunt.  The Minister talked about the additional sums required under subhead F5 for essential maintenance work at Galway courthouse.  As Chairman of Galway County Council, I want to say that is not our responsibility.  It is the responsibility of Galway Corporation.  It is sad when the Judiciary have to say they are not prepared to hold their court in cold dilapidated courthouses because they are not being maintained.  The reason for this is because the Government have not given the necessary finance to local authorities to upgrade and preserve the courthouses.</P>

One major area of reform would be if the Office of Public Works were to accept they have a responsibility and a duty to upgrade courthouses and ensure that local authorities are not to be saddled with this responsibility.  In 1986 Galway County Council received a net increase for all works of £7,000.  How can we or our sister organisation, Galway Corporation, be expected to maintain courthouses when we receive only that increase?  Urgent work is required on the Islands river, the Nanny river, the Dunkellin river and the Shannon.  Urgent work is needed in Tuam where the farm development service are operating under terrible conditions.</P>

Dublin County Council have purchased a very fine property in the town of Swords, namely, Swords Castle.  We have been requesting the co-operation of the Office of Public Works as this is a protected building and rightly so as it is a national monument. Dublin County Council have money in their Estimate this year to spent on a survey to be carried out in the Swords Castle area but we have been informed that the delay in sanctioning the necessary official to supervise this work is because of the lack of funds.  I should like the Minister to assure us that this revised Estimate for additional funding is going to allow the necessary survey work to be carried out&mdash;&mdash;</P>

People are working in conditions which are in breach of the guidelines laid down by the Department of Labour under the office conditions.

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the Chair for giving me permission to <Col N="1762" /> raise this matter.  On 22 October I tabled a number of questions to the Minister for Energy asking when work would commence on the extension of the natural gas pipeline and his reply was:</P>
      <P>The prospects for an extension of the gas supply network to centres in the Border region are very much dependent on the economic viability of such projects, taking into account the availability of European regional development funding under EC Regulation 3627/85.  Until the necessary evaluation and planning work is completed, I am not in a position to comment on a supply to particular centres or on the timescale for such projects.</P>
      <P>I am seriously concerned about the delay in getting this project under way.  We have been trying to ensure that the evaluation was carried out quickly.  All local organisations are prepared to give the assistance necessary to An Bord Gáis in the carrying out of that evaluation.</P>
      <P>We have been involved in that work since Mr. Rickard H. Deasy, head of the financial service of the Economic and Social Committee of the EC presented a paper at a conference of the Gas Association of Ireland in Dublin on 9 October 1983.  On that occasion he said the EC had a particular interest in the improvement of the economic and social situation of the Irish Border areas.  In 1980 it adopted, according to him, a regional development measure &mdash; 2619/80 &mdash; providing support for investment mainly in the tourist sector.  He said that the &ldquo;Irish Border Areas Report&rdquo; was adopted in December 1983 and published in early 1984.  That report recommended broadening EC support to cover communications, industry, small business, tourism, agriculture and the improvement of rural towns.  It also supported the concept of a North-South gas link, specifically recommending a distribution network which would take in Dundalk, Newry and other towns in the region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mr. Deasy produced a map at that conference showing the possible natural gas routes.  One route was to Northern <Col N="1763" /> Ireland but that proposal fell by the wayside. There was to be a spur from Dundalk to Monaghan and a separate one from south Monaghan to Cavan, on to Ballinamore and to Sligo.</P>
    <P>Following that conference I tabled a question asking the Minister for Energy, in view of the statement at the conference regarding grant-aid to extend natural gas to Border counties, if he would expedite commencement of work on the project. His reply to that question, on 23 October 1985, was to the effect that the possibility of securing special EC funding for the supply of natural gas to the north-east, including areas in County Louth and in other Border counties, had been under discussion for some time.  The Minister said that the viability of gas projects in those areas was a primary consideration and the availability of such funding would be an important factor.  He said that the EC aid proposal for a north-east gas programme was being considered as one element of a community regional aid package.  While he was hopeful of a successful outcome, the overall package had yet to be approved by the EC Council of Ministers.  Accordingly, it would be premature for him to comment further.</P>
    <P>The EC Council regulation, No. 3637/85, was made on 17 December 1985. It states:</P>
    <P>The specific measure shall apply to the following Border areas:</P>
    <P>(a) Ireland: the counties of Donegal, Leitrim, Cavan, Monaghan, Louth and Sligo;</P>
    <P>(b) Northern Ireland, with the exception of the Belfast urban area.</P>
    <P>The regulation stated:</P>
    <P>Whereas the natural gas supply and consumption in some of these areas located in Ireland could, while enabling the economic development base of these areas to be reinforced, contribute to the realisation of Community energy policy objectives by reducing dependence on oil by increasing security of energy supply through diversification of energy resources, and <Col N="1764" /> by improving the balance of trade of the member state concerned.</P>
    <P>The regulation stated that money would be available for consultancy and technical assistance and added:</P>
    <P>... making available to industrial and service activities, with a view to facilitating adaptation to natural gas and encouraging exploitation of new products and process possibilities, technical assistance and services in the following fields:</P>
    <P>(a) assessment of the technical implications and benefits and costs of conversion to natural gas;</P>
    <P>(b) identification of new products and processes dependent on natural gas;</P>
    <P>(c) analysis of market potential for existing and new products linked to the use of natural gas;</P>
    <P>(d) identification, acquisition and transfer of technology aiming at new high performance of natural gas.</P>
    <P>It appeared from that that the way was clear for an investigation and assessment of the area.  There was a lot of goodwill for the project and it appeared that assistance would be made available.  We were concerned that the project should proceed. That supply should be made available to Monaghan and Cavan and other areas here and we should not allow the reneging by the British Government on a commitment to ruin the project.  A decision by the Government to proceed with the gas main would amount to a vote of confidence by them in the Border areas.</P>
    <P>Early in 1986 Bord Gáis Éireann inserted a number of advertisements in newspapers identifying the towns scheduled to receive a gas supply.  In the early advertisements Dundalk was mentioned but later it was withdrawn.  Many groups in our area are anxious for the extension of the gas supply to the region, including the regional development organisation that caters for Louth, Cavan and Monaghan. That organisation asked the marketing manager of BGE, Mr. Lincoln, to address a meeting of the board <Col N="1765" /> on the background to the proposal to extend the natural gas network to the north-east region and Border counties.</P>
    <P>He explained the role of BGE in the supply and distribution of natural gas. He confirmed that market research and technical studies were undertaken by BGE in the region and that these formed an important part of the submission he proposed to make to the Department of Energy for consideration and inclusion in the overall project programme.  Mr. Lincoln explained that, if the project was to proceed and be funded in 1987, it was important that a decision was reached quickly.  He contended that if it was not submitted by October or November this year there was a poor chance of its being funded.  The assessment and examination were carried out during 1986 and at the September meeting the director of NERDO stated that it was a matter of urgency that the date should be met.</P>
    <P>In a telephone conversation the director had with NERDO it was confirmed that the examination was ongoing and that the project had not been cleared for submission to the EC in accordance with Regulation 3637 of 1985.  The members expressed surprise that the project had not been forwarded to the EC and were concerned at the delay in the Department. At the following meeting on 7 October, two months later, they were given the same story.  They were told it had not been completely evaluated and that there would have to be a further examination carried out.</P>
    <P>Will we lose out as a result?  We were told the preliminary studies had been carried out and it was reported in the newspaper that Dundalk Gas were very interested in BGE supplying them with gas.  They spoke in terms of having in excess of 30 miles of mains in Dundalk which could be adapted for natural gas at a low cost.  There are many potential consumers in the area.  For example, there are a number of processing plants involved with poultry, beef and pigs and it is also an intensive mushroom growing area.  Intensive heat is essential for this industry.  Many industries in Dundalk would avail of this.  It is very hard to <Col N="1766" /> understand the reason for the delay.  I suggested 12 months ago at county council meetings that people from the youth employment scheme could carry out an evaluation and get the opinions of different firms.  No evaluation has yet been carried out.</P>
    <P>The amount of money which has been approved of under the EC Regulation is £23 million.  That has to be matched pound for pound.  It is great value for money.  We had expected the project to be submitted to the EC in the autumn of this year so that it could be put in train in 1987.  A lot of lip service is paid to this area.  The Department would be well advised to avail of the EC funding while it is available.  Much employment could be generated through this project.  If gas at a reasonable price was available to people in the area it might act as an incentive for them to set up different projects.</P>
    <P>The subject of import substitution in regard to fruit and vegetables was discussed at ACOT meetings.  On the east coast and in north County Dublin glass-houses were closed because growers were unable to compete with the Dutch growers who are heavily subsidised.  They receive a subsidy for oil, thermal screens and so on.  They have taken over the tomato market.  ACOT drew up a plan for 1986-1990 and recommended that 40 additional acres be used for growing tomatoes under glass.  ACOT drew up that corporate plan with a selective crop expansion.  They zoned the country and planned for the production to be in Leinster and Munster.  They forgot about the northern and western counties.</P>
    <P>One objective in the plan was planning and zoning production; another was maximising technical efficiency and upgrading product quality.  They recommended 40 acres for tomatoes, nursery stock, cauliflowers and so on.  I greatly resented this and made it clear at many meetings. People in this area have shown great initiative in starting up mushroom growing and so on without any great energy resource.  Is there any real commitment for the project?</P>
    <P>It is proposed that Nitrigin Éireann <Col N="1767" /> would have a stake in ICI.  Under the proposed terms Nitrigin Éireann would have a 51 per cent stake in the new company and continue to buy natural gas from the State at favourable rates.</P>
    <P>We have an international company coming into this country setting up with an Irish company which unfortunately had not the luck or success which many of us hoped it would have in the early years and is only now coming into profitability since 1976.  An international company enjoins us to avail of the natural gas from the State at favourable rates.  I hope the Minister will make provision even at this late stage, before 1987, so that this extension can be availed of.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister of Health (Mr. B. Desmond) Minister of Health (Mr. B. Desmond)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of Health (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am replying on behalf of the Minister for Energy.  In December 1985 the EC Council of Ministers approved a regulation providing for a Community regional aid instrument aimed at improving the economic and social situation of the Border counties of Ireland and Northern Ireland.  This provided for development measures for tourism, industry and natural gas infrastructure.  Altogether about £23 million is available for implemtenting the measures in Ireland.  Of this £18 million is earmarked for infrastructural development.  The scope of the regulation, as is known, extends to Counties Louth, Monaghan, Cavan, Leitrim, Sligo and Donegal.</P>
      <P>The regulation supplements a previous 1980 regulation under the Non-Quota Section of the EC Regional Fund, which was designed to strengthen the economic base in Border areas.  Funds, as we recall, from the 1980 scheme were used here to promote tourism in Border counties.</P>
      <P>The inclusion in the EC Regulation of the provisions relating to natural gas infrastructure recognised that the economic development of the region could be reinforced by a supply of natural gas and that this would contribute to the realisation of Community energy policy objectives by reducing dependence on oil and by increasing security of supply through diversification of energy resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1768" /> At no time, however, was it ever intended that a gas project would be initiated unless it could achieve an adequate economic return and this is clearly stated in the EC Regulation.  It would not be sensible to invest heavily in pipelines and other hardware unless the projects were viable, taking account of the EC funds.  The availability of EC funding improves the economics of projects, but does not automatically make them viable.  It must be remembered that the EC contribution must be at least matched by our contribution.  It makes no sense for us to spend scarce resources simply to attract EC money.  The projects, as I have said, must be justified in their own right.</P>
    <P>Since the proposals were first mooted, the world energy scene has changed quite dramatically.  The decline in crude oil prices and in the price of oil products within the last year had a major impact on world economies.  I do not think anyone would argue that the overall impact of the fall in oil prices on Ireland's economy has been anything but positive.  Nevertheless there is a down-side for countries which have an indigenous source of energy and we have Irish natural gas. This competes directly with oil.  The price to be got for natural gas is related to oil prices and has followed the downward oil price trend.  Energy price movements since the EC Regulation was adopted have had an adverse effect on the economics of the gas project which was originally envisaged.</P>
    <P>I should point out that gas selling prices are related to oil by a formula.  While selling prices have come down, costs have not decreased commensurately, if at all. The margin between revenues and costs has decreased accordingly and this is at the heart of the difficulty raised by the Department of Energy in analysing the project proposals.  Further consideration of the issues is currently under way.  I can assure the Deputy of that.</P>
    <P>It is our intention to maximise the gas element of the programme.  I should point out that the regulation covers tourism and industry, as well as natural gas subject to viability.  As a first step, BGE were <Col N="1769" /> requested to prepare a draft programme to see what was possible on the gas infrastructure side.  Their proposals were received by the Department of Energy some time ago and have been the subject of ongoing clarification and evaluation since then.</P>
    <P>It has always been recognised that the economics of the project were marginal and this has been exacerbated due to the fall in oil pices.  Since the original BGE proposal, there has been another change in that the recent Supreme Court decision has limited the annual quantity of gas which is available to BGE.  We have to recognise now that allocating gas to any new customer, in effect, means reducing the allocation to some existing customers.</P>
    <P>It must be recognised at this stage that it might not be viable to bring gas to all the Border county areas.  An attempt is being made, however, to balance the distribution of the programme benefits by relying more on the non-gas elements of the programme.  There are ongoing discussions between the Department of Energy, the Department of Finance and the EC Commission for this purpose. Other Departments and State-sponsored bodies will be involved as appropriate.</P>
    <P>As regards the Northern Ireland Companion Regulation, the option of gas infrastructure development is, of course, not available there.  I understand that, for their part, the Northern Ireland authorities intend submitting a programme comprised of industrial development aids.</P>
    <P>I must point out that the internal procedures of the Commission require that the restrictive programmes are approved by the Regional Fund Committee.  This committee meet three times a year and the earliest meeting at which an Irish programme could be approved is next March.  This does not mean that any of the EC funds are at risk.  When the issue of project viability has been resolved, the Government can approve the programme and initiate work in advance of formal Regional Fund Committee approval.  The programme has a five-year life and retrospective approval can be <Col N="1770" /> given for work carried out since last December.</P>
    <P>In his original question to the Minister, Deputy Leonard sought an assurance &ldquo;that the sale of natural gas at exceptionally low rates of charge to NET will not put at risk the extension of the gas main to Dundalk and the Border areas&rdquo;. Let me say, first, that I do not accept the terminology used by the Deputy when he refers to exceptionally low rates of charge.  He seems to imply that the price to NET is unfair or unjustified in some way.  That is simply not so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. J. Leonard Mr. J. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I said favourable terms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to dwell on this particular aspect of the question since the gas is supplied on the basis of a confidential commercial contract agreed between BGE and NET in 1976.  The price which NET pay is calculated on the basis of a pricing formula provided for in that contract.  The contract was negotiated at a time when the principal users identified in the market were the ESB and NET.  This reflects the historical reality that the Kinsale Head gas field could not be developed without an established market.  At the time the ESB and NET provided that market.</P>
      <P>I wish to assure the Deputy that it is Government policy to consider all proposals for extension of the natural gas system on their own merits.  The terms of supply to existing customers have no direct bearing on this evaluation.  The supply of natural gas is justified only where it is economically viable, taking account of the capital cost to be incurred in supplying gas and the likely volume of sales and prices achievable.</P>
      <P>I must add that it cannot be assumed that the extension of gas supply to the Border regions is more economic than meeting the needs of BGE's existing customers, taking account of the capital costs involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In conclusion, I wish to state that the analysis of the gas projects within the Department of Energy is now nearing completion and I understand that the <Col N="1771" /> Minister for Energy hopes to be in a position to take the proposals direct to the Government in the very near future.</P>

      <P>The preparation of Ireland's contribution to the Australian Bicentennial celebrations in 1988 is now under way.  In May of this year, the Irish-Australian Bicentennial Committee was established, under my chairmanship, to draw up a programme of official projects to mark the Bicentenary and to promote and coordinate national Bicentenary activities generally.  Three meetings of the committee have been held to date.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1717" /> Already a new history of the Irish in Australia has been published as part of our participation in the Bicentenary. That history, by Professor Patrick O'Farrell of the University of Sydney was launched by Prime Minister Mr. Bob Hawke at a ceremony on 15 October.</P>
    <P>The committee has begun consideration of a number of specific proposals for the Bicentenary including the presentation to Australia of a microfilmed copy of the large collection of documents about the transportation of convict prisoners for the period 1788 to 1853 which are housed in the State Paper Office in Dublin Castle.  Other proposals being considered include exhibitions and events of broader cultural interest which will reflect the massive contribution made by our people to Australia's development over two centuries.  The committee is also anxious to generate as much voluntary effort as possible.  To that end, an extensive range of Irish organisations have been asked to get in touch with their Australian counterparts with a view to co-operation on Bicentennial projects. The initial response to this idea has been very satisfactory.</P>
    <P>The committee hopes that as many Australians as possible will visit Ireland in connection with the Bicentenary and consideration is now being given as to how best to develop this aspect of the Bicentenary.  It is to be noted, for example, that the Bicentenary coincides with the Dublin Millenium in 1988 and Prime Minister Hawke has already indicated that he wishes to have Australia associated with those celebrations.</P>

      <P>One of the primary aims of the <Col N="1718" /> Department of Foreign Affairs is to assist in the promotion of Ireland's economic interests abroad especially through the promotion of foreign earnings.  The concept of foreign earnings embraces both the attraction of foreign investment to Ireland and the development of foreign markets for the export of goods and services.</P>
      <P>The kind of activities engaged in by our diplomatic and consular missions includes for example, market research, assistance to visiting Irish exporters, support for trade missions, and such other appropriate assistance as might be required in specific circumstances on behalf of Irish companies.  Where necessary, diplomatic missions are also involved in discussions at government to government level.</P>
      <P>The way in which this important work is conducted varies according to the different conditions and circumstances prevailing in various foreign countries. All embassies and consulates are actively engaged in the promotion of our economic interests but the extent of a particular mission's involvement is largely dependent on whether the relevant semi-State bodies have offices or not in the area covered by the diplomatic mission. Where semi-State bodies such as CTT, IDA, Bord Fáilte, Aer Lingus, CBF etc. are directly represented through resident offices, embassies support and complement their work.  Irish consulates general are fully involved in the promotional process and are under the control of the ambassador who is accredited either on a resident or non-resident basis to the country in question.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of roads which are not in public ownership, certain local authorities may contribute to the cost of works on these roads under the local improvements scheme.  This scheme applies to farm road projects eligible for EC aid under the western package. Under the legislation governing the local improvements scheme, the roads, when constructed or improved must be used as a means of access to two or more parcels of land (owned or occupied by different <Col N="1722" /> persons) or serve the public.  The cost involved is met from Exchequer grants and contributions from the beneficiaries. The 1986 Exchequer provision for the scheme of £2.15 million has been fully allocated.</P>
    <P>The administration of the local improvements scheme, including the selection of projects and the allocation of the Exchequer funds notified by the Department, is a matter for the county councils.  Subject to compliance with the above requirements, it is open to local authorities to select for improvement farm roads-bridges damaged in the recent flooding.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed injury benefit from 12 June 1985 in respect of an incapacity from an alleged accident at work on 26 May 1985.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1732" /> Pending investigations, disability benefit was paid on an interim basis from 15 June, the fourth day of incapacity. Investigation by the social welfare officer who interviewed the claimant, the employers and a witness failed to confirm the accident at work.  It was not accepted that an occupational accident giving rise to the incapacity had happened and the claim was disallowed accordingly on 30 April 1986.</P>
    <P>The claimant appealed against the decision and an oral hearing of the appeal was held on 24 September 1986 which was attended by the claimant, employers' representatives and a person nominated by the claimant as a witness to the alleged accident.  Following the hearing the appeals officer confirmed the decision rejecting the claim to injury benefit.  It is open to the claimant to furnish any contentions of mistakes made in relation to the law or the facts in the case to the chief appeals officer when the decision would be reviewed or to appeal to the High Court on a question of law.</P>
    <P>Meanwhile the claim has been treated as a claim to disability benefit which has been paid to the date of the latest medical certificate received.  Arrangements have been made for payments each week on receipt of medical certificates by the month while the claimant remains unfit for work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Dukes)</NameTxt>
      <P>I want first of all to make two points which were emphasised in reply to previous Parliamentary Questions on this general topic &mdash; one which I answered on 1 July 1986 and the other which my predecessor answered on 19 November 1985.  The first point is that the matter of providing an adequate television signal in any particular area is the responsibility of RTE and secondly that the radio equipment and transmission channels being used by the gardaí meet with the approval of the appropriate licensing authority. However, I understand that in certain areas where there is a weak TV signal Garda transmissions can contribute to problems of TV reception.  The Garda authorities have taken part in discussions with RTE on the matter and are willing to co-operate in any way open to them. As a gesture of goodwill the Garda have in a number of cases supplied and fitted filters where this contributed to a solution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some months ago all cases of this nature that had come to Garda notice <Col N="1735" /> had been dealt with and the technical advice available to the Garda suggested that the further supply of filters by the Garda would not be justified.  More recently, however, some new complaints were received and a decision was taken some weeks ago that for the time being the arrangements for the supply of filters would be resumed though there may be some delay in obtaining a further stock. I should again stress, however, that this does not imply a continuing commitment to provide this service as the Garda Síochána do not accept that responsibility for the problem is primarily with them and they continue to be in touch with RTE in relation to the matter generally.</P>
