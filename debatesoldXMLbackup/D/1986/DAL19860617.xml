    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Communications if he will outline the financial contribution made by Telecom Éireann to the Exchequer since the vesting day in 1984 and the expected contribution agreed up to 1989.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Minister for Communications (Mr. J. Mitchell) Jim Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Communications (Mr. J. Mitchell)</NameTxt>
      <P>Payments into the Exchequer since vesting day amount to £192,858,534 including special payments of £104,425,000 under arrangements agreed <Col N="2" /> with the company.  In the period up to 1989 the company will make further payments totalling £130,325,623, including special payments of £103,702,767.</P>
      <P>The company will receive full credit for these special payments according as they are made, the payments being fully allowable in the capital balance for the purpose of calculating interest chargeable.  In addition after 1 December 1987, these payments will be allowable against interest payable.</P>
      <P>Essentially, the cash receipts from revenue arising from the Exchequer debt, payable over a 15 year period, have been condensed into a four year period with full allowance being given to the company for making the early payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister say if the present payments are in keeping with <Col N="3" /> the statements in the now discredited document, <i>Building on Reality 1985-87?</i> How do the figures compare?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The figures are largely in line with what was planned in the national plan.  A very amicable agreement has been reached with Bord Telecom Éireann to meet those targets by way of effective debt rescheduling or bringing forward debt repayments which turns out to be to the advantage of the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that Telecom Éireann had to resort to borrowing to support the Government's excessive demands on them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>On the contrary, Telecom Éireann are borrowing to repay debts.  They have been borrowing for the past two years which they were expected to do as part of the regime set out for them by this Government and by previous Governments.  All they are being asked to do is to reply that debt a bit earlier.  As it turns out, the schedule of debt repayments works out largely to the advantage of the company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it the Minister's case that these payments are not inhibiting development in the company?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that the developments in Telecom Éireann are very encouraging indeed.  The results for the past year, which will be published shortly, will show a significantly better result than was forecast. The portents at the moment are that the company will reach profitability much sooner than expected.  That is because of a number of factors, including volume growth, but it has also been helped by international developments in relation to exchange rates, interest rates and inflation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister state when he expects charges will be reduced as a result of the board's activities?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="4" />
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that charges are too high.  I have done everything possible in the past three and a half years since I became Minister to keep charges to an absolute minimum.  There have been only two increases and they were way below the rate of inflation as compared with the previous five years when there were very steep increases in telecommunications charges which at the time were justified because of the enormous investment by the State in the accelerated capital development programme. It is to be hoped, once the bulk of that investment has been made and the rewards are reaped from that very wise investment &mdash; my predecessors deserve credit for that &mdash; that we would get to a situation where we will have stability in telecommunications prices.  There have been some reductions this year in certain telecommunication charges.  I hope this will be seen as a welcome beginning.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Communications if he will outline the financial allocation made to An Post by him for current and capital expenditure since the vesting date in January, 1984.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>A grant of £5 million was paid to An Post in December 1984 for current expenditure purposes.  An allocation of £4 million, in the form of Exchequer equity, was also paid to the company in December 1985 as a contribution towards the capital expenditure programme of An Post for last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister indicate whether a capital allocation has been made for the sorting office project in Cork?  Is the Minister aware if there is a capital allocation to be made?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a separate question.  If the Deputy tables such a question and if it is in order, I will be delighted to answer it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it proposed to make a capital allocation to An Post in 1986 for <Col N="5" /> the development of post office buildings and sorting offices?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>No provision is made in the current year.  I am glad to report that An Post have a very good equity ratio and that it is well within their capabilities to borrow such funds as are necessary for their investment.  I hope to fund that borrowing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that in the annual report of An Post, dated 31 December 1985, their chairman stated that they were looking for a £3 million capital payment for 1986?  The Minister has reneged on the postal telecommunications legislation which allows for a total capital investment of £50 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to clarify that.  Deputy Leyden was Minister of State at my Department at the time.  When the figures for the total capital investment were provided for it was in keeping with the normal practice for semi-State companies.  This House from time to time is asked to fix ceilings on the amount of money which can be invested in semi-State companies.  That does not imply any commitment to invest that money either immediately or at any time in the future.  It is purely an enabling provision.  For instance, we are voting today on the B &amp; I Bill.  In that case the amount is £38 million.  That does not mean we are giving the B &amp; I £38 million or anything like it this year.  There has been much play made about that and unfounded expectations have resulted from the misunderstanding.  There was never any intention that I know of to invest £50 million immediately in An Post.  It is purely an enabling provision.</P>
      <P>In relation to the first part of the Deputy's question, An Post have recently put proposals to me regarding investment in the next few years.  Those proposals are being considered in my Department at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the document, <i>Building on Reality</i>, any credibility?  In that <Col N="6" /> document a sum of £3 million was promised in 1986.  Is <i>Building on Reality</i> now dead and gone?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That is another question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer is that there were figures set out in the plan. Plans have to be revised, in some cases upwards and in others downwards and have to be changed in the light of events. Substantially, the proposals, in <i>Building on Reality</i> are extant and very successful.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said my question was a separate question but since then he has indicated no financial allocations have been made for this year.  Is he confirming by that statement that there has been no capital allocation made for the sorting office in Cork?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>What I am saying is that there are no Exchequer funds being provided for capital purposes this year. It is within An Post's ability to borrow for such capital purposes.  As I said, they have a very healthy equity base and are in a good position to borrow for their capital needs.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the Minister's reference to the excellent borrowing capacity of An Post, is it his intention to fully guarantee all of that borrowing and, in his opinion, given An Post's present rate of progress and level of profitability, in approximately what year would he expect them to be standing alone as a semi-State company?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be disappointed if An Post do not break even this year.  I think they will.  They may make a small profit this year.  Certainly by next year I expect that An Post will be profitable.  I have every confidence that they will be in a position to stand on their own feet. Everyone would agree that the company, since they were vested, have shown particular flair and imagination for which everyone in An Post deserve credit.  I am glad to be able to report to the House that they are one of those companies who can stand alone and who do not need to be bailed out by the taxpayer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonalOrmonde" hpid="Dr. Ormonde Dr. Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Communications if, in view of the urgent necessity for an effective radio communications network to help improve maritime safety around the coast, a complete VHF network will be installed and commissioned as quickly as possible; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>11.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Communications if he has any proposals or plans to improve safety, navigational aids, and communication facilities in the coastal areas; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 and 11 together.</P>
      <P>Measures to improve the standards for safety of life at sea are kept under review by my Department and changes introduced from time to time as resources permit to reflect changes in international practice, technological change or to rectify deficiencies which have come to light.</P>
      <P>In recent years Ireland has ratified the two main safety conventions promoted by the International Maritime Organisation &mdash; the UN specialised agency responsible for safety at sea.  The conventions, which have been given full effect in domestic legislation, are the 1974 Convention on Safety of Life at Sea known as SOLAS which governs the safe construction and equipping of boats, and the Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers 1978 which governs the standards of the personnel who work on Irish ships.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the sea fishing industry, a useful recent innovation was the introduction in January 1985 of a requirement by my Department that candidates for certificates of competency for fishing vessels must first complete a basic sea survival course.  About 200 successful candidates have qualified since that time. On the communications front I fully recognise the valuable contribution which marine VHF communications facilities can make to improving the <Col N="9" /> safety of life at sea and considerable progress has in fact been made in recent years in this area.</P>
    <P>A VHF station was built in County Donegal and commissioned in 1983.  This station, which is remotely controlled from Malin Head Coast Radio Station, provides full cover from west of Tory Island along the northern coastline of Donegal, eastward and northward towards the Scottish coast.</P>
    <P>Two new VHF stations were commissioned early in 1985, one each in Counties Cork and Kerry.  The stations are remotely controlled from Valentia Coast Radio Station and between them provide distress, safety and public correspondence communications over an area of coastline stretching from Loop Head to Seven Heads near Kinsale.  In addition, a trial station has been brought into operation at Dublin Airport which provides for emergency and distress communications over the coast from Carlingford Lough to Wicklow Head.  Extension of the system to other areas in the State will be considered in the light of the financial resources available from time to time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I should begin by disclosing an interest in this matter.  With regard to the particular matter of a radio communications network could I ask the Minister would he not accept that such a network on the west coast in particular is absolutely essential from the point of view of maritime safety?  In fact it distresses me a little to hear him say &mdash; I think he used the words in this reply &mdash;&ldquo;make a contribution toward&rdquo;.  Would he not agree, if we are serious about marine safety, particularly in so far as our fishing fleet is concerned, that an adequate, complete and comprehensive radio network along the coast is essential?  Furthermore, would he agree that this matter has been very tragically underlined for us all by the frequency of tragedies which have occurred <i>vis-à-vis</i> our fishing fleet along that coast even in very recent times?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's interest in this matter is well known.  I certainly very much appreciate his comments in <Col N="10" /> relation to what is needed in this respect. He can be assured that there has been progress made in providing a radio communications network around the coast.  It would be my ambition that we reach a stage as soon as possible of having full coastal cover in radio communications. While I do not think there is any significant risk to safety at present it would be better that we have such a system. Certainly I share the Deputy's ambition that all of our coasts be covered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister has already done so and, if so, he might inform us but if he has not would he take an overview of this whole situation in regard to maritime safety?  In that connection many of us are deeply concerned at the decision taken by Irish Lights to de-man a number of lighthouses along that coast, to proceed with a programme of automation which will mean in effect that the west and south coasts will have no effective coastal watch.  This is related to the subject matter of Question No. 3 because all of these matters should be inter-related and considered together.  I ask the Minister to give us, if he can, some view on whether his Department are having a comprehensive look at all elements of a maritime safety programme &mdash; lighthouses, lifeboats, radio networks and so on.  The Minister might agree that the time for such a comprehensive review is now, particularly in view of this decision taken to de-man lighthouses, a decision which was taken on purely commercial grounds without any regard to its implications in a number of areas, particularly maritime safety?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure the Deputy is correct when he says that the decision in relation to the lighthouses was taken purely on commercial grounds.  Of course there were commercial considerations but I have no doubt that the Commissioners of Irish Lights are fully conscious of the safety requirements; indeed that is their very purpose in life. I am quite sure that anything they have done will in no way jeopardise safety at sea.  I wonder whether there is much <Col N="11" /> value in having a coastguard or coast watch of the type mentioned by the Deputy.  They do have such in some other countries, especially where there is a high volume of shipping close to the coast. We do not have that here.  It was never intended that the lighthouse men should be watchers.  Indeed, their visual range would not stretch very far so the area of sea covered by any such watch would be minimal.  Nonetheless, because the funding of Irish Lights has been reviewed recently and because its future administration is under review &mdash; because of those new funding arrangements &mdash; probably it is appropriate to consider the points raised by Deputy Haughey.  I can assure him that they will be considered in the light of that revised administration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the VHF network would the Minister agree that it is a matter of some urgency that the area between the Malin Head VHF area &mdash; which, as the Minister said, runs from West Donegal in a north eastern direction towards Scotland &mdash; and the southern VHF coverage, that dangerous area, particularly Mayo/Galway, along the west coast, should be covered because there has been a weakness obtaining there for some time?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>My aspiration would be to have the entire coast covered by radio communications in due course. Obviously we have to order priorities and pick the areas of our coasts where there is more business going on, where there may be more danger.  But my aspiration would be that we would have the entire coast covered in due course.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister does not appear to recognise the seriousness of the <Col N="12" /> circumstances we are highlighting here. Could he give us some indication of the expenditure in this area by his Department, for the current year?  Furthermore, would he say whether he has contact with the Minister for Fisheries because he must be aware that the Fisheries Consultative Sectoral Committee have recommended the immediate installation of a VHF network because of the danger to fishing boats in particular? Can the Minister satisfy us that further threats, such as the removal of the Decca signal, will not create a further hazard? The Minister must be aware that there have been various allegations to the effect that navigational aids have not been in operation?  Can he give us some indication of what inspections are carried out to ensure that such aids are fully operational and working effectively?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Communications if, in view of the summer holiday period, he will, at this time, outline procedures for bonding by travel agents; and if he will consider requiring such agents to give to each customer a simple written statement telling them how to proceed in the event of company failure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an offence for any person to trade as a travel agent or tour operator unless that person is the holder of a licence under the Transport (Tour Operators and Travel Agents) Act, 1982. One of the prerequisities for a licence is the production of a bond for the protection of persons who enter into overseas travel contracts with the licensee during the period of the licence.  In the case of travel agents, the required bonding level is 4 per cent of projected licensable turnover. There is a 10 per cent bonding requirement for tour operators.  The types of bonding permissible under the legislation include guarantees by banks or insurance companies and cash sums to be deposited with me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whenever a licensed travel firm fails to meet its obligations to its customers under overseas travel contracts, my Department activate the necessary rescue arrangements.  The usual procedure when a failure occurs is that my Department meet the travel firm concerned to get details of all customers whose travel arrangements are affected. Immediate steps are taken to ensure that any customers abroad at the time are enabled to complete their holidays or other travel arrangements without disruption. The situation in relation to customers due to travel shortly after the <Col N="14" /> collapse is also assessed and whenever possible, steps are taken to ensure that their travel and associated arrangements can proceed as planned.  An announcement is made to the news media as soon as possible &mdash; usually the same day as the collapse occurs but, in any event, in good time to ensure that those about to travel are informed of the arrangements being made on their behalf.  In addition, my Department make urgent contact with persons who are about to travel.  Contact is also made with persons due to travel at later dates.  In the administration of these arrangements, my Department have operated, where necessary, in close liaison with the Irish Travel Agents' Association and other interests.</P>
    <P>Since 1983, when the travel trade licensing/bonding scheme was introduced, the rescue arrangements have been administered on 13 occasions and 3,500 persons, who would otherwise have incurred losses, have benefited.  I am satisfied that the arrangements have been administered satisfactorily and, as the form of the arrangements depends on the particular circumstances of each case, I do not consider that there is a need to introduce the procedure proposed by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister happy that travellers are aware of their entitlements?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Every effort is made to ensure that travellers are aware of what is necessary.  The legislation requires that all travel agents and tour operators clearly advertise that they are covered by the Act and that they are bonded. Anyone who does business with travel agents or tour operators who are not bonded is very silly.  If my Department become aware of any illegal operators they take effective action as quickly as possible.  In cases of the collapse of tour operators or travel agents the provisions of the Act have been adhered to and I am not aware of any complaints being made by travellers.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister consider it desirable, in the interests of the travelling public, to place an advertisement in the newspapers say on 1 January each year or as near as possible to that date indicating the travel agents and tour operators who are bonded in accordance with the Act?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>A person may not be aware if a travel agent or tour operator is bonded.  Would it be possible for the Department of Communications to publish a list of officially bonded tour operators and travel agents once a year? If such a list appeared in the newspapers people would know the properly bonded tour operators and travel agents.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>That point can be considered. However, there is no adequate substitute for vigilance on the part of the public.  The public should be reminded to be vigilant and not do business with travel agents or tour operators who are not covered by bonding or the other provisions of the Act.  People are liable to end up losing money or being stranded abroad if they do business with other operators.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>No such application has been received.  RTE's capital allocation, which they finance internally or through commercial borrowing or leasing, is approved annually in the context of the public capital programme and on the basis of a general statement of proposed expenditure headings.  It is a matter for RTE to determine their detailed expenditure priorities, including expenditure on studio development, within the limits of their allocation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I put it to the Minister that he cannot but be dissatisfied with the fact that RTE have an excellent studio which is not fully equipped and therefore cannot be used.  This studio could be used in a number of ways, for example, it could be used for Teilifís Scoile programmes which RTE cannot at present do because of lack of funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a lot in what the Deputy says but it is very important that RTE maintain their financial house in order.  The studio was built at a time when, clearly, adequate consideration was not given to how the funds necessary for the construction of the studio would be raised and other funds found to equip the studio.  The first priority must be to ensure reasonable order in the finances of RTE.  The first step in that direction was taken with the appointment of the consultants.  The RTE Authority are now actively implementing their own plan on the basis of the consultants' report with a view to correcting any imbalances in their finances.  They are addressing a shortfall in the pension fund.  They are required to at least break even in each financial year.  I am sure RTE are anxious to use the studio and will do so as soon as they are in a position to equip it.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Communications if there are proposals from Aer Lingus to take over the operation of the Shanwick Radio Network, North Atlantic area; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>There are no proposals from Aer Lingus to take over the operation of the Shanwick Radio Network, North Atlantic area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJoeCosgrave" hpid="Mr. M. Cosgrave Mr. M. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that all aircraft using this air route to North America must pay for radio communications and, as this revenue is controlled from London, will the Minister take steps <Col N="29" /> to have it controlled by Aer Lingus or Aer Rianta?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>There is some misunderstanding in regard to this.  Neither Aer Lingus nor Aer Rianta have any role or responsibility for air communications. That is a matter for the Air Navigation Services Office of my Department.  It is true that there has been a co-operation agreement in existence for some years between Ireland and the United Kingdom under the aegis of the International Civil Aviation Organisation under which an area called Shanwick, an abbreviation for Shannon and Prestwick, across the North Atlantic is jointly controlled by ourselves and the British.  There is a certain role for Shannon at Ballygirreen and a role for Prestwick.  That system is under review to see whether it is the best arrangment for Ireland or whether an alternative arrangement would be better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJoeCosgrave" hpid="Mr. M. Cosgrave Mr. M. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>In the event of an international incident or emergency what say will Ireland have in the field of aircraft communications in that area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a worry I had when I discovered that the agreement between the British and ourselves provided that anything more than 200 miles from our coast was not under our direct control.  I wondered if in a national emergency access to Ireland could be cut off and because of that I opened discussions with the British with a view to drawing up an alternative plan.  Those discussions are nearing completion and I am considering alternative proposals which will specify certain routes that will not be controlled by any other sovereign State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Minister say that Shannon had the major controlling voice in Shanwick and that Prestwick played a minor role?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say that.  I said that Shannon has a certain role to play, as has Prestwick.  The effect of the arrangement is to give effective control <Col N="30" /> over the international air space, anything beyond 200 miles west of Ireland, to the British Civil Aviation Authority.  Therefore, access to this country is completely surrounded by air space control operated by the British aviation authority.  I did not think that was satisfactory and I asked that discussions be opened with the British to rearrange that.  Those discussions took place and I am considering new proposals which will provide for a national emergency and put certain aspects of air space under our direct control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Does that obtain on the south western approaches, in the Mount Gabriel catchment area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Mount Gabriel radar station was part of Eurocontrol but has reverted to the complete control and ownership of my Department.

      <P>RTE sought my approval recently to increase broadcasting hours to within the range 3,500 hours, maximum, and 3,000 hours, minimum, per year in order to broadcast an all-day service, Mondays to Fridays.

      <P>I have no doubt of the success of Cork Local Radio, but it would be wrong of me to make decisions on radio development piecemeal or in isolation.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Communications if he is aware of the concern of fishermen at the threatened withdrawal of Racal Decca from the operation of navigational stations and signals from United Kingdom stations which would seriously affect fishing activities in the north-west, the east coast and other fishing grounds; if he has discussed the matter with the UK authorities; the action he proposes to take; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Racal Decca, a private company, operate a marine navigation aid system &mdash; known as the Decca chain system &mdash; on a commercial basis.  The Decca chain works on the basis of transmissions from shore stations which may be picked up by receivers on board ship and which accurately determine position.  The Racal Decca Company rents receivers to users thus providing an income to run its stations and remunerate investment.</P>
      <P>The Irish Chain, known as 7D, is served by a Master Station at Renvyle, County Galway, and three slave stations at Ballydavid, Ardmore and Burtonport; these have been in operation since 1972-73 and cover the north, west and south coasts.  The stations are owned by Bord Iascaigh Mhara and operated by Racal Decca on their behalf.  Coverage on the east coast is provided from UK based stations.</P>
      <P>I am not aware that Racal Decca have threatened to withdraw from their services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister must be aware that the threat has been there for some time from the Racal Decca service in the UK.  This is creating a very special problem for Irish fishermen, expecially in the north west fishing area.  Has the Minister had any communication with the Minister for Fisheries on this issue?  The fishing industry are concerned about the problem and I find it unbelievable that the Minister does not know there is a very serious threat to the north west fisheries <Col N="35" /> with possible serious consequences for the fishing fleet.</P>

The Minister must admit it is very disappointing that after three-and-a-half years in Government the Bill dealing with local radio has not been passed by this House.  It was first debated on 5 July 1985 but progress <Col N="37" /> has not been made in the matter.

It is true in the absence of any progress with regard to the legislation that it is difficult to know how much extra work the commission can do in the future unless we make progress in the matter.  With regard to Deputy Leyden's assertion that the Interim Local Radio Commission are a smokescreen to protect the Minister against criticism, that is not so.  The commission have been doing useful work.  I think criticism of the Minister in this case is justified because I have not been able to get through legislation that meets with the approval of the House and I consider I have failed in that regard.  However, I continue to try.  Equally, I am determined not to bring proposals before the House, or to accept proposals, that I do not consider would be in the long-term interests of broadcasting.

      <P>I am accepting the ruling of the Chair but I wish to know if there is any mechanism whereby the Chair could let the Minister know the situation, in view of the fact that we will be discussing that Bill in the House tomorrow and I may be able to get a reply from the Minister to the questions when he is winding up Second Stage.</P>

        <i>The Irish Press</i> of 2 June carried a statement by the Minister that Aer Lingus would have to attract outside investment to finance a substantial part of fleet replacement.  Is that still the Minister's view?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>That article did not quote the Minister accurately.  It is well known that Aer Lingus are facing into a decade of very substantial investment.  In answer to a question if the State would be meeting these sums, I could not say yes because these matters have not yet come before the Government and before they come before the Government, they will need very careful consideration.  I was not prepared to exclude any possibility because it is important that we make the best decision in the interests of Aer Lingus and that we do not close off any avenue which might help Aer Lingus grow in the future.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister developing the economic philosophy of the British Tory Government, who have been selling off British Telecom and are trying, and finding it difficult, to sell British Airways? Are these sentiments coming from that economic philosophy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Absolutely not.  I know Deputy Wilson is capable of thinking in other than the straight lines his question suggests.  The only motivation for considering any proposals in relation to Aer Lingus will be in the best interests of Aer Lingus.  They will not be motivated for good or ill, positively or negatively, by ideological considerations of the sort mentioned by Deputy Wilson.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of possibilities.  The Deputy can take it that all possible avenues will be explored by the board of Aer Lingus and by my Department before decisions are made to the Government, who in turn, I am confident will give every consideration to those different possibilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister distinguish between two forms of leasing: first, where Aer Lingus would eventually end up owning the aeroplanes and, second, where the aeroplanes would revert to the lessors?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The different options are called lease purchasing and against leasing and there are costs involved in those options.  Other options are direct purchase of new aircraft, direct purchase of fairly new secondhand aircraft, lease purchasing of secondhand aircraft, lease purchasing of new aircraft, or the leasing of those aircraft.  Another factor is the timing of the decisions which may be affected by circumstances outside our control, for instance, the noise regulations which may or may not be adopted <Col N="43" /> by other administrations; that could influence the timing of decisions in relation to Aer Lingus and might bring forward the timescale for the replacement of the aviation fleet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask a question about the noise levels in a moment but, arising out of the Minister's reply to my question on leasing, does he see any implications for employment in Airmotive in the leasing of aircraft as distinct from the purchase of aircraft?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I really do not know, because it would be hard for me to link the two at this stage.  Obviously all factors, such as the spin-off benefits to Aer Lingus or to any of their subsidiary companies, would be considered as part of the package but as of now, it would be mere speculation on my part to see benefits for any other company&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that there are fears among the people employed by Airmotive that if the exercise of straight leasing is indulged in there may be danger to those workers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Very often people have fears which are unfounded, and sometimes people do not fear the obvious.  At the moment the Aer Lingus group are doing well.  I do not see any fear for them or for any of their subsidiary companies at this stage provided they continue to improve on their profit margin.  That is very necessary if they are to be in a position to fund the fleet's replacement programme.</P>

I want to suggest on this Stage as I did on Second Stage that the terms of reference of SFADCo, after this Bill has been put through the Oireachtas, will not be mitigated or diluted in any way, that the terms of reference will be as the company have been operating since they were set up in 1959, strengthened somewhat by the 1983 Act in terms of moneys being available to them for grant aid and so forth.

    <Speaker pid="NedOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. E. O'Keeffe Mr. E. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amending Bill in general, as I had not an opportunity to speak on it.  SFADCo have been a very fine development in the mid-western region and have done tremendous work.  This House owes a great tribute to them for what they have done for this region.</P>
      <P>One of the difficulties is that it is only three years since we last had a Bill before the House, which again was enabling legislation, to increase the funding and capital for that company.  Like other State agencies they should have a free hand in having enough capital available to develop all the areas they are considering. One such area of which they are making an excellent job is food technology and processing which has a great deal going for it because of our natural resources, but they should be able to plan over a five year period.  They should have something like a five year plan of development. When they are restricted in their capital base there is very little opportunity to do long term planning.  Since their foundation enabling legislation has been brought before this House for capital funding and that must have been an impediment to the progress of the company. In the political area necessary legislation can be quite slow in coming forward for one reason or another, and I suppose all sides of this House can take the blame for that.  Very often more presing problems come before us and consequently such legislation may be left for some time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Food processing and technology are a new development for SFADCo who will need a huge injection of capital for this. SFADCo are pioneering research and development in this area and I am not satisfied that the funding being made available will be adequate to do that job. They have a huge programme of work to undertake.  Deputy Hegarty who is the Minister of State with responsibility for <Col N="128" /> food has been making enormous strides in trying to get this area developed and we in the Cork area are following closely the research and development work in SFADCo.  We have a great deal to learn and to achieve from their work.  They have a market on their doorstep of which they can take advantage in the whole area of quality and quality presentation through the Shannon Free Airport and the trans-Atlantic service.</P>
    <P>Americans have been taking a liking to Irish food and foodstuffs from the point of view of taste and quality.  We have a potential to produce foodstuffs that are pure and uncontaminated.  Production is not very intensive and that is good in these days of modern technology in agriculture across Europe.  We have a climate which suits production of certain foods.  I am convinced that the development in the food area under SFADCo is realistic.  I would like to see more brand image development.  That is one area where we have fallen down.  I do not want to deviate too much from the Bill, but we should have more brands rather than one national brand.  That will be helpful to our food processing industry and has been successful in other countries.  I would like to get the Minister's view on those two points.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree generally with what Deputy O'Keeffe had to say.  Let me point out that the increase we envisage is adequate for the purpose.  It concerns mostly buildings and that sort of thing. The next review will be in 1990.  It is felt generally that this increase is more than enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are trying here this evening to do what we have been doing over the years, to afford the Oireachtas an opportunity to review regularly the affairs of the company. We have had meetings with the SFADCo people and we are not aware of any complaints from them.  We have these regular reviews.  I am sure both sides of the House welcome the initiative by SFADCo on the food scene.  As a matter of fact, I have often felt this area was lacking in our agri business.  We can <Col N="129" /> see what happens in many of our supermarkets. We see new types of cheeses and other food products.  How does one get them initiated here?  The commercial people are not too keen, perhaps rightly. Perhaps too much of a gamble is involved. Therefore, we need somebody like SFADCo to manufacture and fabricate a product and have its markets tested and then when it is commercial, to roll it, so to speak.  We think £130 million is adequate, and I think the House will agree with that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 2 increases the facility of the Minister for Finance to take up shares in the company.  It is proposed to raise the existing level of £120 million to £130 million.  Are the Minister and the Government satisfied that the present limit is adequate?  Am I correct in saying that about £91 million of the £120 million has already been taken up?  Is the Minister satisfied that this sum is adequate, because it will be a considerable time before we review this Bill?  The Minister indicated that the last review was in 1983 and that the next would be in 1990.  Are the limits now set for the share capital of the Minister for Finance in this company adequate for a period of four years?  In the structure of moneys are we allowing for any possible economic upturn or expansion of economic developments in that area?  I should like to be assured that any increased activity in the mid-west would not be short-changed because of any inadequacy in the Bill, especially in section 2.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Keeffe raised the question of food processing, which is very important.  I am also concerned at Deputy Lyons' comments <Col N="130" /> regarding the funding now being provided and whether it is adequate.  However, the Minister does not have to wait four years; if necessary, he can come back at any stage to seek additional funding for SFADCo.  With regard to Deputy O'Keeffe's comments, food processing is very important and I am pleased that SFADCo over the last couple of years made considerable progress in identifying processing and doing something about it.  There is a food processing centre at Raheen which provides opportunities for entrepreneurs to start up in business and to test their products.  I am not aware of any complaints about the inadequacy for food processing at present.  Over the years I criticised SFADCo because, although we had a massive industrial estate, a tremendous development unique in Europe, we did not have an industry for processing the natural raw materials of the land.  At last something is being done about that.</P>
      <P>I am not too concerned at this stage about providing finance for the next four years.  We are all concerned about the provision of adequate capital to enable SFADCo to do the job.  I urge the Government and the Minister to do everything in their power to encourage them to continue to focus on the development of food processing.  They have mounted exhibitions and done a lot in the area of public relations to make people aware of the possibilities in food processing.</P>
      <P>The financial provisions in the Bill are adequate at present and if, in one or two years' time SFADCo need more money, we will ensure that the Government will provide it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the provision of finances for the company, it is not in the best interests of the developing company to come back in two or three years' time in a piecemeal fashion to seek additional funds.  Any company involved in promotion, develoment, tourism, airport traffic, industrial development and so on like that at Shannon, need to be in a position to plan over a period of at least five years.  It is not in the best interests of the company or their work &mdash; or indeed in the best interests of the House &mdash; to come back every two and a half years or so seeking further financial support to enable them to do their business.  There should be no dilution of the status of responsibilities of the company and it is in the overall interests of the development of the area, the mid-west region in particular, to have a development agency which could oversee the whole process of development within the region.</P>
      <P>That is why we have been amazed and indeed alarmed at the selective and negative stance adopted by Deputy Keating. His view was not shared by the committee as a whole.  It was a selective statement issued by the deputy leader of the Progressive Democrats and I do not believe he has much support for that view in the mid-west region.  We are concerned that the necessary overall finances will be provided for the development company and, in not providing for the full four year period, we are afraid that it may be the Government's intention to dilute the responsibilities of the company in question. I should like to get a firm assurance from the Minister in this regard.</P>

      <P>I read the report of the OECD and they were loud in their praise of what has happened here compared with other countries.  They said we have been progressive and far-seeing in this regard.  However, we could do more in the area of marketing.  Money is the key to the success of food processing. We have fallen down in processing and marketing.  I have to compliment the <Col N="132" /> Minister because he has been very forthcoming in this area and is trying to correct the situation.  But this cannot be done unless money is provided.  I would like some answers.  Will the money be provided?  Can the Government insist on the money being provided for marketing? In the agri-food area Raheen is now in operation and a substantial number of jobs are being provided, but all this will fall flat on its face if we do not take care of the whole marketing area.</P>

      <P>Section 2 deals with the aggregate amounts which the Minister for Finance may subscribe under that section by taking up shares in the company.  What is proposed in this Bill is that we repeal the previous figure of £120 million and substitute instead that the aggregate amount so subscribed shall not exceed £130 million.  That is fairly definite.  I have suggested that the existing £120 million will be taken up over the next two years and there will still be two years to run on this Bill, given the indication by the Minister that it will be 1990 before we are back.  I do not accept that the Government, or any Government, can come back here at any time and ask for this money to be raised if the need arises because it says here quite definitely that the aggregates of the amount subscribed shall not exceed £130 million.  Are we saying in effect that the present £120 million will be taken up by the Minister over the next two years and that the £10 million will be sufficient for the remaining two years or the suggested lifetime of this amending Bill?  That is all we want to know.</P>

      <P>I agree with Deputy O'Keeffe that marketing is important. SFADCo have been liaising very closely with CTT on the whole marketing front and this arrangement is working well.  I <Col N="133" /> agree with Deputy O'Donnell that SFADCo have been doing a good job on the food front and will continue to do so. In regard to Deputy Lyons' point, we have had discussions.  Let us remember that we are talking about projections and buildings and so on and we have been reassured by SFADCo that the £130 million will suffice to take them up to 1990.  I would also like to reassure Deputy Daly, who is not in the House at the moment, that the Minister has laid to rest any fears. The Minister's Second Stage speech must reassure everybody.  It has certainly reassured the people in SFADCo.  He also mentioned the five year period.  A corporate plan has been received from the company and they have been reassured by the Second Stage speeches of all Members of the House that they can plan for that period regardless of any statements.</P>

      <P>Deputy Lyons' amendment No. 1 was ruled out of order as it involved a potential charge upon the Revenue.  A substitute amendment on the white list was also ruled out of order because, again, that would involve a potential charge on the Revenue. Deputy Lyons is at liberty to speak on the section.</P>

      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 3 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me explain that in the amendment as first published there was an error, possibly on my part.  In any case I was not proposing that we increase the figure by £1 million.  The intention was to increase it by £10 million.  I know another statesman who got mixed up with noughts but I do not want to be put on a parallel with him by any stretch of the imagination. Much of what we were saying in <Col N="134" /> section 2 strayed into section 3 in regard to the grant-in-aid required by SFADCo. I am aware that the figure in the 1983 Bill was £60 million and it is proposed to raise that to £105 million in this Bill.  Given the timescale &mdash; and I keep referring to that because it is important &mdash; I feel this increase is insufficient and that is why I wanted to amend it.</P>
      <P>I have the statement from the Ceann Comhairle's Office stating that substitute amendment No. 1 tabled by me for the Committee Stage of this Bill was adjudged to be out of order because it would involve a potential charge upon the Revenue.  I have no option but to accept that decision.  That sort of decision worried me somewhat because it could easily create a precedent and even if we could justify that an increase was insufficient, it would not be possible to discuss it if money had not been provided.  I honestly believe that is a dangerous precedent.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>Far from it.  It is on the record that I accept the decision of the Ceann Comhairle.  I have no other option but to accept it and I am not accepting it in any qualified way.  What I am saying is that we could be discussing a Bill such as this and, even if there was agreement between the Government and the Opposition that the provision of money was inadequate, we could find ourselves in a position where we could not discuss increasing the amount.  That is restrictive. We must take into account that the cost of grants to small industries administered by SFADCo in the mid-west region outside the Shannon Free Airport zone is borne by the Industrial Development Authority.  That situation arose from the legislation passed in 1983 which was the last occasion on which the question of financial assistance to the company was raised and that legislation gave statutory authority to SFADCo, although the right had been with the company since 1978.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposal is to increase the amount <Col N="135" /> under the 1983 Act of £60 million to £105 million in this legislation, to operate over the next four years.  It would be regrettable, to say the least, if a couple of years hence the SFADCo operation had exhausted that £105 million and there were valuable and viable projects on hand which could do with grant in aid and which could not be assisted.  I know that whatever figure is mentioned could be increased, but why stop at £105 million? Would it not be better to be on the safe side in ensuring that money required would be available?  SFADCo will only spend money allocated to them after careful consideration; that has been their record and their history.  It would be a sad state of affairs if the money allocated in this legislation were found to be insufficient. I know the company could seek amending legislation but there is enough insecurity around at present.  To expect an organisation such as SFADCo to operate surrounded by even the smallest semblance of uncertainty would be retrograde.  It is our function as legislators to ensure that there will be no uncertainty in the foreseeable future with regard to the advancement of SFADCo in the mid-west region in the performance of their functions under their terms of reference, which are &mdash; to generate air traffic through the airport, to encourage the expansion and the development of manufacturing industry at Shannon Airport and to encourage and assist in every way the development of small manufacturing industry in the mid-west region as a whole.  Any legislation must not hinder or hamper that company, in view of their success.  The uncertainty engendered by section 3 was and still is my concern.</P>

      <P>The first time the company took a pilot role in food processing was in 1985.  It is encouraging that all the new units dealing with this area were taken up.  SFADCo have a very different organisation, as proved by their progress. Their major future growth will probably be in the food technology area.  If we are to command a price for our products, we must have them delivered on time.  We <Col N="136" /> have sometimes fallen down in this respect. I hope that SFADCo will keep up their good work in the area of ensuring prompt deliveries.  The whole economy would benefit enormously, from a whole new area being opened up with perhaps new markets, and many new jobs which are so badly needed at this time by our young people being created.  These opportunities would arise from our own natural resources and that is very important.</P>
      <P>No work has been done yet in the area of fish processing and development.  This opportunity could be exploited and it would take a firm like SFADCo, who have shown much courage, to start on this theme.  There is a huge national resource encompassing the whole Shannon estuary. We claim in the Cork area to have the finest deep waters, but there is a huge potential for fish farming in the Shannon area which also has excellent waterways. If those opportunities are developed, that will lead to a need for processing and marketing.</P>
      <P>We have the developments at Moneypoint and Aughanish which are interesting and give great employment opportunities in key industries.  I understand that there would be potential in Moneypoint in the food development area from the point of view of hot water being available for glasshouse production. That area must be exploited and we cannot afford to let such opportunities pass.  I wish the Minister, who has such a keen interest in this area, every success and hope he will use his good offices with SFADCo for the encouragment of development in these new areas.  We see Norwegian and Japanese ships bringing in service goods to plants.  That under-lines our need for our own shipping line.</P>

      <P>The amounts outlined in this section and the increase in grants involved are welcomed by everybody in the House.  The increased funds will be of benefit to all the areas which come under the scope of this section and to the areas which come within the ambit of the Shannon Free Airport Development Company.  One of the areas of importance is food and food processing. SFADCo are involved in this area.  I hope that with these increased grants they may be able to expand further into food, food processing and the development of different types of products for sale, not only on the Irish market but on the British market and other European markets. Perhaps the Minister would be more specific and give us details of the percentage of grants paid by SFADCo in regard to food processing.  There is enormous potential for SFADCo in this regard.  The amount under this section, £105 million, is a vast sum of money.  Throughout the SFADCo area there are large numbers of firms involved in food processing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Batchelors have been taken over recently by Northern Foods and Beechams. SFADCo should work in conjunction with existing bodies.  There is not enough co-operation or intermingling between the IDA and SFADCo.  They are both trying to encourage people to develop industry and provide jobs.  In this instance, I am not certain whether or not there is a real opportunity for SFADCo to join with some of the bigger companies. Nevertheless, I hope that a body such as SFADCo will take a very close interest in assisting the farmers who are the producers and the industrialists, the people who are involved in small and medium-sized firms.  They should help in providing the expertise and the capital necessary to produce marketable goods. <Col N="138" /> There is a great potential for food processing in Ireland.  The Minister has a specific interest in this field.  He is aware that each year we import vast quantities of vegetables from Britain and specifically brassicas from Spain.  SFADCo should co-operate with other firms to give encouragement and assistance to farmers and to firms.  They should assist them with marketing, expertise and advice to develop food processing in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Recently I spoke to a number of people involved in horticulture who carried out a survey of a number of supermarkets in Dublin.  They found that most house-wives prefer fresh or chilled vegetables to tinned or packaged vegetables.  There is a market for firms who process fresh or chilled vegetables.  We are all aware of the firms who are involved in vegetable production and processing.  There are quite a number of them, the Fruit Importers of Ireland, the Kinsealy Farms, the Irish Sugar Company and so on, involved in different forms of food processing and food production.  I hope and envisage that the Minister for Agriculture, with the help of the Minister for Industry and Commerce and of SFADCo, will undertake market research into the area where a specific product could be geared for a particular consumer.</P>
    <P>It is important that proper marketing research be carried out.  SFADCo have the expertise to find out what products are needed.  It is within the ambit, scope and guidelines of SFADCo to be able to provide finance and assistance to firms to produce the products which are required from the results of that research.  This is an area which is very important.  The Minister on a news programme last night dealt with the scope and potential which is there.  The potential is there and not just in one specific area.  There is a huge market in Great Britain.  If one visits any shop in Dublin or rural Ireland for nine months out of 12 months one will find they are buying imported vegetables and fruit.  That is an area where we have enormous potential.  There are no mountains of vegetables in the EC as in other products.  There is enormous potential in vegetables.  Through firms, such as <Col N="139" /> SFADCo, with the assistance of other semi-State agencies, the potential is there for us to move in that direction.  I hope this will be looked at closely.</P>
    <P>I will give the Minister an example. One area where there is vast potential, if properly marketed, is in salads and coleslaw etc.  Vast quantities of these products are being imported.  With modern techniques they can be prepared and made available.  It is important that this be looked at further.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>That is why the increase specified in the Bill is sizeable.  The Minister and the Government are to be commended on bringing about this increase. There are a number of firms involved in the processing and production of vegetables. Northern Foods are one such firm.  They have enormous capital resouces and their involvement is to be welcomed. In this part of Ireland food processing in general is to be welcomed. It is not alone of importance to the firm in question but also to the farming community that they get every co-operation and assistance.  The vegetables produced by the farming community are of top class quality and are recognised as such throughout Ireland, Britain and Europe. It is important that we avail of these products.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>SFADCo were welcomed when they moved into my constituency of Laois-Offaly, particularly in the south and west areas.  I must say that all of the units they built and prepared were well planned and are of excellent quality.  Care has been taken to ensure that the area in which they were erected was properly land-scaped. That is important and I welcome it.  The Minister should further consider the expansion of smaller units in different towns.  A resolution was proposed by Offaly County Council that the area and scope for development of SFADCo should be extended as far as Tullamore. I ask the Minister to consider such a development.  Others are anxious that <Col N="140" /> SFADCo be extended to parts of Laois also.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasGODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am a bit perturbed regarding the comments by Deputy Lyons <i>vis-à-vis</i> the adequacy of finance. The Deputy said, if I am quoting him correctly, it is important that there be no element of doubt on the part of SFADCo about the fact that they may not have adequate funding.  It is necessary for the Minister of State to clarify this situation. The people in SFADCo and in the mid-west should be informed and assured that there will be adequate finance available. I assume that the figures in this Bill were compiled by the Department following indepth consultations with the board and officials of SFADCo and are based on the projections which can be ascertained at present.  I want to put the Minister of State on a spot.  I appreciate that he is deputising for his Minister but at the same time he will have no hesitation in giving an assurance that it is very difficult to forecast what will happen over a four year period.  The economy might start to move well and the money being provided might be spent in two years time.  An assurance should be given that should such a set of fortuitous circumstances arise the Minister will come back to this House and any developments and projects which will provide employment will not fail for the lack of Government financial backing.  Deputy Lyons raised this point and I am sure the Minister of State will be able to reassure us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Keeffe and Deputy Enright raised the question of expenditure of the money which is now being voted for <Col N="141" /> SFADCo.  They emphasised the vital importance of and the priority which should be accorded to food processing. Deputy Enright dealt at length with many aspects of this.  Let me say as one who has considerable experience in dealing with SFADCo that I have been encouraging individuals who have ideas for the development of food processing projects to go to SFADCo.  I must say that SFADCo's set up is very good.  They are highly sophisticated in their approach, efficient when it comes to processing applications, rendering every possible assistance to potential entrepreneurs.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister is well aware that SFADCo are receiving great co-operation from ACOT.  I agree with Deputy Enright and Deputy O'Keeffe that there is enormous potential in this area.  Therefore, it is vital that there be close co-operation between SFADCo and ACOT, which is evident in the mid-west region.</P>
    <P>I am aware of a number of original imaginative projects, amongst them venison and goosemeat production, by way of import substitution.  Some months ago SFADCo held a seminar when there were on display something of the order of 350 food products, mostly in the food speciality area, many of which are at present imported and which SFADCo contend could be produced at home.  Therefore, they established what might be described as an incubator centre at Raheen where anybody with an idea about a food project could receive assistance and guidance. Provided SFADCo felt there was market potential for the product, one could experiment with one's product and then seek the aid of SFADCo to test its market.  I am very pleased that the company have launched into that area.</P>
    <P>We are here talking about the expenditure of money.  As the Leas-Cheann Comhairle is well aware, SFADCo do not confine their activities to food processing. They constitute an outstanding example of what a development agency can achieve, how State funds can be expended in the best possible manner.  The innovation centre at the NIHE at Plassey is one such example.  While there has been excellent <Col N="142" /> liaison between SFADCo and ACOT in the food processing area tremendous work has been done by way of linkage between the NIHE in Limerick and SFADCo.  Last week there was a group of German parliamentarians here &mdash; from the State of Baden-Württemberg &mdash; who visited Limerick for three days. Of all the things they saw in the mid-west region what most impressed them was the innovation centre at Plassey where they are into very high technology, the application of micro-electronics and so on.  The Germans said that some of the products being produced there, in small units, were well up to German, if not international standards.</P>
    <P>Being optimistic I would envisage the Minister having to return to this House well before another four years have elapsed seeking further finance for SFADCo when I am sure that whatever Minister or Government are in power in will be willing to sanction it, as they have been over the years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>We all accept that SFADCo are the leader or co-ordinator of all activity in the mid-west region.  We have been placing emphasis on some of their areas of responsibility.  I wholeheartedly agree with the goal of import substitution, particularly with regard to food products.  Therefore, I concur with the views of my colleagues on the need for SFADCo to place emphasis in that direction, whether it be with regard to food or any other products.  The value of present imports creates such an imbalance in our economy that we should make an immediate effort to curb them, thereby creating employment for the young and perhaps not so young.  If there is any organisation capable of setting a headline in that regard it must be SFADCo. Therefore I am glad to note the expression of confidence in what they are doing and, indeed, in what they have achieved over the past 27 years.  SFADCo, as a statutory body in the mid-west region, could be the forerunner by way of example of how that imbalance in our economy which has led to so many of our people being unemployed can be redressed.  It <Col N="143" /> would be ridiculous to suggest that the huge national problem of unemployment could be solved by SFADCo.  On the basis that few other organisations, if any, are in a position to do something worth-while, by way of giving the lead or encouragement, then this organisation has a role to play.</P>
      <P>We are here talking about grants-in-aid, which are to meet the running expenses of the company and provide financial assistance to companies in the Shannon Industrial Estate.  We are aware also that a substantial proportion of the company's running expenses relate to the administration of their small, indigenous industry programme in the mid-west region.  Here it must be emphasised that grants for plant and equipment, training, research and development and other programmes are given by the IDA.  It must be borne in mind also that approximately 70 per cent of the company's administration costs are offset primarily by way of rent on factory space.</P>
      <P>In relation to running expenses, there is one other aspect of activity in the mid-west region to which I should like to refer.  A significant element of these expenses arising from the company's tourism activities used to be met by a special grant-in-aid for which the Minister for Tourism was specifically accountable notwithstanding that the amount comes from within the overall limit being amended by section 3 of this Bill.  The Department of Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism has been changed and we now have the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister for Tourism, Fisheries and Forestry. There is need for the greatest co-operation between Board Fáilte, SFADCo and Aer Rianta.  These bodies must realise that their functions complement each other and they must act in a co-ordinated way to ensure the future development of the region for which they are responsible. One of the areas dealt with in the report of the Oireachtas Committee on Public Expenditure was duplication of wasteful expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="144" /> SFADCo are seen as the leader but I would place all the organisations on an even keel.  We can see the great opportunities for employment and economic development in the region with the facilities which are available at the airport and the developments which have taken place at Shannon over the past 27 years.</P>
    <P>Section 3 deals with the grant-in-aid. We are not being critical of these organisations but we are offering a constructive suggestion.  These bodies are grant-aided by State funds and it behoves us to ensure that this money, which is so painfully collected, is used to the best advantage.</P>
    <P>There is always an extra effort which every body can make and now more than ever is that extra push required from SFADCo, Bord Fáilte and Aer Rianta. The local authorities in that area also have a role to play.  As I said on Second Stage, this region could serve as an example to other areas.  In time perhaps we could see a south-west type SFADCo operation.  The west, north-west, south-west, east and north-east all need a boost at present.  I am not suggesting that we should introduce legislation to set up statutory authorities in all these regions. However, action will need to be taken in all these regions in relation to unemployment which would give hope to many thousands of people.  A commitment should be given in future legislation to solve unemployment which is our biggest social problem.  Regrettably we have been addressing various other issues and have not given this problem the degree of concern it deserves and which is expected from us by the unemployed and young people who see little hope of a future for them.  That is why I was anxious to introduce into the debate the involvement of SFADCo and Aer Rianta in tourism development in that region.  As usual, in making passing references to such matters, I am able to stay within the terms of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasGODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to detain the House unnecessarily but the Bill is important and we are dealing with the expenditure of State money.  It is importand that all aspects of the legislation are <Col N="145" /> teased out.  I was please to hear Deputy Lyons refer to tourism because we have dealt with food processing, the innovation centre at Plassey and developments in the micro-electronics industry.  I should like to comment on two important points Deputy Lyons made.  I was pleased to hear him refer to the need to co-ordinate the work of the various State bodies in the Shannon region.  Aer Rianta are responsible for the airport, Bord Fáilte have overall responsibility for tourism, the Shannonside Regional Tourism Organisation are responsible for tourism in the region and SFADCo are responsible for industrial development.  I was concerned to hear rumours recently that the powers of SFADCo will be diminished in that the tourism function of that organisation will be given to Bord Fáilte or the regional tourism organisation.  I will oppose that move vigorously in the House and outside.  SFADCo have done tremendous pioneering work in the field of tourism.  Castle Tours and Castle Banquets are evidence of the success of SFADCo in the area of tourism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to express my appreciation of the work of SFADCo in encouraging visitors from Europe to the region. For some years now charter flights have been arriving at Shannon from different European countries, Germany, Denmark and Switzerland, and SFADCo are trying to develop that market further.  I agree with those who have complained that we do not concentrate enough on Europe in our efforts to attract tourists but few can question the efforts of SFADCo in that regard.  I suggest that that organisation be given <i>carte blanche</i> in their efforts to attract European visitors. The future of the tourist industry depends on the development of European traffic.  Last year when I attended one of the largest European tourist fairs, in Stuttgart, I was very impressed by the work of the officials of the tourist section of SFADCo.  The results speak for themselves and officials there realise the potential for the development of the region.  I have no doubt that there will be further characters from other European cities.  SFADCo have blazed the trail and <Col N="146" /> there should not be any attempt to interfere with their operations.</P>
    <P>I agree with the call by Deputy Lyons for greater co-ordination.  In that region the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister for Tourism, Fisheries and Forestry have a function.  I have always held the belief that Tourism should be linked with Transport.  In a small island country like ours access transport is a vital part of tourism.  I prefer to see those interests under one ministry, as happened some years ago.  It is important that we ensure that there is no overlapping or wasting of State funds. At present there may be some overlapping in regard to tourism and some apparent overlapping in regard to the functions of SFADCo and Aer Rianta <i>vis-á-vis</i> the airport but I am not too concerned about them because there is a good relationship between those organisations.</P>
    <P>It is a tribute to SFADCo that Deputies on all sides of the House compliment them on their operations and are anxious that the company should function even more effectively in the future.  However, the strategy of SFADCo should be applied to other regions.  Some years ago there was some flak flying between Cork and Shannon and I took one of my party colleagues to task for suggesting that Shannon was being treated over-generously. I suggested to that Deputy that he should do something about setting up a similar type operation to cover the south-west. We would not object to such a development.</P>
    <P>Having worked in the area of EC regional policy in the past seven years I am aware that many of the developments of SFADCo are funded by the Regional Fund and the Social Fund.  However, I am disappointed that the Government did not avail of this opportunity to look at SFADCo in the context of being a development agency for the mid-west region along the lines of State agencies in the Mezzogiorno in Southern Italy.  I hope the Government, when considering local government reform, will designate SFADCo as the regional development agency with responsibility for all aspects of development, economic, social and <Col N="147" /> cultural.  That would be in accordance with European thinking on regional development.</P>
    <P>We have a tremendous opportunity to set up similar agencies in the south-west and the west because under the new EC regulations finance is available for regional development programmes.  The Government should avail of that assistance and designate SFADCo as the agency with responsibility for all aspects of development in the mid-west region. They should submit a four year development plan to Brussels, and the money will be forthcoming, £1 for £1, for any type of programme during that time. Having done that, I should like to see a similar type agency set up for the south-west and the west and other regions.  We have no proper regional development policy in Ireland.  We have SFADCo as a pilot, an ideal model, for proper regional development throughout Ireland.</P>

      <P>I should like to follow up what Deputy O'Donnell said, and I should like to alleviate any fears he might have about Fianna Fáil's commitment. We are firmly committed to the continuation and further development of SFADCo.  We have no intention of interfering in any way with that agency, in or out of Government, because SFADCo have played a major role in the development of the mid-west.  They have laid the foundation for the type of regional development we should be moving towards.  We must do more to develop our indigenous resources.  It is a pity that from time to time politicans have tried to undermine SFADCo and have a go at it. More responsible politicians should not tolerate that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tourism is an important industry in that area but we have not harnessed it to its full potential.  We have an enlarged EC with new members like Spain, Portugal and Greece.  European prices have been high and it is quite likely that there will be a reduction in the number of tourists travelling to those countries.  We should be trying to attract more tourists to our market but our prices must be in <Col N="148" /> line.  It is well known that many people throughout the west prefer to spend their holidays in climates like ours rather than in the warmer climates.  That is to our advantage.  Though we may be critical of our misty isle, as John F. Kennedy once called it, we should be very proud of it. We should sell our tourism more intensively in Europe, particularly in Germany, Denmark and other such countries.  We have many scenic areas to offer.</P>
    <P>From time to time I travel through the mid-west, particularly in County Clare, and I have always been proud of what I have seen.  Having driven through Limerick to Ennis and further, I have often been struck by the prosperity there and I feel envy when I go back to the level lands of Cork.  I notice Deputy Daly and Deputy O'Donnell taking great interest in what I am saying&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We have been questioning finances.  The increase in capital is £10 million, a small amount when you analyse the position.  Three years ago we debated an increase in capital for SFADCo.  If there are to be the exciting developments SFADCo have in mind, particulary in relation to the food industry, I believe we will be debating shortly a further request for capital.  We talk much about import substitutions.  We have three items in respect of which there is great potential for development, fishing, agriculture and forestry.  I will refer briefly to a recent OECD report which stated that 40 companies in Ireland import about 75 per cent of their total material inputs, with the result that inter-industrial linkages between the indigenous sectors and foreign high technology remain limited.  One striking result is that between 1980 and 1984 when manufacturing was falling and real GNP grew by 2 per cent, industrial production rose by 24 per cent and exports by 32.8 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is therefore a case for developing <Col N="149" /> our own resources, and the pilot scheme at Raheen is a very worth while development. I expect a lot from it and we cannot praise it highly enough.  I should like to see in the southern region a similar organisation to SFADCo.  There is great potential in the Cork and Kerry region and indeed we envy the success of SFADCo. I was glad to hear Deputy Enright speak of development in Laois-Offaly.  Of course it was a Fianna Fáil Minister who enlarged SFADCo's interest in Offaly.</P>
    <P>SFADCo have been responsible for the major success of small industries. Recently in their report the chairman said it was the very best of small industry.  It is exciting to know that 500 new jobs were created in the mid-west, grant-aided during the last year.  That is further proof of the successful management and ability of the people concerned.  About 164 small industries were developed in difficult times.</P>
    <P>I asked the Minister of State not long ago to comment on fishing and the development of the estuaries for mariculture and fish farming.  I asked about the availability of large volumes of water of high temperature from Moneypoint which would go to waste or ill-use.  It is a resource in itself because it would help to develop the glasshouse industry which has been going to the dogs.  There is huge potential in that industry if there was a source of heat energy available.  In better circumstances we could complete with the best in Europe.  The Minister of State, Deputy Hegarty, has a great interest in these matters and I should like to hear his comment and his commitment so that SFADCo would harness some of the Moneypoint water energy to pilot projects in fish farming and glasshouses.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>I am at pains to keep to section 3.  My amendment was ruled out of order because of rules and regulations governing revenue.  I have read that the accumulated expenditure of SFADCo in share capital and grant-aid as at 31 May last amounted to £91.6 million and £60 million, respectively.  The grant-in-aid limit has been reached by the company <Col N="150" /> and they have been relying in the meantime on a combination of their own resources, on income and, worst of all, on bank borrowings to meet their obligations. As the Minister said on Second Stage, it is a matter of urgency that these limits be increased now and it is estimated that the increases proposed will suffice until 1990.  Those were the words of the Minister and I underlined them in the script of the Minister's speech.  Like many other people, I have a horror of bank borrowings&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Borrowings have brought us to our present level and in recent times borrowings have been even worse than before.  When I read SFADCo had to borrow to keep in existence, I was prompted to put down the amendment and it is regrettable that because of procedure we cannot debate it.  Because SFADCo ran out of the funds they were allocated under the terms of the 1983 Bill, I was trying to ensure that in future they would not have to rely on borrowings. That was the reason I put down the amendment.</P>

      <P>It is right and proper that the Minister should move quickly on the matter.  Deputy O'Donnell spoke about extending the remit.  There is a new team now working in the development company and I expect they will respond to calls for an expansion of the industrial programme on the industrial estate at Shannon.  Now is the time for them to move in view of the economic situation, because there has been a downturn in the cost of energy and also because there are few industrial disputes at Shannon.  Any kind of reasonable agreement promoted <Col N="152" /> by the employers and unions has been met fairly by both sides and there has been only one or two major industrial disputes in the area.  Since 1960, SFADCo have used their capital resources in a proper way.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Donnell referred to tourism. That aspect of the operation is not seen to work properly.  A considerable number of aircraft cross the Atlantic each day eastbound for Europe.  In recent times there has been a reduction but I will give the House one figure to illustrate the point I wish to make.  There are ten aircraft per day ferrying US personnel from Europe to the US.  We have already a Russian presence at Shannon Airport and I do not see why we cannot offer the facilities available there to the companies flying American personnel to and from their duties in Europe.  Even if we had four additional landings per day it would improve the transit traffic at Shannon.  I should like to see the people in SFADCo getting together with officers of other promoting agencies such as Aer Rianta and Bord Fáilte to consider the promotion of the kind of development to which I have referred.</P>
      <P>This injection of capital is well-timed. Shannon is facing new competition from a major airport known as the Connacht Regional Airport.  They are trying to zone in on the new traffic that Shannon has attempted to develop.  In recent times Aer Lingus have got permission to build a new freight terminal and a private company expect to build a smaller freight or warehouse at Shannon.  SFADCo and Aer Rianta have used this facility to promote the interests of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The export of meat from Shannon has been a great help to the west and I hope it continues.  I was not too happy with the establishment of the Connacht Regional Airport which is only 60 miles up the road &mdash; and in international terms that is not very far.  I wish the company and the Monsignor well but there are limitations to the market they are entering.  I hope this new airport does not result in a downturn in employment in Shannon.  Scarce Government resources have been put to very good use in the international airport <Col N="153" /> in my constituency.  I welcome this section and wish it a speedy passage through the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to deal with a few points raised by Deputy O'Donnell.  I agree with him wholeheartedly in the emphasis he placed on the desirability of having a regional development strategy. In SFADCo we have the ideal vehicle by which regional development can be promoted.  SFADCo have overall responsibility for development in the region &mdash; large industry, industrial promotion, tourism and development and a range of activities such as the food processing experiment and so on.  I agree with Deputy O'Donnell that there is a need for a strong regional development infrastructure in identified regions.  We need stronger regional development and more investment and decentralisation.  In the main, most regions should be self-sufficient so far as organisation and the provision of jobs are concerned.  This would take some of the pressures off other parts of the country.</P>
      <P>In the mid-west region we should utilise our own resources, whether they be food or fisheries.  This would provide a substantial number of jobs in the region which would mean people would not be seeking employment elsewhere.  The development company have a grave responsibility to create further jobs in the tourist related activities in which they were so successful in the past.  One only has to mention places like Bunratty and Craggaunowen, where the Shannon development company, by investing in a tourist related development, attracted people to the region and kept them there. One of the difficulties we had in the Shannon region when passengers disembarked at the international airport was to keep them in the region because this would benefit the local economy and would create further prosperity.  The development company have had a tremendous success in the Bunratty Castle complex, the Folk Park and the banquets at Bunratty and other places.  These are very strong attractions and are keeping visitors in the region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="154" /> I should like to direct the attention of the Minister and the company to the huge potential in many parts of the mid-west region as regards tourist related activities and the promotion and investment of funds in developing areas which would attract people.  One such area is the Burren, which has beautiful scenery and is one of the most attractive areas in the west.  With proper management and with the preservation of the flora and fauna of the Burren we could have an ideal centre which would attract people to the Knock-Clare region, a difficult area in which to create employment.  This would be of immense benefit to the local economy.</P>
    <P>Farm house holidays, small businesses, small hotels and guesthouses, which are going through a very difficult period at present, would be supported if special areas were promoted and developed fully by an agency like SFADCo.  In these areas there are many small farmers whose incomes are restricted and certain activities could help them supplement their income.  The Minister should direct the company to look at areas like the Burren and Knock-Clare to see what can be done.  Perhaps we could have a golden triangle in the Knock-Clare area &mdash; the Burren, Galway and Ennis &mdash; similar to the golden triangle of Ennis, Limerick, Shannon.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>We have been doing fine without interruptions.  The lack of a Bunratty type attraction in the West Clare area has been a great disadvantage.  Scattery Island is an ideal location for the development of a scenic area with a tourism related project.  The development company might consider investing to restore Scattery Island because at present while it is a beautiful area it is very overgrown and neglected.  The development company could use the funds available under this section to make Scattery Island-Kilrush an area for special attention where there could be investment to <Col N="155" /> attract people.  We could provide a service from Kilrush to the island which is not available at present.</P>
      <P>Earlier we discussed the development of the estuary.  When the estuary legislation comes before us later this year, we will have another opportunity to discuss it further.  On the Clare side of the estuary&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>From Carrigaholt to Cappagh, Kilrush, Killadysert and Laba-sheeda, there is not one single industrial site even though sites were identified as being suitable for industrial promotion for large and small industry.  We would like the developing company with responsibility for the mid-west region to look very carefully at this area and to identify with other development agencies as a matter of urgency, suitable sites, acquire them and have them available for industrial promotion and development in the west Clare area &mdash; from Carrigaholt to Cratloe and Limerick city.  We have ideal sites there with attractions that are not available in other parts of the country. We have an estuary which has been relatively unexploited up to now, with the possibility of further industries with the establishment of Aughinish and the Moneypoint generating station.  It is time for the development company to direct their attention with the new estuary authority, when established, and the agencies and bodies responsible for tourism, agriculture and industrial related activities along that estuary, to getting together with a plan for the development of the Clare side of the estuary to make sure that we get the full benefit of this magnificent resource which has been relatively untapped and undeveloped up to now when substantial funds are available from the EC to help in the establishment of a major port in the Shannon estuary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are some areas which need to be examined in a special way at this time when the various agencies are being examined here by Dáil committees and <Col N="156" /> when the companies are examining their positions.  It is time for them to look at the areas which have been handicapped in the past years where we have not had the same level of job creation or industrial development as we have in other areas.  I request the Minister now to direct SFADCo to the areas which have the potential in both north and west Clare for development which well be of immense benefit to the region generally. If we can get from SFADCo some further action in these areas it would be of immense benefit in job creation and would create enormous wealth within the whole region.  It would take some of the pressure off the other regions.  We should back up with Government action the whole area of decentralisation so that we can have very healthy economic areas and regions, something similar to what Deputy O'Donnell had in mind when he spoke here and which we know would have the wholehearted support of the MEPs in getting European regional aid to support the involvement of development companies and agencies and everybody involved in the overall development of these important regions.  I ask the Minister to respond positively to the views expressed from this side of the House this afternoon.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the general constructive tone of the debate and the positive points that have been made which will be considered seriously and, as far as is practicable, will be taken on board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the points made by Deputy Lyons with regard to his fears about the funding right up to 1990, we are satisfied that we are all right up to 1990, that the funding has been increased from £60 million up <Col N="157" /> to £105 million, which is a substantial increase.  The previous one was from £40 million to £60 million.  Any Minister &mdash; I for one &mdash; would be prepared to come into the House again to vote further resources if necessary because I agree fully that funding should be adequate for SFADCo.  The administration of SFADCo is funded substantially from their own resources and rent of factory premises, so it is important to know that they contribute very substantially to their own resources.</P>
    <P>With regard to the points made by Deputy Lyons on public expenditure and duplication, we are already and will be pursuing exactly that point.  We have set up a small permanent committee, whom I am chairing, involving all the agencies, and one matter we are considering is duplication &mdash; for instance, between ACOT and AFT &mdash; because we have no room for duplication; we cannot afford it.  But in the same breath let me assure the House that, as far as the duties of SFADCo with regard to the airlines and tourism are concerned, there will be no diminution of their functions in anything they have been doing and doing well.  I favour the regular review of the affairs of the company because it is right that we should have this review by the owners of the company who effectively are the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Keeffe pointed out that the potential of mariculture for creating employment has not been exploited.  An objective of the company has been to investigate the possibility of developing and processing fish products using natural resources which exist in the Shannon estuary and off the west coast of County Clare.  The use of Shannon Airport as a means of supplying markets has been studied.  However, there are difficulties in developing this sector, not the least being the licensing regulations and the time scale involved in establishing projects. SFADCo's strategy has been to involve all development agencies in a joint planning exercise designed to identify constraints clearly and to agree on a plan of action.  A study of the feasibility of establishing mariculture projects in the <Col N="158" /> Shannon estuary has just been completed. Suitable sites have been identified for shellfish projects and the necessary application for designation is being prepared for submission to the Department of Fisheries and Forestry.  Further sites are being investigated in the estuary and a number of sites with potential for fin fish farming are being examined on the west Clare coast.</P>
    <P>The Deputy mentioned horticulture and the possible uses of waste heat from Moneypoint.  Let me mention something I have been studying for quite some time and have discussed with the glasshouse industry.  Whether it will be of commercial use will depend on the temperature of the water leaving the plant.  We have such a development already concerning a turf station but if the temperature of the water is not up to a certain level it is not worth going into the matter further.  However, we are keeping that very much in mind and we have done some investigatory work on the gas power turbine at Aghada and we find that the temperatures there are quite low.  Generally, that covers most of the points raised.</P>

That is why I put down the amendment. I welcome the proposal to delete the section and if it should arise in another way we will have to deal with it then.  I am sounding the warning signals that, if it is the Government's intention to introduce that sort of regulation in a global way, I would not favour such a move.

The fund provides loan capital to local authorities to finance their capital development programmes.  The construction of local authority housing and sanitary services programmes are the largest beneficiaries from the fund.  House purchase loans under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Acts &mdash; or SDA loans as they are generally known &mdash; are also financed from the fund.</P>
      <P>The fund is itself financed by means of advances from the Exchequer.  It was formally established in 1935 by the Local Loans Fund Act of that year although this form of financing of local authorities by the Exchequer originates in the 19th century, 1887 I think.</P>
      <P>The ceiling on issues from the fund has been progressively increased since it was set up and now stands at £3,500 million as provided in the Act of 1983.  This ceiling will be reached shortly and must be increased if the LLF is to continue to operate.  The revised ceiling proposed is £4,500 million which should be sufficient to meet requirements for the next three to four years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It might interest Deputies to know that the original ceiling on issues from the fund was set at a mere £5 million.  Yet between 1983 and 1986 £1,000 million will have been issued reflecting the dramatic increase in public investment in <Col N="161" /> infrastructure in recent years.  This is even more striking when one considers that the £1,000 million I refer to does not include certain capital items notably roadworks, which are not funded through the LLF but through voted moneys, that is, direct grants payable from the Vote for the Department of the Environment.</P>
    <P>Total public investment through the public capital programme this year will be £1,681 million, of which £324.0 million will be financed through the Local Loans Fund.  The principal elements are £178.8 million for LA house construction, £77 million for sanitary services and £62.0 million for the SDA scheme.  The total provision for SDA loans is £83 million, the balance coming from repayments on existing mortgages.</P>
    <P>Housing continues to receive a large proportion of public investment.  Public housing represents about 55 per cent of all expenditure from the LLF.  House completions by local authorities for the years 1982 to 1985 reached 25,400.  The total number housed increased from 7,900 in 1982 to 11,750 in 1985.  A major factor in achieving this breakthrough in the provision of LA housing has been the success of the £5,000 grant scheme for LA tenants vacating their houses and moving into the private sector.  The scheme which was introduced as part of the national plan has been remarkably successful.  It is estimated that 2,200 dwellings were vacated in 1985 as a result of the scheme and this should be exceeded in 1986.</P>
    <P>The level of expenditure on SDA loans, although sizeable at £83 million has fallen somewhat since loans from the Housing Finance Agency became available in 1982.  In the meantime the agency have advanced mortgages totalling £280 million.  The HFA raise their own funds directly from the market and are not financed from the Local Loans Fund.  The PCP provision for HFA loans in 1986 is £86 million.  Therefore, the pool of publicly funded mortgage finance available through these two schemes is substantial &mdash; £169 million in 1986 compared to £65 million in 1980 when only the SDA scheme existed.</P>
    <P>Loans from the Local Loans Fund are <Col N="162" /> repayable by the local authorities on an annuity basis.  The normal period of repayment is 25-30 years.  The rate of interest chargeable at present is 9 per cent &mdash; the current Exchequer lending rate.  SDA capital is made available to local authorities at a fixed rate of 9 per cent, the current Exchequer lending rate.</P>
    <P>In practice the Exchequer meets a large proportion of the loan charges on advances from the fund, both capital repayments and interest.  For example, it meets the full loan charges on local authority housing and 40 per cent to 60 per cent of the charges in respect of sanitary services.  The annual cost is shown in the Vote for the Department of the Environment.  The amount provided for 1986 is £179 million for local authority housing and £46 million for sanitary services.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the Local Loans Fund is an integral part of local authority financing and this legislation is required to allow the fund to continue to function. The existing ceiling will probably be reached by late summer and the revised ceiling must be approved by then.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill for the approval of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister of State has indicated in introducing this Bill, when the Local Loans Fund was first established in 1935 on a statutory basis the amount involved was £5 million.  Even allowing for inflation in the years between, it is clear that the scope and function of the Local Loans Fund has increased and extended quite dramatically to cover areas that the Minister has now referred to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to make some comments generally in relation to local authority financing and to the manner of the administration of the Local Loans Fund, and to endeavour to ensure that in terms of the actual allocation of such major resources as we are speaking about here this afternoon &mdash; £4,500 million in terms of guaranteed loans &mdash; we can be guaranteed as well that the authorities that administer them are equipped and adequately financed in <Col N="163" /> other directions to ensure that these programmes that have grown so enormously, from £5 million in 1935 to a loan guarantee of £4,500 million, are in line with the financial position at the moment and also with the most prudent and effective allocation of public resources.</P>
    <P>The first point I would like to make is one that was made here on the last occasion when these were introduced, when our spokesman inquired of the Minister's predecessor why it was that this legislation was introduced by that Minister.  Perhaps in this case it is because the Minister is the Minister of State in the Department of Finance and in that capacity can understand it quite well. Even if that is so, it would appear, however, that when we are talking of funds of such a significant amount that it should be the Minister for Finance himself who would introduce the legislation.  I say this without any implied criticism of the Minister in the House or any suggestion that she has not the capacity or otherwise to deal with it.  But it appears to me that in terms of ministerial function it would be more appropriate that a Minister for Finance would introduce this legislation. Alternatively, it would be appropriate for the Minister for the Environment to do so, because the total amount of funds being provided are for programmes which, as the Minister has indicated, are a very essential part of the funding of local authorities' housing programmes, service programmes, sewerage facilities and the whole SDA scheme.</P>
    <P>I would ask a rhetorical question.  In an era when we are talking about Dáil reform, why should a Minister who has responsibility for an important area &mdash; public works and all to do with public works &mdash; be introducing this legislation in the House?  The same question was asked the last time.  It was not, to my knowledge, answered; and apparently it is not going to be answered today.  We are talking about major financing and I have no doubt at all that the Minister of State who is present here, given the responsibility for major financing, could <Col N="164" /> cope very adequately with it, but in fact she does not have his responsibility.</P>
    <P>On the question of financing of local authorities, of which this forms an integral part, it is very clear that the whole financing of local authorities is at this point in a state of crisis.  At a recent meeting of the General Council of County Councils the chairman of the General Council of County Councils, in a very informed and direct address, pointed out that matter very cogently, and anyone who has any experience of local authorities at the moment will have to acknowledge that financing of local authorities today is in a state of crisis. Wherever we go we are informed that the necessary resources are not being provided by the Exchequer to make up for the base of local rating which was an essential part of local authority financing, and because they are not we are faced with the position where attempts are being made through a variety of means, notably local charges, to make up the differential between what the Exchequer should provide and that which would otherwise be available from local rates. This has clearly not worked.  We find that charges are, for one reason or another, not being paid; people are unable to pay them or unwilling to pay them.  They clearly will not meet these extra impositions which are the consequence of a Government decision about three years ago when they transferred the responsibility for these charges to the county manager.</P>
    <P>We are dealing with local authorities, elected representatives.  If elected representatives are to have a meaningful role at any level, then they must have authority. It is quite clear that the elected representatives of this nation who serve on local authorities do not have effective authority at this stage.  I cannot think of any person in the democratic function in this country who has the powers now delegated, by this Government particularly, to the county manager &mdash; and already they were considerable.  The Taoiseach, in order to bring proposals before this House, must get agreement <Col N="165" /> not just from his own parties in Government but from his colleagues in collective responsibility in Government.  That often involves a very detailed, difficult and important process; and, when that process has been completed in the proper democratic manner, the Taoiseach and the Government then bring the proposals before Dáil Éireann where they are debated in detail, questioned, analysed, sometimes opposed, sometimes supported. In any event it is subject to full democratic scrutiny in the way that democracy is meant to operate.  On the other hand it has to be said &mdash; and this is evidenced by the significance of what the Government have done &mdash; that transferring powers such as have been transferred to county managers in addition to what they already enjoyed under the Managerial Act &mdash; and I say this without any criticism of individual managers &mdash; means, and any local representative will confirm this, that the manager effectively exercises almost exclusive authority.  It means that the people elected by the people, the local authority representatives, are not enabled or allowed to discharge the effective, democratic role which is the cornerstone of the democratic procedure in most of our European partner countries.  If we want to have full democratic involvement, so that the people will not feel remote from the decision-making and will feel directly able to make an input into it, then we will have to ensure that the local authorities in respect of whom we are making these major provisions are answerable to the people in respect of all the decisions they take, and that can only be achieved when those who are elected have authority and the responsibility of answering to the electorate.</P>
    <P>The county manager does not have to bring his proposals before the Government as the Taoiseach does.  He certainly does not have to bring them before the Dáil as the Taoiseach and his Government do.  In many cases the decision is a <i>fait accompli</i> and mature adults are forced to react to decisions being taken by an administrator with very considerable powers.  That is not the way in which <Col N="166" /> democracy was meant to function.  It is time that the Members on both sides of this House recognised that fact.  If we want local authorities to function as originally envisaged there must be not just accountability on the part of the county manager with his rather extraordinary powers but on the part of the members of that authority.</P>
    <P>It has been very clear for some time that the real potential of local authorities is as developmental bodies.  The best example is Switzerland, but we can take as examples other countries in Europe such as The Netherlands, Belgium or France, which have real local authority devolved from central government.  It is quite clear that these authorities function in a manner which is very much in tune with the developmental needs of their immediate communes or electoral areas. The elected members there have an authority, responsibility and status that our elected members do not have.  It is time we realised that we have a major leap to make to achieve that position here.  It is for that reason that we have proposed and will implement in Government local government reform, which is long overdue, in order to ensure that if there are, for instance, to be industrial development programmes the local authorities, be they county or urban, will be in tune constantly with the potential of and the need for those programmes and will harmonise all their policies to ensure a maximisation of the development of such programmes.</P>
    <P>If there are to be housing programmes, it is important that decisions as to, first, the location of those programmes or schemes and, secondly, their nature and style, and all that means with regard to the housing environment in our towns and cities, should be conducive to better living and better community standards. They must be matters for full discussion by the relevant local authority.  They are being discussed at present, but not as Members on either side of this House would wish.  We do not want county councils to be told that they have a certain amount of money for a new scheme at Raheen or Killaloe and that is it.  There is much more to local government than <Col N="167" /> that, but that is the way it has been operating for some time now.</P>
    <P>This Bill has the support of all sides of the House because of the important elements involved in the funding programmes. It is an opportunity for highlighting the fact that we are not talking about just passing on funds.  Where funds of the nature of £4,500 million are being administered, there must be accountability to the electorate.  That is not the characteristic of the local government scene at the moment.  Secondly, everybody acknowledges and welcomes the fact that here we have had for a very considerable time a major commitment to public housing. Our expenditure is far higher than that of almost any other country in Europe.  This is because of the very inadequate housing stock initially over the years and the obligation faced by the State to provide for the basic right and need for adequate housing for those who could not afford such from their own incomes.  This has developed to the point that we are now probably more committed to public authority housing than any other country.</P>
    <P>The basis for local authority housing goes back to the Housing of the Working Classes Act of the last century.  The impression has stayed with the public generally that it is the manual working classes only who are suitably qualified for local authority housing.  I am not saying that that is how it is applied by local authorities, but that is the perception of the public.  Many people in clerical and administrative positions tend to provide and build their own houses for one reason or another, perhaps as a matter of pride or status.  Many with lower incomes are providing their own housing through other loan facilities while some with higher incomes naturally are turning to the local authorities.  We should have a good look at this aspect to ensure that incomes and not the nature of the work is and will always be the criterion for qualification for housing development. The traditional attitudes that we have all inherited are certainly due for review.</P>
    <P>This Bill is short and, like all short <Col N="168" /> Bills, is all the more significant in that in one line a figure can be increased from £3,500 million to £4,500 million, which is a matter of major significance.  As a contrast, there is the Finance Bill where we must go through the most complex drafting of perhaps 25 pages to the least effect.  This Bill in one line can achieve more than 40 or 50 sections of a Finance Bill.  It is important that we address ourselves to the scope of action required here.</P>
    <P>When we speak of home ownership, we mean the conventional home, if possible the house with its own frontage and garden based on the ground.  High rise developments, a feature of other countries, have not worked successfully here, although time may demonstrate that what first was resisted can subsequently develop into a very fine housing programme.  I am not an expert on housing and do not pose as such.  In most other European towns the secure conventional house that we provide here through local authorities is not a feature of their public housing.  They deal with apartments and high rise developments.</P>
    <P>We must ensure that our pattern of housing must be maintained because it is more characteristic of the Irish house and home.  We must also consider how long we shall be able to sustain effectively a rate of growth of guarantee funding at this level.  How long can we see the expenditure grow from £5 million to £4,500 million in terms of ancillary services such as sanitation?  One point that I would make, which I hope will be taken in the spirit suggested by the Minister, is that it is clear that there is now very considerable scope for a much more imaginative approach to local authority financing than we have seen in recent years.  I am thinking particularly in terms of joint ventures, even in matters such as servicing and housing programmes and matters of that kind.</P>
    <P>We can enlist the private sector in joint ventures with the public sector where funds are clearly in scarce supply in the public sector.  We can give guarantees but at the end of the day we, the taxpayers, must pay for them.  Anything that can <Col N="169" /> be done to recruit others in support of essential housing programmes for the lower income groups must be done in a sophisticated and imaginative way.</P>
    <P>I took up responsibility as spokesman for Finance some years ago.  Many people are interested in joint ventures with the Government or with local government, be they pension funds, investment trusts or construction companies.  Our major construction companies have at least 85 per cent of their investment programmes outside of Ireland.  That is shocking, but it is true.  The ones which we always regarded as the flagships are not developing here because the investment climate in terms of the private sector is such as to discourage investment here.  I do not wish to name them because they do not require to be named.</P>
    <P>If anyone wishes to check through the list of major construction companies, they will find that 85 per cent of their major investment commitments are not in Ireland but are a long distance from Ireland.  As was said dramatically to me, that is necessary to maintain the 15 per cent skeleton at home.  This is because the investment climate for the private sector, the whole tax regime and the incentive for investment have been suffocated. It is no surprise that where the private sector cannot get the opportunity to take a role in this area, we have to extend the limit of the public sector guarantee on loan funds to £4,500 million.  In the old days we could boast that we were providing so much money.  We are providing this money at a time when the local authority financing programme is in crisis and when those who could be involved in joint ventures which might lift some of the burden from the public purse are otherwise involved in imaginative areas and are not prepared to undertake this venture.</P>
    <P>I suggest that we look at the role of building societies.  I do not wish to be critical of our building societies.  The role of building societies in Britain should be encouraged here if the climate for doing so is right.  They can promote building programmes for people on low income, even for pensioners, on the basis of home <Col N="170" /> ownership.  We should encourage home ownership.  I agree with any suggestion in terms of purchase schemes under local authorities.  That is the right direction to take.  It is not always essential that it be done through the expanding State or local authority sector.  It is time that we asked ourselves how long can we continue without calling on the support of those who are ready to give it.  If the return is there for them, they will do it at least as cost effectively as the public sector can.</P>
    <P>If we compare the role of building societies in Britain with the role here, we will find that there is a considerale difference between them.  It is time we looked at that.  The nature of the housing programmes they undertake is very different.  The income groups they accommodate are very different.  The financial services they provide are very different.  The opportunities available to them are very different and the burden they lift from the State purse is also very different.  It is time that we looked at these areas to see how we can recruit either the capital or the expertise to ensure that our housing programmes, both public and private, are conducted efficiently in order to minimise the level of Exchequer guarantee where appropriate, which at the end of the day means tax and the taxpayer.  It is for that reason that I look on this Bill as an opportunity at least to signal that it is time we reviewed our position.  Deputies in the House who are members of local authorities&mdash;I am not&mdash;are much better equipped to talk in terms of the effective operation of these schemes.</P>
    <P>I do not want to take any credit from the Minister.  We are talking in terms of the total number of houses increasing from 7,900 in 1982 to 11,750 in 1985.  A considerable number of houses are laying vacant in some areas.  That may not be the case in regard to every county council administrative area.  In some parts of Dublin houses are lying vacant for some time.  That can hardly be said to be efficient.  We cannot force people to occupy houses.  Programmes based on home ownership are the best guarantee that people will either occupy their houses or dispose of them to others who <Col N="171" /> will occupy them.  In regard to local authority housing &mdash; and this is understandable &mdash; in many cases the rents paid are just about adequate, if they are, to finance the general maintenance of the houses, not the capital cost of construction. It has been an essential characteristic of our programmes and policies from the beginning that those who cannot afford houses will be guaranteed them. We should encourage people to seek finance from other sources in order to lift the burden from the taxpayer generally. I would like to see that approach adopted in the course of local government development programmes and housing programmes from now on.</P>
    <P>Anything I have said has to be seen in the context that the local authorities who administer these funds must be meaningful, real, democratic authorities where the democratic process is exercised effectively and is seen to be exercised.</P>
    <P>I would have to say, everyone in the House would have to say, that is not the way at present.  If we want to recruit good young people into local government service&mdash;and we have a fantastic reserve of ability, knowledge and commitment throughout the country&mdash;we must do so on the basis that they will know that they will have a real role and responsibility as local representatives, that they will have something which will stimulate and challenge them and give them the opportunity to make an effective contribution to the development of their own communities. That role is not there at present.  I say that only from a brief experience on a local authority and from very constant contacts with colleagues on local authorities. That has to change.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil could never depart from what was an essential feature of our programme, adequate housing, particularly for the poorer groups.  We have imaginative proposals, the full details of which will come in time, to ensure that we not only can provide adequate housing but can do so without increasing the burden on the State unnecessarily.  We are prepared to support this Bill and allow it through.  Why is the Minister for <Col N="172" /> Finance not introducing this Bill?  If not the Minister for Finance, why not the Minister for the Environment?  Perhaps, the Minister will advance some of the points I have made to ensure we have the same standard of housing and at a lower cost to the State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the amendment to the Bill.  I am not a great expert on local authorities because I have not long been a member of one.  It is right to say that local authorities are starved of finance.  It is very frustrating to be a member of a local authority, as we like to get necessary work done.  Yesterday, at Cork County Council I requested a survey be carried out in the northern area.  I would class that as a very important survey from the point of view of making piped water available to people who can ill afford to pay for it.  The engineer pointed out to me that they did not have the staff or resources to carry out such a task due to inadequate financing. We in the northern area of Cork County Council have been proud of the fact that we are one of the areas, after South Tipperary, which has the highest level of piped water supply in the country.  There are still people living in areas which are without this facility.  I would hope that some type of funding will be made available to alleviate this problem so that the job can be completed.  This would be very worth while.  It is very important to retain people in rural areas where they were born and raised and from where they would not like to move.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Local Loans Fund has a wide spectrum of activity from the point of view of financing.  It covers a broad area.  By and large in my own county there have been many local authority housing developments built over the years.  In towns like Fermoy and Mallow we are having problems. I do not want to be seen as too local when speaking on this fund.  For the record, at present in the town of Mallow there are 105 applications for a 25 house scheme.  That is serious in its own way. We are not keeping pace with the needs of families in the area.  In Fermoy, there is a similar story to tell.  One of the failings <Col N="173" /> of local authorities is that they have an inclination, whether by policy or otherwise, to draw people from rural areas and house them in what I would call large built-up areas.  This puts pressure on schools and facilities in those towns. Many of our villages are very well looked after with facilities such as post offices and adequate schools.  Another failure is that when we take people from the environment in which they are born and raised and house them in new areas, it takes them a long time to settle down. This often does not suit them as they were raised in a rural area.  The reason why they drift towards towns is that they falsely believe that they will become more entitled to housing by paying an exorbitant rate of rent.</P>

      <P>I am not too good at finance.  I welcome the fact that extra finance is being made available through SDA loans.  I am a great believer in people owning their own homes.  This gives them an independence.  Recently, the ceiling was raised from £16,000 to £20,000.  It was a coincidence that I had a question on the Order Paper asking the Minister if he would have a look at that situation.  Before my question was answered he had this changed.  I was very proud that I was in line to know that people were so concerned about this. Local and SDA loans are very important from the point view of people who want to avail of moneys to build their own homes.  The interest rate at 9 per cent is very competitive and is the best value for money one can get at present.  If interest rates were keeping pace with inflation it should be substantially lower, but it is the best value on the market from the point of view of other agencies who are making funds available for private house building. For people who can afford to build their own houses there is encouragement in this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="174" /> Another area which I am concerned with is the level of repayments for tenant purchasers.  This area should be looked at again.  Many tenants are in local authority houses for five to six years before a tenant purchase scheme is brought into existence.</P>

      <P>The financing of local authorities overall is far from satisfactory. Over the years there were Government promises to the effect that they would be refunded 100 per cent by the Exchequer whereas they have been refunded to the tune of 69 per cent only. This is a cause of major concern to all local authorities.  Our roads are in a deplorable state, practically impassable, especially county and regional roads. There has been the discontinuation of local improvements schemes, all of which should come under the heading of the Local Loans Fund.</P>

Unfortunately, the funds at present being made available to local authorities to provide housing accommodation are totally inadequate.  Every local authority is in need of massive injections of money in order to keep going.  Being a member of a local authority, having made representations to the county secretary, housing officers and so on, I am aware that the money made available from the Department by way of block grants towards repairs and maintenance of local authority housing is totally inadequate.  I made representations to the county manager, county secretary and housing officer of Sligo County Council to ensure the availability of this £5,000 grant because one sees many pre-1940 houses <Col N="176" /> on which very little maintenance work has been carried out in their lifetime.</P>
      <P>Local authorities carry out a number of small sewerage and water schemes which are an asset to any town or village.  Certainly I know that any small sewerage schemes undertaken by the local authority in my county, with the aid of a grant from the Department, have been much welcomed.  Therefore, I would ask the Minister to make more moneys available for this purpose, which would also lead to the creation of employment.  The same is applicable to water schemes, because there remain many houses throughout the country without a water supply. Therefore, the requisite finance should be made available to local authorities for the provision of these services.  Finally, I would ask the Minister to initiate the survey I have mentioned.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann condemns the Government for their failure to honour specific undertakings in the Joint Programme for Government to halt and reverse the growth of unemployment and reduce the proportion of tax taken under PAYE from the wages and salaries of employees.</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil have put down this motion because of the widespread wish that exists among the general public to see an end to this incompetent, discredited and intensely disliked Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This motion provides every Deputy in the Dáil with the opportunity to vote in sympathy with that overwhelming public feeling.  Every Deputy in this House will have the opportunity to express dissatisfaction with the economic performance of this Government and to indicate by their votes that they want either a change of policy or a change of Government. The choice facing Deputies is clear: they <Col N="177" /> can either vote to condemn the economic policies of this Government or else they can, by their votes, acquiesce in a continuation of permanently high unemployment, taxation and emigration.  They cannot dodge the issue.  This is no time for escape clauses or phony amendments or making speeches one way and voting another.  Deputies can either, for their own narrow, party political reasons, vote to condone disastrous economic and social policies, or they can bring them to an end now.  We want by this amendment to show the voters who is responsible for the present situation dragging on, why this Government are able to hang on to office; and what groups and individuals are keeping them in office when a very large majority of the voters wish to see them gone.</P>
    <P>The two parties in this Government, after the last general election, bargained and negotiated for some time and finally put forward a programme of Government which was the basis of their agreement to form a Coalition Government. It set out what this Government promised to do during their term of office.  In particular, it secured the support of the rank and file of the Labour Party because it contained specific undertakings about social and economic policy.  That document is now in shreds; it is politically irrelevant.  It represents a litany of broken promises and unfulfilled undertakings. At this stage it is only of importance to political historians.</P>
    <P>In our motion we have only selected two of the items in that programme for attention.  We could have included many others, but we wanted to make the issue as straight forward and direct as possible for Deputies and the public by concentrating on these two specific promises which three and a half years after the Government were formed have not been fulfilled.</P>
    <P>This Coalition Government took office on the basis that they would seek to halt and reverse the growth in unemployment and reduce the proportion of total tax being paid by the PAYE sector.</P>
    <P>According to the OECD, late 1982 <Col N="178" /> represented the bottom of the international recession.  That also happens to be the moment at which this Government took office.  While in many other countries there has been a significant recovery, Ireland four years later is still as deeply as ever in recession.</P>
    <P>When this Government took office unemployment was at a high level, 170,000.  Since then it has risen steadily and is still rising.  It has increased by 30 per cent; and that figure, of course, takes no account of emigration.  If emigration, running now at 30,000 or more a year, were taken into account, it would be seen that there has not even been a significant slow down in the growth of unemployment. The promise was to halt the growth and reverse the trend so that we should now be well below the 170,000 figure. That has not happened.  If emigration were taken into account it is clear that the rate of growth has not been halted.</P>
    <P>The rise of 3,100 in the seasonally adjusted rise of unemployment in May of this year shows that the growth even in visible unemployment has not been halted let alone reversed.</P>
    <P>This Government are acting in a disgraceful manner in not revealing the actual extent of emigration at present. We all know from our personal experience and observation &mdash; we only have to go to one of our airports or seaports &mdash; that emigration is running at unprecedented levels.  Deputies will tell of different parts of the country where parishes are no longer able to field a full team because so many young people have emigrated. It is almost certainly about 30,000 a year.  In this connection I am talking about permanent emigration &mdash; people who have left this country for good &mdash; and not the seasonal movement of young people looking for temporary employment.</P>
    <P>This Government will not come clean on this serious issue.  They will not give the true picture even though they know what it is.  Were it not for this haemorrhage of emigration, the figure of 230,000 now given as the number of unemployed would be far greater.  It is true to say that the real number of persons unemployed <Col N="179" /> at the present time must be somewhere between a quarter of a million and 300,000.  If everything is taken into account &mdash; the registered unemployed, the level of emigration and those who are artificially taken off the live register because of schemes of one kind or another&mdash;in the region of 300,000 people are being denied the opportunity to find permanent employment in their own country.  That figure in itself is a total condemnation of this Government, their economic policies and performance.  By itself and without taking into account any of the other ghastly mistakes, blunders and misjudgments of which they have been guilty, it would justify this Dáil in ending the term of office of this administration today.</P>
    <P>This Government were formed on the basis of halting and reducing unemployment. That was probably the most important single undertaking they gave and the most clearcut reason why they were able to form a coalition.  They have failed to do that and, therefore, they are no longer entitled to the support or confidence of Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>It would be bad enough if this Government were honestly trying to reduce the levels of unemployment but were being prevented by circumstances from doing so.  But that is not the case.  The policies which this Government are implementing are actually hostile to employment. Time and time again they have, either by deliberate action in pulling the plug or by refusal to act when they should have, added to the level of unemployment directly by their behaviour.  The last three and a half years present a picture of economic devastation, of close-down after close-down, bankruptcy after bankruptcy, redundancies and more redundancies, dole queues lengthening, while an aloof monetarist Government stood back as a matter of deliberate policy and let it all happen without lifting a finger.</P>
    <P>The programme of Government also specifically undertook to reduce the proportion of total tax which is paid by the PAYE sector.  That it has completely failed to do.  During their term of office <Col N="180" /> over the last three and a half years personal taxation has been savagely increased.  There was no reduction, as promised.  They did not make any positive move to reduce the burden on the PAYE sector &mdash; in fact, they have done exactly the reverse.  They have piled more and more burdens onto wage and salary earners to the point where they are now by far the most heavily taxed group of taxpayers in the entire European Community.</P>
    <P>The proportion of tax taken in income tax and levies rose from 36.8 per cent of total tax in 1982 to 40.5 per cent of tax in 1986.  Within the income tax category the estimated proportion of tax from PAYE as opposed to income tax from farmers and self-employed has risen from 87 per cent in 1982 to 90.3 per cent in 1986.  They are not my figures, they were given in an oral answer by the predecessor to the Minister for Finance on 20 February 1986.</P>
    <P>Income tax from PAYE as a proportion of total tax has increased from 31.3 per cent in 1982 to 32.3 per cent in 1986. There was no reduction in the proportion there.  These figures do not however, include levies deducted at source.  If these are included, with the same percentage in each year attributed to PAYE, then income tax, including levies, has risen from just 32 per cent to over 34 per cent of tax revenue in the four years, all of this in the context of a substantial increase in the overall tax burden.</P>
    <P>Many people would have taken the pledge in the Joint Programme for Government to mean an absolute reduction in the amount of tax under PAYE. It would have been fair to read that assumption into it.  In fact, when it is adjusted for inflation the amount of tax to be taken under PAYE in 1986 is about 25 per cent higher than in 1982.  Whatever way one looks at it, whatever basis for comparison one uses, the result is that this Coalition of Fine Gael and Labour have not fulfilled their tax pledges.  The opposite is the case.  There has been a massive increase in taxation, including a substantial increase in the tax paid by those on PAYE.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="181" /> This motion deals with these two major planks in the Coalition's programme for Government on which they have reneged. If, however, any Deputy might not be totally convinced on the basis of those two issues alone, let me give a brief outline of other areas of that infamous programme in which promises have not been fulfilled either.</P>
    <P>The current budget deficit, far from being phased out, was at its highest level ever last year, £1,284 million, or just over 8 per cent of GNP.  The second chapter of the programme states that the Government will concentrate upon the achievement of recovery at the outset of their period in office.  Four years on there is still no sign of recovery.  There was also the promise of an additional £100 million to be spent on areas of defective infrastructure. I am certain some Deputies will have forgotten that the Government were to allocate an extra £100 million to areas where the infrastructure appeared defective.  Instead, the whole capital programme has been cut by one third. Far from the undertaking that indirect taxes would be minimised, they have been greatly increased.  VAT, in particular, was savagely increased on a number of occasions.  Many of the other undertakings on tax were not implemented, such as, &ldquo;all income taxation to be on current year basis&rdquo; or &ldquo;expansion of full PRSI to the Civil Service&rdquo;.  A tax on derelict sites has not been implemented. We were promised that 30,000 houses would be built each year.  I heard the Tánaiste reiterate that promise; but, in fact, output has fallen to less than 24,000 per annum.  The Book of Estimates has not been produced and, obviously, will not been produced in September as promised. There is no longer time to make good these pledges, many of which are far out of reach.  Clinging on will not improve the electoral prospects of the parties in Government or those who keep them there &mdash; I note I am addressing empty benches at the moment &mdash; but only accentuate popular anger and resentment. The stated basis on which Fine Gael and Labour agreed to govern no <Col N="182" /> longer exists.  Surely, it is time to recognise that clear and simple fact.</P>
    <P>I want to avail of this debate to once again nail the untruth which is constantly repeated by the Government and, in particular, by the Taoiseach about the history of the public finances of this country in recent times.  The Taoiseach is consistently dishonest and deceitful on this issue.</P>
    <P>Recently, on a carefully stage managed television phone-in, with all the trappings suitably provided by the faithful RTE, he again sought to distort the truth.  The figures clearly show that an overwhelming portion of our present national debt was borrowed by Governments of which Deputy Dr. Fitzgerald was either Taoiseach or a prominent and influential member.  I have, on a number of occasions in this House, quoted from statements by the Taoiseach when he was a member of the 1973-77 Coalition Government in which he advocated budget deficit financing and foreign borrowing to meet the budget deficits. He has never denied these statements. Nevertheless, he has the audacity to continue to mislead the public about the position regarding borrowing and the national debt and the real history of what has happened.  Those statements, which he has not denied, can now go on a par with his famous statement, recently unearthed, that in fact he is against divorce.</P>
    <P>Though there has been a massive campaign to conceal the fact, the truth is that our current financial difficulties had their origin in 1973.  It was then the major upsurge in the national debt and foreign borrowing began.  The total foreign debt is now £8.4 billion and Coalition Governments have been responsible for 63 per cent of that amount; nearly two-thirds of it.</P>
    <P>Of the increase in the total national debt by borrowing that took place in the period 1973 to 1985, the two Coalition Governments accounted for 59 per cent, while 41 per cent was borrowed by Fianna Fáil Governments.</P>
    <P>In three years of this present Coalition to the end of 1985 the national debt has <Col N="183" /> increased from £12.8 billion to £20.4 billion. That is an increase of over £8 billion in the last three and a half years, which is the equivalent of the entire national debt incurred under all Fianna Fáil Governments put together.  Each year, the Government is borrowing about £650 million, one third of the annual total of £2 billion, just to pay unemployment benefit alone.  That is some sensible economic policy.  The cost of unemployment payments and of disability benefit has increased by 44 per cent since 1982 in real terms, discounting inflation.  If the growth in unemployment had been halted as promised, the payments saved and the extra revenue would have brought down the current budget deficit to £700 or £800 million or 4 per cent of GNP instead of £1,250 million as it is this year.</P>
    <P>Not content with distorting the position about borrowing, the Taoiseach in his radio interview claimed that the reason taxes were so high was &mdash; and I quote &ldquo;because between 1977 and 1981 you had an increase in the volume of public spending of 40 per cent.  Once a Government gets into office and literally goes mad like that, as no other Government I've ever heard of in any democracy had done, the clearing up of that mess takes a very long time&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach's figure of 40 per cent is accurate.  The increase in current day to day expenditure on supply services for the period between 1977 and 1981 was 40 per cent but, what the Taoiseach did not say on that stage managed TV programme was that day to day public expenditure grew by 43 per cent 1973 and 1977 under a Government of which the Taoiseach was a member, though he now talks as if he never heard of such a Government.  The present Minister for Finance was not a member of that Government but I am sorry to have to tell the former Taoiseach, Liam Cosgrave, and all the upstanding men who were members of that Coalition from 1973 to 1977, that the Taoiseach today has forgotten all about them &mdash; they never existed.</P>
    <P>Mistakes of economic management <Col N="184" /> may have been made at different times by different Governments, but in the 1977-81 period there was a substantial increase in employment of 68,000 under the Fianna Fáil Government, a stark contrast with today when this Government borrow to pay unemployment benefit, not to invest.  If the Taoiseach considers that the level of current expenditure is too high, why has he not availed himself of the last four budgets to cut it?  The fact is that current expenditure has increased in volume terms by a further 7 per cent since this Government took office.</P>
    <P>This Government, when they came into office, published their bogus Programme for Government and immediately discarded it.  Having brought the Labour Party into the position of support, they proceeded to subvert that support into supporting totally different policies. The world has been in the economic recession for a long time and nobody would expect this country, which has a small open economy and is very dependent on international trade for its prosperity, not to suffer from the effects of that world economic recession.  But I believe it can be clearly and categorically demonstrated that the effects of that recession in our case were grossly exaggerated by the unsound policies pursued by this Government.</P>
    <P>In their obsession with the budgetary position, they discarded and threw aside every other economic objective and social consideration, and the formula that they applied to deal with the public finances was basically wrong.  They sought to correct the imbalance by imposing higher taxes.  That policy, as we pointed out at the time and can now clearly be shown, was self-defeating.  It started a downward spiral which has fed upon itself consistently since and brought us now to this appalling, dreadful state of permanent mass unemployment, high emigration and high taxation.</P>
    <P>The latest OECD outlook shows that in 1985 Ireland experienced the worst growth performance in the entire OECD, with a drop in real GNP of 0.7 per cent. We had the distinction of being the only country with a negative growth rate. <Col N="185" /> Despite a major propaganda campaign &mdash; this should influence Deputies in how they vote &mdash; there is no indication that this year will show any significant improvement, despite the windfall drop in oil prices.  We all know where the information came from on which the OECD reports are based.  How far out the OECD forecasts are likely to be, can be shown by reading out a couple of sentences from their May 1986 Bulletin:</P>
    <P>Private consumption growth may accelerate to 3½ per cent, buoyed by lower inflation and a projected recovery in agricultural income.  Investment is also expected to display more strength, primarily as a result of a pick-up in construction.</P>
    <P>Projected recovery in agricultural income, a pick up in construction? According to the chief economist of the IFA there will be at least a 5 per cent drop in farm incomes this year with milk production to the end of May already down 11 per cent.  As for the pick-up in construction, the CIF are forecasting an 8 per cent fall in building activity this year, with current sales falling for the fourth month in a row.  Add to that a significant drop in tourism.  A drop of a quarter in the number of American tourists means a 5 per cent drop in total tourism revenue.</P>
    <P>The benefits of lower inflation have not been passed on either to the productive sector or the consumer, because interest rates, despite today's reductions, remain extremely high.  The average rate of inflation is likely to be 3 per cent in 1986 and the real interest rate for productive borrowing will still be 8 per cent or 9 per cent and for the private borrower 12 per cent.  Three times under this Administration rates have risen sharply: in the spring of 1983, in the spring of 1985 and the spring of 1986.</P>
    <P>The Government's vacillating exchange rate policy, about which there is still a lot of confusion and uncertainty, has contributed to these periodic sharp rises in interest rates, which have led to an even wider divergence between the rate of inflation and the rate of return of <Col N="186" /> investment required to cover borrowings. Let us not forget the economic growth of the sixties was fuelled by low-interest rates.  Factors contributing to persistent high interest rates today are the rise of the current budget deficit which pushes up the price of domestic funds, the DIRT tax, and uncertainty about exchange rate movements.  It is very well to have glowing headlines about a reduction in interest rates, but that is not what matters.  It is the competitive aspect that matters, and if real interest rates in Ireland are 8 per cent to 9 per cent how can Irish industry and the Irish economy be expected to compete with nations whose rates are infinitely lower?</P>
    <P>Evidence at the moment does not support the contention that there will be an upswing in manufacturing output this year.  The latest quarterly figures to the end of February show stagnation.  Our OECD friends talk of the &ldquo;expected recovery of the high technology sector&rdquo; but exports of office machines and automatic data processing equipment showed only a 3 per cent increase in the first four months of this year.  If we look at retail sales, the latest figures show a negligible 0.1 per cent increase in volume compared with the preceding three month period.</P>
    <P>It is difficult, no matter what the national handlers and their sympathetic commentators in the newspapers say, to see any real upswing in the Irish economy this year.  Expectations of a slight increase in employment do not seem to be justified in the light of what is happening in the different sectors.  What we have at the moment is an economy that is completely failing to respond to favourable developments in the external environment, because the policies of this Government are wrong and are giving us the worst economic performance of any country in Europe.  That precisely is why this motion is before you.  We need to change those policies before we get anything worth while going.  I hope that when the Minister intervenes he will not again claim credit for lowering rates of inflation, because the Minister knows as well as I that he has nothing whatever to do with the lowering of rates of inflation. <Col N="187" /> Rates of inflation are declining internationally and Ireland is following suit.  I hope the Minister will not have the audacity to claim any credit for falling rates of inflation.</P>

      <P>In my view any Deputy who does not vote for this motion will be going against the wishes of the majority of his or her constituents.  For selfish political reasons, they will be voting for a continuation of policies that have failed, that are seen to have failed and are rejected by the people.  If every Deputy in this House who rejects the economic and social policies of this Government were to vote accordingly, then those policies would be rejected by Dáil Éireann and would have to be changed.  That is the issue that is before the House and before every Deputy here.  I challenge every Deputy here to face that issue.  A vote for our motion will be a vote against the disastrous economic policies of this Government.  A vote for any of these flimsy, fictitious type of amendments will be an attempt to dodge the real issue we are asking the House to face this evening and tomorrow evening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been stated that Fianna Fáil are being opportunistic in putting down this motion.  It is difficult to understand what exactly is meant by such a statement. At present, there are in Dáil Éireann, a majority of Deputies who, at one time or another, have condemned the economic policies of this Government.  That is the factual position.  We in Fianna Fáil are seeking to give that majority of Deputies an opportunity to express their rejection and condemnation of Government economic policy in a formal way by passing this motion.  That seems to us to be completely in accordance with normal parliamentary practice.  We believe that it is perfectly valid to mobilise the opposition that exists in this House to the disastrous policies of this Government and to ask the Dáil to give formal expression <Col N="188" /> to that opposition.  I do not see how anyone will call that opportunistic.</P>
    <P>I would like to suggest that if anyone is being opportunistic on this occasion it is those who, even though they have condemned and spoken strongly against this Government and their policies and performance, nevertheless will not come out clearly and vote in accordance with the views they have so often expressed because their own narrow party interests dictate that they should keep this Government in office until it suits their electoral purposes to get rid of them.  In my view, that clearly qualifies as being opportunistic.  I am talking about Deputies of parties here who have trenchantly condemned the disastrous economic and social policies of this Government but who will not now give expression to that condemnation by voting for our motion.</P>
    <P>Attempts will, of course, be made in this debate to misrepresent Fianna Fáil's approach to our economic problems and the thrust of our economic policies.  I believe, however, that the programme of economic recovery which I outlined at the Fianna Fáil Ard Fheis is not alone right but is also an urgent national necessity.</P>
    <P>I cannot accept the views of the new Right about the economic situation.  They may be able to look with equanimity on a society which is enduring permanent mass unemployment, high emigration and widespread hardship throughout all sections of the population and from that viewpoint advocate policies of non-intervention by the Government.  Fianna Fáil are not prepared, as are the new Right, to look unconcerned on this appalling situation as if it were the natural order of things or dictated to us by some unchal-lengeable economic doctrine.  The policies pursued by this Government are, in our view, completely inappropriate.  We must try out of desperation if nothing else to devise an alternative, a policy which will ensure that whatever borrowing is undertaken by the State is used for investment and job creation and not to pay for rising unemployment, as is now happening. We have analysed the situation and consulted with those whom we know <Col N="189" /> from experience to be knowledgeable and expert in their understanding of the Irish economic situation and its special features.  We have identified the course of action we intend to pursue.</P>
    <P>First of all, we see the most important economic task and the most difficult one to be the development of our economy, so that it can provide jobs and reasonable standards of living for our population. We do not believe that this will be easy and, in fact, I clearly stated in my Ard Fheis speech that I saw it as a tremendous challenge.</P>
    <P>The primary concern of our policy will be to develop our natural resources such as agriculture, fisheries, fish-farming, forestry, minerals and hydrocarbons, to create a spirit of enterprise, to develop quality products using as far as possible local expertise and raw materials and to ensure the application of high-technology to everything we produce on the farm and in the factory.  We intend to take full advantage of the intelligence and adaptability of our young labour force, the most computer-literate in the world, in developing high-technology science-based modern industry.  We will create a climate for investment which will encourage wealth to stay and be usefully deployed in the Irish economy for the benefit of the Irish people.</P>
    <P>Our strategy involves selective investment but it does not involve massive public expenditure, or the indiscriminate raising of aggregate demand, but rather a raising of the supply capacity of the economy over the period of our programme.  We argue also that selective taxation reductions and tax incentives can be financially and economically rewarding and that there are clear examples of what can be achieved in this regard.  As regards our intention to invest immediately in the building and construction industry, what we propose is selective investment in projects that will enhance the productive potential of the Irish economy.  Much of this could be achieved by private funding, if necessary. There is also the very important factor, one that seems to have been completely <Col N="190" /> ignored by this Government, that structural development can be achieved at half its economic cost because the EC will help to finance suitable projects.  That is an idiotic aspect of the economic policies of this Government, that in every region in the country there are sound projects to improve the infrastructure that could be started tomorrow morning and to which the EC will contribute 50 per cent. However, this Government will not undertake them because they will not subscribe the other 50 per cent.  That is economic madness, apart from all the other things of which this Government are guilty.</P>
    <P>The economic and social policies pursued by this Government have done enormous psychological damage.  They have brought confrontation and divisiveness, born out of frustration.  Our nation has lost its cohesion, people are turning against each other, each section blaming some other section for the present mess. There is no longer any sense of national purpose, no overall consensus, no broad agreement on what we should be trying to achieve.  The very high number of people seeking to emigrate is perhaps the most worrying manifestation of this negative and depressing outlook.  It indicates a high level of disillusion and loss of confidence in the future.  It is the inevitable outcome of three and a half years of hopelessly bad government.  This Government act constantly to worsen the situation.  They are divisive in practically everything they do.  Fianna Fáil clearly see it to be one of our priorities to reestablish a sense of unity of purpose, based on sound economic planning which can be seen to be in the interests of all sections of the community.</P>
    <P>I now ask all those Deputies who reject both the policies and performance of this Government, who wish to see an end to permanent mass unemployment, allied to emigration and high taxation, who deplore the widespread hardship in the community, to demonstrate this in the only way that matters &mdash; by voting for our motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. J. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann approves the policies of Government to develop the economy, in the face of difficult conditions internationally and domestically, and, in particular the measures it has taken (a) to promote investment and employment and (b) to curb the growth of public expenditure and, thus, of the requirement for high taxation&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The rhetoric of this House tends, all too often, to display a total disregard for facts and realities, especially when it comes to the economy.  This evening and tomorrow we will, no doubt, be assailed from the benches opposite with pictures of an economy in deep crisis and allegations that this is the result of Government policies.  The truth, however, is that the real crisis was the one which faced us in the early eighties, when we took control &mdash; and that is a most apt phrase &mdash; of the financial affairs of a country which stood at the edge of a precipice.  Today, by contrast, it is well on the mend and we can look forward to a period of sustained growth and progress towards all our major economic and social objectives, provided commonsense continues to guide economic policy.</P>
      <P>When the Government took office towards the end of 1982 the economy was in the grip of a severe recession.  There had been an abject failure to make the necessary adjustments to absorb the oil price shock of the late seventies.  We had sought to cushion ourselves against reality through increased borrowing and increased spending.  The consequence of this was that this Government inherited a huge public finance problem with builtin pressures for further growth in expenditure and in borrowing.</P>

    <P>From the very beginning the Government have followed a consistent policy to cope with an extremely difficult situation. This policy has been reflected in successive budgets and in the national plan, <i>Building on Reality.</i>  The main elements <Col N="192" /> of this policy have been first, to minimise the effects of the recession and, within the constraints imposed, to provide the best possible environment for employment; secondly, to exercise a prudent control over the public finances; thirdly, to reform the taxation system, and, fourthly, to protect the position of those on low incomes.</P>
    <P>The facts of the economic situation which we inherited speak for themselves. Firstly, public sector borrowing, at over 20 per cent of GNP, was running at levels more commonly seen in Third World countries than in a modern developed economy.  Secondly, inflation had been around 20 per cent annually, eroding our international competitiveness and causing large scale job losses.  Thirdly, industrial production was stagnant; and, fourthly, our balance of payments deficit, which in 1981 was almost 15 per cent of GNP, and would have been higher still if I had not taken action in my mini-budget of July of that year, was of a magnitude which threatened national solvency. Indeed, if we had continued to accumulate overseas debt on that scale, the cost of servicing it would within a few short years have gobbled up a frightening proportion of our export earnings.</P>
    <P>Surely, it might be argued, there were some benefits from the splurge of deficit financed spending which we inherited. Was it not generating jobs and bringing us closer to the goal of full employment which had been promised?  Far from it, according to the statistics available.  At the end of 1982 the level of unemployment was twice what it had been in late 1979, when Deputy Haughey warned of the policies which he then commenced to implement.  The number of persons out of work was, in fact, spiralling upwards with an increase of almost 40,000 a year when Deputy Haughey left office.  As the House is aware, the rate of increase is now more like one-tenth the amount which was the case when this Government came to office.  Therefore, it is surprising to hear Deputy Haughey speak with such eloquence about the employment problem when his own record &mdash; as <Col N="193" /> witnessed by the increase in unemployment when he vacated office &mdash; was that his words were not matched by his deeds when he had the opportunity to do something.</P>
    <P>If one had been able to pick a time in which to correct serious imbalances in the public finances no one would have chosen the past few years.  As an incoming Government we could not, unfortunately, afford the luxury of making that choice: the nation's problems were much too serious to defer corrective action to a more propitious or easier time.  If the prevailing trends had been left unchecked, the financial imbalances would rapidly have escalated to insoluble proportions.  We had to move against a distinctly unfavourable international background &mdash; the deepest and most prolonged economic recession since the thirties, which gave way to an only modest recovery.  Between 1981 and 1985, for instance, real GDP in the European Community showed average growth of only 1½ per cent, about half the figure for the previous ten years.</P>
    <P>International monetary developments, moreover, compounded the problems which we faced from the legacy of debt. Real interest rates shot up in the eighties, so that the burden which the economy and the Exchequer had to bear became crushing.  Real rates in the European Community's money markets last year were positive to the extent of over 4 per cent, a far cry from the negative cost that applied in the seventies.  Unfortunately, in the eighties we had to pay much higher interest rates on debts accumulated in the seventies and the first two or three years of the eighties than was the case when that borrowing was first undertaken.  That is something which was conveniently ignored by Deputy Haughey in his lengthy, just completed, treatise on the subject.</P>
    <P>The experience of the last few years should be a salutory warning to those who contemplate, let alone advocate, either reducing taxation or increasing expenditure by means of borrowed money.  Given the huge burden of debt which this <Col N="194" /> Government inherited, as well as the consequent increases in taxation to service this debt, together with the other measures needed to bring order to the public finances, is it any wonder that unemployment increased as it did between 1982 and 1985?  The experience since the late seventies has shown very clearly that we cannot buy sustainable employment with borrowed money.  A cut in taxation or an increase in spending, which is financed by additional borrowing, is not reduced in any way in regard to the amount of borrowing involved simply by using the adjective &ldquo;selective&rdquo;&mdash; talking about &ldquo;selective tax cuts&rdquo; and &ldquo;selective increases in expenditure&rdquo;, as if this word had a magical quality which rendered what one could not pay for capable of being paid for simply because the word &ldquo;selective&rdquo; is used.  Deputy Haughey uses the word &ldquo;selective&rdquo; as if it had some form of virtue-giving quality which enabled what otherwise was incapable of being paid for capable of being paid for. That is a form of self-deception&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Very briefly off the deck, but I am back again and here to stay.  I would advise the Deputies opposite not to give assistance to this side of the House by interrupting me.  They would only provoke me into saying things that I would not regret saying but which some of my hearers might regret hearing.</P>
      <P>There is a strong, mutually re-enforcing relationship between high taxation and high unemployment.  High taxation acts as a disincentive to employees, who see an ever-increasing wedge driven between their gross pay and take home income.  Nearly all of us in this House are agreed that progress in tackling unemployment depends very much on success in curbing this high level of taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The contrast between the economic <Col N="196" /> situation we inherited and that which we have brought about through our responsible and enlightened policies is very striking.  The economy is now firmly on the path of sustained growth.  By the end of this year, we will be able to look back on three years in which real GDP has expanded at an average rate of over 3 per cent, rather better than we had envisaged in the document <i>Building on Reality 1985-1987.</i></P>
    <P>A particularly encouraging feature is that the recovery has broadened out from one based largely on exports to embrace a strong pick-up in domestic demand. Last year consumer spending grew in real terms for the first time since 1981 and, so far in 1986, retail sales are showing an even stronger increase &mdash; by over 3 per cent in the first two months of the year.</P>
    <P>The prospects for an all-round improvement in the economy in 1986 are better than they have been for many years.  This brighter outlook has been confirmed by the forecasts published recently by a number of domestic and international agencies some of which Deputy Haughey was kind enough to quote as if to advertise them but not to demolish them.  Economic growth is likely to accelerate and real GDP could grow by over 3 per cent.  Domestic demand will be boosted by the improvement in consumer confidence, the rise in real incomes, the fall in interest rates and the measures introduced by the Government to assist building activity and employment.  Inflation will continue to fall and, provided crude oil prices and exchange rates remain broadly stable, the annual rate of inflation should be down to about 2 per cent in the second half of the year.</P>
    <P>The fall in oil prices has also improved the prospects for our major trading partners. This will provide us with an opportunity to expand our exports, provided we adjust our costs in line with the new price regime which prevails in international markets.  I am confident that this year will see a substantial growth in the trade surplus and that the balance of payments deficit will continue to lessen. <Col N="197" /> Our oil import bill will be reduced dramatically and the overall deficit might be about half the 3½ per cent of GNP recorded in 1985.  I believe that this more buoyant outlook will be reflected in a substantial increase in employment in 1986.</P>
    <P>The Government's primary objective has been, and remains, to halt and then reverse the upward spiral of unemployment. We adhere to our conviction that the best, indeed the only, way to meet the employment challenge is to create the right economic environment for job creation.  Responsible economic policies are a fundamental prerequisite, but we have not stopped there not do we intend to so so.  The Government have moved in several areas to further the development of the economy.  Among these was the publication &mdash; for the first time by any Government in Ireland &mdash; of a White Paper on Tourism.  This means that tourism will now be a central part of Government policy making, reflecting its potential for further employment creation.</P>
    <P>Industrial policy in respect of manufacturing and traded services has been modified to accord better with the needs of the economy and, in particular, to give us a more dynamic indigenous sector. The emphasis has been shifted from grant aiding fixed asset investment towards encouraging instead technology acquisition, promoting the development of international services and small businesses, and encouraging research and development.  The Industrial Development Act, 1986, which became law last month, provides for two significant new measures, namely, technology acquisition grants and employment grants for small firms.</P>
    <P>Last October the Government introduced a package of measures specifically designed to boost employment creation in the near term.  These measures have been very successful; 80,000 completed application forms for home improvement grants have been received to date and the PRSI exemption scheme for employers has had the effect of reducing the unemployment total by close on 3,000.  This <Col N="198" /> year's budget and the Finance Bill contain a wide range of measures designed to improve incentives for enterprise and investment and so promote wealth creation and employment growth in Ireland.</P>
    <P>In the 1986 Finance Act, which has recently been enacted, there are a number of incentives to encourage share investment in manufacturing business and to promote financial participation by workers.  There is an extension of the business expansion scheme first introduced in 1984, a new scheme to encourage research and product development and a reduced charge on dividends from manufacturing companies.  In addition, the tax terms for profit sharing schemes have been improved and a new scheme has been introduced to provide tax relief for investment by employees.  These incentives are designed to encourage risk investment in Irish-owned businesses, to improve relations in the workplace and so create a better climate for greater economic development and more employment.</P>
    <P>The available indicators make it clear that the corner has been turned as far as employment is concerned.  Figures for the last quarter of 1985 suggest that stabilisation of manufacturing employment is a realistic prospect.  The unemployment figures also give cause for optimism for the future.  The average year-on-year increase in the live register in the first five months of this year was only about a third of that in the comparable period last year and represented a mere one-seventh of the peak year-on-year increases in unemployment of over 40,000 recorded in late 1982 when Deputy Haughey left office and early 1983.</P>
    <P>When the wide ranging and imaginative measures taken by this Government take full effect it will be seen that, in this area as in others, the objectives of the national plan are realistic.  I believe that there is good reason for confidence that the Irish economy, if managed properly, can generate enough employment to meet the needs of our growing labour force and give those now out of work the prospect of returning to gainful activity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me draw, if I may, a contrast between our approach to creating employment and that displayed on the other side of the House.  Our aim, with the various incentives that I have put in place in the tax area and the incentives that my colleague, Deputy Michael Noonan, has put in place in the manufacturing grants, are designed to get Irish people to put their money into creating jobs.  As far as I can see, the objective on the other side of the House is to get foreigners to lend money so that the Government, not the people, can put this in place.  I believe that selective investment should be selected by people who are selecting investments in order to make money for themselves because they have a viable prospect of selling the results of that investment.  That is a far better way of creating durable jobs than the quick fix approach demonstrated on the other side of the House where money borrowed from foreign banks is spent by a domestic Government in a way that has no real selectivity and no real prospect of succeeding in its objective by comparison with the decentralised and much more effective approach to employment creation which underlies the approach in this year's Finance Bill, in the White Paper on Industrial Policy, the White Paper on Tourism and all the other measures designed to improve fundamentally the efficiency of our economy rather than creating foreign financed palliatives of the kind advocated by Deputy Haughey and his associates.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>In the Programme for Government the primary emphasis was on achieving a better distribution of taxation. The Government policy, as enunciated in the budget of 1983, was to devise tax arrangements under which the heaviest burden would be carried by those best able to pay.  While the Government would have wished at the time to reduce levels <Col N="200" /> of taxation on some categories immediately, the reality was that the imbalance in the State's finance did not allow immediate tax concessions on any scale, unless public expenditure were to be curtailed to an unacceptable extent.</P>
      <P>In assessing the Government's record on taxation, it is essential in the first instance to reflect on the economic and financial situation which they inherited. The economy was in a grip of severe recession.  The financial situation was a matter of extreme concern so that the Government's room for manoeuvre in framing a budget strategy was very limited. There had been a manifest failure previously to adjust living standards to the oil price shock of the late seventies; the growth in borrowing was most disturbing and was calling our credit standing into question.  Efforts to stimulate demand by pouring more money into the system had proved counter-productive, as Deputy Haughey warned they would before he changed course in 1979.</P>
      <P>There has been much criticism of the Government for failing to give due attention to the reports of the Commission on Taxation. This criticism is unjustified. The first report of the commission was published in 1982 and the fifth and final report towards the end of last year.</P>
      <P>The main findings of the commission were that there should be a single rate of direct taxation and single rate of VAT and that self-assessment should be introduced on a wide scale.  In all the commission made several hundred recommendations and they emphasised that their package could only be introduced over an extended period.  As stated repeatedly, the Government are in full sympathy with the general thrust of the commission's findings.  These lead towards a tax system which would be more simple, more equitable and more efficient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government have reservations, however, about the merits of a single rate of direct taxation in particular because of the possible impact of this on the less well off and the relatively high rate that would <Col N="201" /> be required to maintain the existing revenue yield.  The commission's reports are complex, they raise issues of fundamental importance and it is unfortunate that some commentators have dealt with them in a very facile manner without any proper analysis of the consequences of implementing these reports in full.</P>
    <P>Government policy on taxation was again outlined in the national plan.  The principal commitments given then were that there would be no increase in the overall level of taxation and that bands and allowances would be adjusted each year so that the overall income tax burden on taxpayers would not increase.  The Government have more than honoured these commitments.</P>
    <P>There have been major changes in the taxation system since publication of the plan.  In 1985 there were fundamental changes in the income tax and VAT structures. The emphasis was on major simplification and a reduction in the highest rates.  The number of income tax rates was reduced to three; and the VAT system was streamlined by reducing the number of rates from six to three.</P>
    <P>These were changes of great importance and they were very much in sympathy with the thinking of the Commission on Taxation.  It is the Government's intention that further streamlining will take place as soon as circumstances allow.</P>
    <P>This year's budget contained real benefits for the PAYE taxpayer in particular. The Government decided that substantial reductions in income tax should be the priority so as to provide for real increases in disposable incomes.  To provide the revenue needed for these increases, it was necessary to increase substantially the tax yield from the activities of the financial institutions.</P>
    <P>The principal income tax changes are that the income levy has been discontinued; the PAYE allowance has been increased from £600 to £700; the personal allowance has been increased from £3,000 to £4,000 for a married couple and from £1,900 to £2,000 for a single person; the top rate of tax has been reduced from 60 per cent to 58 per cent; the 35 per cent <Col N="202" /> tax band, which is the standard rate, has been widened from £9,000 to £9,400 for married persons and from £4,500 to £4,700 for single persons.</P>
    <P>In addition, the age exemption limits were increased and the age allowance was doubled.  This income tax package is costing £121 million this year and £205 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>The argument will be made that the yield from income tax will be higher in 1986 than in 1985.  This argument is facile. Of course, the yield will be higher and there are obvious reasons for this.</P>
    <P>First of all, the 1986 figure includes a substantial contribution from the retention tax, which is classified as income tax although it is not.  The yield is also higher because of a number of other factors, principally the fact that wages are moving ahead of general inflation.  Obviously, income tax yields will increase as wage levels rise.</P>
    <P>What matters is the tax imposition on individual taxpayers this year <i>vis-á-vis</i> the past income tax year.  For all taxpayers there are improvements in disposable income.  I would also like to draw attention here to the new child benefit scheme; since April there has been a 25 per cent increase in the child benefit and this has been of particular advantage to lower income families.</P>
    <P>There were also other changes of significance in the 1986 budget.  There was further rationalisation of the VAT system through the reduction of tax on some items.  It was, unfortunately, necessary to increase the standard rate because of revenue requirements.  All the VAT changes have not get come into effect. We can look forward to reductions in the VAT on meals and a range of personal services from 1 July.</P>
    <P>Substantial improvements in tax collection and enforcement procedures were announced by the Taoiseach in Dáil Éireann last autumn and these are now being implemented.  Some of these changes required amending legislation &mdash; for instance, the surcharge on late payments &mdash; and the appropriate provisions are in the Finance Act.  Arrangements are now completed for extending the requirement <Col N="203" /> of a tax clearance certificate to sub-contractors.</P>
    <P>Tax levels continue to be unduely high. It is Government policy to reduce these levels progressively by widening a tax base and improving the efficiency of collection. Further reform of the tax system is high on the Government's list of priorities. It is wishful thinking to expect that there can be dramatic reductions in tax levels overnight.</P>
    <P>Dramatic reductions could only be achieved either through intolerable cuts in public expenditure or further increases in borrowing.  These approaches simply add to our problems.  There is need for tax reform; there will be further reform with the emphasis on reducing tax levels, especially for those who are now carrying a high burden, and on moving towards a manifestly fairer system.</P>
    <P>The priority accorded to social policy by this Government is particularly evident in our record in relation to social welfare recipients.  From the outset our Programme for Government undertook to maintain the living standards of that section of the community which relies on welfare payments for its long-term support.  Between mid-1983 and mid-1986, pensions and other long-term payments were increased by over 27 per cent. Inflation over this period is estimated at approximately 18 per cent so that pensioners have got a real increase, over and above inflation, of about 8 per cent.  The long-term unemployed got a real increase of over 12 per cent over the same period.</P>
    <P>Similarly, this year's increase of 4 per cent for pensioners from July 1986 is to cover the period mid-1986 to mid-1987. It is now expected that inflation over that 12-month period will be only about 1 per cent.  Not only have we honoured our commitments to welfare recipients, we have exceeded them &mdash; and this at a time of great constraints upon the public finances.</P>
    <P>A new child benefit payment was introduced as from April this year giving a payment of £15.05 per month for each of the first five children.  This represents an increase of 25 per cent on the children's <Col N="204" /> allowance of £12.05.  The payment in respect of the sixth and subsequent children was increased to £21.75 per month thereby preserving the differential which had till then existed in favour of larger families.  The combination of measures underlying these new payments, together with the net additional Exchequer cost of £11 million in 1986, ensures a more selective distribution of resources: lower income families on social welfare or below the tax threshold benefit while the position of standard rate taxpayers is protected.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should mention one major aspect of social welfare policy which has implications much wider than social provisions. Despite significant increases in social insurance expenditure in recent years, the Government have adhered to their policy of containing the level of PRSI contributions in order to avoid increasing industrial costs.  Apart from minor adjustments in contribution rates to the occupational injuries and redundancy funds, the rates of PRSI for employers, and employees, have not been increased in any of the last four budgets.</P>
    <P>Seeing that many comparisons will be made in this debate, it is useful to reflect on the record of previous administrations. In particular, it is instructive to look at some trends in the period 1977-1981. This was the period in which prudence was thrown to the winds and the emphasis was on spending and borrowing with no regard to the consequences. Between 1977 and 1981 the cost of servicing the national debt increased from £78 million to £250 million.  In other words, in a short period of five years the cost of debt servicing rose by more than 220 per cent.  During this period also there were continuous and serious departures each year from the budget targets.  The credibility of the whole budget process was being undermined.</P>
    <P>The Opposition are most concerned about the treatment of the PAYE taxpayer. If we go back to the period 1977-1981 again, we find that over this period PAYE, as a percentage of all tax paid, rose from less than 30 per cent to nearly <Col N="205" /> 34 per cent.  So, while spending was rising at an exceptional rate and there were enormous overruns on budget deficits, the PAYE taxpayer was still called up to pay an increasing proportion of total taxation.</P>
    <P>Pay increases also ran ahead of inflation during this period.  While the CPI rose by just over 70 per cent, average earnings in manufacturing rose by more than 80 per cent.  Increases in public service numbers were at record levels and there was a policy of job creation just for the sake of increasing job numbers without any regard to efficiency or ultimate cost.</P>
    <P>The spendthrift days would quickly return if we accepted the latest opposition promises.  At the recent Ard Fheis there was a promise of an increase of £200 million in the public capital programme.  In addition, VAT on building would be reduced at a further cost of more than £50 million.  There were further promises &mdash; that two-thirds of all income tax payers would be brought on to the standard rate, that the retention tax would be modified and that cuts in food subsidies would be restored.  Altogether, I estimate that the Ard Fheis promises would add up to £450 million.  It would be instructive if Deputy Haughey had used his opportunity in this debate to tell us how all this would have been paid for.  Perhaps the solution might be to resort to borrowing again as in 1977-1981. We have a right to know how the Opposition would pay for the politics of promises which so dominate the oratory which we heard in this debate.</P>

      <P>In our Programme for Government we are committed to achieving economic growth and higher employment, while exercising a disciplined financial management...</P>
      <P>The statement goes on:</P>
      <P>This policy will require that we... eliminate the current budget deficit ... between now and 1987.</P>
      <P>Eliminating the deficit means both extra taxation, on the one hand, and controlling State expenditure on the other.</P>
      <P>These commitments were extremely explicit and undertaken after the Government assumed office and had an opportunity to assess the realism or otherwise of the promises put forward in that election.</P>
      <P>I would now like, in the time I have available, to review dispassionately their success or otherwise in achieving these self-imposed targets and, on this basis, to ask this House to consider whether it is in Ireland's best interest that it retains its present management or whether it seeks at an early occasion to dismiss that management. I suggest that any management in a company or in a business which produced the results that I am about to lay before this House tonight would meet with only one response from those share-holders at the annual general meeting and that response would be dismissal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government committed themselves to higher employment.  Let us see what happened.  The average level of employment in our manufacturing industries stood at 214,000 in early 1982.  It <Col N="207" /> fell by 27,000 since then to a level of 187,000 in 1985.  Let me select just one other industry, our second largest industry, that is, the construction industry.  When Minister Dukes delivered that 1983 budget speech the index of employment in private building firms stood at 75 per cent.  It has fallen every year since then and now the figure is 49 per cent.  Notwithstanding the inadequate measures taken last year, employment in building and construction has quite clearly been devastated.</P>
    <P>More generally, the recent OECD report clearly shows that employment growth in Ireland from 1983 to 1986 falls dramatically short of that achieved by other EC countries and by the industrial countries taken as a whole.  That is clear from even a cursory glance at the recent OECD outlook publication.</P>
    <P>But let us have a look at the other side of the coin, that is, unemployment.  The Joint Programme for Government pledged itself &ldquo;to reverse the disastrous rise in unemployment&rdquo;.  That disastrous figure was 187,000 people, 60,000 people fewer than the level at which it now stands.  This figure clearly shows that the unemployment rate has risen year by year during the Government's tenure from 12 per cent in 1982 to the present level today of some 17½ per cent.  It is important to point out that the Government, in their amendment here tonight to this motion, blame what they call &ldquo;difficult conditions internationally&rdquo;.  The facts indicate otherwise.  Unemployment rates among the industrial countries as a whole actually declined from 8.8 per cent in 1983 to just over 8 per cent in 1986, and among our EC partners unemployment rates had stabilished at about 11½ per cent, virtually unchanged over the past three years, while we have been galloping towards 17½ per cent.  So much for difficult international circumstances as an excuse.</P>
    <P>By contrast, as I have pointed out, we have seen unemployment rise in Ireland to levels which are today standing at 50 per cent above EC average levels.  It is obvious that unemployment would have been approaching some 300,000 today <Col N="208" /> had it not been for emigration on a scale which is unprecedented in modern times. Let me take this opportunity to remind this House that when the Government came into office there was net inward migration of 2,000 people, that is, people actually returning home to get employment here in Ireland.  Last year, 1985, conservative estimates suggest that some 25,000 people left this country.  Those of us who have witnessed the queues at the United States Embassy of our best and our brightest cannot doubt but that this figure will be exceeded in this year, 1986. I personally estimate from my own resources that the figure will hit 40,000 in the year 1986, which is a figure hauntingly close to that recorded in the late fifties.  I was told recently in a reply to a parliamentary question that the cost of financeing unemployment now stands at £670 million.  That is £13 million a week, near to £2 million a day, just to pay unemployment benefit on the present scale.  That is 27p in every pound of income tax paid by the taxpayer.  Had unemployment remained even at the level at which it was in 1982 the Exchequer would be better off today to the tune of £150 million in saved social welfare per annum.  These are just the direct costs of unemployment; the social, personal and political costs are incalculable.</P>
    <P>The Commission on Taxation called our taxation system a muddle, inefficient and inequitable, and it is this system that lies at the very heart of our present economic problems.  Let me just make three points here.  First, the income tax burden has risen from 36 per cent in 1982 to over 40 per cent in 1986, that is, income tax as a percentage of total tax.  Second, the number of taxpayers paying at above the standard rate has risen from some 25 per cent in 1982 to a staggering 42 per cent today, heading for up to half the Irish taxpayers paying above the standard rate in the years ahead on present policies if they are not changed, and changed drastically.  Third, the number of tax paying units has declined progressively due to unemployment and emigration particularly.  Agencies within and without the country have drawn attention to the <Col N="209" /> disastrous and penal rates of taxation. Indeed, the Minister himself on a number of occasions has accepted this point.  But why is it that the US can plan, undertake and carry through a comprehensive taxation reform programme while we here seem hypnotised by the complexities into engaging in trivial, marginal and very often meaningless so-called taxation reforms?  A comprehensive tax reform is no longer optional in this economy; it is an imperative in resolving our economic dilemmas.  By reform I mean a comprehensive, planned overhaul, undertaken and seen through within the lifetime of the next administration along the general lines of the Commission on Taxation reports.</P>
    <P>In 1983 the Government committed themselves to eliminating the current budget deficit by 1987.  This was a commitment freely undertaken at the outset of their period in Government, taken at a time when they had full access to all the books.  This was no mere election promise, but a firm commitment from a Government Minister at the outset of his term in office.  It would not be unfair to say that they have not come anywhere near meeting those targets, nor have they approached even a revised target of 5 per cent of GNP as a current budget deficit measure.  Instead, the current budget deficit, which was 7 per cent of GNP in 1982, came to 8.2 per cent of GNP in 1985 &mdash; far in excess, in nominal and percentage terms, of anything previously recorded in the history of this State, despite the Minister's lecture about previous administrations.  This was from a Government who have lectured this nation on living beyond its means and on reducing public expenditure &mdash; the highest ever percentages in living memory.</P>
    <P>This failure is reflected in a rise in the national debt from £12 billion on the day on which the Government came to office to a figure which has to be said slowly to be absorbed, a figure of some £20 billion today.  This was on the back of policies which suggested a tightening of our public finances and closing the current deficit and getting our public finances in order.  It <Col N="210" /> would be one thing to have those figures staring us in the face today if the Government had not made those commitments. It is another entirely for those figures to be facing us, the Government having gone on record in the budget speech of 1983 with a commitment to the direct opposite.  It is not easy to take lectures with regard to public finances with those figures before us.  In reply to my parliamentary question to the Minister last week, he admitted that the ratio of debt of GNP in Ireland is now twice the EC average.  The servicing of this debt will cost the taxpayer £770 million this year. That is 30p in every £ taken in income tax.</P>
    <P>In the Government's amendment tonight they ask us to approve measures which they have taken, they say, to promote investment.  Let me look at the promotion of investment as given in the Government statement tonight.  The investment ratio, which has been an accepted measurement of investment by all Governments for many years, has fallen in this country every single year since 1982.  It has fallen from 26 per cent in that year to slightly above 20 per cent as estimated in 1986.  That is the formation of capital as a percentage of GNP, with which the Minister will be familiar. So much for measures taken to promote investment.  The same picture is clear from another leading indicator of investment in our economy which is cement sales.  These have fallen every single year since 1982.  Such investment as has taken place has tended to be in capital intensive, grant aided industries which any objective analysis would show have limited employment potential.</P>
    <P>It is clear from the review I have put before the House of the various headings under which the Government sought to be judged that, first, one must conclude dispassionately, even if one had no political interest, on the facts and figures which I have put before the House arising from the Government's own statements in the budget speech of 1983, that every single target, not only in the joint programme but more importantly in the 1983 budget speech which set the Government's sail <Col N="211" /> for their term in office, has been missed and missed quite widely.  It is fair to conclude that the Government plan, <i>Building on Reality,</i> is no longer a proper or credible framework for solving the economic problems of this nation.  It is also clear, not by my measure or that of the man in the street who feels the pinch these days, but by the measures of the Government's own targets set by them freely in Cabinet in 1983, that those policies have not been adhered to and the targets have not been in any way met.</P>
    <P>On many occasions in the past I have put forward a number of alternatives that we should be looking at.  We must look to a growth led economy, massive investment in the boosting of our export potential, a serious attack in regard to tax reform, the investment in policies which are pro-employment and a concurrent approach of holding the current budget deficit while at the same time trying to boost employment, so that the loss to the Exchequer is minimised.  I freely admit that we must also look at new ways to curb current spending.  Perhaps some of the recent experiences in the United States with regard to their constitutional approach to this topic might be something that should be examined at some stage. It is clear that the present situation just cannot go on.</P>
    <P>On another occasion I should be glad to expand on my alternative scenario, of which I have given just a hint tonight.  I have attempted in this evening's debate to take the Government's own targets, freely set in Cabinet, in the budget speech of 1983 and indicate precisely what has happened on each of those targets.  That conclusion is that they have not been met, the plan has failed and should be withdrawn.  I say that dispassionately and in as non-political a manner as I can. However, be it politically or any other way, if a shareholder had a management team that missed all their targets in a three or four year period and missed them very widely, the shareholder would dismiss that management team.  I suggest that a new management team for Ireland Limited is now essential if we are to make <Col N="212" /> any attempt to tackle the economic difficulties which face this country today.</P>

      <P>One must agree that the amendment to the motion before the House is a commonsense and practical one.  I listened with interest to what Deputy Seamus Brennan had to say.  He spoke of the Government lecturing the Fianna Fáil Opposition and the House tonight.  Having read the Minister's speech, I believe that he has outlined in a very positive and comprehensive manner the efforts made by the Government to tackle what was, as the Minister said, a crisis that faced the country in the early eighties.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Local Loans Fund (Amendment) Bill, 1986: Second Stage (Resumed) and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Local Loans Fund provides capital to local authorities to finance their capital expenditure for the year.  The total provision for SDA loans is £83 million.  The increase last week to £21,000 with a £10,000 income limit, was welcome.  One area which is of concern to me is repayments.  Many people are unable to make repayments.  There is no way that the local authorities can reduce the repayments if a person loses his job and is not in a position to meet the mortgage repayments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The number of local authority houses has increased from 7,900 in 1982 to 11,750 in 1985.  Yet the construction industry is in a shambles at present and many workers have no jobs.  The £5,000 grant scheme is a good scheme.  One problem with this scheme, particularly in one local authority area, Enniscorthy, is that many people who are in employment are leaving the area.  This means that the majority of tenants in the area are unemployed.  This creates a ghetto style housing area.  I am concerned about that. The only people who can avail of the <Col N="213" /> £5,000 grant are people who are working and have an income.  There seems to be a delay in the payment of the £5,000 grant.  People have to get bridging loans from the banks to make up the difference. One wonders if the county council could make the full loan available and the £5,000 grant could be paid to the county council.  That might not be workable but it should be looked at.  We all know that the banks charge high interest rates on bridging loans.  Banks have a duty to ensure that, if people look for bridging loans in order to secure their own homes, they should make it available at reasonable interest rates and not at the exorbitant rates they are charging at present.</P>
    <P>What happened to the tenant purchase scheme?  Does the Minister intend to resume this scheme?  Many people make inquiries to the local authorities about this scheme and the possibility of buying their houses through that system.  It is two years since the last scheme was introduced. The Minister should consider reintroducing this scheme.</P>
    <P>A substantial number of local authority houses are being built throughout the country, particularly in Enniscorthy and in County Wexford.  I ask the Minister to ensure that the single rural cottages will continue.  The Department prefer to see a housing scheme being built rather than single rural cottages.  Those are important to people, particularly those who live in existing council cottages and whose son or daughter would wish to avail of the council site.  I ask the Minister to ensure that that is continued and that the Department, through bureaucracy and red tape, do not get their way and have the isolated rural cottage done away with. It is a very important aspect of rural life throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Recently many people availed of Housing Finance Agency loans because of the 20 per cent repayments.  One wonders if the loan would ever be paid back on this basis because interest rates fluctuate. People tell public representatives that they pick this loan because, if they lose their jobs, they will only have to pay 20 per cent of whatever money they will <Col N="214" /> get.  If people lose their jobs the loan will probably not be paid back during their lifetime.  The banks are not interested in making loans available to the lower income bracket.  For that reason the SDA loan and the HFA loan are worthwhile, certainly in the interests of people in the lower income bracket.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to look at the £5,000 grant scheme.  I am concerned about the large numbers of people in employment leaving local authority houses and being replaced in the main by unemployed people.  It is not the people's fault if they lose their jobs, but there should be a balance in housing schemes with a certain number of employed people and a certain number of unemployed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mrs. A. Doyle)</NameTxt>
      <P>The legislation before us is purely technical and is non-controversial. The purpose of the Bill is to raise the limit on issues from the Local Loans Fund by £1,000 million to £4,500 million.  As all Deputies agree, the Local Loans Fund makes loans available to local authorities for capital works.  The statutory ceiling has to be increased every couple of years as demand dictates.  The last amending Act of this kind was passed in 1983.</P>
      <P>I thank Deputies from the other side of the House for their very constructive contributions.  I reassure Deputy O'Kennedy in particular that the reason he has to put up with me is for no other reason than that I have the responsibility for the Office of Public Works as junior Minister for Finance.  The Office of Public Works and the Commissioners of Public Works administered the Local Loans Fund for many years.  Deputy O'Kennedy made the point that if the Minister for Finance was not present the very least we should do is to have the Minister for the Environment present.  He managed to phrase it quite graciously and did not mean it in a personal way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. A. Doyle Mrs. A. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Kennedy wanted to know why the Minister for the Environment, who is spending most of the money which we are talking about, is not present.  There is food for thought there and much thought has been given to that aspect.  Essentially, this is a matter of funding of public programmes and they have been the responsibility of the Minister for Finance since 1887.  The Local Loans Fund Act, 1935, superseded the national debt and the Local Loans Act, 1887, the Public Works Loans Acts and various others.  The fund has been available for programmes operated by several Ministers over the years.  In the past at any rate it financed education, health and harbour works.  Therefore, the Minister for Finance has been the natural Minister to co-ordinate the funding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference was also made to the financing of local government and democracy. As someone who has been a member of a local authority for 12 to 14 years, I appreciate the concerns which have been expressed.  The Government are engaged in a major programme of local government reform including the organisation of local authorities, devolution of functions from central government, working relationships between elected members and representatives and managers. All of these points and financing generally have been referred to in the discussion this evening.  I, for one, await the outcome of that programme eagerly, as do all the Members of the House who have an interest in local democracy.  At present the Exchequer provides 62 per cent of the current funds of local authorities and over 95 per cent of their capital funds.  Clearly, if local democracy is to be meaningful, local authorities should be able to obtain more locally sourced funding.  Naturally, much reference was made to housing which is the major issue as far as most local authorities are concerned along with the roads issue which does not concern us this evening.  As well as providing generous funding the Government are providing diverse support for a various range of issues.  For example, SDA loans, which are repayable on an annuity basis; HFA loans, <Col N="216" /> with income related payments for the first five years and annuities thereafter; and various other aspects which I have mentioned earlier in my speech.</P>
    <P>Similarly, the £5,000 grant is enabling people to vacate local authority housing and acquire homes of their own.  This supports the concept, which I hold dearly, of maximising home ownership in the country.  In relation to the grant, Deputy Browne made a very valid point and it is one which will have to be watched carefully.  It is only a worrying point in the short term in that many of the people vacating local authority estates at present are leaving behind a majority who are unemployed and have been unemployed for a long time.  Consequently, they are not in a position to take similar steps for themselves.  Sixty per cent of those unemployed today will have found work by next year.  I am not saying there will not be more unemployed to keep the figure up.  Even though there is an initial difficulty in the short term of the social structure as a result of this grant, the Deputy will agree with me that, quite frankly, it is an excellent scheme and one to be encouraged.  In 1985, 2,200 people left local authority houses and built or purchased homes of their own.  Effectively, for £5,000 a house the State acquired 2,200 houses which were made available to those who could not house themselves.  We would all support that, mindful that there would be a short term problem.  But that will sort itself out as time goes on.</P>
    <P>The building societies were also referred to.  I agree that a review of their role is desirable.  The Government issued a discussion document on this subject a few months ago.  The submissions are being examined at present.  Deputies also referred to houses lying vacant.  I think it was Deputy O'Kennedy who made this point.  This in a way reflects the success of our building programme and the great inroads which have been made in providing houses in recent years.  I accept that there are local pockets of difficulty.  I do not think we could say the difficulty in certain areas where there are vacant houses reflects that there is no need for <Col N="217" /> houses in those areas.  We all know there are other reasons why some houses appear to be less acceptable to would-be local authority tenants than others.  That is not for us to resolve tonight.  I acknowledge that that difficulty exists and needs careful monitoring.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Keeffe made strong reference to water supplies and servicing, particularly in rural areas.  I would like to assure the Deputy that 80 per cent of the population are connected to piped water systems and over 64 per cent to the public sewerage system generally.  If I could for a moment put my Department of the Environment hat on and respond by saying that the Department of the Environment continue to provide grants for group water schemes, and over £3 million was specifically allocated for farmyard water supplies in 1986.</P>
    <P>I would also concur with the views expressed by Deputy Browne that we continue our policy of rural cottages.  Tremendous benefit accrues in rural, remote and isolated areas by ensuring that a nucleus of life continues.  People are still working on the land and in certain coastal regions it is essential that we continue to have people living in these areas.  Also, there are people who for many different reasons would not like to live in a housing estate and have always lived in isolated locations.  As far as is practicable we must continue that policy and, I, for one, support it.</P>
    <P>Again, I thank the Deputies for their co-operation and I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. G. Birmingham)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the terms of the Food Aid Convention, 1986 done at London on 13th March, 1986.</P>
      <P>Fundamentally, the approval that is sought is an endorsement of a comprehensive policy of food aid for countries with serious food problems and of a valuable and sound international framework for such vital assistance.  We have all been made aware in recent years of how critical the food problems of some developing countries really are and how precarious is the margin between, on the one hand, the basic subsistence level of much of the world's population and, on the other, famine and starvation.  The solution to the problem of hunger lies in the attainment of food self-sufficiency by the developing countries and the main priority of international development efforts must be to help the developing countries produce enough food to feed their populations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the meantime, however, the reality is that many developing countries do not themselves at present have enough food to feed their populations, nor can they afford to pay for sufficient food imports. In others, sudden disasters or accumulated hardships can give rise, sometimes with little warning, to widespread famine and death, such as we are all witness to <Col N="219" /> in Sub-Saharan Africa in recent times.  In these diverse situations, it is food aid that prevents food shortages becoming famines &mdash; it is the difference between life and death.  In the medium term, food aid, supplied for example through food for work programmes, can be used to support programmess designed to encourage agricultural development.</P>
    <P>The Food Aid Convention provides an important framework for international food aid action, which has demonstrated its effectiveness over the years.  While the new Food Aid Convention obviously does not provide a complete answer to the problems of hunger and underdevelopment, it represents a step in the right direction.</P>
    <P>I would now like to say something on the legal and technical details of the Convention.</P>
    <P>The Food Aid Convention is one of two legal instruments, the other being the Wheat Trade Convention, 1986, which together constitute the International Wheat Agreement, 1986.  The second instrument, the Wheat Trade Convention, 1986, does not involve contributions directly from the Exchequer and therefore does not require the approval of the Dáil before ratification.</P>
    <P>The first International Wheat Agreement was negotiated in 1949.  The second International Wheat Agreement come into effect in 1971 and remains in force until 30 June of this year, hence the urgency of this debate.  In 1967 the original agreement was extended to include the first Food Aid Convention, which was replaced by the second Food Aid Convention in 1971.  Although Ireland did not immediately become a party to the Food Aid Conventions, we did so in 1973 as a result of our accession to the European Communities.  Since then Ireland's contribution under the Food Aid Convention, like that of all the other member states, is counted as part of the overall European Community's contribution. The 1971 Food Aid Convention was replaced by the 1980 Convention.  This was extended by two protocols, the most <Col N="220" /> recent of which extended the convention from 1 July 1983 to 30 June 1986.</P>
    <P>The International Wheat Council met in London on 13-14 March 1986 to negotiate a successor to the 1971 International Wheat Agreement, and finalised the text of the Food Aid Convention, 1986, on 13 March, which is before the House today for approval.  Besides the European Community the other parties involved in the negotiations were: Argentina, Australia, Austria, Canada, Finland, Japan, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland and the United States.</P>
    <P>The objective of the Food Aid Convention is to carry out a food aid programme for the benefit of the peoples of developing countries.  The programme's annual target, established in 1974, of ten million metric tonnes of food aid in the form of wheat and other grains, has been maintained in the 1986 Convention.  The total minimum contribution agreed by the members of the 1986 Convention has been increased slightly from 7,592,000 tonnes annually under the 1980 Convention to 7,617,000 tonnes annually under the 1986 Convention.  The FAO estimate that in fact over 12.3 million tonnes of food aid in cereals was provided during 1984-85, and that 10,996 million tonnes will be provided in 1985-86, including 3.3 million tonnes to Africa.  Approximately 2.7 million tonnes of the overall total for 1985-86 was channelled through multilateral agencies, the remainder being provided on a bilateral basis.  At present food aid donors provide approximately 22 per cent or 9,700,000 tonnes, of the total cereal import requirements of lowincome food deficit countries; the balance is purchased commercially.  In addition, 839,000 tonnes of other commodities such as butteroil, vegetable oil and skin milk powder were provided as food aid during 1985.</P>
    <P>The convention is open for signature and ratification or acceptance at the United Nations Headquarters in New York until 30 June 1986.  It is proposed that the Community and all the member states will simultaneously sign the convention and deposit their instruments of ratification or declarations of provisional <Col N="221" /> application.  Although individual member states are required to sign and ratify the convention, the Community is represented as a single unit for the purposes of the convention.</P>
    <P>With Spain's contribution of 20,000 tonnes incorporated into the Community's contribution, the total minimum Community contribution under the new convention is 1,670,000 tonnes, instead of the previous 1,650,000 tonnes.  The Community's contribution is met partly from the Community's own resources and partly by national action.  Ireland's proposed share of the total is 4,000 tonnes per annum, compared with 4,024 tonnes under the previous convention.  At current market prices and including freight charges, the proposed Irish commitment will cost approximately £800,000 this year, with possible minor increases, in the region of 1 per cent, next year.  As in the past, Ireland's contribution will be borne by the Vote for the Department of Agriculture and will continue to be channelled through the World Food Programme.</P>
    <P>There have been similar motions moved in the past which have received support.  I look forward to the support of the House on this occasion.</P>

      <P>We support this motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I very much welcome the increasing interest of our people in official development aid.  Having regard to the seriousness of the issue, which is helping fellow human beings to survive, we should all do very much more, we should become more involved in every possible way in order to alleviate this terrible problem obtaining in the Third World.  We can see for ourselves that the more advanced and developed countries have great problems keeping their food surpluses under control while at the same time malnutrition, starvation and disease constitute the realities of life for millions of people in the Third World.  I note from what the Minister of State has said that the solution to the problem of hunger lies in the attainment of food self-sufficiency by the developing countries.  I accept that argument <Col N="222" /> in principle, as I am sure does every other Member of this House.  The main priority of international development aid must be to help the developing countries produce sufficient food to feed their populations, something to which we all subscribe.  We are all familiar with the lesson: instead of giving a hungry man fish to eat, we should give him a fishing rod and teach him how to fish so that he can feed himself.</P>
    <P>However, there is the problem obtaining that many developing countries have not sufficient food to feed their populations, nor can they afford to pay for the requisite food.  People in the developed world have become much more aware of the dreadful position that has obtained in many parts of the Third World in recent years.  We were all very shocked to see the television pictures of the last couple of years of the effects of starvation, malnutrition and disease on the continent of Africa, particularly in the countries of Ethiopia and the Sudan.  When we saw such pictures in our sittingrooms and compared the conditions in which fellow human beings were indeavouring to survive, the reality became so real that we felt we had to do something to rectify the matter.  A number of individuals and agencies gave leadership and encouragement in getting something going, to which people responded so generously on a number of occasions helping out those fellow human beings experiencing such extreme difficulty.</P>
    <P>I was glad, as were other Members of the House, to participate in a number of debates on this issue here.  The Minister will be aware we urged that, where food surpluses existed, in particular in the EC, whether of grain or other foodstuffs, we should arrange to have them transferred to needy areas in a speedier manner than was done when we first became aware of these difficulties.  Because of the size of the problem it would appear that the official agencies involved in the area of operations were not prepared or ready to move in as quickly as was necessary to bring medicines, food and help to the millions who were suffering not just from hunger but also from diseases associated with the lack of good, wholesome food. <Col N="223" /> It is very difficult for us, living in comfortable suroundings which we take so much for granted, to understand why in this press button era when we can send people to the moon and send them around the world at supersonic speeds, we could not send food and aid quickly to affected regions.</P>
    <P>I do not have personal experience of the difficulties involved nor do I pretend to have the answers.  I have not visited these areas and I say that with regret.  I know others have visited them including the Minister of State.  I congratulate him on taking the initiative and doing that.  Other Members, through their dealings with the committee, have experienced the problems that exist.  They have presented us with a very fine report which I hope Members will take time to read.  If we are to understand the seriousness of the problem we need to be more informed.</P>
    <P>There is need for help in the short term and I accept that fully.  I thank those who are involved in ensuring that sufficient help is given in the short term.  On occasion we hear disturbing comments, true or untrue I cannot say, that a certain proportion of food aid is not reaching the people for whom it is intended.  In some instances food imports into countries are taken by the administrations for the benefit of the armed forces and the privileged while those in most needy areas are lucky if they come at the end of the queue.  The generosity of the people, which is extremely welcome and most appreciated, could be frustrated and destroyed if there was a belief that food aid was not getting through to the people who needed it most.  I am sure the Minister would agree with me on that.</P>
    <P>Recently it was suggested that in the case of Ethiopia food was being held out as a reward to those who moved to settlement camps.  I do not possess any superior knowledge of the situation there.  Food should be given to the people without any conditions attached.  I know there would be unanimous agreement on that in this House.  I mention it for fear that anything would interfere with the generosity of the <Col N="224" /> people which has been magnificent.  We can understand how a percentage of food aid could be lost through wastage.  Sometimes there is not a proper network of distribution in these countries.  Food is a perishable commodity.  Sometimes there may not be proper road networks.  Food may have to be dropped from aircraft or brought in by convoys of trucks using dirt tracks.  People can accept that wastage might occur in these circumstances.  However, if it is true that food which is meant for starving people is being given to armies, that must not be tolerated.  I do not care how the authorities do it but that practice must be wiped out.</P>
    <P>I commended the Minister's predecessor, Deputy O'Keeffe, on the great personal interest he took in this area.  The demands on his time were so great that I am not sure everyone appreciated what he did.  He did well.  I have heard good accounts of what he did and I congratulate him on it.  I am sure his successor will do an equally good job or even go one better if that is possible.  We on this side of the House will do everything to help him.</P>
    <P>I do not intend this to be a criticism of the Minister, the Minister of State, or the Government but we should do more to get the European Commission and Parliament to respond more efficiently when disaster strikes.  If people are starving, the highly developed economies in Europe should move immediately and get food through to them.</P>
    <P>When we discussed this matter last &mdash; I am open to correction on this &mdash; the Minister promised that he would put certain views expressed by a wide number of Deputies from all parties to a meeting of Ministers for Foreign Affairs saying how best the EC should respond to a disaster which existed at that time.  He succeeded in that and I give him credit for it.  However, it should not have been necessary for the Irish people, Parliament and Minister to awaken the consciences of the leaders of the EC.  Time is valuable.  At that time we were told people were dying at the rate of 50,000 a day.</P>
    <P>We should ensure at all times that food <Col N="225" /> aid is given without conditions attached. It should not be given for political purposes nor should it be used as a foreign policy instrument by the donor country. That is important.  I was present at discussions when the question of aid was spoken about and, although it was never said, I could immediately see the reasons why certain countries were pursuing certain interests and others were not.  I found that difficult to live with.  On such occasions I was anything but diplomatic.  If something needs to be done, let it be done as it should be done, without playing international power politics.  The Minister must be ever vigilant to ensure that food aid is not denied to those in need for any reason, political or economic.</P>
    <P>I note that Ireland's proposed share of the total is 4,000 tonnes of grain per annum and I should like to know if that is a smaller amount than last year.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister give us his assessment of how the problem is being dealt with?  Is he satisfied that enough is being done having regard to the extent of the problem?  Recently I glanced through a document which came my way, The Status Report on the Emergency Situation in Africa as of 1 February 1986, and its contents frightened me.  One can see from that document how so many millions of people depend on outside help.  They depend on us more than others because we have an independent voice in the fora where these matters are discussed.  I was anything but satisfied &mdash; definitely not happy &mdash; with <Col N="226" /> the debate that took place recently at the UN.  I was not encouraged at all that we are facing up to the problem.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister tell us what the picture looks like for the many millions throughout the world who are in dire need of food?  Are we doing enough?  Are our long term plans sufficient?  Are we satisfied that the measures being taken in the short term are sufficient?  Is the Minister satisfied that the co-operation we need from our colleagues in Europe is sufficient?  What can we do to improve it other than highlighting the problem? Can we exert any gentle pressures anywhere along the line because of the extent of the problem?  I am speaking for every Member when I tell the Minister of State that he is assured of unstinting and wholehearted support from us all in his efforts to ensure that Ireland plays as important a role as we should in dealing with an extremely sad and tragic problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. G. Birmingham)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank Deputy Collins for the way he has responded to the motion. In particular I should like to thank him for his extraordinarily gracious and generous remarks about my predecessor, Deputy Jim O'Keeffe.  I have no doubt that they will be much appreciated by him.  Deputy Collins asked me if I was satisfied and, in a sense, that is always the hardest question of all to answer.  If one says that one is satisfied then it could be said that there is nothing more to be done.  Satisfaction leads to complacency but, equally, if one were to say one was dissatisfied that would be to ignore the real steps that have been taken nationally and at the international level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his contribution Deputy Collins broadened the discussion somewhat beyond the specifics of the Convention and it is opportune that he should do so because this is a particularly crucial time for the aid agenda.  In the past couple of years all of our actions, our thoughts, and the focus of our concern concentrated on the need for emergency relief, particularly for Sub-Saharan Africa.  The immediacy of the threat of famine on a massive <Col N="227" /> scale has abated.  I will not exaggerate because it remains the case that in a number of African countries there are still very serious problems.  In at least six African countries, Botswana, Chad, Angola, Mozambique and the Sudan, there are still very serious problems but Africa as a whole has enjoyed a bumper harvest.  Even with the countries that are still experiencing problems in some instances, as for example in the Sudan, there is an overall surplus of food supply but it is a question of getting the food that is in surplus to the places where it is needed.</P>
    <P>This means that there is a change in emphasis, that the debate has to move on now from simply the question of capacity to respond to an immediate problem to rehabilitation, to development, to asking ourselves how that was allowed to happen in the first place and what can we do in the future.  There are encouraging signs and not the least of them has been the courage that a number of countries most affected have shown in expressing a willingness to adopt realistic policies, even painful policies, in the interests of domestic agricultural producers.  Only in that way is there a prospect of food self sufficiency.</P>
    <P>One aspect commented on by Deputy Collins &mdash; I agree with him on this &mdash; was the apparent sluggishness and slowness or awkwardness of the international community and, more explicitly, of the European Community, in responding to the crisis in Africa.  The first thing to be said about that is that the Community's response was slow.  The second thing that can be said is that the response when it was forthcoming &mdash; I think we can take a certain amount of pride in that when it did come it was under the leadership and following the pushing of the Irish Presidency &mdash; was effective and as a result a great number of lives were saved.  If one adds those two together the conclusion one must come to is that were it not for that sluggishness, that lack of preparedness, much of that suffering could have been avoided.  The question is: what can we do about improving that and seeing <Col N="228" /> that at least it does not happen again? We have had examples from other areas in the recent past to establish that the European Community is not at its best when faced with a sudden crisis.  Like many large bodies it moves slowly and has its own decision-making process.  We had evidence of that in a very spectacular fashion recently in another regard.</P>
    <P>One thing I have been pressing very strongly within the development council &mdash; I am glad to say that I have been receiving a substantial amount of support for this &mdash; is that there should be built into each year's Community budget an emergency aid provision.  Then it will not be a question of the Community sitting down from scratch to work out how it responds, or the method of response.  I will continue to push that.  The overwhelming case for it is made by simply studying what happened on the last occasion and saying, now knowing that we are capable of responding effectively and alleviating the suffering on a massive scale, that the onus is all the greater on us to be in a position to move that much faster should we be ever faced with a similar problem.</P>
    <P>With regard to some domestic aspects I join with Deputy Collins in a certain sense of pride in the achievements that we have been capable of over the past decade or so, achievements at Government level and at individual level, with people putting their money where their mouth is.  Very often they put their careers on the line by travelling in huge numbers to African and other Third World countries.</P>
    <P>There has been a long tradition of this. When I was in New York for the special UN session I met the Foreign Ministers of each of the countries with whom we have a priority relationship.  When I met the Foreign Minister of Zambia I said we had a special relationship with Zambia going back a long way, and I said that under Frank Aiken as Minister for External Affairs, a relationship was established through the Institute of Public Administration. The Zambian Foreign Minister corrected me and said: &ldquo;No.  Our <Col N="229" /> relationship goes back a great deal further. What about the role played by Irish Jesuits?  I was educated by them.&rdquo;  He pointed to his Ambassador and said &ldquo;So was he.&rdquo;  In this House we are particularly concerned about the State's role, and there we find cause for satisfaction, a word I did not want to use.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. G. Birmingham Mr. G. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree and it should not be thought of as being enough. We have to do better.  However, this year we will spend £43 million.  Next year, through <i>Building on Reality,</i> that will be increased to £50 million, or 0.275 of GNP.  Even in the few months I have been in this job one thing has become very clear to me, that is, the extraordinary support that all involved were able to take from the fact that they knew how much they would get during the period of <i>Building on Reality</i>&mdash; how much they would get in each of the four years.  That was stated in advance and they could plan and arrange their affairs accordingly. They made the point to me that this is important, given the way in which our aid packet is structured.  It goes both multilaterally and bilaterally.  A great deal of what is going multilaterally is pre-committed and even quite small fluctuations, of a percentage point or two, can have a disproportionate impact on the bilateral side, which is the area for discretionary spending.</P>
      <P>All of us here might put our minds to how we can offer to those interested in the non-governmental bodies some sense of security beyond the period of <i>Building on Reality.</i>  I put it to Deputy Collins that this might be a matter on which all parties could come together and say that during the next four or five years the rate of growth will be so and so and that there will be a consensus about it here and that no party or parties forming the Government would deviate from it.  That would be welcomed enormously by everybody involved because the capacity to plan and know where we are going is very important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="230" /> I was asked about how our aid is targeted from the point of view of the groups of people who receive, and there we insist that our aid should be aimed at the poorest of the poor.  Any attempt to divert our aid in the way described by Deputy Collins is something we could not tolerate in any circumstances.  Deputy Collins said it is important that our aid programme should remain untied.  I share that view very strongly.  That is the necessary corollary of a statement that you are in the business of aiding those whose need is greatest.  If you accept that as a first principle, the idea of using aid as an instrument of foreign policy or of political pressure goes out the window automatically. I thank Deputy Collins once more and I wish to express satisfaction that there has been such agreement here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very important Bill which seeks to abolish juries in High Court civil liability actions.  I have a very keen concern because in the Joint Committee on Small Businesses for six months we studied the insurance problems of the small business community.  The current insurance industry in Ireland is in crisis. It is not alarmist to say that this position cannot go unchecked because it will spell further unemployment and business closures if something is not done.  I will give some examples of the level of the problem we are talking about.  The relevance of talking about insurance when dealing with a Courts Bill is that, on average, of every insurance claim paid 15 per cent to 20 per cent is made up of legal costs: on average, of all claims paid that percentage is represented in legal costs. Therefore, any measure that would reduce legal costs will have the direct effect of reducing awards and, by savings, reducing premiums.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a submission to the Joint Committee <Col N="231" /> on Small Businesses the FUE stated that between 1982 and 1984, on average there was a 286 per cent increase in insurance premiums.  Inflation during that period was a little under 24 per cent, so we had insurance premiums rising at more than ten times the rate of inflation.  However, there are some far worse examples than averages.  If we take the professions &mdash; architects, solicitors, doctors and so on &mdash; who take out professional indemnity insurance, the premiums have rocketed, resulting in increases in their fees.  In the ordinary retail trade, premium increases have gone up by up to 1,000 per cent, partly because of the crime problem in certain areas.</P>
    <P>All insurance has gone out of control, but even worse than having a crisis is the official complacency about the existence of that crisis.  When the committee met the Departments of Industry and Commerce and Justice, both at Secretary level, they said there was not a particular problem, that premiums had gone up but there was no crisis.  They said that total premium income had gone from £52.7 million in 1980 to £64.5 million in 1981, to £67.1 million in 1982, £70.7 million in 1983 and approximately £88 million in 1984, increases of 26 per cent, 22 per cent, 23 per cent, 25 per cent and 24 per cent, respectively, year on year.</P>
    <P>The worrying thing is that though there were increases of 3.9 per cent during 1981 and 1982 and 5.6 per cent in the following year, they pointed out that that was not a crisis.  I agree that increases of that magnitude are not a crisis, but those figures do not relate the whole position. They only take into account the total premium receipts of all insurance companies, who are obliged to make annual returns to the Department of Industry and Commerce.  The Department publish a Blue Book each year giving the total premium income figures.  That does not take account of the volume of business covered, the number of employees or the firms who are told they cannot get any more cover because they are not thought to be good risks.  It does not take into account the numbers of people who have <Col N="232" /> been told that their cover would be reduced or restricted.  It does not take into account the people who transfer from one insurance company to another, the refusals to insure or where people decide they cannot afford to take out insurance and who, therefore, cover their own risks.  Neither does it take into account the number of multinational companies who have switched their insurance abroad.</P>
    <P>There is an increasing number of people each year who do not take out Irish insurance for the reasons I have mentioned.  Because fewer people and businesses are insured, the increases in total premium income figures change dramatically and for the few who are insured the figures have gone up very considerably. The base of the insured community has shrunk and for those left the increases have been much more than shown in the Blue Book.  This is leading to the problem of gross, official complacency.  I know of a recent AnCO course where they tried to start a business where people could fell trees.  However, they could not get started because they could not get public and employers' liability insurance. This crisis is of epidemic proportions and something has to be done.</P>
    <P>I welcome the legislation as a first step but unfortunately, it is too little, too late. It will not have the effect of reducing insurance premiums in the short term. The best effect that can be obtained will be to hold insurance premiums at their current level for the next three years and after that there may be a reduction. There is no way anyone can suggest that by bringing forward this legislation one is solving the insurance problems that exist.  I acknowledge it is a first step but we are not getting to the root causes of the problem.  Therefore, I should like to examine the further steps that can be taken, as previous speakers have done.</P>
    <P>We received a submission from the IDA to say that insurance premiums in one year can equal the total value of IDA aid to an industrialist.  We also received submissions from Dublin Corporation suggesting that in certain areas insurance was not available.  They said where they <Col N="233" /> had renovated premises in an urban renewal programme and had leased the premises they could not get insurance. One need only look at the State rescue of the PMPA in 1983 and the further State rescue of the ICI in 1985.  Not only does this have the effect of being a disincentive to recruiting more people in terms of employers' liability but it also adds to the cost of a business.  The higher the premiums the greater the costs.  It also hits competitiveness very severely. Employers' liability insurance can account for up to 10 per cent of payroll costs.  In addition, it has a severe and adverse effect on employees.</P>
    <P>I nearly got my handkerchief out this morning when I received a submission from the Chairman of the General Council of the Bar of Ireland, professional practitioners who have done very well out of our legal system.  When I hear them talk about the ordinary man and administration of justice I ask them a simple question: do they realise that because of the archaic, inefficient and outdated nature of our court system and because of the legal fees they charge due to that cumbersome system, the result has been that many people are now not able to afford insurance and employees are going to work without any cover?  If they break their neck or their leg they have no cover simply because they could not afford to pay the insurance or it was unavailable.  Even worse, people are going to work without public liability cover and if they have an accident they must suffer the consequences.  All they get is a measly occupational injuries benefit from the Department of Social Welfare and they have no redress because the cases do not come under the malicious injuries code.  In a genuine accident at work, perhaps a person falls off a ladder, he has no cover.  When the Bar Council talk about justice they must take into account justice for all employees.  We must have a system of insurance that is affordable, available and reasonable so that every worker can be covered in the event of an accident.</P>
    <P>I know that many people here are members of the Incorporated Law <Col N="234" /> Society or the Bar Council and they make special pleading cases for the retention of the jury system.  Therefore, it is necessary to spell out the kind of problems existing in the real world.  Let us take the example of a hedge cutter in County Wexford who wishes to get a job with Wexford County Council.  He must have compulsory insurance and in many cases a small firm cannot afford the cost.  There are many small construction firms who are trying to get contracts under the public capital programme but if they do not have cover they will not get the contracts. There is also the farcical situation with regard to young people who are trying to obtain motor insurance but who cannot afford it because of the exorbitant cost, with the huge loading rate for people under 25 years and for first time insurers.  All of these problems are directly related to the cost of our legal system because in every insurance claim paid out, on average 15 or 20 per cent is paid in respect of legal costs.  Therefore, if we are to talk about cheaper car insurance and cheaper employers' and public liability insurance, we must talk about getting the claims and settlement system operating on a more modern management principle and on a more efficient and cheaper basis.</P>
    <P>When considering the difficulties in the insurance sector, many people take the simple and often naive option of blaming the insurance companies.  I hold no brief for the insurance industry.  They have reacted in a narrow, insensitive way to the current crisis; but in the interests of accuracy and fairness it must be said they are not solely to blame for the huge increase in premiums.  I will give the House two figures to illustrate what I mean.</P>
    <P>In 1979 the net underwriting losses of the Irish insurance companies was £9 million; in 1983 that figure increased to £97 million &mdash; in other words, in four and a half years the losses had increased by 11 times.  In 1982 and 1983 five of the ten Irish-based insurance companies incurred substantial losses.  Because of the legislation that controlled the insurance industry between 1936 and 1976 there <Col N="235" /> was an environment of protectionism. With our membership of the EC in 1976 the type of insurance which ensued within the insurance sector meant they were all going for growth in market share with the result that they did not keep a prudent eye on their portfolios and therefore incurred huge losses but did not look at the kind of risks they were taking.  There is an element of culpability on the insurance industry, but nothing to the culpability of the legal profession and our courts structure in relation to the explosion in premiums.  If we look at the figures I have just given we will realise that it was not unreasonable for the insurance companies to pass on these losses.</P>
    <P>I wish to turn now to the legal system and to analyse in some detail how we can go further than this legislation and ensure that we have affordable insurance.  As the Minister said, the primary purpose of this Bill is to reduce insurance costs.  As I said, on average 15 per cent to 20 per cent of claims paid are taken up by legal costs.  Article 34 of the Constitution lays down the fundamental principles of our court structure: the judges are appointed by the President on the advice of the Government and the courts were set up pursuant to the Justice and Courts Officers Acts, 1924 and 1953.</P>
    <P>We are dealing with civil liability actions in the High Court under this legislation. Under the present structure the District Court has a limit of hearing civil liability cases of £2,500; the Circuit Court may decide claims up to £15,000, unless all parties to the action consent, in which event the amount is unlimited; the High Court has unlimited jurisdiction and the Supreme Court has an appellate function in personal injuries accident cases but deals only with points of law.  We are dealing with a system which has not changed between 1924 and 1984.</P>
    <P>The question must be asked: are the court structures which were set up 60 years ago applicable to our current needs?  Emphatically, no.  The first thing that needs to be done is to streamline the jurisdiction of the courts.  I would like to see a major increase in the limit for the <Col N="236" /> hearing of certain cases.  I would also like the District Court limit to be increased to at least £5,000 and the Circuit Court limit to at least £30,000.  This would expedite hearings at the lower level and reduce the delays and the costs associated with High Court hearings.</P>
    <P>If we want to change the court system we have to look at the structures.  First, the Department of Justice have overall responsibility for the administration of the courts.  However, a number of aspects of the courts administration lie within the statutory competence of the courts and the judges.  The number of the Judiciary is controlled by the law.  According to the book of public expenditure for 1985, there are six Supreme Court judges, 15 High Court judges, 15 Circuit Court judges and 45 District Court judges.  We must ask ourselves if that is the right number.  Is that number adequate to deal with our needs?  What is the cost-benefit analysis of more or fewer judges?  The total cost of running the courts in 1985, and this includes the criminal and civil jurisdiction, was £12.9 million, including £1.2 million on building works and £400,000 administration costs by the Department.  To some extent, this expenditure is defrayed by revenue from the general court scale of fees for which the Minister is responsible.  These fees are charged as a contribution towards the running costs of the courts and are payable by and on behalf of litigants on the lodgments of documents with the court. The amount collected in 1985, for example was £5.7 million.</P>
    <P>My view is that because we are dealing with the High Court, an additional two High Court judges should be appointed, bringing the total to 17.  One of the problems in this court is the long delay in hearing cases.  Since the Minister is responsible for the scale of fees, and the amount collected was approximately half of the total cost of running the courts, it is possible to compensate the Exchequer by increasing the scale of court fees marginally. This would mean that two extra judges could be appointed without any cost to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>The changing of rules in relation to the <Col N="237" /> way trials are heard, which is one of the biggest scandals in our legal system, is a matter for the legal rules committee.  The terms of reference of the Committee on Court Practice and Procedures are to inquire into the operation of the courts, to consider whether the cost of litigation should be reduced, how it affects the public and how efficient it is both in civil and criminal cases.  The Committee decide on the levels of jurisdiction and on all levels of practices and procedures. Basically, their role is fundamental to any change; but they are part of the system and very slow to change.  We have the Superior Court Rules Committee, the Circuit Court Rules Committee and the District Court Rules Committee whose terms of reference are to make rules in conjunction with the Minister for Justice, relating to the general conduct, practice and procedure of those various courts.</P>
    <P>I should like to see a very rapid change in this area, especially in relation to pre-trial procedures, because I believe there is great scope for savings in this area. Certain routine evidence, such as Garda statements and sketch plans, should be allowed on a pre-trial basis which would not delay the court hearing.  I should like to see agreement where possible between the claimant and the defendant in relation to medical evidence and actuarial and engineering data being provided in the court case.  This would mean that before the case comes to court, the agreed points are out of the way and the focus would be on the points where the parties agree to disagree.</P>
    <P>For the average punter a day in the High Court is £1,000.  If we are dealing with that level of expenditure for litigants we must look at every way of reducing the number of days on which cases are heard.  Therefore, I would like to see the Superior Court Rules Committee in conjunction with the other courts' committees I have mentioned for the Circuit Court, the High Court and so on getting together to rearrange pre-trial procedures in such a way that there would be a full exchange between the legal representatives of both parties 21 days prior to the hearing so that all the technical, medical, <Col N="238" /> engineering and actuarial data, maps, photographs, certain exhibits, submissions to be taken and so on can be dealt with and got out of the way expeditiously. I request the Minister urgently to take up this matter with these committees, because if they are not given some spur to do this we will go for another 60 years with no change.  Our whole economic structure and way of doing business over that period has changed.  It is like saying that the donkey and cart are a relic of our past but the court system is still with us, unfortunately.</P>
    <P>Now we get down to the meat of it which is the jury system and legal representation. This is the kernel of this legislation which needs a great deal of thought. First, let me deal with the General Council of the Bar of Ireland data which I presume all Deputies received this morning and which suggest that juries should be retained for the following reasons.  A Mr. Dermot Ryan, spokesman for the insurance companies, stated categorically that the abolition of juries will not reduce insurance premiums.  That is a gross, total misrepresentation of the views of the Irish Insurance Federation to whom I have spoken and I know where they stand on this subject.  I know where their clients, the insured community, stand on this.  I do not know who this Dermot Ryan is, but this is a gross misrepresentation or unrepresentation of their views.  They have been looking for this legislation for the last five years.  They have been saying that we are the only country in Europe that retains jury sittings in civil liability cases in the High Court.</P>
    <P>The second reason is that there is no evidence to suggest that individual judges in this country will be less generous in their assessment of compensation than would a jury.  The Bar Council go on to say that there is no reason to suggest that judges would be any more consistent than juries.  They say in their submission in relation to the administration of justice that if the English example were involved it would have the effect of reducing the amount of compensation recoverable by persons injured through no fault of their <Col N="239" /> own to a very low level by comparison with what they could now reasonably expect under the jury system.  On page 1 of their submission they say that there is no reason to believe that people are going to get less, and on the last page they say that it will be unfair to claimants because they are going to get less.  Perhaps they could make up their minds on what they think will happen.</P>
    <P>If we follow the English example we will see that, first of all, legal costs in Ireland are twice what they are in the UK and, secondly, in the UK the judges have reference to guidelines called the Kemp and Kemp guidelines which are basically a standard award system for an arm, say, £10,000, a leg £12,000, an eye £20,000 or whatever.  These figures are off the top of my head but there is a set standard of reference.  Therefore, it is not just judges in whatever mood they are in or any particular judge.  I imagine that we would follow the English system whereby there would be not a statutory or mandatory thing but a standard reference book to which judges could refer and make awards accordingly, and of course that would create consistency.  I fail to see the Bar Council's argument having any logic or common sense if they expect a dozen ordinary people, varying from farmers to social welfare recipients, factory workers or accountants, to have some idea of what would be an appropriate level of compensation.  They have no clue.</P>
    <P>The Bar Council say that among the practical effects of the abolition of the jury system is that it will remove from the public at large one of the very few opportunities they have to participate in the administration of justice.  My experience is that people who get notice of a call for jury duty go to their local council or TD to get out of it, or they get doctors' letters.  However they can they get out of it, because under no circumstances do they want to participate.  I grant that I am generalising, but it would be representative to say that many people would lose no sleep over their loss of right to hear civil cases.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="240" /> However, we are not necessarily dealing with the rights or wrongs of the case but with the necessity to assess damages. We are not dealing with a criminal case and whether the verdict is guilt or innocence. We are dealing with a technical matter of assessing awards on the basis of injury, loss of capacity and so on. Every other country in Europe has gone the road this legislation is going, and I fail to see why the Bar Council are using terms like &ldquo;this legislation is a pig in a poke&rdquo;.  That is unreasonable and unfair. I have met the Bar Council face to face and they are well aware of my views on this matter.  With a Kemp and Kemp type of system such as the UK has we can eliminate their worst fears.</P>
    <P>Now we come to the best line of all: &ldquo;The availability of jury trial serves the useful social function of discouraging and even preventing litigation from becoming the exercise of an exclusively professional ritual engaged in by professional lawyers, judges and advocates.&rdquo;  I suggest that the current courts structure, the system in this country, serves its practitioners better than it does the claimants and defendants when we look at the type and scale of fees they have.  If they are so interested in involving the public, why do they not take off their gowns and wigs and wear ordinary clothes like the rest of us so that people would not feel afraid for their lives when they go into court? Why do they not come down to earth and get away themselves from the professional ritual?</P>
    <P>Enough about their submission.  I wish to turn to the most appalling restrictive practice that exists in this country, perpetuated by the members of the Bar Council, something that this Minister and this Government should deal with immediately if we are to get legal costs down. This legislation is a welcome change, but it is too little too late.  We need a major radical approach to the reform of the legal system.  I refer to the three counsel rule, as it is commonly known.  This is unbelievable to the ordinary people when you try to explain it to them.  Where in a High Court hearing you have a jury sitting the universal practice is that each <Col N="241" /> side has a solicitor.  That solicitor in turn gets counsel who is a barrister.  The barristers operate a three counsel system which requires each side in a High Court action to be represented by two senior counsel and one junior counsel.  Thus you have the three counsel rule.  Therefore, for what could be a very straightforward hearing there are eight legal representatives in one case, four on either side.</P>
    <P>I am glad to say, before I defame the legal profession any further, that the Incorporated Law Society in their submission to the Committee on Small Businesses admitted that was totally indefensible and should be done away with.  Of course, as fair-minded people, we sought the views of the Bar Council on the reason for such an excessive level of legal representation.  Their answer was unbelievable. They said that there is no rule of the Bar that any minimum, number of counsel should be briefed in any particular case other than the rule that senior counsel must not appear in court unless junior counsel is briefed on the case.</P>
    <P>The court schedule is disorganised.  A senior counsel can be ready to take a case but he or she does not know when the case will be heard because the timetable is not specific.  Therefore, a spare senior counsel must be standing by, equally well briefed on the case, to settle it on the steps of the courthouse if the other senior counsel is tied up in another case.  It is a ludicrous and expensive system.  It is only because such a cosy restrictive practice operates that they get away with it and that is why the current court structure serves its own practitioners better than the litigants.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I strongly believe that there is an unanswerable case for the Minister for Justice to call together the Superior Court Rules Committee and to tell them that something will have to be done very rapidly about the three counsel rule.  One of the practical solutions would be to abolish last minute settlements on the steps of the courts because this is the cause of the problem.  All cases should have to be settled within a given period, say 15 days before the scheduled hearing, <Col N="242" /> or it would have to be heard, because at present there is an element of cat and mouse and bluff on both sides.  There may be a case involving someone who has been in a car injury and who has suffered an eye injury.  Perhaps the insurance company are offering £40,000 but the claimant wants £60,000 and is holding out for the full amount.  I am also critical of insurance companies, who have tolerated the three counsel rule for so long. Unlike ordinary mortals who fight a single case in their lifetime, if at all, it is the bread and butter of insurance companies and they should have been a lot tougher in regard to this matter a long time ago.</P>
    <P>Those are the changes I would like to see in the court system.  The present system has been in operation, virtually unchanged for 60 years.  There is no sign of modern management principles.  It is time for a radical review, which should include increasing the jurisdiction of the District Court from £2,500 at present to £5,000 and the Circuit Court from £15,000 to £30,000.  I should like to see the appointment of two extra High Court judges, from 15 to 17, a change in pre-trial procedures whereby all medical, technical, actuarial and engineering evidence, maps, photographs and exhibits could all be agreed before the hearing. That, coupled with the abolition of the three counsel rule, would ensure progress towards changing the system.</P>
    <P>I should also like to refer to the crisis in the insurance sector and the availability and cost of insurance, which has reached enormous proportions and is leading to unemployment, closure of businesses and to people going to work without insurance cover, which is a very dangerous position for them.  The answer is to take the settlement and claims system out of the hands of the courts. That may seem extremely radical; but, if you examine the international situation as I have and study the position in relation to OECD countries, you will find that Ireland is unique in its settlement and claim system.  I wish to refer specifically to the international situation relating to employers' liability insurance.  I will give <Col N="243" /> some examples.  Since 1910 Canada has had a workman's compensation system financed by employers and based on collective liability and, in order to avoid delay and to have quick settlements, it is exclusive of the courts' jurisdiction.  West Germany has a compulsory no faults insurance scheme for work accidents which has its origin in the industrial accidents insurance law of 1884.  Different autonomous funds have been set up which are administered by the Department of Labour and employers are obliged to have insurance cover.</P>
    <P>In France all persons in paid employment are covered by the work accident injuries scheme.  Its cost is met by the employers and settlements are made by a tribunal system.  They have a right to an appellant court, which is not a court in our sense, but a tribunal system.  In the Netherlands up to recently they did not allow civil actions for negligence in cases of this kind.  In Sweden they have a voluntary, no faults agreement between management and unions whereby the equivalent of the ICTU and the FUE got around a table and worked out the problems of expensive insurance.  They realised that 15 per cent to 20 per cent of the cost of such insurance went to solicitors and on court expenses.  They agreed to set up a tribunal system with a right of appeal.  The premiums vary for different risks and there is an expenditious way of dealing with cases.  There are no wigs and gowns and the formalities of court proceedings.  The system works perfectly simply and the same system applies in New Zealand.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to delay the House unduly by giving it the benefit of my international knowledge in this matter but I would like to point out that basically Ireland is unique in the way it deals with this situation.  In most countries there is a no fault system of insurance which is compulsory and accidents at work are settled by a tribunal.  That has the advantage of being equitable to all employers, provides adjustable premiums for higher risk categories, widens the insurance pool and thus improves the current situation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="244" /> More people would be paying because it would be compulsory and the burden of insurance cover carried only by those firms who have cover at present would be slightly lighter.</P>
    <P>What are we going to do here, because we are light years away from change?  We have studied the situation in very great depth and one comes to the interesting conclusion that almost by accident here we stumbled across a solution through the Stardust tribunal settlements.  We all recall the desperate tragedy of the Stardust where, obviously there would be very substantial claims for loss of life, injury and so on.  We saw the total and utter frustration of the people concerned because of the administration of those claims.  I would be of the view, a layman's opinion, that it would be many, many more years before those cases would be settled if the Stardust tribunal had not been introduced.</P>
    <P>The Stardust tribunal is an extremely important precedent in relation to a claims settlement system in Ireland for the simple reason that the people who settled their claims through the Stardust tribunal waived their right to sue subsequently for damages.  The basis for this tribunal system in other countries is that equally through their unions and as individuals, they agree the rules of this new tribunal system, and because they are party to making the rules they have confidence in the operations of the system. We could very quickly move to a situation where widows would not wait four and five years for compensation; where people could get the necessary expensive medical help to take care of their incapacity and, at the end of the day, we would not have the fat cats of the legal profession cleaning up.  So, I firmly call on the Congress of Trade Unions and on the FUE who are equally concerned about this matter, to get together and discuss this matter and to put proposals to the Ministers for Labour and Justice.  I know there is a great deal of sympathy within the Department of Labour for the suggestion that employers' liability insurance should be made compulsory but, if it is made compulsory in isolation and the <Col N="245" /> settlements system is not changed, the third party fire and theft motor insurance problem will just be compounded.  At the moment this is compulsory but there are still thousands of uninsured drivers and very heavy losses by that section of the insurance industry.</P>
    <P>We have to make a root and branch change in the system of insurance here rather than just making insurance compulsory and compounding the problem. An essential change by the tribunal system would be that it would be on a no fault basis.  That means that if a person is working as a painter and is on a ladder, falls off and breaks his ankle it does not matter if it was his fault or the employer's fault; what matters is that he has a damaged ankle, and is entitled to compensation. If it is made no fault the argument is taken out of it and the need for it to be administered by the courts is removed by virtue of the fact that it does not matter whether it was negligence or who was culpable that the fact is that there was injury, there was damage and that damage must be compensated for.</P>
    <P>Therefore, we could very quickly get into a Stardust tribunal settlement system.  I would strongly urge it because when I was researching this area for the Small Businesses Committee everybody said we should abolish juries, remove the 1 per cent tax levy on insurance and make various changes such as abolishing the three counsel rule and so on.  Nobody had gone to the trouble of studying why they have affordable and reasonable insurance in Germany, France, New Zealand, Canada and Sweden.  It is because they gave a little thought to the root causes of the problem.  The real insurance problem here is that claims have gone out of control and our legal system is so blatantly a lottery.  Under the jury system people are prepared to take a risk because of the great potential of the gravy train.  People have become more litigation conscious. People who have minor accidents want to go to the High Court and the situation in relation to the level of claims has gone out of control.  In my constituency, not a quarter of a mile from where I live, there are 74 people employed in a certain <Col N="246" /> manufacturing industry and the employers' liability insurance premium is £120,000, to give a specific micro example &mdash; I gave the macro survey figures earlier. That is simply unsustainable.  The insurance company are doing them a favour in giving them insurance at that level.  It is all because the legal system is a lottery. Legal expenses represent up to 20 per cent of claims and awards paid and nobody does anything but talk about it. As I heard the Bishop of Ferns say today, we have a great Irish habit of thinking that if we talk about a problem we have done something about the problem whereas, in fact, we have done nothing about it.</P>
    <P>I would strongly urge the Minister to examine the international experience in all OECD countries and to realise that we are almost unique in the way we go about our settlement system.  I urge him to introduce a no fault compulsory tribunal awards settlement system whereby cases could be settled within six months on an agreed basis between unions and employers and to introduce the other legal changes I spoke about.</P>
    <P>In my view, this legislation will, at the end of the day, reduce the level of awards and bring greater consistency in awards.  I totally reject the Bar Council's argument that 11 or 12 lay people who have never heard a case before in their lives would know how much damage to give for the loss of an eye as opposed to judges who would have reference to the <i>Kemp and Kemp</i> system as they do in the UK.  The system I suggest will bring about consistency of awards and will cut out special pleading to juries by senior counsel on bended knee, the jury having their handkerchiefs out for someone in a wheelchair and in need of compensation, and legal costs of £1,000 to £3,000 per day in the High Court.  It will cut out all of that nonsense and provide something that is equitable.  The House need not take my word that the situation is crazily inconsistent. One has only to look at the over 300 awards in civil liability jury cases that were subsequently appealed to the Supreme Court &mdash; a very expensive and time consuming process.  The fact that <Col N="247" /> there was appeal to the Supreme Court showed that there was no sense or reason in the awards made.  A no fault system would speed up the litigation process but the appointment of two extra High Court judges will do more in this area.  At the end of the day the argument from the Bar Council represents nothing more than special pleading by people who have done very well out of a very expensive legal system, the cost of which has been borne by the insured community, and they are at the end of their tether.</P>
    <P>I welcome this legislation which I hope will bring some order out of the current chaos.  I firmly believe that if the Government think or anybody thinks that this measure to abolish juries in High Court cases of civil liability actions will solve the insurance crisis, they are sadly mistaken. The best it can do is stop premium costs rising.  What is needed is a major overhaul of our legal system.  This should include the appointment of two extra judges, the raising of the limits in the District and Circuit Courts, the changing of pre-trial procedures, the dropping of the three counsel rule, the introduction of a time limit for the acceptance of settlements and, above all, an attempt to take settlement claims out of the hands of the courts altogether.  Then we could have an efficient, expeditious, reasonably costed system in terms of administration whereby justice could be seen to be done and people would not be terrified going into court and could hope to get compensation quickly after their accidents.</P>
    <P>When replying to this debate, I hope the Minister will give consideration not only to the points I have raised but to a detailed analysis done by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Small Businesses, which committee spent six months looking at this area and whose report is worthy of consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment Deputy Yates on his contribution.  His committee have obviously done much work on this subject.  I must first declare my interest, as a member of the legal profession. However, my interest is not to ensure the <Col N="248" /> maintenance of the jury system for its own sake.  Regardless of whether juries remain or are abolished, my simple interest is to ensure justice between the parties with regard to any claim brought before the courts.  With reference to the previous speaker's expansion on the idea of the no fault system and the New Zealand experience in particular, which I studied when doing court law in UCD, there are certain differences of approach as between the New Zealand system and our own which would present some difficulties for us, even though it is a country which, while not the same size as ours, has the same population.  There are areas in New Zealand where there is a fight for reform of the system in certain aspects of its administration.  There are some delays there, but perhaps not as bad as we experience here.  The New Zealand system is not by any means a perfect one.  It has a different concept of claims settlement.</P>
      <P>Before going into the wider ramifications of our claims settlement system, I maintain that the particular point of this legislation is specifically the abolition of civil juries in certain cases, particularly civil injury cases.  There were many points made by previous speakers on both sides of the House with which I would agree.  If we wish to approach this matter rationally, we should first realise that the bodies of societies concerned in this area need a certain shake up.  The insurance industry has experienced many difficulties over recent years, quite a few of which it brought upon itself.  Any examination of the situation would show that certain insurance companies overstretched themselves in the premiums they made available and the amount of business which they took up, on which they could not meet claims.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We in the legal profession must also clean up our act if we are to make any credible contribution in this matter.  I am glad Deputy Yates referred to the fact that the Incorporated Law Society, of which I am a member, realise that the three counsel rule is difficult to defend. As a solicitor dealing with personal injury cases, I know solicitors are the people <Col N="249" /> who deal with the victims of accidents from the first day and up to the settlement of the claim, when the costs are agreed and paid.  The role of the barrister in these matters is to draft proceedings where necessary, to advise on quantum damages which might be payable, to assess the medical reports from the various sources and to help settle claims, &mdash; in many cases, it is stated, on the steps of the High Court.</P>
    <P>If bodies in this country wish to proceed in these matters which are of vital national interest, they must conduct themselves in a manner which is acceptable to the ordinary people.  I have always believed that the three counsel rule does not make sense.  Many eminent junior counsel are quite capable of handling the most difficult claims and certain senior counsel are excellent in ensuring that a client obtains the maximum compensation reasonably available.  A senior and junior counsel together acting in the most difficult and the most complex claims that may be brought are quite sufficient to ensure that proper representation at court level is achieved.  It must be said also that the delay which had taken place in the High Court, particularly in Dublin, to all intents and purposes has been more or less eliminated and the situation has been improved.  Credit is due to the former President of the High Court, now Chief Justice Finlay, and to Judge Liam Hamilton, President of the High Court, whose organisation of the courts and their business in the Four Courts during their tenure ensured that the delays have been greatly reduced and there is a greater degree of efficiency in the administration of the court system as a result of the reforms these men have introduced in the High Court.</P>
    <P>It should be pointed out in relation to personal injury claims, that it must be realised that in many cases the delay from the layman's point of view occurs because a final medical report takes some time to assess.  If a person has a serious injury it may take three or four visits to a consultant or a medical representative of the insurance company before a final decision can be made on the level of injury and <Col N="250" /> the future disability of the person involved. In other words, a serious injury cannot be assessed with any consistency or reasonable foreseeability by the following morning or the following week. One must wait until the person is reasonably healed to see precisely the difficulties which may be experienced by him or her in the future.  It must be borne in mind that that delay is necessary and totally defensible if one is interested in ensuring justice between the parties.  It is simply part of the process of assessing claims and to reduce that delay would in many instances be to the disadvantage of the victim who seeks compensation. Obviously if there were to be a time limit within which the claim would be settled &mdash; one must start proceedings within three years of the date of the accident &mdash; it could in many instances be to the disadvantage of the individual concerned. The medical people may not be in a position to give a definite view of his future disability within that prescribed time.</P>
    <P>There is a major need for reform in this area.  The Incorporated Law Society have taken a very pragmatic approach to the need to ensure that ordinary people see that justice is being done and that there is not a rip off.  Nobody is entitled to profit from a person's injury except the person himself.  The legal profession exist to do a job well and to be reasonably remunerated for that job.  The idea that the Incorporated Law Society would hope that people would profit from it is unreal and one that would not hold water with me or with any member of the profession. It is important that people understand why there is a delay.  In many instances that delay occurs because they must await the final medical report.  They must wait until the physician and the medical experts are satisfied that the contents of their final medical report are an accurate assessment not alone of the present condition of the person concerned but also the future disability it may occasion him.</P>
    <P>I welcome the increase in the jurisdiction of the courts.  Since the change in the limits in 1984 to £2,500 for the District <Col N="251" /> Court and £15,000 for the Circuit Court, many district justices, certainly in my area, are well capable of dealing with matters which arise up to a value of £2,500 and also cases up to a higher limit. Deputy Yates mentioned £5,000.  I would not be adverse to increasing the jurisdiction to £5,000.  It is also advisable to increase the jurisdiction in relation to the Circuit Court.  Deputy Yates mentioned £30,000.  I am not sure if I would go that high but I would not quibble over the figure.  It is not an unreasonable suggestion.</P>
    <P>The question of the abolition of juries affects High Court cases alone.  We do not have juries for civil cases in Circuit Courts.  Those who propose the abolition of juries hope to bring about a greater consistency in the awards in the High Court.  That is a very laudable objective and one which I hope will be achieved. If a judge alone is to decide on the quantum of damages available to an individual and if there is to be no reference whatever to a jury, what will happen in the event of an award being too low?  Where is the financial wherewithal of that individual to appeal that decision to the Supreme Court?  He will not be able to do that. Therefore, for all practical purposes there would be no right to appeal by the individual if he thought the award was too low.  He could not afford the expense of going to the Supreme Court.  If, on the other hand, the insurance companies &mdash; the insurance company appeals to the Supreme Court &mdash; feel it is too high they have the financial wherewithal to appeal to the Supreme Court.  If justice is to be done between the parties, we should make sure that we do not deny justice to individuals who feel that their award in the High Court is too low.</P>
    <P>There is a feeling that judges with a certain number of years experience would properly calculate a reasonable assessment of award for damages to individuals. I am not convinced of that.  I do not think judges have the monopoly of knowledge as to what a person from a working class background should be entitled to in the event of a reasonably <Col N="252" /> serious injury if the social background of the justice is upper middle class.  Would a justice who has a family history of involvement in the legal profession, who joined the Bar and performed with eminent distinction, who had the connections to start off as a junior and eventually became a judge in the High Court, necessarily have the knowledge at his disposal as to what the needs of that person might be?  I do not think one should assume that judges would have a monopoly of knowledge in that instance. That is why the presence of a jury is an important part of the system.</P>
    <P>That is not to say I believe that a jury should be present to give awards which are ridiculously high.  Can we not devise a system whereby the judge could give guidelines to a jury on what he would regard as a reasonable assessment of the damage or a minimum and maximum figure within which juries could operate? Could we not have a system whereby juries could retire having been advised by the judge as to what the assessment of damages might be without the need for their abolition and thus leaving the case in the hands of a person who by the nature of his work will be involved in that type of case every day or most days, who will over time, being a member of the human race, adopt certain attitudes to certain types of injuries or who may be more sympathetic to one type of injury than another.  Whatever way we reform the system, we will not get an infallible system.</P>
    <P>We will deal with a fallible system of justice no matter what system we get where injustice and miscarriages of justice unfortunately will still exist despite the best applications of the law. There are alternatives to the proposed abolition of the jury system which can achieve the same objective in the knowledge that there is a cross-section of the community who are assessing what they believe to be a reasonable amount of general damages.  Let us remember that in three cases in 1983 and 1984 the Supreme Court changed the basis of assessment of general damages for pain and suffering <i>et cetera.</i>  They fixed a <Col N="253" /> maximum level of £150,000.  That serious change, which takes account in assessing future earnings that ability to earn in the future might involve a period of redundancy, of unemployment, prospects of marriage <i>et cetera,</i> has ensured there is a greater sense of reality in the amount of the awards being made to litigants who seek compensation in the High Court.</P>
    <P>Therefore, there is a mechanism in the court system to ensure that the basis of assessment can be changed as social realities change.  I do not believe we should change the system because there are vested groups who believe it should be changed, groups who have brought many of their problems upon themselves.  Why should a citizen of the State be penalised by a lesser amount of damages, than his injuries are serious enough to merit and which, in the opinion of his peers is the value of his claim even in the situation I am suggesting where the judge will state the financial guidelines for the jury?  Why should an individual who has suffered severe damage be penalised because the insurance industry decide they cannot meet the claims?  The reason given is that the premiums are too high.  Fair enough, they are too high.  Where is the guarantee that in the event of the abolition of the jury system premiums will come down? In all of the submissions by the insurance industry I have seen only the bald statement that premiums will come down.  I am to be convinced that premiums will come down.  We should try to bring about a system which will achieve the objective of reducing insurance premiums.  This I am interested in as a person who pays insurance, employer's liability insurance, public liability insurance and car insurance. I as a private citizen am hopeful that they will come down but I want to operate within a system which ensures that those who suffer pain and suffering and have a claim achieve justice in the courts.  Every individual is entitled to that.</P>
    <P>In Britain, it is true, claims are lower and assessment of damages is lower but the basis of assessment is very different. There are instances which can be quoted, about which I have grave reservations <Col N="254" /> that the amount of damages made available to individual litigants in the UK was adequate.  I do not think it was adequate.  On the other hand, individuals can in this country assess claims in certain cases which are too high.  If they are too high, the insurance company has the ability to appeal to the Supreme Court as an appellate jurisdiction.  An individual who gets too low an award has no such appeal.  He has in theory but not in practice. Therefore, whilst we want to bring claims down to a reasonable level, if we are going to have levels of assessment of damages let them be a little high because the only people who will be able to appeal against them will be the insurance companies, not the individual.  I am in the corner of the individual who is hurt and has a legitimate claim.</P>
    <P>We can achieve consistency within the High Court personal injuries system as it operates if we give the judge greater latitude to make recommendations to the jury on the level of damages and ensure that there is not the crazy system where there are four counsel on each side.  Very seldom do we have a situation where four counsel on each side appear, to be quite honest about it.  Granted, the legal profession will have to reform themselves or be reformed.  In the same way, we in our branch of our profession must reform ourselves or be reformed.  At least, I can say that the Incorporated Law Society recognise the fact that there is a need for reform.  We have, as stated by the previous speaker, accepted that the three counsel rule should be modified and amended.</P>
    <P>In relation to the claim that we could reduce premiums by reducing awards and legal costs I would say this: obviously, if we modify the three counsel rule we will reduce legal costs.  We should remember that when costs are awarded the fees of those who give technical evidence, be they doctors or engineers, are included in the legal fee.  The job of the solicitor at that stage is to pay those who attended the court.  Therefore the 15 per cent is not exclusively a solicitors fee.  The solicitor collects the fees on behalf of the technical people who may have fees to be paid as <Col N="255" /> a result of the case being heard.  That should be borne in mind.  Therefore, it is not simply a case of barristers getting 15 per cent of the claim.  There are other people involved who give of their time and must be paid accordingly.</P>
    <P>The wider question of a no fault system should be investigated.  I have my reservations as to whether it would be possible for us to fund such a no fault system and ensure that employees who are injured will get a level of damages which under the present system is reasonable.  If the fund is not sufficient, then, obviously, the awards will be less.  That becomes of paramount importance in ensuring that the fund operates rather than whether or not a just settlement is reached between the parties.  It is important that we do not lose sight of that fact.  The main reason for claims being brought in the first place is that justice be done for the injury which has occurred.  Whilst we have become more litigation conscious, certainly in the last five to ten years, there is also the situation that if we had safer places of work and better supervision in factories we might not have these injuries in the first place.</P>
    <P>There is a broader reason for there being so many claims and cheques paid by insurance companies to individuals who have been injured.  There are places within the sphere of the legal profession within which I operate where an injured person will be guaranteed a successful claim because the brokers and insurance companies know that many of those are unsafe places of work.  It is essential that we ensure that our safety at work and industrial legislative provisions are properly monitored thereby ensuring that these are safer places in which to work. It is my understanding that the requisite legislation exists if only its provisions were properly implemented by way of inspections and so on to ensure that such safety standards are maintained at the appropriate levels.</P>
    <P>There is also the point that should not be missed, which is that 95 per cent of all cases which are initiated in the High Court are settled before going to court at <Col N="256" /> all.  One must examine the fact that 5 per cent only of cases get into court.  There has been a suggestion that there should be a 14 day waiting period before a court hearing during which time one must have settled one's case or go to court for the full hearing.  One of the reasons for there being a cat and mouse situation as described by the previous speaker is that, having given counsel full documentation, having received advice and proofs, an estimate of the value of the claim is given but, in many cases, the insurance companies do not rise to that level.</P>
    <P>Why should it be incumbent on an individual to settle a claim if the insurance company are not offering an appropriate amount of money, particularly in marginal cases worth, say, £15,000 or £20,000? Under this proposal, one would have had to settle one's case 14 days before the date of the court hearing or continue?  Let us suppose one has been offered £10,000. One is then in the position that the insurance company would know that if the claimant settles two weeks before the date of the court hearing he must accept £10,000.  If the claimant goes to court he may reckon that his case is worth £20,000 but he will have to pay £3,000 or £4,000 if it is a full court hearing.  That is a cat and mouse situation one cannot avoid.</P>
    <P>The new system I am proposing &mdash; not the abolition of juries but rather a judge giving them guidance &mdash; would bring greater consistency <i>vis-à-vis</i> awards made in the High Court, when insurance companies might then make the litigant concerned a proper offer which would obviate a court hearing.  Of course there is the rule that, once a barrister has been asked for advice and proofs, he is entitled to his fee &mdash; that is a matter for the Bar Council &mdash; but there are some individuals within the insurance industry, within claims departments, who are realistic, practical and make a practical offer which is accepted by many litigants.  However, there are others who are very impractical, who perhaps wish to make a name for themselves by endeavouring to get somebody to reach a low settlement.  There are very few solicitors who would settle on that basis.  But within the settlement <Col N="257" /> system obtaining insurance companies must make a proper settlement offer. Otherwise a solicitor would be open to an action for negligence on the part of the person he is endeavouring to represent, for advising him to settle for too little.  There are many such cases from which it is difficult to draw general conclusions.</P>
    <P>Reform is vital by way of ensuring that the perception of the administration of justice is seen by ordinary people to be fair and equitable.  However, when we talk about reforming the law in this area we should always remember that the ability of the individual employee to appeal to the High Court does not exist.  For that reason &mdash; if there is to be some controversy &mdash; then let any settlement be a little on the high rather than on the low side because it will be up to the insurance companies to exercise the right of appeal. In many cases they are the only party to the proceedings who, for all practical purposes, can exercise that right of appeal.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Yates that there must be a major reform of the whole system.  I believe the majority of my profession would welcome such review.  If our job is to be done properly and efficiently then it must be carried out within an efficient system.  Many of the delays occasioned in court lists, and in dealing with matters like probate, land registry and so on, result in the perception of the legal profession not being as good as it should be.  This, in turn, means that clients tend to blame the legal profession. They are not interested in the delays occurring along the line, whether it be in the processing of a High Court claim, taking out probate, a land registry transfer or whatever.  It is for the members of the legal profession to act responsibly.  Likewise it is the responsibility of the Legislature to ensure that that system is efficient, fair and equitable. If both branches of the legal profession do their utmost to so ensure, with the Legislature providing the system within which they can work efficiently on behalf of their clients, then many of the difficulties now being experienced, not merely <Col N="258" /> in relation to personal injury claims but with regard to all aspects of the law, could be rectified within a short time to the benefit and satisfaction of all concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>Speaking as a layman I agree that there is obvious need for a dramatic reform of the whole system for dealing with personal injury claims. Whenever this subject has arisen in discussion in recent years &mdash; the reasons for there being such high insurance premiums and so on &mdash; it seems always to have centred on the high claims and costs paid out in settlements.  Probably there is some justification for that if one examines the large number of cases in which exorbitant claims have been lodged and paid out.  This arises for a number of reasons. The degree of injury having been determined by the court, having been settled out of court or whatever may be the circumstances then the degree of liability is agreed inside or outside the court.  This results in the degree of liability being levelled on one or other party, ultimately both parties coming up with a solution which, surprisingly, appears to militate one way or the other against the general insurance policyholder.</P>
      <P>Up to the time of this discussion it was the general opinion among insurance brokers, agents and companies that the major cause of high premiums was the high cost of claims.  Every time the discussion arose this argument was put forward. Mysteriously for some unknown reason since the introduction of this legislation the insurance companies seem to have had a second look at the position.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for affording me an opportunity to raise this matter.  This is an historic occasion in so far as it is the first time that Parliament has had an opportunity to put on record the plight of the Saharan people.  I take <Col N="259" /> this opportunity to speak not alone on my own behalf but on behalf of Deputy Andrews and Senator Connor and also on behalf of the Saharan people.  I was privileged to be on an all-party delegation which was invited to visit the Sahara two weeks ago and see at first hand the problems which exist.  Following that detailed and exhaustive visit to the Sahara we came to the conclusion that these are the forgotten people of Africa.  We hear a lot about the problems in the Middle East and about America versus Russia but we seldom hear or read about the problems of this very fine race who have been fighting for centuries for their self-determination and civil rights.</P>
      <P>When we visited the Sahara we were met openly by the people there.  We witnessed an excellent form of democratic election and democratic representation by the people.  We visited many camps where on occasion we witnessed in the middle of the Sahara Desert 40,000, 50,000 and 60,000 people living under canvas with very little sanitation or water and in some cases with very limited food. Nevertheless, these very proud people of the Sahara were able to show the world what can be done against impossible odds.  They have an excellent educational programme for young children and with very limited resources they operate excellent hospitals with trained nurses and doctors all of whom work for the system without pay and with very little, if any, reward other than the hope of making a contribution to self-determination.  Any race of people who are that dedicated to their cause must be admired and supported.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Chair will be aware of Resolution No. 104.  It is supported by the vast majority of countries.  It urges the parties to the conflict &mdash; the Kingdom of Morocco and the Polisario Front &mdash; to undertake direct negotiations with a view to bringing about a cease-fire to create the necessary conditions for a peaceful and just referendum for self-determination for the people of Western Sahara, a referendum without any administrative or military constraints under the auspices <Col N="260" /> of the OAU and the UN and calls for the implementation of the cease-fire.  The Chair will be aware of that resolution because as leader of the Irish delegation at the 74th Interparliamentary Union Conference in Ottawa in September 1985 he supported that same resolution put was incorporated in the resolution put before that conference.  That was the resolution which called on the parties to the conflict, namely the Kingdom of Morocco and the Polisario Front:</P>
    <P>...to undertake direct negotiations so as to arrive at a cease fire aimed at creating the necessary conditions for a peaceful and just referendum under the auspices of the OAU and the United Nations, with a view to the self-determination of Western Sahara and without any administrative or military constraint;</P>
    <P>It also called:</P>
    <P>...on all parliaments to support the efforts of the United Nations and the Organization of African Unity with a view to the implementation of the relevant resolutions and decisions on the question of Western Sahara.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is any area in the world where the Interparliamentary Union are almost unanimous in their support of that resolution and are in support of self-determination for the people of the Sahara.  Most countries support the resolution and in particular the OAU of which the Saharan people and the Polisario Front are members.  The President is Vice President of that organisation.  This demonstrates to the western world the support of the African people, with the exception of Morocco, for the cause of the Saharan people.</P>
    <P>The problem in the Sahara is not unlike the problem in Ireland.  For 800 years we suffered under foreign domination and struggled against it.  The Saharan people have the same problem because they had to struggle against the French who abandoned them and handed the problem to the Spanish.  They in turn abandoned them and handed them to Morocco.  We have a problem similar to that of our <Col N="261" /> friends in the Sahara Desert who are fighting against impossible odds.  It is a problem which the Moroccans cannot and will not win.</P>
    <P>The Moroccans have created the impression in the western world that this is a problem of Morocco versus Algeria, but that is not the case.  The problem of the Saharan people is a problem of seeking self-determination against an aggressor.  The aggressor is the Kingdom of Morocco who have tried to exploit the people of the Sahara as the French and Spanish did over a century.</P>
    <P>Self-determination in my opinion and in the opinion of my colleagues who visited the area is more than justified.  We could find no reason to justify the presence of the Moroccan Army in the Sahara Desert.  The Sahara is by right the property and domain of the Sahraran people. If given the support of the EC, and the Western world, those people will build a nation which, in the opinion of the group who visited them, will be an example to those states who have fought for self determination on the African continent.</P>
    <P>One might ask why is there a Moroccan presence in the Sahara.  The answer is quite simple.  The Sahara, like many other areas in Africa, is very rich in minerals. The Kingdom of Morocco has to support an army of 30,000 troops who have built a 1,500 kilometre wall across the Sahara desert.  Those troops have mined that wall and are defending it with arms and ammunition supplied by many of our Western allies.  Those arms are being used to deprive the people of the Sahara of their just rights.  When thinking of that wall built across the Sahara to divide the people one cannot but think of the wall built across Northern Ireland, above my constituency of Louth, which divides the people of Northern Ireland and Southern Ireland.</P>
    <P>My colleagues and I believe that Ireland should take the lead on this.  Ireland, as a non-aligned country that is not a member of NATO and does not have any axe to grind with Morocco, has a right to take up the cause of those people.  In fact, we should support the ordinary people of Morocco who are suffering because of <Col N="262" /> the greed of the people who rule their land.  Not only are we seeking human rights for the people of the Sahara but human rights for the people of Morocco. We spoke with and interviewed the prisoners of war captured by the Polisario Army and they did not know of Ireland or the UK.  They never heard of the EC or America.  We asked them what they were fighting for in the war and the answer was that they were involved for the money they got.  Those young boys and young men with families were being paid £25 per week to fight in the war. They were anxious that the war should be brought to an end so that they could return to their homes in Morocco.  They did not know what they were fighting for and they did not want to be in the Sahara.</P>
    <P>A deserter told us that because his machinegun broke down while he was at the front he was fined eight months pay by his commanding officer.  He dropped his machine gun, ran to join the Polisarios and is now living with the Saharan people.  The case of those people has never been brought to the attention of the Irish people.  With due respect to the Minister of State and the Government, the problem of the Saharan people has been a minor one in the eyes of the Department of Foreign Affairs and of successive Governments.  It is easy for us to act as the Pontius Pilate and wash our hands of the problem.  We may say that we support the resolution laid before the IPU conference but we are not doing anything about the problem.</P>
    <P>In 1980 the Government of the day gave humanitarian aid to those people but that aid did not reach the people of the Sahara until 1983.  How many people died in the desert in the meantime?  It is fortunate that other countries got aid to those people much quicker than we did. It is not my intention tonight to plead for humanitarian aid but to call for human rights for the Saharan people.  I am calling on the Government to fight for a people who have been treated in the same way as the Irish were treated.  What can we do?  We must take independent action at European level.  We do not need to know what the French, the Belgians, the Dutch <Col N="263" /> or the Germans are doing.  We are free to act on our own and we have a right in world terms to act independently. Excuses will not be accepted.</P>
    <P>Those who represent the Saharan people, the Polisario Front, were democratically elected but they have not the right to make their case because Heads of Government here, and throughout the EC, will not meet them and allow them make their case.  However, we have diplomatic relations with Morocco and we allow them to make a false and misleading case.  I make that statement on the basis of information that exists in the Department of Foreign Affairs and information that was obtained by EC delegations who visited the area.  Irish people were party to a false and misleading report which was adopted by the EC. Having visited the area we are in a position to refute that information.  The Minister should send officials of the Department to the area and make a judgment then.  I am confident that if that happens those officials will come back holding the same views as Niall Andrews, Michael Bell, and John Connor.  Those forgotten people have not had an opportunity to make their case to the EC.  I am thankful that the people of the Sahara, through the wisdom of their leaders have seen the light and are inviting parliamentarians and journalists to the area.  On the basis of advice given by our delegation they have sent a delegation to Ireland to make their case.</P>
    <P>It is left to people like Deputy Andrews, Senator Connor and myself to make the case here for those people.  I regret that we are keeping the Ceann Comhairle and the Minister of State in the House at this late hour but the cause of these people is worthwhile.  I understand that 500,000 people live in the desert.  They have not seen rain for 20 year.  Agricultural production is nil and there is no sanitation.  One does not see any nice semi-detached houses in the desert and most of those people live under canvas.  Half of the people living in the desert are children.  It is to the credit of those people that they have built <Col N="264" /> schools out of mud.  The children are being given a proper education because their leaders realise the importance of education.  Those people can survive by good medical support.  What has Ireland done for those people?  We sent aid in 1980 but it took three years to get there.</P>
    <P>I should like to thank the Chair for affording me the opportunity of placing on the record of the House, on behalf of Deputy Niall Andrews of Fianna Fáil, Senator John Connor of Fine Gael and myself, representing the Labour Party, the plight of the people of the Sahara.</P>
    <P>Thanks be to God, the peoples of West Sahara, through the wisdom of their leaders, see the light.  They are inviting journalists and parliamentarians there.  On the basis of our advice they have come here to make their case.  Elsewhere, they could not make their case for reasons which the Minister well knows.  It falls on people like Senator Connor and Deputy Niall Andrews and others to make their case for them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. G. Birmingham)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to have the opportunity, even at this late hour, to speak on the subject raised by Deputy Bell.  I know that his visit moved him deeply.  Senator Connor was also deeply moved by what he saw. The origin of this conflict described by Deputy Bell is a dispute about the status of the territory west of the Sahara.  For many years it has been the subject of dispute, most recently between Morocco and Algeria in the UN and other international fora.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>West Sahara is a former colonial possession of Spain.  In 1975, a UN visiting mission to the territory conceded that measures should be taken to enable all Saharans originating in that territory to decide their future in complete freedom, in an atmosphere of peace and security. In November 1975, Spain, Morocco and Mauritania agreed on a declaration of principle known as the Madrid Agreement, under which Spain transferred its authority to a temporary administration comprising a Spanish Governor General and two deputy governors, one to be <Col N="265" /> nominated by Morocco and the other by Mauritania.</P>
    <P>In February 1976, Spain formally terminated its presence in the territory.  Following the withdrawal of Spanish troops, Moroccan troops moved into the northern and eastern parts of West Sahara and Mauritanian forces moved into the southern area.  Since then, Algeria has rejected claims by any state to the territory. It is argued that West Sahara should become an independent state and Algeria has worked closely with the resistance movement in West Sahara, popularly known as the Polisario Front, towards that end.</P>
    <P>In 1979, efforts by the Polisario Front and Algeria were successful in persuading Mauritania to abandon its claim. Morocco, though, has continued its presence and has not recognised either Polisario or the SADR.  Polisario engaged in an effort to oust the Moroccans from West Sahara through a campaign of military resistance.  A number of efforts have been made to encourage a peaceful solution of this tragic problem.  In particular, the OAU have continued to play an active role and as a result of their deliberations in Nairobi in 1981 Morocco agreed to the principle that a referendum should be held to enable the people of West Sahara to exercise their right to self determination.  The OAU have been assisted by and have worked in close co-operation with the Secretary General of the UN.</P>
    <P>Approaches by Morocco and Algeria have been consistently presented by both States at a number of UN General Assembly sessions.  Both States have sought the support of other Un member states from their different standpoints. It is against that background that I will explain Ireland's position in relation to this dispute.</P>
    <P>First of all, we regard the dispute, in part at least, as involving two states with whom we have friendly relations and diplomatic ties.  Therefore, our efforts have been directed at the achievement of a peaceful settlement of the conflict.  We have not believed until now that the endorsement of the position of one or <Col N="266" /> other of the parties to the dispute would serve the interests of a peaceful agreed settlement.  We have joined with our EC partners and have been engaged in encouraging a consensus between Morocco and Algeria at the UN General Assembly, rather than lending our support to a tabling of competing resolutions. It is worth recording that in 1983, at the 38th Session of the UN General Assembly, a consensus resolution on West Sahara was adopted.  In our view that helped to advance a solution.  The practice has been for Ireland to abstain from competing resolutions.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bell referred to the plight of refugees and the very difficult conditions in which people are living in West Sahara. We have to be concerned about the wellbeing of the Saharan people, many of whom are obliged to live in most difficult circumstances in Algerian camps while the dispute continues.  We have strongly and consistently supported the implementation of the principle of self-determination in respect of the territory so that a permanent settlement can be found.  We agree that this should be done by the holding of a referendum which would allow the people themselves to decide the status of their territory.  We welcome the Moroccan agreement to such a referendum, but we note that Morocco refuses to enter into direct negotiations with the Polisario because they do not recognise that organisation as representatives of the Saharan people.</P>
    <P>In those circumstances, we have supported recent efforts by the UN Secretary General, working in co-operation with the Secretary General of the OAU, to offer his good offices as an intermediary with a view to advancing an agreement. Therefore, we support strongly the principle of self-determination.</P>
    <P>However, we do not regard ourselves as being in a position to recognise West Sahara as an independent State before the Saharan people declare themselves in a referendum.  It is Ireland's practice to recognise states and not governments.  It has not been our practice to give formal recognition to liberation movements or <Col N="267" /> similar organisations and more particularly not to ascribe to them the characteristics and status of a state.</P>
    <P>The UN Secretary General and the Secretary General of the OAU are continuing their efforts and talks with the Polisario Front and Morocco to secure a basis for agreement.  We understand that the two secretary generals are reviewing developments to date and we support this important attempt to bring this tragic, bitterly divisive conflict to an end through mediation.  We hope an opportunity will be found in the near future for the Saharan people to exercise fully their right to self determination.</P>
    <P>The Government contribute to the general refugee programme of the UN <Col N="268" /> High Commission for Refugees in Geneva.  We have allocated some funds specifically for the relief of Saharan refugees in Algeria.  Deputy Bell will know that in the past week I have had some contacts with others interested in this problem and I am considering the possibility of giving further assistance to alleviate the problems which those refugees are facing.  I have been able to explore possible avenues which would allow us to assist.  Pending a political settlement, that is the practical way for us to express our concern.</P>

      <P>The <i>Irish Spruce</i> was sold by public auction on foot of a court action brought by the holders of the ship's mortgage against its owners.  The vessel was never owned by Irish Shipping Limited but was leased to that company by its owners.  The price obtained at the court auction was $5.0 million and this amount was in line with existing market expectations and compared well with the price obtained recently for similar Panamax ships.  New Panamax ships can now be built for approximately $15 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The cost of building the <i>Irish Spruce</i> at Verolme, that is £30 million approximately, was substantially in excess of the world market price of Panamax vessels and the major part of the cost can be categorised as ship yard subsidies.

    <P>
      <Col N="63" /> The area of unplanted land held by my Department on 31 December 1985, was 44,500 hectares.  This includes a substantial area of land which for a variety of reasons (e.g. grazing-turbary rights, sale-exchange proceedings, wildlife conservation and nature reserves, amenity considerations) is not available for planting. Aside from these considerations, it is the normal practice of my Department to plant available land in the first planting season after its acquisition or as soon as possible thereafter.  The period between completion of acquisition formalities and planting varies depending on the nature and location of the site or other special circumstances affecting it but on average the period is about one year.</P>

      <P>The State planting programme as outlined in the Government's plan <i>Building on Reality</i> is aimed at achieving planting of the order of 7,500 hectares per annum.  In addition my Department operates schemes of grants to encourage private planting.</P>
      <P>The Department's seed sowing programme each year is based on the expected requirements of the State planting programme in the succeeding years and I am, therefore, satisfied that the plant supply situation will be adequate to meet the requirements of that programme.</P>
      <P>Plants for private afforestation are normally provided by the private nursery trade and to this end the Forest and Wildlife Service sells seeds to the trade as well as plants surplus to the Department's own requirements.</P>

      <P>It is not normal practice to leave thinnings in plantations.</P>
      <P>In some instances, there can be delays in extraction because the timber merchant is awaiting the availability of suitable extraction machinery or improved weather conditions.  Occassionally, timber merchants may leave in the forest small volumes of material which they regard as unsuitable.  The Forest and Wildlife Service repossesses such material and makes suitable arrangements for its disposal where practicable.</P>

      <P>The Government is fully committed to expanding the <Col N="65" /> area under forestry by both the State and private interests.  This commitment was confirmed by the Government in its economic plan <i>Building on Reality</i> where it was stated that investment in forestry in the years 1985 to 1987 would aim at the establishment of plantations at an annual average rate of some 7,500 hectares per annum to be augmented as much as possible by private planting.  The necessary funds for afforestation both State and private are provided by the Government annually within the overall constraints on Exchequer resources.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Fisheries and Forestry (Mr. Kavanagh)</NameTxt>
      <P>Studies by An Foras Talúntais identify 1 million hectares in low intensity agriculture which would be more productively used in forestry. It is estimated that of this at least 500,000 hectares are capable of achieving very high yields by Irish forestry standards (18 to 24 cm per hectare per annum) while another 500,000 hectares has high production potential by European standards (i.e. average yield of 16cm per hectare per annum).</P>
      <P>The question of the disposal of State forests would be a matter for decision by the Government and there is no such proposal before either me or the Government at present.  In this connection I would refer the Deputy to my statement to Seanad Éireann on 7 May 1986 on the matter.</P>

      <P>The Transport (Re-Organisation of CIE) Bill, 1986, which provides for the establishment by the board of CIE of three subsidiary companies having responsibility for Dublin city buses, provincial buses and the railways, passed Committee Stage in Seanad Éireann on 12 June 1986 and I expect the remaining Stages to be passed this week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been aware for a considerable time of the concerns expressed by the CIE workforce through their trade unions about the re-organisation of the <Col N="69" /> board and account was taken of them before the Government reached its conclusions on the nature of the re-organisation. In November last I met a deputation from the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the CIE group of ICTU unions for a full discussion.</P>
    <P>In preparing the Bill great care was taken to ensure that the conditions of employment of the CIE employees to be transferred to the new companies would be fully protected.  Furthermore, as an indication of a positive approach to protecting the workers' interests, I agreed to a number of amendments in Seanad Éireann which further clarify the situation.</P>
    <P>The re-organisation of CIE in accordance with the Bill will not of itself lead to any reduction in employment in CIE. The board intends to continue to achieve any reductions in numbers employed through natural wastage and the use of existing arrangements agreed with the trade unions, representing the board's staff, concerning redundancies.</P>
    <P>The primary purpose of the re-organisation is to so structure CIE as to maximise its chances of success in the future both for the entire group and its component parts; to build on the financial and other improvements of the past three years; and to put behind it the poor industrial relations and escalating losses which marked many years before 1983.</P>

      <P>A State grant of £359,000 is being paid to CIE this year in respect of completion of the customs clearance building and other passenger facilities.  I understand that CIE expect to complete <Col N="70" /> the customs clearance building by the end of July 1986.  The proposal for a main terminal building is part of an overall development plan for the harbour prepared by CIE.  This is at present undergoing financial appraisal by my Department in conjunction with the Department of Finance, in accordance with standard procedures for appraising projects of this nature.</P>

      <Col N="71" /> In the course of the Committee Stage debates in the Houses of the Oireachtas on the Finance Bill, 1986, I made it clear that my taxation policy was to maximise the employment content of this country in the motor industry.  Accordingly, the emphasis in taxation has been on the removal of duties from spare parts and tyres and tubes.</P>
    <P>I would point out to the Deputy that motor car duty was reduced to offset the VAT increase on 1 March 1986.  This was the only dutiable category of goods to benefit in this way.</P>

The appropriate amended certificate of tax free allowances for the current year, 1986-87, was issued to the taxpayer on 14 May 1986.  Any tax overdeducted from her earnings since 6 April last was refundable by her employer on operation of that certificate.</P>
      <P>The taxpayer's entitlement to a refund of tax for 1985-86 falls to be determined by way of a review of her liability for that year.  The inspector of taxes will now communicate with the taxpayer requesting the details which are necessary to enable the review to be carried out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. J. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 86 to 88, inclusive, together.  The statutory position is that if interest is to be avoided the taxpayer must pay the tax due within two months of the due date for income tax and capital gains tax and within one month of the due date for corporation tax.  The tax due is the amount charged by the assessment unless that assessment is under appeal in which event the taxpayer may specify an amount which he is prepared to pay on account pending the outcome of the appeal.  Tax under appeal is not otherwise payable but if the taxpayer wishes to avoid an interest charge, the payment on account must not be less than 90 per cent of the final liability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="73" /> The vast majority of appeals are settled by agreement between the taxpayer and the inspector and the negotiations are normally conducted by correspondence. An agreement in writing disposes of the appeal and interest on the balance of tax emerging for payment will arise only if that balance is not paid within the period of two months from the date of determination of the appeal.  Where there is an oral agreement between the inspector and the taxpayer the terms of that agreement must be confirmed in writing by the inspector and the taxpayer can, if he is dissatisfied, repudiate the agreement within 21 days of the issue of the letter thereby keeping the appeal open.  So long as the appeal remains open interest does not accrue.  It will be seen that in such circumstances any delays in reaching agreements which are attributable to the Revenue do not give rise to an interest charge.</P>
    <P>If, however, the assessment has not been applied or if a payment on account is not specified or if the payment on account is not adequate interest will run from the original due date.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the provisions of the existing law are reasonable in that, where availed of, they provide adequate protection for the taxpayer.</P>

      <P>The Revenue Commissioners have advised me that the taxpayer's husband died on 22 June 1984.  Details of his pay and tax for 1984-85 to the date of death were subsequently supplied by his former employer on a form P45 (cessation certificate) and, on the basis of those details, a tax refund amounting to £20.13 was issued to the taxpayer as personal representative on 20 January, 1986.</P>

    <P>The Inspector of Taxes has now been in communication with the former <Col N="74" /> employer and it has transpired that the details of pay and tax shown on the form P45 were incorrect.

      <P>My Department's 1986 allocation to the St. John of God Brothers, in respect of their mental handicap services including St. Mary's, Drumcar, is £11,255,000.  The appointment of the overall allocation to each of the Order's mental handicap centres is a matter for the provincial administration. I am aware that the administration has expressed concern regarding its overall allocation for this year and officers of my Department have met with representatives of the Order to discuss their situation.  As a result of these discussions, I have made some additional funds available which will help to ease the Order's financial difficulties.</P>

      <P>Persons who are in receipt of social welfare pensions are entitled to a living alone allowance by way of an increase in pension if they are aged 66 or over and are living alone.  The living alone allowance is one of a number of increases which may be granted in social welfare pensions in particular circumstances. Pensions payable from other countries are calculated in different ways depending on the scheme in question but there are no arrangements whereby elements of pension entitlement which are peculiar to one country are applied to pensions payable from other countries.</P>
      <P>Where, however, a person who is entitled to a pension from another EC member state is also entitled to a <i>prorata</i> Irish pension under EC Regulation or to a non-contributory pension on the basis of means, a living alone allowance would be payable where the basic conditions for that allowance are fulfilled.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 126 and 128 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The supplementary welfare allowance scheme provides weekly payments to persons whose means are not sufficient to meet their needs and those of their dependants.  In addition to basic weekly payments the scheme provides by way of additions to the basic SWA payment for assistance in meeting additional needs which may not be met by the basic payment.  In the case of rent, assistance can be provided towards rent payments in excess of £1.50 a week, the amount of the assistance in any particular case being <Col N="99" /> a matter for the health board to determine, having regard to the circumstances.</P>
    <P>Where a person is receiving a weekly payment other than basic suplementary welfare allowance, assistance towards rent payments can also be given.  The amount of assistance in such cases is determined by the health board to be appropriate to meet the person's needs.</P>
    <P>It has been the practice to calculate the amount of assistance towards rent in all cases in such a way as to ensure that the person should have, after payment of rent, a net weekly income not less than the basic level of supplementary welfare allowance less £1.50.  This practice is considered to be a reasonable one.  However, the whole area of rent supplementation and other aspects of the operation of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme are under review and the matter raised in the question is being examined in that context.</P>

      <P>Following reinvestigation of the unemployment assistance claim of the person concerned he was assessed with means of £55.90 weekly with effect from 22 January 1986.  His means are derived from benefit from his wife's earnings.

      <P>Income from farming under the various social assistance schemes administered by my Department is determined on a factual basis of the normal gross income from farming less the expenses actually and necessarily incurred in earning that income.  Assessments are made periodically and are generally based on the income in the 12 months immediately preceding the assessment.  In any case where, due to unusual factors such as crop failure the normal pattern of farming no longer operates in a particular case, it would be open to the person concerned to apply for a re-assessment of his means.  In such cases the means assessment would normally be further revised when the pattern of farming has again returned to normal.</P>

      <P>The notional method of assessing means for unemployment assistance purposes, which was based on the Poor Law Valuation System, had to be discontinued following the High Court judgment that the Valuation Acts were unconstitutional in certain respects.  This position still obtains and it would not be possible to revert to the notional method of assessment.</P>

    <P>Smallholders qualify for assistance on the basis of a factual assessment of their means such as that which applies to applicants generally.  The means test is designed to ensure that all applicants for unemployment assistance are treated in an equitable manner having regard to the resources available to them.  Payment of unemployment assistance is made to <Col N="106" /> those who are in genuine need and is directly related to the financial circumstances in each individual case.</P>
    <P>The aim of the means assessment is to calculate the net income generated by the farm in a normal year.  It is open to any applicant who feels that his means have changed to apply for a review of his means.  In carrying out a review account would be taken of any exceptional circumstances relevant to the particular case.  For example if an applicant were seriously affected by crop failure this would be taken into account.  However when a degree of normality was restored to the farm operation the case would generally be reviewed again so that the means assessment would reflect the normal situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Deasy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 160 to 162, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>Pig prices in the different member states of the Community are given on an annual basis in the Eurostat publication &ldquo;Agricultural Prices&rdquo;.  A further Eurostat publication entitled &ldquo;Agricultural Prices: Selected series from the Cronos data bank&rdquo; gives such prices on a monthly basis.  The latest available editions of both of these publications are available for reference in the Dáil Library.</P>
      <P>Because of different pig specifications applicable in the various member states, it is not possible to achieve a absolute comparability in prices.  Despite this reservation, however, it would appear that Irish pig prices have been among the lowest in the community.  At the same time the efficiency of Irish pig producers compares favourably with that of producers in Europe though Irish production costs, notably feed, tend to be higher.  I have been stressing for some time that in the absence of rationalisation of slaughterhouse capacities and modernisation of processing facilities, Irish pigmeat plants will not be able to withstand the growing competition on home and export markets. Substantial grants from IDA and FEOGA are available for suitable capital projects aimed at modernisation and rationalisation.  In addition, it is necessary for Irish factories to engage in product development and to be able to sell effectively, particularly on export markets. Allocation of resources to product and market development are matters for individual factories.  Improved competitiveness through modernisation and effective selling is one of the better ways of generating higher profits to enable all sectors of the industry to be amply remunerated, including producers' margins.</P>

I can say, however, that the allocation of manpower, transport or other resources is the subject of continuing <Col N="118" /> review between the Garda Authorities and the local Garda officers in the light of overall resources and demands on Garda services.  In this connection the Garda authorities have given me to understand that it is proposed to increase the strength at Tallaght when the next group of recruits complete basic training in September next.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Registrar of Titles that this is an application for registration of a Land Commission vesting order which <Col N="119" /> was lodged in the Land Registry on 11 April 1986.  Such applications are not generally as urgent as other applications because registration of title takes effect retrospectively from the date of vesting. There is at present an unavoidable delay in completing registration in these cases due to the pressure of other more urgent applications.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will, of course, appreciate that it would not be possible to give favourable treatment to any particular application except at the expense of other applications.  I am informed however, that the Land Registry gives priority to applications in respect of which it is brought to its attention that there are special grounds for urgency, such as bridging finance for example. Accordingly a request for expedition in this case will be considered if details of the reasons for urgency are submitted to the Land Registry.</P>
