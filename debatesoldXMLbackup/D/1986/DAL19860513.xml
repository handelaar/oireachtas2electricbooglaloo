    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. F. Fahey Mr. F. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Communications the number of deflectors being used to provide UK television reception in rural areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Minister for Communications (Mr. J. Mitchell) Jim Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Communications (Mr. J. Mitchell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that there are illegal rebroadcasting systems, which are also known as deflectors, in operation in both urban and rural areas throughout the country.  I have no information on the number of such systems in operation at present.  Such systems are liable to seizure and their operators are liable to prosecution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. F. Fahey Mr. F. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that those systems are operating very effectively &mdash; several Members of the House can enjoy the British television service as a result &mdash; why has the Minister repeatedly stated that it is not possible from the practical point of view for him to authorise the operation of those systems?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>First, the policy which is now being adopted has been adopted by successive Governments.  It is based on a number of considerations, the first <Col N="548" /> of which are technical considerations. These deflectors use up a great amount of the frequency spectrum.  If these developments were allowed to continue unabated there would not be any of the frequency spectrum left for necessary developments, not only in broadcasting but for emergency services and so forth. It is necessary that there should be regultion and that the best use of the frequency spectrum be achieved, bearing in mind probable future needs.</P>
      <P>There are also questions of copyright involved here.  This has been the subject of much discussion over the years between my Department and the Attorney General's office and, indeed, with other people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. F. Fahey Mr. F. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I stress that it is not correct that there is interference with the frequency spectrum?  In fact, only a very small number of frequencies are being used by this deflection system.  The advice the Minister has been given, according to his answer, is simply not true and I wish to put that on the record.</P>
      <P>In relation to copyright, the Minister has repeatedly told us that there are copyright difficulties with the Federation of Performing Rights Society in Britain. Have there even been any discussions on the subject with this federation or with the British broadcasting authorities?  If not, while we continually have this problem about copyright, why have no meaningful discussions taken place between the Minister's Department and the people involved in Britain who may raise difficulties about copyright?  From my information, gained from discussions with people in Britain, they would welcome discussions with the Minister's Department with a view to sorting out the problems which copyright presents. Finally, no effort has been made by his Department &mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. F. Fahey Mr. F. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>The real problem is that there has been no effort by the Minister's <Col N="549" /> Department to deal with those two problems &mdash; the practicality and copyright &mdash; over the years.  We have continually received the kind of answer which we have received today.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>By his tone Deputy Fahey thinks himself to be an expert in this field.  He has asserted that the information of a technical nature which I have given is incorrect.  It is not incorrect and I would ask Deputy Fahey does he even know what part of the frequency spectrum these deflectors occupy?</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. F. Fahey Mr. F. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>There are only three parts which operate in the west where this system is operating successfully.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say it is very clear, especially as the Deputy Leader of the Deputy's party, who seems to be good at keeping files on people and snooping on people as he was in Government, has to jump in in defence of Deputy Fahey, that Deputy Fahey knows nothing about the technical nature of the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not fair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact of the matter is that the deflector systems are pre-empting the use of the ultra high frequency system which will be needed, or almost certainly will be needed, for the future development of television in this country. In relation to the copyright aspect of the question, we have been avoiding any discussions with the British or anybody else on copyright for the simple reason that we are not going to walk into a situation whereby 60 per cent to 70 per cent of our population currently enjoying signals from the services from the air free <Col N="550" /> of charge would possibly then have to pay for them.  I am sure that that is not what Deputy Fahey or the Fianna Fáil Party want.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I ask the Minister if he would make any provision for people in rural areas who are seeking to have multi-channel viewing?  In fact, the people who are enjoying this facility at present are not causing any great difficulty, as far as I am aware.  The Minister should be aware if there are any objections into his Department.  There are quite a number of these deflectors operating and operating very successfully.  We are calling on the Minister to introduce legislation to allow these deflectors to be legalised and to charge a licence fee if required.  This is a reasonable approach. The Minister is not prepared to accept this proposal from us.  I can assure him that something will have to be done to bring these people into the legal situation. These people want to be legally set up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>A question, Deputy.  The Deputy is making a speech.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking the Minister if he would at least have his officials carry out an investigation into this matter so that when we come into Government we will be in a position to introduce the necessary legislation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is the case I would like to know why Deputy Leyden, when Minister of State, did not do anything about it?  If it is as easy as he suggested, I am sure his Government and himself, he having been Minister of State in my Department at the time, would have done something about it.  He knows more than Deputy Fahey or Deputy Lenihan on the subject and he cannot pretend to be ignorant like they may pretend to be.  The fact of the matter is that this is a complex problem.  It has received extensive consideration by myself and my Department.  I take the question by Deputy Leyden to imply a desire to supply multi-channel signals to even the remotest homes of this country.  This is <Col N="551" /> a desire I fully share and it is something we have been studying with great intensity in the last few years.  Unfortunately, so far no solution to the problem has been reached, but there has been some progress.  Hopefully, in the course of time we will be able to deal with this problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>While I appreciate the difficulty which the Minister has in defending an impossible situation, could I suggest to him that all that is required in the earlier stages would be a policy decision by him and the Government that they would allow the free transmission of the particular signal to rural parts which are not already in the overspill from the airwaves naturally.  As late as 1974 the Minister's predecessor in office, Dr. Conor Cruise O'Brien, had consultations with the BBC with a view to coming to an arrangement on the question of copyright for the extension of BBC 2 throughout Ireland as a whole rather than RTE 2, which he did not want.  Because of the Minister's indepth knowledge of the situation which I have no doubt he is receiving from his colleagues in Government and from the backbenchers of both parties involved in the Government, would he give very serious consideration to having the matter discussed by an all-party committee of the House?  This is something which concerns the people we represent and it is something for which there is a genuine and obvious request.  I am not saying a demand, but a request. I am not asking the Minister to make a decision here, but would he consider referring the matter to an all-party committee of the House to get their views, opinions and advice on how best the problem might be overcome?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I will certainly consider the suggestion made by Deputy Collins. There are a number of issues which complicate the matter.  First of all, there are throughout this country licensed franchisees of cable systems who in some cases are adversely affected by the existence of illegal deflectors.  If we were to make the policy decision which Deputy <Col N="552" /> Collins suggests &mdash; and there is some merit in that proposition &mdash; we could not do it before coming up with a policy on how to protect existing legal franchisees. The nature of the airwaves is such that you cannot set boundaries.  That is a difficulty. We are, as I have already said, examining this matter with great intensity. I fully share the aspiration of people in remote areas to have as big a choice of television channels as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. F. Fahey Mr. F. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to the question the Minister put to me, I will supply him with the technical data which proves that deflector systems can and are being operated successfully without any great interference with the frequency spectrum, which is totally underutilised at present.  Could I ask the Minister, in view of his reply on the copyright, if he is aware of the very small cost to cable television for copyright and if, based on that cost, he would withdraw the comment he made in regard to the cost for the remainder of the country, which I must also put to him is totally incorrect? There would be a very small cost for copyright to the remainder of the country, as there is a very minimal cost for rebroadcasting of cable systems.  I must say, unlike the way the Minister accuses me, he has shown an appalling lack of knowledge on the subject.</P>

      <P>A question, Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very difficult to respond to questions of the nature tabled by Deputy Fahey without being cross with him because he keeps asserting things which are the reverse of the truth. There would be a very significant cost for this country potentially if people who at the present time have access to cross-channel television services had to pay for them.  There would be a very big cost both to the individual subscriber and to the country as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. F. Fahey Mr. F. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Fahey might take the hint from the suggestion made by Deputy Collins that this is a subject which could be discussed in a more responsible way by means of an all-party committee where the facts and not fiction might be considered.</P>

    <P>2.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Communications the estimated cost of the provision of the long wave radio service by RTE; if he will approve the proposal from RTE and provide a capital grant for the provision of it; the estimated number of people to be employed on this project; and if studio facilities are available at the RTE radio complex in Donnybrook.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>RTE recently submitted a detailed proposal to establish an additional radio service on the long wave band at an estimated capital cost of £4.25 million.  Pre-transmission costs are estimated at £416,000.  The service is expected to employ 22 persons and it is proposed that studio facilities would be provided in leased accommodation in Dublin.  RTE have not applied for any capital grant assistance for the project. The proposal is under detailed examination at present and a conclusion will be reached as quickly as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Minister if he would be prepared to give the necessary sanction to RTE to proceed with this very important development?  Is the Minister aware that we are losing a very major market of great potential both in Britain and beyond by not having such a service, which could be set up at a reasonable cost?  The return on that investment would be well worth while.  I would call on the Minister to actively pursue this matter with RTE and that in advance of satellite broadcasting he <Col N="554" /> would launch this radio service which would give our producers, presenters and broadcasters &mdash; the best in the world &mdash; further opportunities at home to broadcast to Britain and beyond.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have already stated, RTE have submitted a very detailed proposal to me in recent times which is the subject of consideration.  I have already intimated over the past three years my support in principle for the idea, provided it can be shown to be a viable proposition.  That remains the situation.  I would very much hope that when the examination of the proposition for a long wave fourth national radio service is completed it will prove to be viable and that we will go ahead with it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Communications if he is aware that areas of County Donegal do not receive a reasonable reception of RTE 1 and 2; and the steps which are being taken to improve the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>This is primarily a matter for RTE.  RTE state that reception of their services in County Donegal are in general satisfactory; they are aware, however, that the quality of reception may vary in different parts of the county because of the nature of the terrain.  They say they would be happy to investigate individual cases and advise viewers to make the best use of available signals.  RTE state that they are proceeding to improve coverage by their services as quickly as their resources permit, but say that it will not be possible to effect any major improvements in County Donegal during the current year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I suggest that Deputy Gallagher take this matter up directly with RTE.  They told me that if specific problems were drawn to their <Col N="555" /> attention they would see how they could deal with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister accept that it is particularly difficult to expect people in those areas to pay the full licence for colour televisions while not receiving the same excellent reception as other areas?  Does he accept that some areas in County Donegal get better reception from some foreign channels than from our own?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is possible that is the case in certain areas depending on the location of the relevant transmitters. It is RTE's duty to ensure that television reception in every part of the country is at a level which is acceptable to the viewers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Can I ask the Minister if he will inform RTE that some areas in the west and the north west of County Donegal and particularly the Gaeltacht Lár areas, are receiving no picture at all and other areas are receiving a very poor picture?  Would he, as Minister responsible for communications, impress upon RTE the necessity to provide all parts of Donegal with the same reception as the rest of the country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have said, it is RTE's duty to provide a television signal to every part of this country at an acceptable level.  I accept fully that if there are pockets of any county which are not receiving a proper television signal, it is RTE's duty to ensure that they do.  I will draw the Deputy's questions to the attention of the RTE Authority.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government do not receive financial assistance from EC sources for the operation and maintenance of rail services.

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not accept that, in view of the fact that the EC accepts the need to maintain rail services and allows, under its regulations, for the subsidisation of these services, it would be reasonable in view of our state of underdevelopment that we should get assistance from the EC to maintain those rail services?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not certain that I could accept Deputy De Rossa's proposition. I am not sure that it would be to our national advantage.  He will know that the rail networks in some of the mainland European countries are very extensive and very costly.  I am not sure that it would be right to expect us to participate in the subsidisation of networks which are perhaps, in their case, grossly in excess of what can be socially justified not to mention economically justified.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister is aware that there are large tracts of this country which have been denuded of rail services on the basis of economies.  Would the Minister not agree that it would be far cheaper to preserve the rail services which we have and, if possible, to extend them and that it would be reasonable to seek assistance from the EC for the purpose?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the first part of the Deputy's question there have been closures in the past.  No closures have taken place for a very long time and <Col N="557" /> I do not anticpate any closures in the foreseeable future.  The McKinsey report said there was not any further scope for retrenchment on the railways and that the choice was to keep them open or to close them.  The report stated that the relevant cost of both options in the short to medium term at least was broadly of the same order of magnitude. The obvious thing to do, therefore, is to keep the railways.  That is the decision which the Government have taken. Moreover, we have tried in our dealings with CIE to arrange a better performance of the railways and the other component parts of CIE.  There have been dramatic improvements in that respect in each of the past three years and everybody in CIE should be commended for that.</P>
      <P>In relation to the second part of the Deputy's question I will repeat what I have already said.  There would be great danger in our proposing that railways should be subsidised by the EC.  It is far from clear that we would be net beneficiaries of such an arrangement.</P>

    <P>The works will include the provision of infrastructural services relating to the Dublin airport runway project and associated buildings, new accommodation for maintenance staff at Dublin airport, extension of the apron and provision of additional fuel storage facilities at Shannon airport, improved fire protection facilities for the control tower at Cork and the provision of new and replacement instrument landing systems at Dublin and Cork airports.  In addition, provision has been made for the payment of some £625,000, being the balance of a grant commitment for the construction of a new runway and related facilities at Carnmore airport, County Galway.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a separate question.  I have told the board of Connacht regional airport consistently over the past year and a half, or so, that I would give them every possible assistance other than further State funds.  This is what has been happening.  My Department are actively trying to meet deadlines in order to allow the opening of the airport on 30 May 1986.  I have every expectation that all the basic requirements will be met to allow that to happen.</P>

      <P>Has the Minister any proposals to provide capital for the Connacht Regional Airport in 1986?  In view of the fact that the airport project at Knock has progressed so well so far, would the Minister reconsider the decision not to provide any capital whatsoever for its development in 1986?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>State funds of £9.8 million have been spent on the airport <Col N="559" /> and another £2 million to £3 million has been spent to date.  I understand that the completion of the airport would require another £2 million or more.  Since January 1983 all grants made by the Exchequer must pass a commercial test &mdash; single decisions will be taken to bring some order into the way decisions are taken which would involve big financial commitments &mdash; and unfortunately the airport at Knock would not pass that test. Therefore, I cannot make available further State funds.  I think the airport board accept that.  What is important now is that we do everything possible to ensure that the investment made will be put to good use and that, notwithstanding all the prognosis to the contrary, the airport will achieve maximum success.  I intend to do everything possible to help the airport to become a success.</P>

      <P>When Deputy Wilson was in Government there was a proposal put tentatively to the European Commission.  It was not pressed at that time because of the vibrations they got back.  Subsequent inquiries elicited similar vibrations, so it was thought prudent by successive Governments not to press the point.  The most recent discussion I had in regard to the Connacht Regional Airport was many months ago.  I told the board that we would go to the EC but because they were unlikely to pass the Exchequer viability test they were unlikely to pass the EC test.  However, I told them that if they could give me ammunition to use in a submission to the EC I would be glad to use it.  I have not seen any such ammunition.</P>

      <P>Can the Minister tell me if the £2.7 million for Shannon includes the cargo handling facility which Aer Lingus propose to provide at Shannon?  Is there any provision to extend the mail order facility at Shannon and a number of other projects which are awaiting development there?  Can the Minister give an overall figure of the total to be spent in capital developments at Shannon in 1986?  My understanding is that projects under way or about to commence at Shannon will not be covered by the £2.7 million.  Is it proposed to borrow some money?</P>

The breakdown is as follows: new fuel storage facilities, known as the Western Fuel Farm, £1 million <Col N="561" /> to be spent by Aer Rianta; and further construction projects will account for £1.15 million; electronic equipment will account for £560,000.  The total will be £2.7 million.  That would not include any expenditure by Aer Lingus or other companies or agencies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The money spent by Aer Rianta will eventually rebound to the Exchequer because any surplus made by Aer Rianta will come back to the Exchequer.  Any repayments of borrowings would come out of the Exchequer, unless the investment makes a profit, as we expect it to do on this occasion.  Not only would there be no cost to the Exchequer but there would be a profit to Aer Rianta, and therefore to the Exchequer.</P>

The Minister has said that the £2.7 million does not include a provision for freight facilities for independent users as distinct from Aer Lingus.  I am satisfied that approximately £5 million will be spent at Shannon this year, a substantial boost to the construction industry, but would the Minister explain if the additional freight facilities for independent carriers will be included in this year's programme?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Communications the present position regarding the issue of a licence to Atlantic Satellites for the provision of direct satellite broadcasting on orbital slot 31 degrees west longitude; and the expected coverage of footprint.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Negotiations with a view to concluding an agreement with the company in question are continuing and in this regard I have agreed to a request from the company for an extension of the time until 10 June 1986 to allow it to comply with the conditions referred to in my reply to a question on this subject by the Deputy on 18 December 1985, columns 2731 to 2736, Volume 362, No. 14 of the Official Report.</P>
      <P>The footprint of a transponder is determined by the purpose for which it is to be used, the technical characteristics associated with that use, its power, and the size and sensitivity of the receiving dish.  The coverage area of an Irish DBS service would include the whole island of Ireland and a substantial portion of the UK using a 60 to 90 centimetre receiving dish.  Others such as cable operators in Europe using larger dishes could probably also pick up the signal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister made <Col N="563" /> provision for the downstream development of receiving dishes and associated equipment and the issue of licences to people who have this equipment?  Further, is he making provision for the involvement of both RTE and Telecom Éireann in relation to the services that will be provided by Atlantic Satellites?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>First, we have to finalise negotiations with Atlantic Satellites and see if those negotiations lead us to proceed with a direct broadcasting satellite project.  Only if such a project goes ahead should we address ourselves to some of the areas referred to by the Deputy.  It would not be appropriate for the Department or myself to be directly involved in some of them but in other cases it would be appropriate.  With regard to receiving dishes, I am considering this matter at the moment and I hope to be in a position to make an announcement in the very near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>I get the impression the Minister is dragging his feet in relation to this matter.  Certainly it appears he has had second thoughts with regard to the project.  I ask him to expedite a decision in relation to this major project.  It could have tremendous benefit for the country and we would be ahead of the British in relation to the launching of the satellite. Thus, major benefits could accrue to the economy and to employment here.  Does the Minister propose to place legislation before the Dáil in order to give Deputies an opportunity to discuss the long-term implications of the launching of the satellite and the control of films and videos that would be broadcast directly into Ireland? What kind of control does he envisage in relation to direct satellite broadcasting when it becomes a reality?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Deputy is serious when he refers to me dragging my feet on this matter.  As he pointed out in his question, we have got in ahead not only of the British but of many other countries by our expeditious treatment of the report of the satellite <Col N="564" /> committee.  As I pointed out to the House on many occasions, the committee was set up by Deputy Wilson who showed great foresight.  When that report came to me some months after coming to office I was able to deal with it very expeditiously. We had hoped to have got to a certain stage in the negotiations where we could agree a business plan with the company by 10 March but they requested an extra three months which runs out on 10 June.  This is a major project but one that carries considerable risks.  I can assure the House that not only will there be no delay but there will be expedition in the way my Department and the Government deal with this matter.  However, we will not so rush our fences as to make a mess of it as considerable sums are involved.  There are considerable risks but there are also considerable opportunities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>At one stage the Minister indicated there would be no financial risks for this country, that it would be the responsibility of Atlantic Satellites.  In fact, he said we would be getting 25 per cent of the share of the satellite free of charge.  Where are the financial implications for this country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Twenty-five per cent of nothing is nothing but 25 per cent of a very large sum could be a considerable asset to the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>Where does the cost for the State come into all of this considering the Minister stated originally that the agreement with Atlantic Satellites was a 25 per cent share free of charge?  We were given to understand that Atlantic Satellites would be taking all the risks with the Hughes Corporation of America and that we would have no financial commitment whatever.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I said there were large risks involved.  It is extremely important that we get right the business plan, the make-up of the satellite, the kind of services and so on.  Only by getting all these things right will we maximise the opportunities <Col N="565" /> here.  If we get them wrong we could lose many opportunities and it could be very costly.  It is a complex question. We are entering new ground.  It is a sector that is developing rapidly so that the latest technology is quickly out-of-date. What was relevant or correct a year ago may not be correct today and what is correct today may not be relevant or correct in a year's time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  A decision has to be made at the appropriate time but it must be taken with great care.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister stated that the footprint area depended a great deal on a number of technicalities which he listed in his reply.  Is it not true to say that the maximum footprint area has been defined and agreed internationally already, including France and some parts of Europe?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy knows, a slot in space was given to Ireland in 1977 and the footprint or area of coverage was agreed in 1977.  However, because of foreseeable technological developments it can be taken that the coverage area of a footprint would be much larger than was originally intended, and perhaps in years to come it will be much larger again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Has it been agreed internationally?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been agreed internationally that a slot in space be given to each country.  We got a very good location.  That was designed to give us a footprint broadly covering these islands.  The island of Ireland was the centre of the footprint but because of the ripple effect of airwaves it would also cover these islands.  Because of technological developments in relation to the capability of satellites and of receiving dishes, footprint boundaries are ever <Col N="566" /> widening.  I said earlier it should be possible for cable systems on the near continent, possibly to Scandinavia, to pick up the signals from such a DBS and it is also conceivable they could be picked up by cable systems on the east coast of the United States.  This is something that is developing all the time.  I will not be surprised if in due course the footprint for our satellite, if it gets off the ground, will be very much wider indeed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Communications the consequences for air travel to and from Ireland as a result of the European Court of Justice decision on 30 April 1986, particularly with regard to fifth freedom rights for Irish carriers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am unable to give a definitive view of the implications of the European Court of Justice decision of 30 <Col N="567" /> April last, until such time as I receive an official English translation of the French text of the decision.  I understand that this will take some time.</P>
      <P>Having said that, I can tell you that my understanding of the position is that the European Court decision established that: (a) the competition rules laid down in the Treaty of Rome are in principle applicable to air transport; (b) in the absence of a Council Regulation under Article 87 of the Treaty, the competition rules can be given practical effect only by action by a national authority under Article 88 or by the Commission under Article 89; (c) in circumstances where either a relevant national authority under Article 88 or the Commission under Article 89 had determined that an agreement or concerted practice between airlines infringed the competition rules, it would be contrary to the Treaty for the member states concerned to approve air tariffs and therby reinforce their possible anti-competitive effects; (d) unless and until action is taken under Articles 87, 88 or 89, no contravention of the competition rules can be presumed to exist in respect of any inter-airline arrangements.</P>
      <P>The European Court decision does not appear to have any immediate consequences for air travel to and from Ireland. As the substance of the cases before the Court related to tariff issues, it is not possible to say at this stage whether the decision has any implications in relation to matters such as market access, including the question of fifth freedom traffic rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>If Aer Lingus, for example, as one of the carriers between here and the United Kingdom and the Continent, proceeded now to take on passengers at Manchester for Amsterdam and take passengers at Amsterdam for Manchester en route to Dublin, would they be acting illegally as a result of this court case?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to be an impossible hypothesis because it would require the agreement of the British <Col N="568" /> Government and the British authorities to allow Aer Lingus to pick up passengers at Manchester, for instance, and allow them to travel on to Europe.  If it were possible to do that without British acquiescence it would be illegal and in breach of British aviation legislation and policy.  The Deputy has raised a very interesting point.  We had an extensive debate in this House on the Air Transport Act and one Deputy proceeded on the basis that this country was less liberal than perhaps our nearest neighbour or the Netherlands.  Several times I pointed out that this was a fiction because we are seen in the European Council as being the most liberal country in Europe in relation to air transport.</P>
      <P>Secondly, we allow fifth freedom rights from Shannon to most carriers but the fifth freedom rights we had out of Manchester on to Copenhagen and Amsterdam and one or two other places were withdrawn, although Aer Lingus had developed the routes at considerable expense.  Our fifth freedom rights out of Lourdes, Geneva and Milan were also withdrawn, following development of these routes.  Many people talk liberally but act conservatively when it comes to their own national interests.  It is the objective of our aviation policy that we achieve the maximum degree of liberalisation in aviation in Europe, consistent with continuity of air services in and out of this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  Anything I say <Col N="569" /> has to be taken as a preliminary view because we do not have the full English text, but it is our understanding of the judgment that it only affects tariffs, not access rights.  Therefore, it would not impinge on fifth freedom services.  However, the decision by the court will inevitably give an impetus to those of us at the EC Council of Ministers who have been urging greater liberalisation of air services within the Community.  We are in a minority.  Included in greater liberalisation has to be greater access to routes by way of fifth and sixth freedoms, otherwise the airlines of the Community will not be competing on equal grounds.  An airline based on a market of 3.5 million people is not competing on an equal basis with airlines who have access to a base of 60 million people.  It is interesting to note that speaking in Washington recently the British Secretary of State for Transport made this point in relation to British airlines being at a disadvantage compared to American airlines.  It is the very point I have been making to him about our airlines compared to British airlines. There has to be fair competition and that means there must be broad access to routes throughout the Community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>My understanding is that the recent judgment of the European Court related only to tariffs.  However, there is a lot more going on at EC level in relation to aviation matters.  During our Presidency in the second half of 1984 we set up a high-level working group on aviation.  The report of that group has formed the basis for discussion by working parties working towards a more liberalised regime for aviation throughout the EC.  It is my understanding that the Presidency at the meeting of the Council next month will come up with a package of liberal and progressive proposals.  We <Col N="570" /> cannot anticipate the package.  The question is whether it will be acceptable to the Council of Ministers, whether it will go far enough and whether it will be fair enough.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot speak for the Commissioner, but I have had discussions with him.  My understanding is that the Commission are going for greater competition in aviation and do not see Europe going through a completely deregulated situation <i>a la</i> the United States of America. I do not think anybody thinks that this is the right objective to pursue in this case.  I have to say that I admire greatly the efforts of Commissioner Sutherland to get increased competition in aviation throughout Europe, but I would caution him and the House to remember that one cannot have selective competition.  One must have fairly widespread competition and it must be fair.  It is no use expecting an airline from a country like Belgium with eight million people to have its hands tied behind its back in relation to access to routes compared to a British airline with 60 million people.  That would not be fair competition.  If competition is to be successful it has to be fair.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Communications the present position of the Commissioners of Irish Lights with regard to funding the operation, maintenance and development of lighthouses, lightships, and other navigation aids.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894, responsibility for the provision and maintenance of lights services, comprising lighthouses, light vessels, beacons and so on, around the coasts of Ireland and Britain is vested in three bodies, known as general lighthouse authorities, namely, the Commissioners of Irish Lights, who serve the coasts around Ireland, Trinity House which has responsibility for England and Wales and the Commissioners of Northern Lighthouses, who are responsible for Scotland and the Isle of Man.  While the lights in the three areas are separately held and <Col N="572" /> managed by the three lighthouse authorities, the whole system of lights around the coasts of Britain and Ireland is administered as a single financial unit. Expenditure is met from the General Lighthouse Fund which derives its income from the collection of light dues in ports in Britain and Ireland.</P>
      <P>There is a substantial gap between revenue from light dues in Ireland and expenditure by the Commissioners of Irish Lights.  This arises because the elaborate system of lights demanded by the geographical situation of Ireland has not been matched by a corresponding flow of shipping traffic into Irish ports.  The cost of operations of the CIL in the State in the year ended 31 March 1985 exceeded revenue by about £7 million.</P>
      <P>Following negotiations between the Irish and British authorities, it has been agreed that in future a greater share of the costs incurred by the CIL in the State will be met from sources in the State. Under the agreement, the lights dues collected at Irish ports will be supplemented as necessary by an Exchequer contribution so that total revenue from sources in the State will account for 50 per cent of CIL's expenditure in the State.  The arrangement will be phased in over a five-year period commencing at a level of 30 per cent in 1987 and increasing to reach the 50 per cent level by 1991.  It is estimated that the cost to the Exchequer in 1987 will be of the order of £1.4 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister like to tell the House whether any estimate has been made of the percentage of British ships and boats that have availed of the services of the Commissioners for Irish Lights around Ireland?  What percentage of the total does that account for?  Is there any way of so determining?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no precise way for so determining, although some attempt has been made at estimating the extent of British use of our lights.  I do not have the figures with me here.  The situation is that the Commissioners of Irish Lights are a 32-county body and therefore fall under the joint jurisdiction <Col N="573" /> of the British and Irish Governments. They are to remain a 32-county body and also an intrinsic part of the overall lights system for these islands.  The Commissioners of Irish Lights have been spending, within the Republic, a great deal more than the moneys got in port dues. However, it would be very unfair that 100 per cent of the expenditure for Irish lights in the State should fall on the State because British ships passing by our shores use those lights.  So it has been estimated that the appropriate cost would be 50 per cent for us and 50 per cent for the British.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the tonnage registered as Irish shipping and the tonnage registered as British shipping, would the Minister not agree that 50 per cent is more than a just share of the expenses, even taking into account the fact that Irish personnel are employed?  Would the Minister rebut charges made in the British House of Commons that Ireland was getting an undue amount of money in this regard?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I sympathise very much with what Deputy Wilson has said. I have let it be known to my counterpart in Britain that I am irritated, to say the least, by this issue.  As the House will be aware, it was originally raised at a meeting of the Public Accounts Committee at Westminster and as a result of the situation we have been forced to accept a situation where the Irish taxpayer will bear a part of the cost for Irish lights in the future, 50 per cent of the total expenditure after five years.  While our negotiators have done a good job, it still remains a fact that Irish taxpayers may be called upon to pay this proportion of the costs in future years.  There is no call on British taxpayers.  That is an anomalous situation and my irritation and anger has been expressed to my colleague in London.  However, as a result of negotiations we have now agreed on something a lot less than was originally demanded, a lot less than 100 per cent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Communications his policy with regard to an EC common transport policy; his priorities in the development of such a policy; and the present position of the Council of Ministers in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Ireland has maintained a positive attitude towards the development of a Common Transport Policy for the Community.</P>
      <P>The requirement to adopt a Common Transport Policy derives from Articles 2, 3, 75 and 84 of the Treaty of Rome.  In a judgment delivered in May 1985, the European Court of Justice, in an action brought against the Council of Ministers by the European Parliament, found that the Council was in breach of the Treaty of Rome for having failed to secure freedom in the provision of services in the field of inland international transport, and in not having fixed the conditions under which non-resident carriers might operate within a member state.</P>
      <P>In response to this judgment the Council at its meeting in November 1985 recorded its agreement on the following policy approach:</P>
      <P>(1)  creation of a free market in transport with no quantitative restrictions by 1992 at the latest;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  during the transitional period, <Col N="575" /> progressive adaptation of the bilateral road haulage permit quotas on a nondiscriminatory basis, coupled with a simultaneous development in Community quotas;</P>
    <P>(3)  elimination of distortion of competition during the transitional period.</P>
    <P>Proposals will now have to be debated and adopted to give effect to the Council's conclusion.</P>
    <P>As a priority I strongly support the principle of liberalisation of international road haulage and accordingly I favour the removal of quantitative restrictions between member states, subject to qualitative controls directed mainly towards technical and professional competence.  I am also adopting a positive approach to proposals being developed by the Commission in the areas of vehicle weights and dimensions and of the structure of vehicle taxation which proposals are designed to harmonise conditions of competition.</P>
    <P>As regards maritime transport policy, I have welcomed at the Council of Ministers, the EC Commission memorandum on maritime transport policy put forward in March 1985.  In its document the Commission supports the concept of a free competitive market and proposes that a number of measures be adopted, including measures aimed at combating unfair pricing practices of non-Community shipowners in the liner trade to and from the Community and all forms of discrimination and protectionism by third countries.  Measures are also proposed to open up the Community market in maritime transport services to all Community shipowners and apply the competition rules of the Treaty of Rome to maritime transport.  The Council of Ministers at its meeting in June 1985 agreed the main ideas in the Commission memorandum and asked that priority be given to discussion of the measures mentioned with a view to their early adoption into Community law.  These proposals are in line with the open port policy of successive Irish Governments and I will be supporting <Col N="576" /> their early adoption as a package. Discussions on the proposals are continuing.</P>
    <P>In so far as air transport is concerned, the forthcoming Transport Council will review progress being made on the tariffs, capacity and competition fronts. At this stage, it is not possible to indicate what decisions will emerge, but I suspect that further work may be necessary before a package of measures in these areas can be agreed.  The area of market access, to which Ireland attaches a particular priority, is likely to become a more prominent discussion point later this year.  I shall be using every possible opportunity to further our aim of expanding the commercial opportunities for Irish airlines to develop viable air services.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister agree that the Council of Ministers are giving the impression of foot dragging and that they had to be pushed into action by the court case brought against them by the European Parliament?

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Transport Council have been notorious for dragging their feet over the years.  After 22 years a set of proposals was finally agreed during our Presidency in the later part of 1984.  We got agreement on annual increases in the Community quotas for road hauliers for the next five years, there are some changes in weights and dimensions and a commitment to achieve liberalisation by 1992.  That was aided and abetted by the Court decision.  There is no doubt that there has been a great deal of foot dragging, but I am of the view that because of the pressure of certain Ministers, including myself, the European Court, the European Parliament and the Commission, movement is beginning to take place and by the early years of the next decade we will have a completely liberalised and harmonised road transport system in the EC.</P>

      <P>During the negotiations earlier this year with the Civil Service unions on an agreement on the 25th round and related matters, all outstanding arbitration findings were discussed in a working party.  Certain proposals were put which took account of the special factors which existed in the case of some of the Union <Col N="578" /> of Professional and Technical Civil Servants findings &mdash; for example, that offers had been made prior to arbitration but had been rejected by the union.  In the event the UPTCS did not accept the package of proposals then offered.</P>
      <P>In the light of the agreement reached last week with teacher unions and now being put to ballot by them, I had hoped to negotiate a settlement with the UPTCS on the same broad lines.  The union maintained that their arbitration awards were unique and they were not prepared to negotiate a settlement along the lines suggested.</P>
      <P>I regret that the union was not prepared to negotiate a settlement on these lines and that it has taken industrial action the effect of which on the agricultural industry could be out of all proportion to the alleged grievance being suffered by the members of the union.  I call upon them again to reconsider their position before major damage is caused to the agricultural industry and to return to the negotiating table with a view to negotiating an agreement on the same lines as was done for teachers.</P>

Already we have made offers to them in relation to the nine specific awards and findings which are available to their members.  As the House is aware, this is not a homogeneous group of people working within the Civil Service but different categories who are open to accept findings that have been made by the arbitrator.  I urge them, in the context of what they are disputing and the potential damage they can do to the agricultural industry and all the PAYE workers in that industry, to come back to the negotiating table where we can continue to negotiate with a view to finding a settlement to this dispute which is acceptable to both sides.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> After all, the question was mine as well.  Will the Minister agree that he and the Minister for Agriculture have a national duty <Col N="581" /> to use their good offices to resolve this escalating crisis?  They have a responsibility to protect the agricultural sector which is now under attack from both at home and abroad.  Will he agree further that the Government have acted appallingly in both of these matters?</P>

      <P>I can understand Deputy Noonan's concern when speaking on behalf of the Opposition party and I accept that this is a matter of national concern which crosses party political lines.  For that reason I expect the Opposition party will join with me in requesting the trade union involved to respond to the invitation that has been extended here again today to enter into negotiations to see if a proper resolution of this matter can be found and, in the interim, to avoid doing the kind of damage Deputy Noonan has described.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>We on this side do not want to see the continuation of this because every day that passes spells more disaster for the agricultural community. Is the Minister aware that 5,000 tonnes of butter per day are manufactured in this country and that in one instance a substantial milk co-operative is within two days of having its stores full and that all co-operatives are now feeling the pressure?  Has he or have the Cabinet contingency plans for storage in the event of this strike continuing?  Can he assure us here today that farmers will not have to spill their milk once again into the rivers of Ireland?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>If they spill their milk into the rivers of Ireland they will be compounding one problem with another and will be breaking the environmental legislation this House has enacted.  I hope we will not reach that.  I am aware that we are at the season of maximum milk production. The efforts of the Opposition <Col N="582" /> would be best applied to joining with me in ensuring that negotiations are reopened with the trade unions.  The sentiment has been expressed by the other side that the message which should come out of this House is that there is a solution to this dispute; it can be negotiated, and in the process of trying to find that negotiated settlement, innocent third parties, including the Irish economy, should not be put at risk.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That provision be made in the Act giving effect to this Resolution so as to restrict, in the manner and to the extent specified in that Act, relief from income tax and corporation tax in respect of capital allowances on leased machinery or plant.</P>
      <P>This relates to amendment No. 7 for the Report Stage debate and, as we have provided a distribution of time which should allow us to debate all these amendments, I do not think there is any great need for me to elaborate on this.</P>

      <P>I have but one point to make on Resolutions Nos. 7, 8 and 9 which follow directly as a consequence of the issuing today by the Minister of a further booklet of amendments.  That makes the whole examination of the Finance Bill impossible.  It is the first time in my experience, which is more considerable than the Minister's, that we have had Resolutions being brought in in the last few hours to give effect to further amendments that have been coming in on the Bill right up to lunchtime and afterwards.  If that does not demonstrate that the Minister who was to bring about Dáil reform is making a total nonsense of it, nothing else could.  It is not possible to address ourselves to these Resolutions. I appeal to the Minister and, through <Col N="669" /> him, to the permanent staff to ensure that the House is never again treated with such contempt and mockery in the course of a debate on a Finance Bill.  Booklets of amendments arrived at lunchtime today.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is treating the House with contempt and the intelligence of the people also.  The Resolutions relate to amendments of which notice was given last week.  An indication was given last week of the subject matter of those amendments.  Furthermore the amendments were circulated in good time yesterday.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is interesting that Deputy O'Kennedy who is making a complaint on this occasion circulated amendments later than the ones I circulated and about which he is complaining. In the last hour or so he circulated amendments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is complaining about amendments I circulated yesterday that I gave notice of a week ago.  The Deputy is making a big issue of his being in favour of Dáil reform while at the same time he breaks his own rules. To my mind that does not make any sense at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>My amendment concerns one figure.  The Minister has 20 pages of amendments and that is a big difference.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy would not have time to think out any more amendments than that.  The fact that he has not produced a large number is simply an indication of his own lack of industry and not an indication of his adherence to Standing Orders because if he would he could, but he cannot.  The fact is that the Deputy circulated amendments later than mine without giving notice in the <Col N="670" /> same way as I gave it last week.  The purpose of the Report Stage debate is to enable amendments to be introduced.  It is quite reasonable that, having given notice a week ago and circulated the amendments yesterday, I should be introducing them today.  There is nothing abnormal about that.  In fact, it has happened every year there has been a Finance Bill that amendments have been circulated in this way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The only amendment in my name today, as distinct from those already on the Order Paper, is one to change one figure in the Bill by way of tax allowance.  I do not think any Minister would need very much notice in respect of that, even the Minister.  I contrast that with the fact that since the House rose last Thursday the Minister has introduced five different series of amendments, totalling 45 to 50 pages.  This is the first time that, in a debate on a Finance Bill, it was necessary to introduce three Financial Resolutions at this point.  Previously they were introduced at the outset of the debate on the Finance Bill.  This is a matter of shame for the Minister and should never be allowed to happen again.</P>

      <P>I do not have the slightest intention of giving any assurance of the kind sought by the Deputy.  I am quite concerned to ensure that points made either in debates or in representations I receive during the passage of a Finance Bill &mdash; if I am convinced they will improve, as the ones before the House are designed to, the climate for investment and job creation here &mdash; are introduced up to the last moment possible in the form of amendments.  That is my job.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. a1:</P>
      <P>In page 10, in the Table, Part 1, Column 1, to delete &ldquo;£4,700&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;£4,850&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the amendment is to endeavour to reduce the burden of income tax which has grown enormously under the Coalition.  On Committee Stage I tabled an amendment seeking to extend the payment of the standard rate of tax to those earning an income up to £5,000 but the Minister did not see fit to accept it.  Accordingly, I have reduced <Col N="672" /> my proposal.  It is worth noting that this &mdash; and the amendment in relation to married couples &mdash; is the only amendment I have tabled.  I am proposing we increase the application of standard rate of tax from the figure of £4,700 to £4,850.  The consequence of that would be that the figure for a married couple would rise from £9,400 to £9,700.  The income tax take under the Coalition has increased by more than 40 per cent and that says more than anything else about the ill-advised fiscal attitude of the Government.  They have increased the income tax take from £1,400 million to £2,500 million in the space of three years.  No other country has experienced an increase of that level in income tax.  We are all obliged to endeavour to convey to the Minister, even at this final stage, how essential it is in the interest of economic development and providing a breathing space for workers, investors and employers, that the proposed additional taxation he is introducing in the Bill is reduced even by the marginal amount I am suggesting.</P>
    <P>Unless and until we receive some signal from this Government that the direction they have followed is being radically altered they are dooming, not just themselves, but the country to wallowing in the depression we have experienced over the last few years.  Instead of moving in that direction what this Minister and Government are doing is adding new taxes, which are in effect income taxes, under a different name.  One of the best examples is the DIRT, which is imposing income tax at 35 per cent on deposit interest that was exempt from taxation to date because the income on the interest itself was below the tax limit.  It is absolutely essential, even at this late stage of the game, that the Government repent of the course they have been following at great disadvantage to everybody.</P>
    <P>I make no bones of the fact that what we are endeavouring to achieve here is a pattern of income tax similar to that which existed before this Government came into office.  I want to remind the House, and the Minister particularly, that at that time two-thirds of all income taxpayers were paying income tax at the <Col N="673" /> standard rate.  I believe I will have the support of all other parties in the House, if not that of the Government parties, in saying that we should as quickly as possible revert to that position because of the consequences for all of us of the penal levels of taxation imposed by this Government.</P>
    <P>In moving in that direction it is important that certain facts be put on the record. Within the last two weeks I asked the Minister in the House here what would be the gross and net cost to the Exchequer of applying the standard rate of income tax &mdash; 35 per cent &mdash; to two-thirds of income taxpayers in 1986 and, secondly, in a full year.  The Minister's reply was that the cost to the Exchequer of expanding the standard rate band to ensure that the marginal rate of tax of two-thirds of income taxpayers would not exceed 35 per cent is estimated at £38 million in 1986 &mdash; that figure is very important &mdash; and £63.4 million in a full year.  Both of those are gross figures.  The Minister indicated that the net cost in 1986 would be, at very most, £25 million.  It should be remembered that that information was given by way of official reply by the Minister in this House.</P>
    <P>I want now to direct the attention of the House and of the Minister to a totally false statement on the part of his party in relation to what they claimed were the outrageous proposals of Fianna Fáil. Here I am referring to a Fine Gael Information Services document issued on 24 April last.  I presume the Minister has some little association with those who issue these misleading documents, this outrageous propaganda.  I am quoting from the document relating to the Fianna Fáil proposal to restore the income tax position to that obtaining prior to this Government coming into office, when two-thirds of taxpayers were paying at the standard rate.  The document has this to say:</P>
    <P>...But Mr. Haughey has said he will bring two-thirds of taxpayers onto the standard (35 per cent) rate of tax. <Col N="674" /> Assuming that allowances remain the same this would cost £218 million.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will get back to the Fine Gael Press Office and have them publicly repudiate this outragous, false propaganda, that is, as is claimed in that document, increasing the 35 per cent band by about £1,100 to take in an extra 100,000 taxpayers.  The Fine Gael Press Office say that it would cost £218 million whereas the official statement of the Minister for Finance puts that figures at £38 million in 1986.  If we are to have any proper analysis of the political positions of the various parties, I must insist that the Fine Gael Press Office, through the Fine Gael Minister for Finance, immediately and publicly withdraw that totally false, misleading propaganda which multiplies by at least seven the cost, as given directly by the Minister himself, of moving to the position in which we were before this Government set out on this outrageously dangerous and damaging path for our economy.  A net cost this year of approximately £25 million would constitute not only a major boost to our economy but would be a signal that, even at this late stage, the Government are prepared to repent of their ways and lift the burden of this awful tax increase of 40 per cent we have experienced over the last three years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we have covered all of this ground already on Committee Stage.  We spent hours, during which Deputies O'Kennedy, O'Malley and others put forward various proposals to increase the tax bands, personal allowances and so on, all in the full knowledge that there was not any possibility of their being accepted because the Government have set their financial targets for the year in the budget as far as expenditure and revenue are concerned.  In a sense I feel that Deputies opposite have not made the best possible use of their time. While amendments of this kind do afford Deputy O'Kennedy an opportunity of making a political speech&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>They afford the <Col N="675" /> Minister an opportunity of withdrawing this propaganda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in that sense constituting a clothes peg on which he can hang a political speech, although he might have other ideas as to how the parliamentary process might be utilised, in reality that type of contribution does not contribute very much to improving the Finance Bill and essentially is something of a time-wasting exercise.</P>
      <P>To come to the amendment that Deputy O'Kennedy has put forward, its proposals would cost £7.6 million in 1986 and £12.7 million in a full year.  The House might well say that this is a relatively small amount.  That is true, but if one were to tot up the cost of the various amendments put forward, of which this is one only, then the amount would be very considerable indeed.  I do not feel that Deputy O'Kennedy is making very good use of his time.</P>
      <P>I would point out to the House that the reason the income tax burden is so severe in this country is that its revenue has to be used almost exclusively for the service of debt, the payment of interest on foreign and domestic loans.  Practically every other European country is in a position in which a small proportion only of its income tax revenue is used for that purpose, leaving most of its income tax revenue available for normal, day-to-day expenditure.  That is not the case here. Almost our entire income tax revenue is used for that purpose; it is in fact used to support deadweight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Kennedy made the point in the past that, of course, some of that debt was incurred in the course of office of other Governments and some in the course of office of this one.  That is undoubtedly true.  However, the important change that has occurred as far as this is concerned is that in recent years the budget deficit has been significantly less than the cost of debt service.  In other words, if there were no debt service there would be a budget surplus of somewhere around 3 per cent of GNP this year, whereas in the earlier years the budget <Col N="676" /> deficit was considerably greater than the cost of debt service.  To use a commercial analogy, the Government were trading at a loss in those years.  Now we have moved to a position in which, while the legacy of the past means that we have a deficit, on day-to-day expenditure and taxation we have a surplus of income over outgoings.  That is a major change which has occurred during the period of office of the present Government.</P>

    <P>(c)  References in this section to a disposal of shares include references to a disposal of an interest or right in or over the shares and an individual shall be treated for the purposes of this section as disposing of any shares which he is treated by virtue of paragraph 5 of Schedule 2 to the Capital Gains Tax Act, 1975, as exchanging for other shares.</P>
    <P>(d)  Shares in a company shall not be treated for the purposes of this section as being of the same class unless they would be so treated if dealt in on a stock exchange in the State.</P>
    <P>(2)  Subject to the subsequent provisions of this section, where, in the year 1986-87 or any subsequent year of assessment, an eligible employee in relation to a qualifying company subscribes for eligible shares in the qualifying company, he shall be entitled, in estimating the amount of his total income for the year of assessment in which the shares are issued, to have a deduction made of an amount equal to the amount of the subscription:</P>
    <P>Provided that a deduction shall not be given to the extent to which the amount subscribed by an eligible employee for eligible shares issued to him in all years of assessment exceeds £750.</P>
    <P>(3)  Subsection (2) shall not apply as respects any amount subscribed for eligible shares if within the period of five years from the date of their acquisition&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  they are disposed of, or</P>
    <P>(b)  the eligible employee who made the subscription receives in respect of the shares any money or <Col N="679" /> money's worth which does not constitute income in his hands for the purposes of income tax,</P>
    <P>and there shall be made all such assessments, additional assessments or adjustments of assessments as are necessary to withdraw any relief from income tax already given under subsection (2) in respect of the amount subscribed:</P>

    <P>(a)  eligible shares, and</P>
    <P>(b)  shares held by persons who acquired their shares in pursuance of a right conferred on them or an opportunity afforded to them as a director or employee of the qualifying company or any of its 75 per cent. subsidiaries.</P>

    <P>(a)  as to which (if any) such shares issued to an eligible employee at different times a disposal relates, or</P>
    <P>(b)  whether a disposal relates to such shares or to other shares.</P>
    <P>shall for the purposes of this section be determined as for the purposes of section 17 of the Finance Act, 1984.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="680" /> (6)  Where there occurs in relation to any of the eligible shares of an eligible employee (hereinafter referred to as `the original holding') a transaction which results in a new holding, as defined in paragraph 2 (1) (b) of Schedule 2 to the Capital Gains Tax Act, 1975, being equated with the original holding for the purposes of capital gains tax, then for the purposes of subsection (3)&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the new holding shall be treated as shares in respect of which relief under this section has been given,</P>
    <P>(b)  the transaction shall not be treated as involving a disposal of the original holding,</P>
    <P>(c)  the consideration for the disposal of the original holding to the extent that it consists of the new holding shall not be treated as money or money's worth, and</P>
    <P>(d)  a disposal of the whole or a part of the new holding shall be treated as a disposal of the whole or a corresponding part of the shares in respect of which relief has been given under this section.</P>
    <P>(7)  Any amount in respect of which relief is allowed under subsection (2) and not withdrawn shall be treated as a sum which, by reason of paragraph 4 of Schedule 1 to the Capital Gains Tax Act, 1975, is to be excluded from the sums allowable under paragraph 3 of that Schedule.</P>
    <P>(8)  An eligible employee shall not be entitled to relief under subsection (2) in respect of any shares unless the shares are subscribed for and issued for bona fide commercial reasons and not as part of a scheme or arrangement the main purpose or one of the main purposes of which is the avoidance of tax.</P>
    <P>(9)  All such provisions of the Income Tax Acts as apply in relation to the deductions specified in sections <Col N="681" /> 138 to 143 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, shall, with any necessary modifications, apply in relation to relief under this section.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to introduce a new provision in regard to income tax reliefs to promote profit sharing. The position at the moment is that the company can transfer shares to their workers and the workers pay no income tax on the benefit they receive in the form of the ownership being conferred on them of shares.  All they need do, as a result of this Finance Bill, is retain these shares for a minimum of five years in order to qualify for that relief.  This amendment is designed in a totally new and different way to provide an extra incentive to worker shareholding.  In this context, what the company may now do is transfer the money to the workers so that they can use that money to buy shares at a particular time.  By providing for the building up of a fund in the name of individual workers for the purchase of shares, this new scheme is more particularly suited perhaps to situations where it is desired to give shares to workers to whom it might not be suitable to give them all at once, but rather that they should build up a fund in their name to purchase shares.</P>
    <P>This measure represents a radical step in the development of the profit sharing concept here and is intended to complement the two schemes already introduced to promote investment in business ventures which involve a degree of risk &mdash; relief for investment in corporate trades and the new relief for business research and development.  Under this additional measure, employees will be granted a deduction for income tax purposes up to an overall limit of £750 in respect of money paid as a subscription for new ordinary shares issued after 5 April 1986 by the company in which they are employed, or new ordinary shares issued by their holding company where the employer company are a 75 per cent subsidiary of that company.  The company issuing the shares must be one whose business consists wholly or mainly of the carrying on in the State of one <Col N="682" /> or more trades.  However, that company may instead be a holding company for companies carrying on wholly or mainly in the State a trade or trades provided the trading comprises companies which are 75 per cent subsidiaries of the holding company.  A company which is both a holding for such subsidiaries and a trading company will also qualify.</P>
    <P>The relief is confined to full time employees and full time directors of the company or of their subsidiary company. This condition is in line with the interest relief introduced in 1978 for individuals who borrow money to finance the acquisition of shares in an employer company. The decision to confine the relief to employees was not taken lightly.  As the House knows, I am very interested in promoting greater participation by Irish investors generally in business equity and venture capital.  I am satisfied, however, that special extra measures are necessary to encourage share ownership by workers in the firm in which they themselves are employed.  A scheme open to all investors would have been too costly.</P>
    <P>A new section provides for a deduction, in computing income, up to £750 in favour of each employee who subscribes to the eligible shares.  The investment does not have to be made all at once and can be spread over a number of years. To the extent that the individual exceeds, in the aggregate, the maximum of £750 per year, the income tax relief will not be given.  However, the succession of £750 amounts can be put into the fund to be used in a subsequent year to buy shares worth a lot more than £750 at one time.</P>
    <P>It is not possible to forecast the take up of this measure but there are already indications that many thousands of employees will benefit from it.  I have received substantial representations from firms interested in introducing profit sharing for their employees, who felt that the existing scheme which involved the direct transfer of shares was not quite suitable to them and that instead a scheme which allowed them to transfer money which could be used to buy shares would be <Col N="683" /> more suitable for their financial circumstances and the financial circumstances of their employees.</P>
    <P>In order to facilitate every possible opportunity for the extension of worker share ownership in industry, I have introduced this amendment.  As the House will be aware, I gave notice of my intention to introduce an amendment on these lines on Report Stage.  I hope it will receive a welcome in the House.  I know there is an interest on all sides of the House in the promotion of worker share ownership in industry.  I had the honour to introduce the first tax concessions for this purpose in the budget in 1982 and those proposals were carried through into the Finance Act by my successor, Deputy MacSharry. It is very clear that there is support on all sides of the House for the promotion of worker share ownership and I hope this further incentive and further extension of this concept will command support in the House.  I certainly intend to do all I can to promote this concept throughout the country in the coming months and hope I shall have support in so doing from Deputies of all parties.</P>

      <P>The Minister has rightly anticipated the response from this side of the House in relation to this proposal in so far as it is something for which we have been calling for some considerable time.  We are quite happy to give our full support and I make only one comment.  I hope that in its application it will be not circumscribed by any regulations or qualifications which will make it unwieldly and impossible to implement, as were some of the schemes which we have seen introduced in the past few years.  I am glad to give our support for this proposal and the Minister will find that when he brings proposals of this kind before us he will always get a response such as this.</P>

      <P>I should mention that this amendment is one that has not been introduced in other countries.  Some of the incentives we have introduced previously such as tax relief on share <Col N="684" /> transfers to worker shareholders and the business development scheme were incentives which had been introduced in other countries, in particular in Britain, where the legislation was used as a model.  This new concession is, to the best of my knowledge, being pioneered here in Ireland. I hope other countries will look at what we have done and consider that maybe they will imitate us.  It is desirable that we should be giving a lead in this area.  It is fair to say that in Ireland there have been some problems in the past in industrial relations, but the truth of the matter is that in well managed Irish firms industrial relations are better than they are anywhere in Europe.  The fact that under this scheme more and more companies will now be in a position to give shares in their own firms to their workers will mean that we will be able to build further on the success of existing Irish companies in the industrial relations field.  Clearly there would be far less problems in the areas of absenteeism or disruption of work on the part of workers who happen to be also owners of shares in the company in which they work.</P>
      <P>I would further mention that in the case of manufacturing companies there is an added incentive in this Bill for worker shareholding.  Under the provisions of this Bill the effective tax rate on dividends received from manufacturing companies is being reduced from about 58 per cent down to 23 per cent under another section.  This means that workers who receive a substantial part of their income in the form of dividends on shares owned by them in the company will pay on that income a much lower level of tax, around 23 per cent, than they would if they insist on taking their entire income in the form of wages.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 20, between lines 39 and 40, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;14.&mdash;That a marketing or other duly authorised representative who is based abroad of an Irish resident employer shall have his Irish tax payable reduced by reference to the following formula:</P>
      <P>*****formula*****</P>
      <P>where</P>
      <P>T is total Irish liability to tax in respect of the employment</P>
      <P>F is total number of days abroad on employer's business</P>
      <P>A is 365 days.</P>
      <P>Provided:</P>
      <P>(a)  No relief shall be granted unless in excess of 70 days are spent abroad on the instructions of the employer and such days are spent exclusively in the business of marketing the products of the employer, in the income tax year.</P>
      <P>(b)  No relief shall be granted to any person who is a participator, or an associate of a participator, of the employer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="686" /> (c)  No relief shall be granted unless a marketing programme is submitted to and agreed with Córas Tráchtála in advance of the tax year for which relief is claimed.</P>
    <P>(d)  Provided all the foregoing conditions are met, relief shall be given by way of repayment of tax paid on production to the Revenue Commissioners of verification by the employer and employee of days spent abroad in a form prescribed by the Commissioners.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>One of the major priorities for this country is to realise the marketing potential that is of vital importance for our economy. This proposal is an incentive to marketing personnel abroad by way of a limited tax allowance in relation to the amount of time spent abroad which will cost little or nothing, a matter of a few hundred thousand pounds.  I strongly commend this amendment to the House because we depend to a very great extent on export led growth.  We are a very small country and account for 0.5 per cent of total world trade in terms of aggregating both our imports and exports.  We require to win and maintain only a very small proportion of world markets in order to achieve our economic success.  Our attempts to date have been excellent in many spheres, but they still have not been enough to earn for us the jobs and living standards to which we aspire.  For that reason, I suggest we must make a far greater effort to export abroad.  We must do this with thoroughness and determination but, most of all, we must focus on getting export marketing executives into foreign markets.</P>
    <P>In many ways, export marketing is all about shoe leather and aeroplane tickets and about travelling at the weekend rather than spending a working day in travel.  In other words, export marketing is all about export marketing executives not only working hard but also accepting grave personal inconvenience.  Our amendment is geared to acknowledge that.  The extent to which we must encourage people to enter export markets <Col N="687" /> is very obvious if we study the degree to which we have penetrated various markets in 1985.  Irish merchandise exports in 1985 were estimated to have amounted to about £9,744 million.  A breakdown of this will show that the island of Great Britain was our biggest customer with £2,607 million followed by the Federal Republic of Germany with £984 million and the USA with £953 million.</P>
    <P>If we define the penetration of a market by the value of Irish products which we sold to each inhabitant in that market, we get the situation that we sold £47 worth of goods to each person on the island of Great Britain, an identical £47 to each Dutch person, despite the fact that in absolute terms of value of exports the Netherlands only came fifth in our export league table.  The figure for penetration fell to £16 per inhabitant in the Federal Republic of Germany.  It is obvious that we can penetrate the German market to a far greater degree if we encourage export sales executives to work in that market.  Penetration of the German and European markets generally to the same degree as we have already achieved in the Dutch market could add almost £2 billion to our exports each year.  Surely, this is not an unrealistic proposal.</P>
    <P>In a similar fashion, greater focus could be placed on the US market where we sold only £4 per inhabitant in 1985 and on the Japanese market where we sold only £1 per inhabitant in 1985.  Relatively little will happen until we give the individual international marketing executive the incentive to go abroad and work foreign markets.  The most effective incentive can be the reduction of the income tax bill of the international marketing executive <i>pro rata</i>, which is what I am proposing here, to the time which the executive spends undertaking export marketing activities outside of Ireland in any one tax year.  The return to the Exchequer and to the whole economy would be well justified and would be very considerable.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="688" /> It has been estimated by the Confederation of Irish Industry that each additional wholetime export marketing executive would generate enough sales to sustain at least seven jobs at home.  It would be well to remind ourselves of the proposals we have made.  I regret the fact that I have had to move such an important amendment at such speed.  The message nonetheless is there and one I feel the Minister is in agreement with.  For the small amount involved I ask the Minister to accept this amendment.</P>
    <P>Amendment put and declared lost.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">

      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 29, line 44, to delete &ldquo;20 per cent&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;49 per cent.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment proposes to amend section 20 of the Bill which defines a qualifying research and development company for the purposes of new relief in respect of investment in research and development.  Under the existing provisions of the Bill, a company could set up a research and development company which would qualify for this tax relief on money coming in to it but the company setting it up was not allowed to own more than 20 per cent of the shares in the R and D company.  It was represented to me that this was too restrictive a provision and that many companies who would be setting up research and development companies to develop products which they themselves would be selling would want to have more of a share in the action of the research and development company.  It was represented to me that the 20 per cent limit was too small.  To restrict them to 20 per cent would not encourage them to set up these research and development companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been concerned to try to make this scheme as attractive as possible.  We are proposing in this amendment to increase the minimum shareholding of the sponsoring company from 20 per cent to 49 per cent.  Deputy O'Kennedy and <Col N="689" /> Deputy Wyse might ask: why 49 per cent? Why not 100 per cent?  The whole purpose of this R and D scheme is to bring in outside money and, if you enabled people to get tax relief simply by putting their own money in, you would not be bringing in any extra money into the research and development activity of the manufacturing company.  Therefore, there has to be a majority of the money coming from outside if you are to have the incentive effect for additional new resources coming into manufacturing. On reflection, I felt that requiring 80 per cent of the money from the outside and only 20 per cent from the existing company was probably setting the target too high and that it would be more realistic, certainly initially, to allow the relief where up to 49 per cent of the money was coming from the company itself.</P>
    <P>The overall purpose of the scheme is to give specific tax incentives to research and development in Ireland.  To my knowledge there is no other European country with a tax incentive of this kind. There is such an incentive in the US tax code but not in Europe.  As a country which has been spending far too little on research and development as a percentage of our GNP we have a lot of catching up to do.  Furthermore, I would stress that this incentive would help Irish companies to develop Irish products.  To too great an extent high tech industries in Ireland have been dominated by foreign-owned companies.  These companies have undertaken very little research and development in Ireland.  The production is carried out in Ireland on the basis of research and development which is done elsewhere.  This makes the Irish plant rather vulnerable to changes at corporate headquarters or in the marketplace.  On the other hand, if research and development is being done in Ireland, preferably by Irish-owned companies, and if that is the main source of innovation in the Irish economy, the jobs created thereby are much more secure because they are Irish originating in every sense, right back to the seed from which they grew, which is research and development.  I hope that I <Col N="690" /> will have the support of the other two parties represented in the House at the moment for this amendment, which is a pioneering one and one which meets a long-felt need.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">

      <P>We accept and support this amendment because we have been calling for developments of this kind for the last few years.  Just as we believe that marketing is essential we also believe that the added value through knowledge-based activities in industry such as research and development is essential.  For that reason we are glad that the Minister has responded to cases which we have made by way of amendment in each of the last number of years for a scheme such as this.  The Minister will understand if I make some general comments on the scheme.  I agree with the amendment introduced today which relaxes some of the regulations and limitations on the scheme, which I think is worthwhile.  There is the risk that this scheme will also suffer from the constraints which have been placed on it by the Minister.</P>
      <P>The scheme is not available to a research and development company. There has to be a sponsoring company. We proposed on Committee Stage, which unfortunately we did not have a chance of debating, that the requirement in this section which is limited to a sponsoring company, was unreal and inappropriate. Where a pure research and development company was formed for that reason and that reason alone the tax incentives that are being made available here should also apply to such a company.  We are trying to promote pure research and development and the Minister has our support in this. The incentives which are being introduced here should not have been restricted in the way they were.  We are, as the Minister has pointed out, light years behind in this area.  To that extent we should be encouraging and not discouraging the development of research and development corporations in their own right.</P>

Allowing that he has increased the share participation to 49 per cent, there is nothing here that makes it clear that there is no limit on what a company can do in terms of figures.

      <P>Tá, with reservations. I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>In page 46, between lines 6 and 7, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;38.  &mdash;(1)  Notwithstanding anything contained in this Chapter, appropriate tax shall not be deducted from any relevant interest paid to any of the following&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  persons, other than companies, who establish to the satisfaction of the Revenue Commissioners that no liability to taxation exists under the Tax Acts;</P>
      <P>(b)  an individual, or his spouse, who</P>
      <P>(i)  at some time during the relevant year proves to the satisfaction of the Revenue Commissioners that he or his spouse was sixty-five years of age or upwards, or</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(ii)  throughout the relevant year he or his spouse was, or as on and from some time during the relevant year he or his spouse became, permanently incapacitated by reason of mental or physical infirmity from maintaining <Col N="694" /> himself or herself.</P>
    <P>(c)  organisations or bodies of persons who satisfy the Revenue Commissioners that they are in nature voluntary and exist solely as non-profit making bodies established in the public interest for charitable, philanthropic or humanitarian reasons.</P>
    <P>(2)  The Revenue Commissioners, where satisfied under subsection (1) of this section, shall issue an appropriate exemption certificate as provided for in section 34 and subject to the conditions of that section to deposit takers identified for the purposes of this section.</P>
    <P>(3)  Any person to whom this section applies who is aggrieved by the Revenue Commissioners' decision shall have recourse to the Appeal Commissioners as if the non-issue of an exemption certificate was an appeal against an assessment for the purposes of the Tax Acts.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment relates to the DIRT. We have approximately half an hour, but at least it gives me an opportunity to move the amendment, which I did not have on Committee.  My first point is that this tax has been introduced without any knowledge of how much it will bring in and without any regard to the principle of applying income tax to those who do not have taxable incomes.  The Minister gave me three or four different figures in regard to the cost of exempting people not already liable to income tax.  In the course of his statement announcing the DIRT the Minister said it would cost £60 million to exempt those not liable to tax, but in reply to a question two weeks later he gave a figure of £25 million.  If the Minister is not aware of the cost of exempting non-liable persons from this tax he should not have introduced it in the form in which it is before us.</P>
    <P>The Minister has given one figure twice the size of the other in the space of two weeks and it is clear, therefore, that this <Col N="695" /> tax has not been properly conceived.  The Minister should not have introduced it without at least being aware of the amount it would yield and the impact it would have on those affected.  The reason for its introduction, according to the Minister, is that it would reduce the tax burden on others who are liable to tax.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances it is vital that we should know at least how much it would cost to exempt people below income tax liability level.  It is totally unacceptable to us, and I believe to the population at large, that a tax would be imposed on people who have not got taxable incomes, simply because it would cost too much not to do so.  That is an outrageous principle.  For the first time we will be applying a tax to people whose incomes are below the limit, and to add insult to injury, the Minister said this is necessary if he is to reduce the burden of income tax on those already paying.  That introduces another outrageous principle.</P>
    <P>We all know that the burden of income tax on those liable to it has been increased by 40 per cent since this Government took office, an intolerably high rate of tax, but is the Minister sincerely suggesting that the way to reduce the burden on those already paying too much is to impose a tax on people who have no liability to it?  That, in effect, is what the Minister has said.</P>
    <P>Logically, because the Minister does not have an idea of how much it would cost to exempt those people, he cannot know how much he will get from this tax. I have said that it is wrong to impose a tax on people who are not liable to income tax, and the Minister's argument is that it would cost too much not to do it.  For those reasons we propose to exempt from this tax at 35 per cent all people whose incomes are below taxable levels.  This proposal by the Minister is unprecedented in any Parliament, this taxing of people who are below taxable levels.  It is unacceptable by any standard to tax widows entirely dependent on their deposit interest, to tax children and other categories below taxable income levels.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="696" /> I have not heard the Minister seriously trying to justify this.  Those people will be put through the nonsense of having the tax deducted at the beginning of the year and then having to apply to the Revenue Commissioners for refunds, putting them through periods of worry and anxiety.</P>
    <P>The obligation to prove that such people should be in the exempted class should rest on the Revenue Commissioners. There is no reason citizens should have the burden of proving that they have only such a level of income. Apparently we are not just to have a police State but a police revenue State, because people will have to prove that their incomes are already so miserably low that they should not have to pay tax.</P>
    <P>Our argument is that this awful, outrageous tax should not apply to anyone older than 65 years no matter what their incomes.  When people reach that age and have money on deposit it is so that they will feel secure in their own homes, so that they will not be a burden on their children or grandchildren.  If they were prudent enough to invest money to provide small incomes for themselves, my God it is a terrible reflection on us if we impose a tax on them.  Throughout their lives those people have paid taxes and their small investments have been made in order to relieve their families and relations of the burden of providing for them.</P>
    <P>Any principle of social justice would insist that old people should be exempt from the tax.  During the past weekend four old people came to my clinic to speak to me about this matter.  One of them might have been marginally at the taxable income level but none of the others was in that category.  The Minister should be aware of the apprehension, anxiety and needless worry he is causing these old people.  We should have respect for them at this stage of their lives.  It is ridiculous to impose such a nonsensical tax.  It appears the Minister is not even able to let us know the cost of excluding these people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has used the same terminology, that of non-liable persons.  The terminology was the same but the figures were different.  I am not now talking about non-liable persons because some of these old people could just come into the tax bracket.  I am talking about excluding people over the age of 65 years.  The amount of money involved would be buttons.  Many of these people have been prudent enough during their working lives to provide for their old age and for their funerals.  They wish to have the self-respect of being able to provide presents for their children and grandchildren. If we are to penalise them for being prudent, we are not fit to have the name of parliamentarians.  I do not know where all this nonsense came from or who dreamed it up in the first instance.  Whoever was responsible for this tax had no awareness of what it is like for old people.  That is the only exception I am making in respect of persons who would be liable. Those who are non-liable should not be made liable now to this tax.</P>
      <P>The voluntary organisations mentioned in my amendment are doing magnificent work.  I do not know how we can adequately express our appreciation of the positive impact of their work on society.  They may be quasi-charitable organisations who will not get the exemption granted to charities because they are not exclusively legal charities or they may be community and sporting organisations who do so much to enhance community life.  For the life of me I cannot see why the Minister should have imposed this tax on them.  The money such organisations put on deposit when they come into funds, either because of special collections or receipts at major sporting events, should not be liable to a 35 per cent rake off by the Government.  What the Minister is proposing is outrageous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="698" /> I will give the case to illustrate my point and it has to be Cumman Luthchleas Gael.  Since I spoke to the Minister about this matter, I have got some other figures. While I am using this example to illustrate the point, I wish to point out that it applies to other organisations also.  The GAA have a special place in our community and the Minister would do well to consider the impact of this outrageous proposal on them.</P>
    <P>I do not know if he is aware that they are at present promoting a new self-financing insurance scheme for their players. This is very important because they are amateur players, having all the qualities that follow the pursuit of amateur sport.  These amateur players in vigorous, manly games such as hurling and gaelic football, are liable to injury.  One of the most important developments in the GAA recently was the introduction of an insurance scheme they are funding themselves to cover accidental injury to their players during the games.  They estimate that the cost to them of this tax will be not less than £300,000 and they also know it will cost them at least £400,000 to fund the new insurance scheme for their players.  I am sure this matter must have been mentioned to the Minister already because I am not the only person privy to this kind of information.  Now, instead of being able to fund this scheme, they will have to pay at least £300,000 to the Government and there is a danger that this essential scheme will be aborted.  In case the Minister tells me he does not accept my figures, I wish to point out that they are figures the GAA can make avaiable to the Minister.  They know how much they have on deposit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Now is the time to change it.  It is not good enough first to talk to them.  We want to see this tax gone so far as GAA and other organisations are concerned.  On this side of the House we are totally committed to repealing this awful section.  The contribution of the GAA to our society must be <Col N="699" /> respected, not penalised.  I cannot understand how any Government with any sense of awareness of that contribution could presume to impose a burden of £300,000 on them and that is only at headquarters level.  It is appalling to think it will apply to every club throughout the country.  They raise funds to buy hurleys, build halls and they provide training facilities for their teams but instead of saying &ldquo;well done&rdquo; to them for all their work and the enjoyment they give to many thousands of people, the Government are demanding this penal tax from them.</P>
      <P>Has the Minister any idea of the revenue the State gets from the replaying of a major match?  Last year we had some marvellous games in gaelic football.  Let us consider the replay between Mayo and Dublin.  Will the Minister consider for a minute how much the Government got because of that replay?  If up to 70,000 people travelled to Dublin, and with petrol charges ensuring that the Government get 67p in every pound &mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the time for the Minister to make an exemption for the GAA, although I would suggest other sporting organisations as well.  I do not mind making an exception of the GAA because they are entitled to it.  The Minister's predecessor, Earnán de Blagdh, is remembered for his action in relation to old age pensioners.  But he recognised the special place of the GAA in our culture, recreational activity and history by exempting them from income tax and the <Col N="700" /> application of other taxes.  Unless the Minister exempts them from this provision he will have the very doubtful distinction of imposing a penal burden of taxation on an organisation which has deserved much better.  I plead with him to write in an exclusion for the GAA. The Minister would be the one to benefit. While doing that he should also drop VAT from hurleys.  The Minister must recognise that if someone is doing something worthwhile some time the Government must commend him rather than penalise him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to support Deputy O'Kennedy's amendment.  The Minister made the point during an earlier stage of the debate that it is important to have a simple tax where deductions are made from everybody.  It is a good argument because it is important to have simplicity in taxation.  If that is so, it should apply in all cases and there should be no exemptions.  If it is deducted from old age pensioners and those who are incapacitated because they have no exemption, then it should be deducted from everybody and these people should be able to claim the money back in the same way as the others.  That is not the case.  There are exemptions in the case of companies and beneficiaries of interest who are nonresident have an exemption.  There is a lack of consistency and an anomaly in the Bill if the same procedure is not adopted for everybody.  Those who are not liable to tax because they are on very low incomes should be exempted, because even their income from a small redundancy sum would not bring them into the tax bracket.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ken O'Brien, an economist in <i>The Irish Times</i>, said when the budget was introduced on 1 February 1986 that this was a non-PAYE/income tax.  He gave it considerable praise because it extended the bracket from the PAYE to the non-PAYE income sector.  He made the point that the tax net was being widened in such a way that a significant proportion of our large black economy would be brought into the tax net for the first time. Unfortunately the Bill does not achieve <Col N="701" /> that, because of the exemption system. If we had a system where tax was deducted in all cases and then those who had a claim could put it forward &mdash; for example, non-residents &mdash; then there would be no escape holes for those with hot money in collusion with the banks.  A system whereby they would have to prove a claim to the Revenue Commissioners at the end of the year would be a major improvement.  Deputy O'Kennedy's amendment is designed to claim exemptions for individuals.  The Minister's original argument of simplicity does not stand up in this case.  If it can be done in one case it can de done in others.  I cannot see how the Minister can argue for making old age pensioners reclaim while allowing exemptions for businesses who have the services of accountants.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The declarations of non-residency will be available to the Revenue Commissioners who will be able to check out suspicions about any of the claims not being genuine.  Deputy Mac Giolla is wrong in saying that this provision does not enable us to make a major assault on the black economy.  It will constitute a major assault on the black economy. Deputy O'Kennedy made some points about the estimates of the reduction from the yield of the tax in 1987 if all non-liable persons were to be exempted.  I should explain that in the press release on the Finance Bill I used the example of non-liable persons, indicating a loss in yield of £60 million.  If you include persons and bodies &mdash; associations of persons &mdash; the loss would be around £60 million.  In reply to a parlimentary question from Deputy O'Kennedy on 30 April I was using the word &ldquo;persons&rdquo; in the narrower sense as being solely human persons.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The term &ldquo;person&rdquo; was used in a different sense in the two statements. I regret that was done but I have explained it fully.  I would point out in regard to the GAA and other associations to which the Deputy referred that there are other places where they can put their money.  In the case of small sums of money there are various Post Office instruments, saving certificates, savings bonds and the instalment savings schemes are available, as are credit unions.  In the case of large sums of money, Government gilts are available.  Deputy O'Kennedy referred to an insurance scheme where payments would be made on a regular basis over a long period.  Even if there were no deposit interest retention tax, it is not necessarily the best thing to have all the money on deposit in the bank.  It makes much sense in the case of long term investments of that kind to have a substantial part in other financial instruments.  The GAA and other associations should look at the instruments which are available, particular Government gilts.</P>
      <P>I do not know where Deputy O'Kennedy got his figure of a loss to the GAA of £350,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is the case then the GAA must have £10 million invested in the banks since it would require a sum of that magnitude for a loss of that type to occur.  Perhaps they have £10 million invested in this scheme &mdash; I do not know. My information is that they would need to have £10 million to achieve the figures quoted by Deputy O'Kennedy.  I would have to question whether that is the case but even if they have £10 million it is open to them to consider other ways of investing.  Even if they have £10 million I am sure it is open to them to invest at <Col N="703" /> least a large part of that £10 million so as not to have to pay the tax.</P>

    <P>This is an amendment to section 40 of the Finance Act, 1984 and it relates to capital allowances for certain leased assets.  The new section 52 which is now to be inserted in this Bill proposes to amend that section of the 1984 Act in respect of the range of leased machinery and plant which is to be free of certain restrictions imposed by section 40 on the offset of capital allowances by lessors.  Unrestricted relief will continue to apply in respect of capital allowances on the following two categories; first, there will be unrestricted relief on capital allowances on machinery and plant leased for use by the lessee for the purpose of manufacturing activities carried on by him or trading activities which, though not manufacturing, are exempted trading activities carried on at Shannon Airport and, second, unrestricted relief will continue to apply in respect of capital allowances on a leased film, the making of which was assisted by the Irish Film Board.  The master negative of a film can be treated as machinery or plant for tax purposes, that is, prints can be produced from the master negative and it is treated as machinery in that sense.</P>
    <P>To explain the amendment to section 40 of the Finance Act, 1984 it is necessary to go back and say what section 40 of the Finance Act, 1984 provided.  It imposed certain restrictions on the extent to which capital allowances arising from leased machinery or plant could be set off against profits other than profits arising from the leasing itself &mdash; this was in the context of the taxation of banks.  The restrictions in the 1984 Act were directed primarily at financial institutions which until then could set capital allowances on leased machinery or plant against any of their profits for tax purposes.  It <Col N="710" /> was decided, however, in 1984 to preserve the full benefit of tax based leasing for the following two categories: machinery and plant grant aided by the IDA or SFADCo or Údarás na Gaeltachta or film assisted by the film board.  Those categories could continue to set off such allowances against any source of profits where the lease applied to those two categories. However, the European Commission &mdash; and this is the nub of the problem that they are addressing here &mdash; has informed us that these exceptions to the restrictions offend against the Community's rules of permissible economic aids.  The Commission has therefore requested the Government to amend the exceptions.  It is of course entitled to make such a request under Article 93 of the Treaty of Rome and so, under Article 92, we have negotiated with the Commission on the matter and it has been agreed with it that if the exception referred to broad sectors of activity rather than specific categories, as was the case in the original of section 40, it will not raise any more objections to it and will consider that it is in compliance with the provisions of the Treaty of Rome.  It is proposed therefore by the amendment contained in the new section 52, which this amendment will insert, to amend section 40 in the way I have described earlier.  The specific reference to the film board in the amendment is being retained because the aid provided is not simply an economic aid but is also cultural in nature and the film board will, presumably, be exercising cultural as well as economic judgment.  There is a lot more detailed information that I could give but I think that explains the origin of this relatively complicated amendment in the most simple terms.  We have had to redefine slightly the terms of a previous exemption in order to comply with an EC decision.

      <P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P>In page 61, between lines 9 and 10, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>52.&mdash;Section 84A (inserted by the Finance Act, 1984) of the Corporation Tax Act, 1976, is hereby amended by the insertion after subsection (9) of the following subsection:</P>
      <P>(10)  (a)  This subsection applies to any interest or other distribution which, apart from this subsection, would be a distribution for the purposes of this Act, other than any interest or other distribution which is paid by the borrower under an obligation entered into&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  before the 13th day of May, 1986, or</P>
      <P>(ii)  before the 1st day of September, 1986, pursuant to negotiations which were in progress between the borrower and a lender before the 13th day of May, 1986.</P>
      <P>(b)  Subsection (2) shall have effect as respects any interest or other distribution to which this subsection applies as if paragraph (c) of subsection (3) were omitted.</P>
      <P>(c)  For the purposes of paragraph (a)&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  an obligation shall be treated as having been entered into before a particular date if, but only if, before that date there was in existence a binding contract in writing under which that obligation arose, and</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(ii)  negotiations pursuant to which an obligation was entered into shall not be regarded as having been in progress before the 13th day of May, 1986, unless, on or before that date, preliminary commitments or agreements in relation to that obligation <Col N="712" /> had been entered into between the lender referred to in that paragraph and the borrower.</P>
    <P>I announced on Committee Stage that I would introduce Report Stage amendments to sections 40 and 41 of the Finance Act in order to respond to certain EC objections.  The Commission also had an objection to section 41 of the same Act to which I have just been referring to the effect that certain provisions of it constituted a State aid which is in contravention of Article 92 of the EC Treaty. The amendment now proposed here provides for the insertion of a new section which is to be section 53 of this Act and which will contain an amendment of the Corporation Tax Act, 1976.  There will be a new section 84A as a result of the Corporation Tax Act and this imposes certain restrictions on access by companies to what have become known as section 84 loans.  Many people will be familiar with this form of tax base financing for industry.  In effect, the result of this amendment means that interest paid on section 84 loans was to lose its character as a tax free distribution in the hands of the lender.  However, this was not to apply to loans made to companies carrying on certain specified trades as defined in section 84A, (3) and (4).  When we were closing the loophole in 1984 we decided to exempt certain trades from these restrictions as we were anxious to continue to encourage manufacturing. The European Commission has objected to the inclusion of service undertakings in the category of specified trades as defined in the original section.  The grounds for the objection are that subsidies which would be what section 84 loans could confer are to particular limited categories of economic activity or contrary to article 92 of the Treaty of Rome.</P>
    <P>The Government, in response to this objection, have agreed to take this into account and, accordingly, to amend this section to exclude such service activities from the specified trades defined in subsection (3)(c).  The benefit of section 84 lending, however, will be preserved for other categories, apart from the services <Col N="713" /> in question, such as manufacturing exempted corporations at Shannon Airport and for the subsidiaries of agricultural and other co-operatives.  This is necessary in order to allow us to continue with section 84 lending in a fashion which is compatible with EC rules.  We are doing only that which is necessary.</P>

      <P>As a result of the 1984 Act services in general were excluded with a certain exception.  The exception was in respect of four categories of specified trades.  One of those was the rendering of services in the course of the service undertaking in respect of which an employment grant was made by the Industrial Development Authority under section 2 of the Industrial Development Authority (No.2) Act, 1981.  In other words, once the IDA gave a grant, that grant extended an exemption from the provisions of the restriction in respect of section 84 lending which would otherwise have applied to it as a service.  The use of an administrative mechanism, which is a decision of the IDA to confer tax relief in a very selective way, which would lead to tax being administered in the form of administrative decisions rather than on the basis of abstract rules, was considered to be contrary to the EC Treaty and we had to remove it.</P>

      <P>This amendment is fairly drastic in the sense that it removes all the export type services which were contemplated by the 1981 Act and which one thought would continue to be placed in the same position as manufacturing generally.  That was certainly the intention in the 1981 Act.</P>

      <P>The non-capital form of assistance is removed as a result of this.  This puts us back in the position that, if they are to get any State assistance, for <Col N="714" /> the most part it will be capital grants or training grants.  From the State's point of view and from the point of view of public expenditure, these are the most expensive ways of assisting them.  Allowing them to help themselves under section 84 was, from the State's point of view, one of the more painless ways of doing so.  I regret the movement away from that type of encouragement and assistance and towards more capital expenditure by the State in one form or another.  Some proportion of it is increasingly coming to be seen as a waste of money.  The section 84 facilities which were available in this country up to recently were very attractive and useful.  I do not believe they cost a great deal although I have no doubt, according to the Revenue Commissioners' way of thinking, they probably did.  In my experience they were one of the most attractive forms of incentive.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>It was one of the happier errors the Department of Finance made because it turned out to be one of the most useful and least expensive incentives in terms of industrial development in the late seventies and early eighties when industrial development was at its height.  Even though it was not intended as that, some Governments are entitled to credit for not having repealed it when its effect became clear.  I hoped that would continue to be the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were many cases where it was a more attractive incentive for many types of companies than large capital or training grants or other things which use a lot of scarce resources.  It was one of the most saleable products the IDA had in the good old days.  Now the IDA are up against far greater difficulties than they were in the past and I regret that some of the more useful weapons they had in their struggles with competition are being removed.  What is left is simply higher capital grants which will have to be paid to compensate for these losses and withdrawals.  I think this is the <Col N="715" /> wrong approach and I am sorry it is happening.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Malley has made an interesting intervention to which I should like to reply.  First, I want to tell him the categories of activity that will lose section 84 lending as a result of this EC decision.  It is not a matter the Government are introducing with any willingness but, having adhered to membership of the EC in 1972 by consent of the people and by international treaty, we have to abide by the rules laid down by the Community.  They found the provisions of the 1984 Act to be contrary to the Treaty to which we had freely agreed. That is why we introduced this amendment.</P>
      <P>There are two categories which might be described as services which will not lose section 84 status because they can be interpreted to be manufacturing &mdash; data processing services and software development services.  They will continue to have access to section 84 lending.  The following services will lose as a result of this EC prompted change: technical and consultant services, commercial laboratory services, headquarters services, research and development services, media recording services, training services, publishing services, international and financial services and health care services. I greatly regret that these categories are losing the benefit of section 84 lending which was never intended as a tax incentive for business because it was introduced as an anti-tax avoidance measure, but in practice ended up as an incentive.</P>
      <P>We must take action in order to stay within the rules of the Community of which we are a freely participating member.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I make one qualifying point to the enthusiasm Deputy O'Malley expressed for section 84.  The effect of section 84 has been to make it artificially attractive for companies to borrow money rather than to look for equity by essentially allowing the taxpayer to subsidise the interest they were paying on <Col N="716" /> borrowed funds while the taxpayer did not provide any equivalent subsidy or encouragement to the same company to get the same money by means of equity. From the point of view of the taxpayer it has been an expensive concession.  There is approximately £1,100 million worth of loans to industry at the moment under section 84 type agreements and the tax loss to the Exchequer is about £80 million per year.  However, perhaps if they had to find alternative means of finance there would be other costs the Government would have to meet in another way. Therefore, that £80 million is a gross figure and presumably if it were not there&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>They could set out their gross borrowings against it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;we would not save the full amount of £80 million by any means.  It indicates that for those sectors that continue to benefit from these allowances, such as the entire manufacturing sector, data processing, the activities of co-operatives, software development and so forth, this is a very generous, important and valuable concession. It is extremely important that we try to develop Ireland substantially as a centre for some of the activities that have no longer the benefit of section 84 lending, such as international financial services, technical and consultancy services and training services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have an unrivalled capacity in terms of availability of trained manpower to provide services of this kind and we should develop a sympathetic regulatory and taxation environment to encourage internationally traded services of this kind.  Since taking office as Minister for Finance I have initiated a study on how we can encourage this type of internationally traded service in Ireland.  I stress that this amendment is in no sense being introduced because we lack an appreciation of the importance of these services. We have a very high level of appreciation of the importance of these services and are anxious to do everything possible to develop them.  Rather we have to make <Col N="717" /> this change in the light of an EC decision.</P>
    <P>However, I assure the House that, over the next number of months in consultation with my colleagues, I will be working to ensure that our tax and fiscal environment generally is as attractive as possible to the development of internationally traded services in this country.  These services will benefit in other ways from measures initiated in this Bill which will compensate substantially for some of the loss that may have to occur now as a result of this change.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;how it was possible to distinguish in the list of services between software and data processing on the one hand and still retain the advantages of section 84 and various other things including technical and consultancy services. If I design a software programme, am I doing anything essentially different from my designing a building, or some technical system, or whatever, and putting it on paper?  If the EC were agreeable to some of these matters being retained, how is it that things which are essentially much the same are not retained?  Does it not seem arbitrary?  The list the Minister read out of what is now excluded is very extensive.  It is a little frightening.  The possibilities of our developing international financial services are greatly weakened by what is happening now.</P>

      <P>To the greatest extent that reasons could be elicited they were <Col N="718" /> given, but in matters of this kind I suppose we are always talking about shades of meaning and degree.  The EC had to draw a line somewhere and this is where it drew it.  I would not attempt to provide a metaphysical justification of this because that would be foolhardy.  From recollection, an important factor is whether there is transformation of material involved or, in some of the cases, whether the service is a pure service and in others whether it is a service applied to certain material which is transformed by the service.  That is not being given with any authority, as an interpretation of the Treaty of Rome, but that is probably the dividing line that would have been used by the EC.  I do not know if that is any help to the Deputy.</P>

That is a decision taken freely by the Irish people, if I do not mistake, at the recommendation of Deputy O'Malley and others who were in Government at the time, and, let me say, supported enthusiastically by me.  I think the gains we have had from EC membership outweigh by far the disadvantages, some of which can be seen in the fact that we have to amend our law to take account of Treaty obligations of this kind. Of course membership of the EC involves some reduction in our sovereignty.  Why else did we have to change our Constitution in order to join the EC?

      <P>I move amendment No. 8a:</P>
      <P>In page 68, to delete lines 3 to 17 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>58.&mdash;(1)  In this section&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;qualifying period&rdquo; means the period of three years commencing on the 4th day of April, 1986;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;qualifying shares&rdquo; means&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  in subsection (2), shares of a kind which are dealt in on the Smaller Companies Market of the Irish Stock Exchange (hereafter in this section referred to as &ldquo;the relevant market&rdquo;) and which are not dealt in otherwise on the Irish Stock Exchange or on any other stock exchange, and</P>
      <P>(b)  in subsection (3), shares forming part of the ordinary share capital of a public company within the meaning of section 2 (1) of the Companies (Amendment) Act, 1983, which has issued shares in respect of which relief has been given under&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  Chapter III of Part I of the Finance Act, 1984, or</P>
      <P>(ii)  Chapter III of this Part,</P>
      <P>and which are not dealt in on a recognised stock exchange.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  Notwithstanding section 3(3) of <Col N="720" /> the Capital Gains Tax Act, 1975, the rate of capital gains tax in respect of chargeable gains accruing to a person on the disposal on the relevant market in the qualifying period of shares which, at the time of the disposal, are qualifying shares shall be 30 per cent.</P>
    <P>(3)  Notwithstanding section 3(3) of the Capital Gains Tax Act, 1975, the rate of capital gains tax in respect of chargeable gains accruing to a person on the disposal in the qualifying period of shares which, at the time of disposal, are qualifying shares shall be 30 per cent.</P>
    <P>(4)  In subsections (2) and (3) &ldquo;disposal&rdquo; does not include a relevant disposal within the meaning of section 36 (1) of the Finance Act, 1982.</P>
    <P>This section does two things.  If gives effect to the Government's decision that chargeable gains made on the disposal of shares in the newly established smaller companies market in the Irish Stock Exchange shall be taxable at the rate of 30 per cent.  This rate will apply only to disposals made within three years of the date of publication of the Finance Bill, 4 April 1986.  It also gives effect to a further Government decision to extend the same treatment to shares in respect of which tax relief has been given under the business expansion scheme introduced in 1984 and the research and development investment scheme introduced in this Bill.  Without this section, gains on such disposals could be taxable at rates ranging from 35 per cent to 60 per cent of capital gains tax.</P>
    <P>This measure is designed to foster the rapid development of the new smaller companies market and is consistent with the general desire of small investors in business and industry.  The measures, as extended by this amendment, ensures that investors under the two schemes mentioned will not receive less favourable treatment.</P>
    <P>One of the criticisms made of the operation of the business expansion scheme was that, while it is very attractive from the point of view of people putting money in, there are not sufficient exit <Col N="721" /> mechanisms, that people who buy shares under the business development scheme should have a readily available means of selling their shares.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>We said that all along and the Minister would not listen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The only opportunity available in the past was that the company would become a publicly quoted company whereby the shares could be sold on the open market or that the shares would be disposed of privately on the basis of an agreement between the parties concerned but, in either case, the rate of capital gains tax would be relatively high.</P>
      <P>We are trying to achieve two things in this amendment, first to give concrete encouragement to the Stock Exchange to develop the smaller companies market. The smaller companies market is necessary because the compliance and legal costs of getting a quotation on the full market are extremely high and smaller companies do not go for public quotations. The result is that at present a relatively small number of blue chip companies and oil exploration companies are on the Stock Exchange but small manufacturing companies in the productive sector of our economy have not tended to use the Stock Exchange.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to remedy this and as a result of a suggestion I made last year, the Stock Exchange have launched the smaller companies market.  To get people to use it, the Finance Bill is giving a capital gains tax concession, reducing the rate of capital gains tax on short term gains and shares bought and then sold on the smaller companies market from what would have been 60 per cent if sold within one year down to 30 per cent and from 40 per cent to 30 per cent if the disposal was after one year.  It is an important amendment because the smaller companies market not only provides an opportunity for smaller companies to get funds but is suitable to companies which are developed initially under the business development scheme, getting in amounts of £25,000 tax free from individual investors. <Col N="722" /> If they want to expand still further but cannot go the whole way in getting a full quote on the Stock Exchange, the smaller companies market provides a means whereby they can either raise additional funds or &mdash; to come back to the point I was making earlier &mdash; where existing shareholders in the business development scheme company can dispose of their shares on an open market where they are likely to get full value for them rather than having to sell them privately where they would not get full value for them.</P>
    <P>The smaller companies market is being developed in a fashion, at my suggestion, which provides an exit mechanism for shareholders who acquired shares under the business development scheme.  It will, therefore, provide a great increase in the attractiveness of the business development scheme and a big increase in the flow of funds into industry in the form of equity rather than in the form of loans to which I referred earlier.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, we have extended the provision of the original section 54 to extend the capital gains tax reduction to the business expansion scheme and research and development companies.  Where a disposal of shares takes place, we are reducing capital gains tax on such companies to 30 per cent as well as giving the same concession to disposals in the smaller companies market.  The reason for this further concession, apart from providing an exit mechanism, is that representations were made to me to the effect that, if the concession was a 30 per cent capital gains tax and was confined solely to disposals on the smaller companies market of the Stock Exchange, it would give an artificial competitive advantage to the Stock Exchange smaller companies market as against other methods that might be set up, such as those operated by different people to provide a disposal or exchange mechanism for shares, a second form of Stock Exchange, so to speak.</P>
    <P>While, obviously, any alternative methods of disposal of shares would have to be regulated in some way to ensure investor protection, it is not desirable <Col N="723" /> that the law <i>ab initio</i> should provide preference for one method over another which might be established in the future. The second leg of this amendment which provides an extension of the reduced capital gains tax rate to business expansion scheme companies is designed to provide an alternative source of companies which might be used by an alternative method of exchange to the smaller companies market of the Stock Exchange, thereby avoiding any suggestion that exclusively was being given <i>ab initio</i> to one private organisation in regard to access to this tax concession.</P>
    <P>These provisions are quite important because it is very desirable that more of our money is in investment and productive assets as too much of our money is tied up in relatively unproductive, static uses&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;where it is not contributing directly to increased production in the community.  I am concerned to channel funds through the tax code into productive activity in the economy.  I know some will say the introduction of tax concessions for activity of this kind complicates the tax system and that is an argument which has considerable appeal to those who fully accepted the recommendations of the Commission on Income Taxation.  In my opinion in a small open economy such as in Ireland, which is not a fully developed economy, we need to tailor our tax system specifically to achieve certain development objectives.  While fiscal neutrality is an ideal much to be sought after, it is probably more appropriate to a country that is already developed than it is to a country like Ireland which is in the process of development.  The use of tax mechanisms, such as the business development scheme, the research and development scheme and so on, to achieve a bias in favour of development orientated activity is appropriate, notwithstanding the fact that it complicates the tax system somewhat, in a country at Ireland's stage <Col N="724" /> of development.  It is justified and I strongly recommend the amendment to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to strongly commend the Minister for his initiative in amendment No.8(a).  The British experience when they tried to deal with the exit problem relating to capital gains and to develop an equity mechanism for small businesses found it was not singularly successful if left to the Stock Exchange.  I am glad the Minister has given an opportunity for securities markets and others to get into the area of trying to get money into the equity needs of small businesses. That is wholly desirable.  If the section was left as it was there would be the difficulty that low risk or speculative types of business such as property, oil exploration and so on which are quoted on the Stock Exchange would be able to benefit, but the business expansion scheme type of companies, the R and D type, would not necessarily benefit.  This will zone in on those who really need.  I realise the Minister had difficulties in terms of the timing and producing the appropriate wording, but I am delighted he has come forward with this.</P>
      <P>I hope the combination of the business expansion scheme and the start-up phase followed by the OTCs, will ensure that there are two stages of development, the original input capital and the follow-up extra equity needs.  It is my hope that because the Minister has come up with this initiative the whole financial services sector will look at the opportunities this presents and ensure that there is a vibrant small company stock market.  I do not see any need for amendment No. 9 in the name of Deputy O'Leary.</P>

      <P>In page 77, between lines 37 and 38, to insert the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="725" />&ldquo;(iii)  by the insertion of the following paragraph:</P>
    <P>(e)  Five per cent of the amount on which tax is chargeable in relation to the supply of the following goods or services:</P>
    <P>(i)  services consisting of the development of immovable goods, and the maintenance and repair of immovable goods including the installation of fixtures, where the value of movable goods (if any) provided in pursuance of an agreement in relation to such services does not exceed two-thirds of the total amount on which tax is chargeable in respect of the agreement;</P>
    <P>(ii)  concrete ready to pour;</P>
    <P>(iii)  blocks, of concrete, of a kind which comply with the specification contained in the Standard Specification (Concrete Building Blocks) Declaration, 1974 (Irish Standard 20: 1974);'.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This is a hopeless attempt on our part to get the Minister to reconsider the impact of VAT on the construction industry.  The most recent figures demonstrate that cement sales for the first quarter of this year show a decline of 12 per cent on the first quarter of the previous year, which was a disastrous downturn in the building industry.  That is one of the indicators of the effect of VAT on the industry.  We are all aware of what has happened in regard to the Public Capital Programme and building in the private sector.  We must not forget that the Public Capital Programme has been reduced by the Government by £18 million.  When we consider the Government's attitude to this the most characteristic domestic enterprise we see is a withdrawal of the capital programme and additional VAT on the construction industry.  In the first few months of this year private housing starts declined by 25 per cent over the same period last year.  The decline for the <Col N="726" /> first four months compares very unfavourably with the same period last year.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that that decline is almost directly attributable to VAT on the building industry because the public cannot afford to pay it and many house builders cannot afford to absorb it.  It is not surprising that the level of unemployment in that industry is the highest of any sector, 50,000, and that the level of emigration of general construction workers, engineers and architects is out of line with the drastic emigration trends in other sectors.  I should like to make a final attempt to get the Minister to correct the error of the ways of his predecessor.  I say that more in hope than expectation because the Minister seems committed to the same disastrous path as his predecessor.</P>

      <P>The Bill we are about to pass, unless something dramatic happens and the component Members of the Government parties get a belated change of mind, represents more of the same to the extent that the level of taxation is increased and the disincentive element which has been a feature of the disastrous economic experience in the last three years is more evident than ever.  I regret that, as a consequence of the Bill, which has been put through the House in the most unsatisfactory manner of any Finance Bill in my four years as Opposition spokesman, our problems will be aggravated. I should like to refer to the way the <Col N="727" /> Bill has been rushed through the House which is best exemplified by the fact that I had exactly one minute to move an amendment in relation to one of our most important industries, the construction industry.  The Bill contains 108 sections and I have never witnessed an occasion where amendments were introduced by the Minister right up to the last minute. I have never witnessed a Minister moving Financial Resolutions on the last day of the debate on a Finance Bill.  Previously all Financial Resolutions were moved at the commencement of the debate.  If the Minister checks the record he will find I am correct.</P>

      <P>Perhaps some one would gag that Minister while I am saying my piece.  Then he can say his piece because, God knows, he has had enough time to do something.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill now gives legislative effect to the introduction of income tax at the highest possible level, representing an increase of 50 per cent on the income tax burden as it obtained before this Government came into office.  This Bill and its provisions will add an extra £400 million <Col N="729" /> to the income tax burden of the already over-burdened taxpayer.  No matter how the Government and the Minister try to misrepresent that fact, it demonstrates once again that we are still being subjected to a regime determined to heap taxation on taxation, apparently to achieve a balancing of the books that have already run out of balance, even to the extent that no longer do we hear talk about elimination of the budget deficit; now we hear talk of its gradual reduction. We have seen an increase in our total national debt to £21 billion whereas, when this Government assumed office, that figure stood at £12.5 million.  All of these consequences can be seen throughout every sector but, most of all, in the unemployment figures, emigration and the total lack of any incentive to invest which has been a feature of this Government over the past three years.</P>
    <P>The only thing one can say about the Government is that at least they are evenhanded, that they have increased the level of taxation evenly across the board. As they have increased the level of income tax by 50 per cent in their term of office &mdash; as will be the case under the provisions of this Bill &mdash; not to be outdone, they have increased the level of VAT by the same amount, give or take 1 percentage point.  I did not have an opportunity to develop the amendment I was going to propose in relation to VAT on the construction industry.  However, it is quite clear that a Government who maintain in this Bill a level of VAT on that vital, labour-intensive sector of our economy have no intention of giving any relief to the really enterprising sectors of our economy.</P>
    <P>Not to be outdone, the Minister has followed quite the same pattern, if not worse, in relation to excise duties.  We spent some little time debating the question of tax on petroleum products.  I want to record the fact that the Minister would not give the House figures for the level of taxation imposed on petroleum products in member states of the EC.  He did not give the figures because he knew too well they would demonstrate that the <Col N="730" /> level of taxation on petroleum products here is far and away the highest anywhere in the EC.  That is a fact.  He tried to get away from it by pointing to the actual retail price in the various member states&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Which is lower here than in three other European countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in respect of which one or two countries are marginally dearer than us.  The level of taxation being imposed by this Minister under the provisions of this Finance Bill puts us way above the league.  It is having a most damaging effect on employment, not just in that industry &mdash; which was demonatrated in the course of this debate &mdash; but on the tourism industry and all of the other service sectors affected by the extraordinarily high excise duties imposed by this Government.</P>
      <P>When one considers what the provisions of the Finance Bill might have done one might contend that they should have concentrated on certain things to cope with the major problems confronting the country: unemployment, lack of incentive to invest and emigration.  Even where the Minister did make some moves we welcomed &mdash; particularly in relation to the research and development project &mdash; they were far too limited.  If the Minister intends to promote a climate favourable to research and development, would he not learn from the mistakes of his predecessor, by not restricting the business expansion scheme in the same manner as his predecessor to such an extent that after two years £5 million has been invested in that scheme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was interested to note that the last amendment introduced here constituted a response, almost two years later, to what we had pleaded for with the Minister's predecessor.  Had the Minister been here to witness the dismissive tones with which his predecessor responded to the case he has now accepted by way of amendment, then he might have learned something.  Unfortunately the same response is evident in relation to the case we made in respect of research and development, <Col N="731" /> the limitations the Minister has imposed, the fact that he has excluded research and development corporations, has limited the figure of £25,000 per person at a time when we should be encouraging people to invest millions, not thousands of pounds.  All of that demonstrates that, even when this Government do move in the right direction, they take a faltering step only.  Then they impose barriers to ensure that a worthwhile scheme will not succeed.</P>
    <P>I might make two final observations. This Bill will be remembered in particular as the DIRT Bill, the Bill whose provisions introduced the DIRT tax.  When all else about this Bill, perhaps even this Government and the Minister is forgotten, the Minister will be remembered as the Minister who introduced that DIRT tax, the tax that crushed every known principle of taxation.  The Minister should know that one does not impose an income tax on people who have not a taxable income, or impose tax on deposit interest earned by old people trying to provide for themselves.  Equally one does not impose an income tax on organisations doing so much to promote the wellbeing, health and activity of the community generally. All of this is being done by a Minister who does not even know how much it will yield or how much it would cost to exempt the categories hitherto exempted, all in the name of reducing the income tax burden on others who are liable.  This Bill will be long remembered when all the other little amendments the Minister introduced are forgotten.</P>
    <P>The Minister has presented himself as wanting to promote a new climate for investment and activity.  The Minister has spoken as if he and his predecessor did not have collective responsibility for ensuring that the climate for investment reached the low level now being experienced in every sector.  If the Minister is so determined to ensure that there is money available to the private sector for productive enterprise then why does he introduce a tax of this nature and exclude the Government themselves from its application?  He should remember that, <Col N="732" /> if one wants to make funds available to the private sector, the last thing a Government should do is introduce a new tax on financial institutions and their depositors while exempting Government gilts.  The last thing any Government would do is advise individual citizens, the GAA and other voluntary organisations to invest in Government gilts &mdash; which is exactly what the Minister has said here today &mdash; to take their money out of the private banking sector and put it into Government gilts.  Surely we have witnessed enough the effects of money being transferred to safe havens and the impact on our interest rates.  There are too many people chasing too little money available for the private sector.  This Bill, instead of making more money available for investment, lifting the penal levels of taxation which are a disincentive, recognising the importance of marketing, the construction industry, research and development, has gone the other way. We might have had some hope that with a change of face there would be a change of policy but, in the event, we have got much more of the same.</P>
    <P>This Minister already has the doubtful distinction of being the only Minister in recent experience in Europe who failed to get his budget through his own Parliament. He is the only Minister for Finance who has not as yet put through a budget. My hope and expectation is that he will certainly not have the opportunity to break that unenviable record by putting a budget through next year.  If it is like this one we will be witnessing more of the same.  Please God, the Minister will retain his distinction in the <i>Guinness Book of Records</i> as being the only Minister who never put a budget through his own Parliament.</P>

      <P>There is very little time left and it is regrettable that such a short period has been allocated for the Report and Final Stage of the biggest, most important and far-reaching Bill which comes before the House in any given year.  This year we have only to look at the Bill to see how complicated it is and how much of it was not part of the Bill upon its introduction but was brought in in huge rafts of amendments at very short notice.  It is a pity that those who agreed the time for this debate did not arrange that it should continue until 11.30 tonight.  I understand the House is sitting until that hour in any case, dealing with matters which are a great deal less important than the provisions of this Bill. About a quarter of this Bill did not exist at Second Stage and it is very unsatisfactory to have to deal with it in this kind of way.</P>
      <P>I wish to make a brief reference to the scheme for the encouragement of investment in research and development.  We all agree it is a very good idea.  It covers sections 16 to 29 inclusive.  Effectively a scheme of encouragement for research and development could perhaps be introduced in a page.  The positive element of this scheme is contained in a page and the many other pages consist of limitations, ways of cutting it down, ways to make it less attractive and less useful.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>It will have the same effect as the business development scheme of some years ago.  The entire alleged effect of that scheme was lost because in two years scarcely anything worthwhile had been invested under it, not because people did not want to but because they did not have the opportunity. It was so hedged around with myriad <Col N="734" /> restrictions that it was quite impossible for them to do so.</P>
      <P>There are many aspects of the Bill one would like to talk about in order to complain about the damage that is being done.  The Bill reflects an attitude on the part of the Government which is doing absolutely nothing for our economy. Painfully the Minister for Finance talks about the benefits that might arise from certain schemes were there not all the restrictions placed on them.  There are about ten individual sections throughout the Bill which wipe out straight away whatever benefits might derive from things so painfully decided and grudgingly given.</P>
      <P>There are aspects of this DIRT tax which are particularly inequitable.  I quoted on Second Stage and on Committee Stage the Minister's own words at the press conference on 4 April that if he were to exempt people who were not liable for income tax because their incomes were too low, then he would lose 60 per cent of the tax or £60 million in a full year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I quoted the figure he used on 4 April.  I invited him on Committee Stage to comment on whether it was right and he did not deny it.  It seems to defy all rules of equity that anyone might contemplate imposing income taxation, 60 per cent of which would fall on people not liable for income tax because their incomes are too low.  There are also many groups and bodies of different kinds who would not in the normal way pay tax but who deposit money in banks. The Minister has never explained away the aspect of gross inequity of that tax. It will be interesting to see how it works in practice.  It may not work the way the Minister and the banks think it will.  It may cause a sudden movement of money in all directions which may not be to the benefit of this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="735" /> This is precisely the form of tax which gives people the excuse to feel there is nothing in any way reprehensible about avoiding tax.  That is a common belief. It has now swung around so that it is commendable in some way to avoid tax because the tax rates, the methods of tax and the new forms of tax are all so onerous and penal that nobody can feel morally wrong in any sense in trying to avoid the payment of the last penny being screwed out of the taxpayers.  This whole Bill and its provisions reflect the attitude of the Government and create that kind of attitude among the community.  Constant penal provisions of this kind have turned our black economy into one of the more thriving aspects of our entire economy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make the point that the original thrust of the budget of the first Minister for Finance has been altered considerably by the second Minister for Finance.  We are dealing with two budgets.  I make that point because the original thrust of this Bill was to broaden the burden of taxation and to endeavour to reduce the PAYE content.  For that reason, I welcomed the deposit interest retention tax section which was the major innovative section in the budget.  The second Minister for Finance in other sections has reduced the burden on capital by reducing capital gains tax and the stamp duty on insurance companies from 15 per cent to 9 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The deposit interest retention tax which basically was a good thing has been, to my mind, implemented in this Bill in an extraordinary fashion.  I agree with Deputy O'Malley with regard to evasion, but I still say the Minister has something to answer in regard to banks putting advertisements in the papers where they are saying that the details of interest paid on accounts subject to the new tax will no longer be disclosed to anybody but the account holder.  I ask the Minister does he agree that a bank can make a statement such as that when he is trying to put a Bill through the Dáil to tax deposit interest.  Banks at the same <Col N="736" /> time are saying: &ldquo;We defy the Minister to find out who has these deposits&rdquo;.  The Minister has something to answer there and I ask him to endeavour to uncover why banks can do this sort of thing.</P>
    <P>There is one other specific point I would like to make to the Minister which I did not have the opportunity of making in the course of the debate.  Has the Minister taken into consideration the position of local authorities who have expressed to me grave concern about the deposit interest retention tax on their funds and on their ability to endeavour to raise money by proper use and proper financial arrangements of their funding. Local authorities feel they will be losing in this once again.</P>

      <P>I want to take this opportunity to make a comment on the amendment which I had down on section 85 and also to make a little comment on the Minister's amendment to section 53. While the question about the levy on life assurance companies might be dry stuff it does change the ground rules substantially for life assurance companies.  There is no doubt in the world about it that we are seeing the end of guaranteed income bonds and guaranteed growth bonds.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>These traditional forms of bonds are going and I presume that investment bonds will be staying.  They will be less attractive because the 1982 stamp duty levy will not now be allowable as a tax expense.  The Minister talked a lot about the question of doing away with ring fencing, as it is known in the life assurance business, whereby management expenses can be written off against losses in one particular sector.  The proposed levy as introduced by the Minister <Col N="737" /> is retrospective, in effect, as it applies to investment income and realised gains which are required to fund the contractual commitments that already have been entered into by the life assurance companies over a long number of years.  The Minister, in effect, is changing the fundamental ground rules in so far as the benefits attached to these things are concerned. It is estimated that it will bring in about £18 million but I reckon that only about £5 million of that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;can be clawed back from policyholders and the rest will have to be taken out from the reserves of the company.  In effect, the Minister is now making every single life assurance company less solvent.  Not only will policyholders suffer, but there will be a reduction in the profits of the with profits policies. <Col N="738" /> People will find it generally more difficult to meet their commitments.</P>
      <P>In that regard I would like to put it on record that I reject this matter of the levy.  It is an arbitrary tax and hopefully I will get an opportunity to put down my full objection to this arbitrary tax at some future date.</P>

This is not practical.  I am merely asking the Minister to have a look at this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann requests the Government to provide the Garda Síochána with the resources needed to enable them to deal effectively with the present unacceptable levels of crime, lawlessness and vandalism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the outset I reject the amendment put forward in the name of the Minister for Justice suggesting that the Dáil approves of the provision by the Government for the Garda Síochána of resources in <Col N="741" /> the current year.  In the past few days, particularly, we have all seen the widespread alarm about the cutbacks in Garda overtime.  There is a basis for this.  Alarm, some of which may have been unnecessary, has been created by what is happening in the Garda Síochána.  The news of the cutbacks was particularly alarming to people living in areas where there are high levels of crime.</P>
    <P>The Minister gave us assurances in the House that despite circumstances at the Border or elsewhere, areas in which there were high levels of crime would be given the attention they need, that the Garda would not be cut for overtime, that they would be allowed the necessary flexibility. Therefore, our great concern when we read of these difficulties recently can be understood.  We know very well that in recent years the volume of crime has increased dramatically, with nearly 100,000 crimes being recorded for 1984. No doubt the Minister will claim that there has been a drop in the figures in 1985 &mdash; the figures should be available by this time.  A special feature of the past three years has been the rise in violent crime and injuries to law-abiding citizens.</P>
    <P>We are not dealing with statistics, whether they are going up or down, but with the clear pattern of an increase in violent crimes and injuries to citizens. Various Coalition Ministers have tried to fudge the issue in an effort to avoid their responsibilities.  They suggest that the crime problem is under control.  This head-in-the-sand approach does not help at all, especially when it is juxtaposed with the low detection rate of one in three, the low rate of recovery of stolen property, about 8.6 per cent, the spiralling of violent crimes, especially in urban and suburban areas, the ready availability of unlicensed firearms, the growth in racketeering and the failure of the Government to give needed support to those who are involved in the front line of the fight against crime, the community, the victims, and above all the Garda, who at the end of the day are the thin blue line between the community and the criminals.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="742" /> It is vital that this House provides the Garda with the resources to deal with the dreadful problem they have to face.  Our newspapers highlight this failure daily when they report criminal cases.  Whole communities are forced to throw a cloak around criminal activities in their areas not because they do not care but because they are caught helplessly between the complacency of the Government and what they see as the success of the criminals and the intimidation, by threats, of the racketeers.</P>
    <P>The Garda can give only so much.  At present they are being asked to fight the criminals with their hands tied behind their backs.  I have been speaking to gardaí recently who are responsible for policing serious crime areas, and that is the way they feel about it.  Their comment is that because of cutbacks in overtime and the lack of flexibility available to them they are facing criminals with their hands tied behind their backs.</P>
    <P>The buck stops with the Minister for Justice, and as long as the Government continue their cutbacks and their failure to re-inforce the Garda the criminals will have a free rein.  There has been a failure to beat the criminals and to reduce the crime rate significantly.  Therefore, the community are forced into a position in which people are forced to accept that the activities of criminals are in some way normal.  We cannot ask people to sacrifice their self respect, their peace and their right to security of life and property. There is no such thing as an acceptable level of crime and we will continue to oppose Coalition attempts to peddle the notion that there is.</P>
    <P>The community are being savaged by criminals, vandals and thugs.  Last year, the value of property stolen is estimated to have been more than £31 million, of which only £2.6 million, or 8.6 per cent, was recovered.  People no longer feel safe in their homes.  The elderly, in particular, are living in an unnecessary state of fear. I say &ldquo;unnecessary&rdquo; because very often the presence of a garda on the beat would take away a great deal of the fear they have and give them a sense of security.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="743" /> I know of schools, pubs, shopping centres and post offices which have been burned and vandalised.  Racketeering is on the increase, a point the Minister continually refuses to accept.  What does the Minister know about the situation on the ground?  He can see from the newspapers that during last weekend, in a locality close to me, a school was plundered, a pub was robbed and a garda is in hospital tonight because of trying to do his duty in a shopping centre.  A church was set on fire, a school was robbed and a community centre was vandalised.  That is what happens at a weekend in this city but it could be stopped if sufficient gardaí were made available.  We asked the Minister about this before and we will go on shouting about it.  It is not good enough to pull back resources from certain areas.  The result is that some people are bearing the brunt of the storm of crime and vandalism.  The Minister has refused to accept that this is happening.</P>
    <P>I am not interested in the generality of statistics.  The Minister can go and see the areas in question.  Night after night, weekend after weekend, crime and vandalism are rampant.  It could all be stopped.  It is interesting to note that during the recent kidnapping affair crime was wiped out when all the detectives and gardaí were around.  The Minister can check the statistics if he wishes.  Because the gardaí and detectives were on the street checking to see what was going on, people had peace.  It shows that if the resources are allocated to areas that have higher crime levels the problem can be solved.  It is the duty of the Minister to do this.</P>
    <P>I know of one public house that cannot be sold even at half its market value because of the involvement of racketeers and of another where insurance cover was withdrawn on change of ownership also because of racketeers.  In that case the Garda Síochána were aware of the circumstances; but, given their limited resources, there was little they could do to ensure the rights of that pub owner. This kind of thing crops up again and again.  The Garda may have an idea of <Col N="744" /> what is going on, but they must put in resources to get results.  That means flexibility of operation and overtime, and unless they are available they cannot carry out the kind of surveillance that is necessary in such circumstances.  The pub owner to whom I referred, and I suspect an increasing number in that locality, are victims of a Government who are less than honest in confronting criminals.</P>
    <P>Some insurance companies will say that no longer can they afford to insure pubs because of vandalism and arson in certain areas.  The insurance of schools is also approaching a point of crisis.  Some 95 per cent of school insurance is carried by one company and recovery rates for malicious damage to schools have risen from £250,000 in 1982 to over £409,000 in 1985.  Of course, the actual cost is higher &mdash; that is just the amount an insurance company can recover in respect of malicious damage.  Three quarters of the claims came from the Dublin area. Schools in that area are in a constant stage of siege and, with the Government's proposed withdrawal of malicious damages, it is anticipated there will be a premium increase of between 25 per cent and 30 per cent in school insurance later this year because of vandalism and because people are not being protected.  The Garda are well able to do that if they are given the resources, but they are not being given the resources. This is the net result of Government policy, of penny pinching and cutbacks of Garda resources.  It means that gardaí are taken off the beat, leaving the community exposed to criminal activity.</P>
    <P>It is no wonder that the only growth industry in the country is in the area of home security which accounts for nearly 40 per cent of the entire security industry. This is an industry that is feeding on fear, a fear that has been bred both by the success of the criminal and the failure of the Government to act.  It causes all the more concern in that it is alleged that some of these security companies are little more than a front for protection rackets.  The response of the Government has been to cut back on Garda resources. I know that this Minister has a deserved <Col N="745" /> reputation for cutbacks, that he is trying to implement in the Department of Justice what he tried to do in the Department of Finance before the present Minister re-wrote his budget.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is forcing the Garda into an increasingly untenable position.  They are caught between the words and the deeds of this Government because the deeds do not match the words.  Not only is there a fall-off in resources and manpower but morale is also hit.  There is a feeling of being conned by the posturing of the Coalition and this was seen clearly at the recent annual conferences of the Garda associations. To give just one example, the president of the Garda Representative Association said &ldquo;It is untrue and the criminals know it&rdquo;, when the then Minister for Justice, Deputy Noonan, told everyone he had provided spike chains to deal with the problem of car ramming.  The Government were trying to convey a false impression not only to the public but to the Garda themselves.</P>
      <P>The deception and confusion that characterised the Government's policy on crime, expecially where cutbacks were involved, hit the morale of the Garda Síochána.  The denial of adequate resources is a vote of no confidence in the Garda.  Since this Government came into office in 1982 they have been systematically undermining the effectiveness of the Garda.  For example, in relation to the strength of the force, we are still 600 gardaí short of the 12,000 target set and approved by the Dáil in 1982.  It is not as though the extra gardaí were not needed. Every community knows they are needed and the crime statistics and the low detection rates prove that.  The annual number of Garda recruits has taken a dramatic downward turn from the figure of 983 when the last Fianna Fáil Government were in office in 1982 to 253 last year and to a zero intake so far this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How can the gardaí be expected to cope effectively with criminal activity when manpower levels are not increased <Col N="746" /> to meet the challenges of the criminals? Civilian posts in the force are also being left unfilled because of the public service embargo.  Again, this is shortsighted.  It means gardaí are being diverted from their primary function which is to police to clerical and other duties.  The penny-wise and pound-foolish policies of the Government means that the efforts and money spent in training gardaí to the current highly professional standards are not achieving the maximum results.</P>
    <P>The Government cutbacks have affected the operation of Garda overtime. In terms of the budget, there has been nearly a 50 per cent cutback in overtime in the past four years.  In the current year a sum of £12 million was allocated.  Recently we learned that £2 million per month had been spent during the first four months of this year, using up £8 million of the £12 million allocated for the year as a whole.  On this basis there will be only an average of £500,000 per month for each of the remaining eight months to cover all overtime duties, including the Border areas.</P>
    <P>The Minister indicated that overtime would be provided where crime was a serious problem and that activities on the Border would not take from the provision of flexibility in overtime in the areas where this was needed.  The reason for this step is quite clear.  The Government committed the country to increased Border security as a result of the Anglo-Irish Agreement, but they are unwilling to pay the bill for it.  Not only is the bill for overtime on the Border taken from the general overtime fund which, as I said, has been decreasing, but it results in the depletion of funds for the more effective policing of other areas.  Cutbacks in overtime for areas apart from the Border areas make a farce of the effort to beat the criminal.  As Garda personnel are redeployed to Border areas, regular levels of Garda activity on our streets are being cut back.  This applies even to squads such as the Serious Crime Squad and the Drug Squad.  In all, it is estimated that there has been a net cutback of over 1,000 gardaí as a result of deployment to the Border.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="747" /> It has been clearly indicated to Garda superintendents that little or no money is available for overtime for the rest of the year.  As a result, in one district a directive went out last week from the superintendent that there would be no overtime in any circumstances following a directive from headquarters.  This may have been a misinterpretation of the directive, but that is how it went out.  From what we are told, that is how the directive was handled on a much wider basis.  I might add that the district to which I have referred was not in Dublin.  Last weekend in the case of a murder in Dublin the technical bureau could not go to the scene of the crime until Monday.  The same happened in respect of a robbery in Cabra and a fatal accident in Offaly.  These men would be going out from Dublin outside normal hours.</P>
    <P>Cutbacks have reached such a ridiculous point that personnel on surveillance and in the technical bureau who are working away from home, for example, in Bray, must now return to base for lunch, instead of getting the subsistence allowance which would allow them to complete their work.  The Minister must agree that this is a ridiculous situation.  The cutbacks in both overtime and personnel have major implications for the maintenance of law and order.  They have resulted in the cancellation of court sittings, in the curtailing and disruption of security patrols &mdash; even at high security prisons such as Portlaoise &mdash; and in the scaling down of special missions and surveillance activities.  Surveillance activity is particularly important where crime levels are high.  If you want to catch those who are damaging a particular shop, public house, school and so forth you put a few gardaí on duty who spend from four to seven days there, watching very often at nighttime, and they will catch the culprits. There is plenty of evidence in support of this.  However, if overtime is so curtailed that they cannot do so, then crime will continue.</P>
    <P>Let me quote the words of the Secretary General of the Garda Representatives Association as follows: &ldquo;Cutbacks <Col N="748" /> have already led to the cancellation of certain duties and services considered vital.&rdquo;  Not just the trappings and trimmings, but the basic services have been affected.  That is what we are concerned about.  These include cutbacks in operation, including the temporary closedown of smaller stations and the depletion of foot patrols.  Resources must be used with flexibility.  Organisationally, the Garda force are flexible enough to adapt to the new situations which are confronting them.  However, there has been no action on Garda review, despite the Minister's promises to act.  We believe that special squads should be developed to confront the changing pattern in crime.  In those areas where the racketeers are operating, or where there are high levels of vandalism, a special squad should be assigned to back up the local gardaí and given the flexibility and the manoeuvrability to deal with the situation in these areas.  If this is done, I am quite certain they will be able to clean up crime.</P>
    <P>These policies worked well in the past and I know they will work well again in the future.  For me, such squads are part of the continuous review of Garda activity. Review must be an active thing and must not be put on the long finger.  The crime problem will never be under control unless and until the Government confront the problem honestly and realistically.  At present they are not doing so.  So the nightmare of crime goes on and will go on until the Garda are given the resources they need.  They need the active support of the Government, not the string of verbiage they have been getting.  Our communities are entitled to a real commitment from the Government to tackle the crime problem.  Our gardaí are ready and able to do their part; so are our communities.  The weak link in the change is Government policy and until that link is strengthened the criminal will reign free.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I appeal to the Minister to take this matter seriously and urgently. If the extra overtime has been used up because of Border activities, he gave us an undertaking earlier in the year that overtime for high crime areas would not <Col N="749" /> be cut as a result.  We want to hear definite assurances from the Minister for those who are beleaguered and besieged by crime in these areas.  I have already invited the Minister to come to these areas.  He will be very welcome.  If he wants to come tonight, he will see the gardaí from our own areas who are in hospital.  That is what we are facing day in, day out in Dublin and I am sure it is no different in parts of Limerick and Cork.  We are asking for the resources and the support and not further cutbacks. People come first; give them the support. The gardaí are fully capable of doing the job and have shown that again and again, if they are given the resources and the opportunity to do it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>Ní mór dom cuidiú leis an rún atá molta ag mo chara anseo.  The seriousness of crime, lawlessness and vandalism throughout the country is indicated by the fact that we have again introduced a motion here to discuss the situation arising from the prevalence of crime, this despite the claim that things are getting better and are not as bad as they were.  The parallel can be drawn with the Government's reaction on unemployment.  The position on crime is still too bad for the House to be fobbed off with easy statements such as have been made in recent times.  In the matter of crime we could use the phrase, &ldquo;Prevention is better than cure&rdquo;.  That would be achieved by the strengthening of our Garda force in numbers, technology, facilities, time, in every detail which is required for the prevention of crime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are not putting sufficient emphasis on prevention.  The task forces which the various divisions had throughout the country were discontinued by this Government and surely that was removing a preventative aspect of crime.  The only task force retained was in the metropolitan area of Dublin and that on occasions has been deployed to another region further north to guard the Six <Col N="750" /> County mythical Border, when the practical thing to do would have been to train people in that area who knew those with whom they were dealing and were familiar with the whole scene.  Deploying a Dublin task force does not result in prevention.</P>
    <P>The cutback on overtime and the use of the overtime fund in specific areas &mdash; perhaps where there is a need &mdash; leaves the remainder of the country in such a state that the criminal is encouraged and takes advantage of the opportunity to commit the crimes which could have been prevented.  The causes of crime are wide and varied.  Surely they are social; surely they are economic in many cases.  That stems from Government policy in the matter of social activity and the economy. There is an old saying that the devil tempts the idle mind and, with so many people idle, we can expect an increase in crime.  The Government have a responsibility to prevent crime by eliminating the causes and much of the cause arises from our economic and social situation at this time.  The only section of our community who are very lucratively engaged at this time are the security firms counteracting the crime, lawlessness and vandalism that is being carried on here for want of proper action by the Government.</P>
    <P>Poverty breeds crime.  Free legal aid is required and I support its availability for people who cannot afford, from their own resources, to have themselves defended in court.  But let us look at the free legal aid situation in Cork alone.  The number of claims by solicitors has increased in this year by 30 per cent.  Since 1 January this year a total of 371 certificates for free legal aid have been presented by solicitors to the Department of Justice. Some years ago only a handful of solicitors operated free legal aid in Cork city. Now there are 36 on the panel.  Surely there is a message there for the Minister.</P>
    <P>Deterrents are another factor.  Our over-crowded prisons meant that the prospect of imprisonment was no longer a deterrent because the criminals realised that there was no place to keep them. When we were in Government we used part of the Curragh Camp when <Col N="751" /> Mountjoy was not available.  Just over 12 months ago the then Minister for Justice made this marvellous announcement that he was going to set up in Cork Harbour Ireland's answer to Alcatraz, Spike Island.  It was going to be the be all and end all of deterrents.  The Minister was advised by the Garda and prison officers that the hurried use of Spike Island without proper preparation other than bricking up fireplaces, would not work. But Deputy Noonan knew it all.  Spike Island was definitely the answer.  At the time the Minister indicated that only trustworthy prisoners would be imprisoned there while it was being made suitable. But we know what happened to this wonderful solution.  For some people what happened to the selected trustworthy detainees on Spike Island last year may be history, but not for me.</P>
    <P>What about the commitments and the marvellous plan suggested to provide accommodation for 300 detainees on Spike Island?  It has been scrapped by the Government.  During the visit by the present Minister to Cork yesterday it emerged that there is no long term strategy for the development of the island prison which was wrecked during the rioting last September.  The Minister indicated that the project would not go ahead despite the fact that Minister Noonan said that there was a plan and that something less than £11 million represented an attractive prospect for the Irish taxpayer. Yesterday the Minister said that the Cabinet had not considered specific plans for a new jail on Spike Island nor was there any policy for the long term.  That came as a surprise to many people.  It now seems likely that the Spike Island prison will develop on a piecemeal basis and that Minister Noonan's plan to have a prison capable of accommodating 300 detainees will never be developed.</P>
    <P>Another aspect in the prevention and elimination of crime is the fact that there are only 32 sitting days in the year for trials in the Circuit Court in Cork, that is, four terms of eight days each.  On average 90 indictments await trial.  In the not too distant past one trial took five <Col N="752" /> days and that left three days for the remaining 89 trials to be held.  Let me ask the Minister a very simple question.  Who could have confidence in the system when such a situation can arise?  The rate of crime indicates that criminals are taking advantage.  To my knowledge no judge has ever deliberately perpetrated an injustice. Yet it would seem that in some cases too much emphasis is laid on technical rules to the profit of the criminal and to the detriment of the injured party and of society in general.  This matter will have to be looked at.</P>
    <P>Let me conclude by saying that the neighbourhood watch schemes seem to be floundering, starved of resources, manpower and direction.  The scheme for rural policing has seen large holes bored in the front doors of Garda stations and green coloured radio transmitters inserted.  These little green men are no substitute for the flesh and blood of the Garda.  Let me give an example in regard to country Garda stations being closed because sometimes we must get down to specifics.  The new region of Cobh Garda station services Carrignavar and Whitechurch. Carrignavar station is closed at 6 o'clock in the evening.  There was a call from Whitechurch to Cobh recently on an urgent matter sometime after tea. Nobody arrived until 2 o'clock in the morning and one of the questions posed at the other end of the line was &ldquo;Where is Whitechurch?&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Minister has a good deal to do.  I compliment the Garda for the work they are doing to combat crime but they are also trying to combat the problems I have already outlined.  Prevention is better than cure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Dukes) Alan Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Dukes)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>Delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dáil Éireann approves the provision by the Government to the Garda Síochána of the resources which have enabled the Force to combat crime more effectively, resulting in a reduction in the levels <Col N="753" /> of reported crime in 1984 and 1985, and supports the Government's further action in this direction.</P>
    <P>There is one point on which I agree entirely with Deputy Woods &mdash; and I think I am using almost his exact words &mdash; when he said he does not know what the Minister knows about the situation on the ground.  He is dead right.</P>
    <P>I find it more than a little difficult to understand why Deputy Woods thought it necessary to put down his original motion.  During the course of his remarks I wondered if he actually disapproved of the resources being made available to the Garda and if he was going to get around to suggesting that fewer resources should be made available.  I am not sure if he has made up his own mind about that because there were some inconsistencies in his remarks.  At one point Deputy Woods said, in so many words, that he did not want to know about the facts, but the facts of the matter are that crime is on the decrease and whatever resources the Garda need to tackle it have been, and will continued to be, provided for them.</P>
    <P>Since first taking up office this Government have been fully committed to the provision of the resources necessary to deal with the crime situation and have made substantial additional resources available to the Garda Síochána over the past three and a half years.</P>
    <P>The most essential requirement of a police force is manpower.  Since taking office in December 1982 the Government have provided the resources necessary to recruit, train and equip over 1,400 gardaí. This resulted in a net increase of over 700 in the strength of the force and recruitment is continuing in order to maintain Garda strength at its current level of 11,400, which is the highest level in the history of the State and is the target strength provided for in the national plan. I need hardly remind the House that this national plan has been endorsed on at least three occasions by this House.  The fact that the substantial financial resources necessary were made available to enable Garda recruitment to continue, <Col N="754" /> at a time when a restrictive approach is rightly being taken to public expenditure generally, demonstrates the Government's commitment to taking the steps necessary to deal with the crime situation.</P>
    <P>The fact that the Garda strength is currently at 11,400, the highest level in the history of the State, indicates that whatever else we might describe the Garda force as, we cannot accept Deputy Woods' description of it as &ldquo;the thin blue line&rdquo;.  It is a very solid blue line and more solid than it ever has been in the history of the State.  Not alone is it clear that there has been no cutback in Garda strength, as Deputy Woods seems to suggest, but there has been an increase since December 1982 &mdash; and I emphasise this again for the benefit of Deputy Treacy who is shaking his head &mdash; bringing it to the highest ever level in the history of the State.</P>
    <P>Since the strength of the Garda Síochána reached the target level, the emphasis has been on providing the force with the most modern technology available so that it can carry out the vital and demanding duties entrusted to it with the greatest possible efficiency and effectiveness. Progress in this area has been very good and I would like to enumerate the various advances that have been made so as to emphasise to the House what has been achieved in the technological field in recent years.</P>
    <P>A new national communications network is being provided at present and, when it is completed, the Garda will have one of the most advanced communications systems in Europe.  The new system went &ldquo;live&rdquo; in February of this year in all parts of the country other than the Dublin Metropolitan Area &mdash; I will come back to the Dublin situation later.  The provision of this new system involved the installation of radio communications equipment at the 18 divisional headquarters, the 72 district headquarters and the 570 Garda stations outside Dublin and the provision of personal and car radio sets for all gardaí engaged in outdoor patrolling duties.  Each of the 18 Garda divisional headquarters concerned has <Col N="755" /> been provided with sophisticated divisional radio control equipment.  Within each Garda division there is the facility for instant communication between the divisional headquarters and each district in the division, and between each district and the subdistrict stations attached to it. This means that at practically all times gardaí and Garda cars on patrol duty within the division are contactable from their station.  In addition, each Garda division has the facility of instant radio communication with all adjoining Garda divisions.  This new system provides for much greater efficiency in the transmission and exchange of information and in the utilisation of manpower and patrol cars.  It also enables an improved service to be provided for the public &mdash; for example, in terms of a quicker response by the Garda to calls for assistance.</P>
    <P>An important feature of the new network is the provision of radio telephone equipment &mdash; known as the &ldquo;Green Man&rdquo;&mdash; at small rural Garda stations. This equipment provides the public with immediate and direct access to the Garda at times when small local substations are closed.  This is an extremely useful feature in small rural communities where station opening times are restricted.</P>
    <P>I am sorry Deputy Lyons should have decided to take issue with the provision of this facility.  The fact is that where in the past a person seeking assistance from the Garda would find that the local garda was gone away, was at the other end of the parish or the station was closed, he now has available to him an immediate and direct radio link with the nearest open station.  This means he is in a position to get a more rapid response than would have been the case under the old system.  It is a grave mistake for Deputies on the other side of the House, simply because they want to make a political point, to run down a facility which is of inestimable value to rural communities.</P>

      <P>If I were in the business <Col N="756" /> of handing out invitations I would ask Deputy Woods to come and see the gardaí patrolling in a rural constituency before he or Deputy Lyons started making the ill-informed comments they have been making this evening.</P>
      <P>On that radio project we spent approximately £11 million to date.  This is one example of the Government's commitment to ensuring that the Garda Síochána are provided with the technical resources they require.  I am sorry Deputy Woods is leaving the House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should do less speed reading and take more time to think.</P>
      <P>As regards the Dublin Metropolitan Area, the position is that a £2 million contract was placed in April 1985 for a new radio communications system there. It is planned that the new system will come into operation later this year.  It includes the most modern type of central control room which will replace the existing central control room in Dublin Castle which is no longer adequate for a large and growing capital city like Dublin.</P>
      <P>Computerisation is another area of technology which can be of invaluable assistance to the Garda Síochána.  The Garda have their own computer since 1981.  At present it is of principal benefit in Garda work on stolen vehicles, firearms and criminal records.  Work is being carried out at present on improving these systems and on developing new systems to meet the needs of the force. A new computer costing over £300,000 was purchased for the Garda in December of last year.  This will facilitate considerable expansion of the computer service being provided for the force and it has replaced the former Garda computer which was no longer adequate to meet the growing needs of the force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sixty visual display units and ancillary equipment were purchased in 1984 and a contract was placed towards the end of <Col N="757" /> last year for a further 45 visual display units and ancillary equipment.  This equipment, which has cost over half a million pounds, has enabled the 18 divisional headquarters and some other busy stations both inside and outside the Dublin Metropolitan Area to be linked directly to the Garda computer.  This facility for immediate access to records &mdash; for example to check out stolen or suspect vehicles &mdash; is proving to be of immense practical assistance to the Garda.</P>
    <P>The most recent innovation available to the Garda is a new crime reporting and analysis system.  This is a sophisticated computer system which will place the most modern technological aids available for the detection and prevention of crime at the disposal of every garda in the country. A database on criminal activity in the country will be built up and the most up-to-date methods will be used to search and analyse it.  Gardaí may enter crime details in their own words into the computer and the system will search and analyse these data to provide investigators with assistance in the solution of particular crimes, or produce analytic reports that explore particular areas of criminal activity in depth.</P>
    <P>The system is intended to benefit primarily the ordinary uniformed or plainclothes Garda officer engaged on routine police work.  The intention is that every garda in the country will be no more than a telephone or a radio call away from the facilities provided by the computer. These include, for instance, the facility to list on request:</P>
    <P>&mdash;all crimes committed by persons with physical characteristics similar to those described in the case of a suspect,</P>
    <P>&mdash;all crimes committed at certain times within specific areas,</P>
    <P>&mdash;the times and areas in which crimes with specific <i>modus operandi</i> are committed,</P>
    <P>&mdash;all thefts of particular goods at certain times within specific areas,</P>
    <P>&mdash;the times that particular goods are stolen in certain areas,</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="758" />&mdash;the streets, roads, or areas in which particular crimes are committed, and so on.</P>
    <P>The system will also produce statistics for Garda management for tactical and strategic purposes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Woods is now scraping the barrel in desperation for some class of argument.  He begins to see very clearly that not alone are the Garda being provided with the resources they require to keep up the present level of policing activity, their facilities are being expanded in order to provide the ordinary garda on the beat with the communications and the information that he requires to do his job more effectively.  If Deputy Woods wants to find something to argue against, it should not be that.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Considerable financial resources have been committed also to meeting the accommodation needs of the Garda Síochána.  In the last three years over <Col N="759" /> £11 million has been spent on the Garda station building programme and a further £10 million has been provided for this programme over the next two years.  In addition to this, two major construction projects costing almost £4 million are underway in the Garda Depot while the fitting out of the new Garda complex at Santry will be getting under way later this year.  I should also mention that an ultra modern indoor firing-range, costing £360,000, was completed in the Garda Depot last year, while a site for an outdoor range, on which planning is already under way, has been purchased.  In this connection I should say that, while it is our proud tradition and policy that the Garda Síochána is an unarmed force, it is an unfortunate fact that, on occasion, members must be called upon to carry and, at times, to use firearms.  In these circumstances it is essential that the Garda be provided with firing range facilities where they can undergo the necessary training.  This has been, and is being, attended to.</P>
    <P>I want to mention also the forensic science laboratory of my Department which is of very great assistance to the Garda in detecting crime.  At the moment the laboratory is being expanded and it will take over additional new laboratory space in the near future.  This year additional funds, amounting to almost £200,000, have been provided for in the Estimates for the purchase of new sophisticated equipment, to ensure that the laboratory continues to be equipped to the highest and most modern standards.  Furthermore, an additional three scientists are currently being recruited to ensure that the necessary analytical work will be carried out expeditiously so that there will be no avoidable delay in the conduct of criminal investigations.  This is a further example of the Government's commitment to providing whatever resources are needed to enable the Garda, to tackle crime and bring to justice the criminals in our society.</P>
    <P>The most important resource which a <Col N="760" /> police force have is their own manpower and it is essential, therefore, that appropriate training be provided to ensure optimum development of this resource.  The Commissioner, with my predecessor's approval, established a committee in January of last year under the chairmanship of Dr. Thomas Walsh to undertake a thorough review of Garda training.  The committee have presented to the Commissioner a report concerning the basic training of new entrants to the Garda Síochána and the recommendations in that report are at present under consideration. It is my hope that it will be possible to implement at least some recommendations in time to benefit the new entrants to the Garda Síochána who will come from the next recruitment competition.</P>
    <P>In view of all that I have said about the equipment and the resources being made available to the Garda, it will be very clear that there is no question of there being any truth whatever in Deputy Woods's allegation that the Garda are fighting with their hands tied behind their backs.  On the contrary, we have made it a deliberate policy over the last three and a half years to ensure that whatever useful tools we can give the Garda, to do their job more effectively will be placed at their disposal.  The Garda themselves are making very effective and imaginative use of the new resources we have placed at their disposal.</P>
    <P>The Government have been concerned also to ensure that the Garda have available to them sufficient powers to enable them to deal effectively with crime and I believe that the Criminal Justice Act will achieve this objective.  Some of the provisions of the Act are already in operation and the remainder will come into force when a Garda complaints board have been set up and regulations dealing with the treatment of persons in Garda custody are implemented.  That Act is one of the most important developments in criminal law and procedure since the foundation of the State.</P>
    <P>Deputies present are, I am sure, familiar with the details of the Act, but it would be useful, in the context of this <Col N="761" /> motion, to outline briefly some of the main provisions.  Many of the Act's provisions were brought into force in March 1985.  These include stiffer penalties for firearms offences and the compulsory fingerprinting of convicted persons.  With regard to bail, the law now requires any sentence for an offence committed on bail to be consecutive on any other sentence passed, or about to be passed, on a person for a previous offence.  To make this provision more effective, so far as sentences passed in the District Court are concerned, the aggregate term which a District Justice can impose when passing two or more consecutive sentences has been increased from 12 months to two years.  In addition, absconding on bail has been made an offence for the first time and carries a penalty of up to 12 months' imprisonment.  Moreover, any sentence imposed for this offence has to be consecutive on any sentence passed for a prior offence.  Offenders who continue to engage in criminal activity while on bail can now expect much stricter punishment from the courts.</P>
    <P>Important changes in trial procedures have also been introduced.  An accused person is now required to give advance notice of any alibi he intends to put forward in a jury trial.  Also, majority verdicts have been introduced in criminal trials.  The right to make an unsworn statement has been abolished.  New procedures to allow proof by written statement and formal admission in trials save court time taken up in formally proving matters which are not really in dispute and also free greater numbers of gardaí to deal with crime on the street instead of requiring them to attend court for unnecessarily long periods.</P>
    <P>Some of the key provisions of the Act are not yet in force.  They deal with detention after arrest, the offences of withholding information about stolen property or illegally held firearms, and inferences which may be drawn by the court against an accused.  These provisions will be brought into operation when a new statutory procedure for dealing with complaints against members of the Garda <Col N="762" /> Síochána is in operation and when regulations on the treatment of persons in custody have been made.  The Garda Síochána (Complaints) Bill is ordered for Committee Stage.  I published proposals for regulations for the treatment of persons in custody in Garda stations in the form of a White Paper last month for public comment and it is also my intention to have these proposals debated in the House shortly so as to give Deputies an opportunity to suggest amendments before I seek formal approval for the regulations.</P>
    <P>So far, I have concentrated my remarks on the resources being made available to the gardaí in terms of manpower, equipment, and legal changes to deal with the crime situation.  Of course, the ideal solution to the crime problem would be to prevent crimes in the first place.  The Government have been anxious to ensure that the necessary resources are allocated to the vital area of crime prevention. One approach to this area which is being actively pursued by the gardaí is the neighbourhood watch scheme.  I am sorry Deputy Woods and Deputy Lyons had the bad judgment to claim, contrary to the facts, that the neighbourhood watch scheme was not operating.</P>
    <P>Following a study of similar schemes in operation in Britain and in the United States, the Garda initially established pilot schemes in a number of districts in the Dublin area.  These schemes were considered to have a useful role to play, not just in relation to crime prevention, but also in fostering a closer relationship and understanding between the Garda and the community.  The Government allocated funds in mid-1985 specifically for a publicity campaign to promote neighbourhood watch with a view to having it adopted as widely as possible throughout the country.  The campaign was launched in mid-summer and concentrated on television and radio coverage. So far there are over 170 schemes in existence involving 50,000 households throughout the country and I am confident that the Government's initiative in having the scheme promoted throughout the country will pay dividends in terms <Col N="763" /> of crime prevention and closer Garda and community co-operation.</P>
    <P>I wish to thank Deputy Woods for his invitation to accompany him tonight to a particular place &mdash; not that I need it as I have no difficulty in seeing the gardaí at their jobs &mdash; but I must decline it as I have an engagement to launch another neighbourhood watch scheme in Dún Laoghaire to which I look forward with pleasant anticipation.</P>
    <P>I should now like to turn to areas of particular concern and to illustrate the effectiveness of the measures taken to curb these criminal activities.  The Garda responded to the threat posed by the so-called joyriders and have, I am glad to say, been very successful.  A special Garda unit has been tackling the problem in Dublin since January 1985 and their success has been heartening.</P>
    <P>Available statistics indicate that the problem of unauthorised takings of vehicles and rammings of Garda patrol cars has reduced considerably in the past 12 months.  For the State as a whole there was a decrease of 20 per cent in the number of unauthorised takings of vehicles in 1985 compared with 1984.  Furthermore, there was a similar decrease of 20 per cent in the number of unauthorised takings of vehicles for the first three months of 1986, compared with the same period last year.</P>
    <P>Another area of concern over the past few years has been the incidence of drug abuse.  Immediately on taking office, the Government addressed themselves to this problem.  A special task force, chaired by the then Minister of State at the Department of Health, were established to examine the extent of the problem and to make recommendations. A number of those recommendations are being implemented, including a wide range of measures involving education and treatment facilities, improvement in the health, education and community youth development areas and the undertaking of appropriate research projects.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Criminal Justice Act, 1984, provides for the amendment of criminal law and procedure to deal more <Col N="764" /> effectively with serious crime including serious offences under the Misuse of Drugs Act.  On a previous evening in the House I said the incidence of drug trafficking has levelled off.  In 1985 there was a decrease of approximately 7 per cent in the number of persons charged with drug offences compared to 1984 and a decrease of 4 per cent in the number of drug seizures over the same period.  As I indicated on that occasion, the Garda will remain vigilant in this area and it is much too early to conclude that any other course can be adopted.</P>
    <P>In the winter of 1984 there was an outbreak of attacks on elderly people living in isolated rural areas.  I am glad to say that in 1985 there was a very considerable reduction in the number of recorded attacks of this nature.  That reduction was brought about by specific action decided on by divisional officers in the Garda who drew up plans to meet the needs of their own divisions, implemented them and brought them up to date as and when necessary.  Those plans included the patrolling of high risk areas, spot checks on vehicles and the allocation of specific members to duties which included visiting elderly people living in rural areas.  That specific action has been successful and, with other examples I have given, clearly belies the allegation by Deputy Woods that no action is being taken by the Garda to deal with particular types of crime.</P>
    <P>We are also concerned with the question of arms crimes.  However, we have taken specific measures, especially in the Dublin area, to deal with the problem. As I pointed out during an Adjournment debate here some weeks ago, I do not intend to go into the measures adopted as it would be counterproductive to do so.  That again belies Deputy Woods's contention &mdash; he should know better &mdash; that no special action has been taken by the Garda to deal with specific problems. They have shown their ability, given the resources we have made available to them, to react flexibly and quickly to new problems as they emerge and on the evidence are doing so successfully.</P>
    <P>I will now turn to the general question of crime levels.  I will abbreviate my <Col N="765" /> remarks, given the time constraints, although I am sure my colleague, the Minister of State, will develop this theme more fully tomorrow evening.  In 1984, for the first time in six years, we had a reduction of 2.6 per cent in reported crime.  That was an indication that the previous trend had been arrested.  That trend was confirmed in 1985 when there was a further decrease, this time a significant one, of 8.5 per cent.  The Garda authorities have reported to me in the last few days that provisional figures for indictable crimes in the first three months of this year show a further significant decrease from last year's figures.  If that is put against the spurious claims that have been made by the Opposition, one will see the emptiness of the motion they have put forward.  They have closed their eyes, taken no account whatever of the successes of the Garda in dealing with crime or the resources we have made available to them.  We have made those resources available because we are not interested in words or the fine phrases that are trotted out.  What we want are results and we are getting them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately, the Minister only got through half of his speech that was circulated and did not reach a topic Deputy Woods was very concerned about, financial resources given to the Garda.  The Minister said that there had been talks with chief superintendents in regard to the £12 million allocation for Garda overtime.  His speech went on:</P>
      <P>To put the matter in perspective, what happened was that I drew attention to the very high level of expenditure on Garda overtime so far this year which, were it to continue at the present rate, would be substantially out of line with the Estimates provision of £12 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The chief superintendents understood from those discussions that they had spent two-thirds of the allocation and could not continue to employ gardaí on overtime.  They reduced the amount of overtime substantially.  I am sure the Minister, and other Members, are aware <Col N="766" /> that £8 million was spent on overtime for gardaí on Border duty.  I have learned from my colleagues of the number of gardaí who have been floating around small towns along the Border for the last few months.  I have no doubt that those gardaí are very busy but they are not patrolling in the areas where crime is highest in the Twenty-six Counties. When the chief superintendents were told they were not getting anything in excess of £12 million they calculated that they would have to reduce the amount of overtime by 50 per cent.  I do not know if the chief superintendents misunderstood the position but there is no doubt that the chief superintendents in the Dublin Metropolitan area were of the opinion that they could not spend any more money on overtime.</P>
    <P>The Minister's speech also stated that he was concerned that spending on overtime was running at a high level and he exorted senior officers, as part of their management responsibilities, to review the deployment of their resources so as to ensure that the policing needs of their divisions were met in the most cost effective way.  There was only one way they could do that, cut back on overtime. There is no point in the Minister saying he did not tell the chief superintendents to cut back and it is a little silly to go on in that fashion.</P>
    <P>This is about the tenth time that the House has debated Garda resources and the level of crime since the Coalition took office.  I have contributed to most of the debates on this topic and I wonder if there is much point in raising these matters.  I accept that there has been success. During 1981, 1982 and part of 1983 there was an improvement and the number of car thefts has reduced.  Those who live in the city, or in places like Finglas and Cabra where the car stealing problem is greatest, are aware of that improvement. The introduction of modern technology and the new communications system are welcome.  I accept that since 1977 the Garda have been given substantial resources to provide modern technology and I hope the Government will continue to provide those resources.  There is no <Col N="767" /> doubt that having car registrations and the records of criminals on computer has helped.  Many gardaí comment on how useful that information is.</P>
    <P>Irrespective of who is in Government it is wrong in the course of a debate like this for a Minister to trot out statistics in an effort to show that everything in the garden is rosy.  We must acknowledge the dedication of gardaí and officials in the Department of Justice, but we should not fool ourselves when quoting statistics into thinking that the problem is under control. It is sad to think that in a small country like ours, with a little over three million people, we can have more than 100,000 crimes in a year.  Those who live in our cities and suburbs are frightened. Last week-end a friend of mine who has a very extensive alarm system in his house told me that for the second time thieves broke a window and removed his video and television set.  A short time ago in the course of a debate I gave details of a similar occurrence in the case of a neighbour of that person.  Thieves are no longer afraid of house or car alarms.  At one time alarms were a deterrent but that is not the case any more.  There is no doubt that those who join video clubs and give their name and addresses make a big mistake because those lists find their way into the hands of criminals.  I have mentioned that very often at meetings in my constituency, but unfortunately people continue to give their addresses.  There is an alternative way of hiring videos and many people are adopting it.</P>
    <P>In the city suburbs people are putting massive bars in their driveways to prevent their cars being stolen.  Extensive locks are being fitted to doors and iron shutters put on the windows of business premises. In one case in North King Street criminals broke through a wall and the owner of the premises, who had erected a cement roof, steel shutters and the basement blocked off discovered that he was not insured because there was no alarm in the wall.  A very reputable insurance company in the city got off the hook in this case but the individual concerned was at a loss of £8,600.  The number of armed <Col N="768" /> crimes in the city is very big.  In a licensed premises in my constituency which I frequent regularly criminals walked in at 9.50 p.m. and took the till.  There have been so many bank robberies that AIB and Bank of Ireland have had printed notices sent to their branches to be displayed in the event of a robbery on the following lines, &ldquo;Closed due to robbery&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>A garda in any Garda station will tell one that the chances of detecting armed robbers or those involved in house burglaries are pathetic.  A meeting was held in the Bridewell Garda station last week &mdash; a station which covers huge, fairly dodgy parts of the city where a lot of crime is committed &mdash; at which we were told that between 10 p.m. and 3 a.m. or 4 a.m. they have one squad car and one motorbike only available to them.  The people who know most about that are the criminals; they know exactly what is available in each area and Garda manoeuvres.</P>
    <P>The reason many robberies are carried out at, say, 9.55 p.m. or at 10.05 p.m. is that the criminals know there is a Garda change of shift at that time.  Therefore, they strike and get away with it then, whereas they would not if they did so half an hour earlier or later.  That is a fact of life.  That happens every Friday, Saturday and Sunday night in the inner city, right out to Cabra, Finglas, East Wall, Marino, all the areas I know well.  I have spoken frequently to the Garda about these robberies. Therefore, I resent the Minister or anybody trying to con people into believing that we have beaten crime.</P>
    <P>It is now more difficult than ever to get insurance cover if one occupies a private flat in an inner city area.  Equally it is extremely difficult to get insurance cover on a business premises in those areas.  It all affords great scope for security consultants, the latest breed who prepare sophisticated reports on how to turn one's business premises or house into a Fort Knox.  That costs a fortune but there are always loopholes so that, even if one does become involved in such expenditure, the criminals find ways around them.  I cannot understand why the Garda Review <Col N="769" /> Group, the people concerned with crime, those in the Department of Justice and so on cannot devise adequate solutions.</P>
    <P>I am as right wing a person as one could find in this House when it comes to the matter of defeating crime but I contend it is not acceptable to allow people to go around in armed gangs, or in any other kind of groups, robbing and terrorising people in businesses, in private houses, to such an extent that people are afraid to walk a few hundred yards from bus stops at night.  The Minister contends that we should not be surprised at that, that crime has risen since 1960 and has done so in other western cities as well.  I contend that in many other European cities there is not that problem.  The Minister of State present will be well aware of the fact that people living in other European cities can walk home in safety.</P>
    <P>Recently a group of politicians visited a number of cities in the course of our travels to the other side of the world. What struck us all, including the Ceann Comhairle, was that people could walk along the streets at midnight.  I am talking about places like Malaysia, Singapore and Australia where we observed that people could walk the streets freely at night.  The suggestion that one cannot do so in this city is not a myth; it is a fact of life.  There are large sections of this city where it is sufficiently difficult to get the Garda to walk at night, although I must admit that they are back on the beat in a number of areas from which they had pulled out four or five years ago.</P>
    <P>There must be a concerted effort at rooting out the criminal gangs.  It will always be impossible to stop individuals engaging in crime at some level, but it must be acknowledged that there are well organised, dangerous groups involved in crime in this city.  They are feared by many people, by people involved in State and semi-State offices and by members of the Garda.  Equally it is difficult to obtain sufficient hard evidence to put them behind bars.  Deputies on all sides of the House should engage in a campaign to break that spiral once and for all, rather than engage in shameful exercises such as the passage of the Criminal <Col N="770" /> Justice Bill, some of whose provisions have been implemented for six years now while others have never been implemented. It should be remembered that the bail scandal has been eliminated as have some of the other anomalies abused by criminals in this city.  Other provisions are badly in need of implementation.</P>
    <P>When the Criminal Justice Bill was being debated it was always my view that the amendments proposed were not sufficiently tough.  I suppose always one has to reach a compromise but it appears we have been suffering ever since because we were not sufficiently forceful at that time.  One wonders did some of the more liberal Deputies who spoke on that Bill ever speak to old people who have been robbed or mugged.  For example, a man died of a heart attack last week only days after he had been mugged.  Probably nobody will ever prove whether his death was related to that incident.  That has happened many times in the inner city and other areas as well.  A review must be carried out of Garda operations in the city, of their resources, indeed the will of the courts and of this House to tackle the problem properly.</P>
    <P>We should not be playing with the fact that in 1982-83, when heroin was freely available in several parts of the city, our crime level shot up to 100 points and because it has now dropped to 90 points we all claim an apportionate decrease. That is statistical nonsense that fools nobody.  The public are prepared to pay taxes to ensure they can walk the streets of the city, that their families can sleep in peace and that their property is safe at night.</P>
    <P>The neighbourhood watch and other schemes are to be welcomed.  Both Deputy Woods and Deputy Lyons have said that the neighbourhood watch scheme is potentially very successful if only the necessary resources were allocated. Some areas most in need of a neighbourhood watch scheme have none because there is more manpower needed. There was a meeting held recently in a block of flats in the inner city area &mdash; I know that the people living there would not mind my saying it is in the Dublin 7 <Col N="771" /> area, which has had more than its fair share of criminals from within and without &mdash; at which a Chief Superintendent of the Garda said they were patrolling that block of flats, that a garda walks through every evening at 8 o'clock and another at midnight.  One might as well send up one's grandmother's aunt as do that.</P>
    <P>If we are in earnest about beating the crime, thuggery and gangsterism, as strong in Dublin today as at any time over the last seven to eight years, there must be gardaí regularly on the beat and seen to be on the beat regardless of cost. Surely it would be better to spend £30 million or £40 million annually on more gardaí on the beat than have them sitting in offices in, say, Dublin Castle waiting to hear of a robbery and all charge at that point.  That is like Fossett's Circus. Would it not be better to expend that money on crime prevention?</P>
    <P>Again, our laws with regard to stolen property are known by everybody.  The Garda know better than anybody else how stolen property is disposed of in this city.  The same people are involved in selling stolen property as were involved two, three or five years ago.  Yet we have failed utterly to deal with the problem.  I suppose, to be fair, it could be said that when Fianna Fáil are on that side of the House again the same debate will take place.  But one must ask: why does a Minister come into the House and talk so pathetically about all the good things we have done to combat crime?  Why does he not come clean and acknowledge that there is a major problem obtaining, that our courts system does not withstand the demands made on it, that there are too many gardaí tied up in court cases, too many gardaí engaged in clerical duties, too few gardaí able to cope with the problem because they have not sufficient squad cars or motorcycles in the city, that there is insufficient money available for Garda overtime?  Indeed, it could be said that insurance companies are merely pumping up security firms while doing nothing to defeat crime.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="772" /> People in this city are terrorised, frightened out of their wits.  After dark, old people barricade their doors with bars, buckets, rocks and this is not in one or two instances.</P>
    <P>Debate adjourned.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 20, between lines 32 and 33, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2)  An order under this section shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after it is made and, if a resolution annulling the order is passed by either such House within the next twenty-one days on which that House has sat after the order is laid before it, the order shall be annulled accordingly but without prejudice to the validity of anything previously done thereunder.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is a drafting amendment in response to comments made by Deputy Flynn in regard to the process by which orders are laid before the House.  It was theoretically not necessary, but because of the points made by Deputy Flynn it was felt that we could include the specific reference to the process by which an order can be laid before the House in deference to the due process.</P>

      <P>I am pleased that the Minister found it possible to accommodate me in this matter.  The old section 23, now <Col N="773" /> section 24 in the amended Bill following Committee Stage, was one section about which I was particularly unhappy.  It gave the Minister all-embracing powers which would not be regarded as normal.  I was trying to protect the Minister from himself or from others who might subsequently take his place, which is why I asked that the section be amended.  The Minister has gone quite some way to accommodate me.  I take it that the full effect of the amendment is that any order made under this or any other section of the Bill will have to come before the House.  If it is challenged in the House and subsequently defeated, it will be annulled forthwith.  I take it that the Minister has a mandate to make the orders and have them lodged in the Library, rather than doing it without giving notice to the House.  I am happy that the Minister finds it necessary at this time, even if only to accommodate me.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="774" /> I should like to say a few words on matters which have been raised on Second Stage and particularly on Committee Stage.  A number of points arose on Committee Stage which I wanted to look at.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister may be aware, he is confined to what is in the Bill and not what might have been put into it, or could not have been put into it.  He must speak about what is in the Bill only.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>It is my intention to deal specifically with the parameters of the Bill and not to go outside them.  The first of the points which arose on Committee Stage concerned the amendment in section 2 (1) (a), changing the wording &ldquo;a company not trading for profit&rdquo; to &ldquo;a company not trading for the acquisition of gain by the members&rdquo;.  This was a point raised by Deputy Flynn at quite some length.</P>
      <P>The purpose of section 2 (1) (a), in either form of words, is to exclude from the detailed accounting requirements of the Bill those companies of a strictly noncommercial character who incorporate as companies merely as a convenient way in which to conduct their operations.</P>
      <P>There are many such companies.  Very often they apply under section 24 of the 1963 Act for a licence from the Minister to drop the word limited from their names.  I gave a few names of such companies when we discussed the Bill.  The sort of bodies involved cover associations promoting social, educational, cultural, charitable, religious, and other like objectives.  Good examples taken from a list of such companies which I have here and which I am quite happy to give the Deputy, if he so wishes&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall give some examples from the list.  They include the <Col N="776" /> Limerick Handicapped Children Committee, Dún Laoghaire Old Folks' Association, Irish Heart Foundation, Catholic Housing Aid Society, Irish Epilepsy Association, Dublin Simon Community, the West Finglas Tenants' Association, Cumann Lucht Capaillíní Chonamara.  I could go on.</P>
      <P>It is hardly the intention of this House to subject such entities to the rigours of this Bill.  However, under the terms of section 2 (1) (a), as previously worded, this could have happened.  Such bodies may indeed technically make a profit from, say, fund raising activities, or events run by them, but such profits would be applied by them in aid of their objectives; individual members would not profit.  This allows these bodies to make theoretical profits, but the definition which excludes them is that such theoretical profits are not to be to the gain of members.  I am sure that the Deputy will agree that that is a more comprehensive definition which would not allow for difficulties.</P>
      <P>This gain can accrue through the distribution of dividends, to use the old wording, through capital gain, or through gain in any surplus in the break-up of assets on liquidation.  This cannot now happen under the new definition.  Some Deputies felt the revised wording would allow for commercial companies to be set up to abuse section 2 (1) (a) to gain exemption. I do not see that happening as I am happy that the wording of the section is flexible enough to defeat such schemes.  Certainly, the Registrar of Companies is in no doubt as to the genuine companies who can be allowed to benefit from section 2 (1) (a).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Flynn asked how many religious companies would be exempted by section 2 (1) (b).  The answer is, not more than 60.  I phrase it this way because there is a doubt about the precise status of a number of them which could only be settled by a rather time-consuming inspection of their activities.  This was not felt warranted since the Deputy only wanted a rough figure.  However, when it comes to gaining the benefit of section <Col N="777" /> 2 (1) (b) any such concerns will have to satisfy the Registrar of their status.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flynn also raised the question of whether it was necessary in section 7 (1) (a) to refer not only to sections 3, 4 and 5 but also to section 6.  I gave as my view that since section 5 is subject to section 6, and expressed to be so in the wording of section 5, it was not necessary to have a special reference to section 6 as sought by Deputy Flynn.  The draftsman, who has been consulted, considers my view to be correct.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also asked about the procedures for translating foreign documents into English or Irish when filing with the Registrar.  I would like to point out that the procedure is set out quite clearly in the Companies (Forms) Order, 1964 (S.I. 45 of 1964) in regulation 6 as follows:</P>
    <P>A translation of a charter, statutes or memorandum and articles of association, or other instrument constituting or defining the constitution of a company, or any account or other document to be delivered to the registrar under the Act shall be certified to be a correct translation&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  if made outside the State, by an Irish diplomatic or consular officer, or by any person whom any such officer certifies to be known to him as competent to translate it into the Irish or English language,</P>
    <P>(b)  if made within the State, by a notary public or a solicitor.</P>
    <P>In so far as the filing of accounts in Irish is concerned, the Registrar assures me that the facilities are there to enable companies to do so if they wish, without the requirement of transmission into another language.</P>
    <P>Finally, Deputy Flynn suggested that there was some room to play around with certain provisions on disclosure of information by leaving this to the directors, and that there was scope in extending the exemptions by devising new corporate structures.  Reference was also made to the position in Germany regarding the <Col N="778" /> limited partnership form of company not covered by the German Fourth Directive law, the GMBH &amp; Co. KG type company. The position simply is that there is little scope for the &ldquo;creativity&rdquo; suggested. In fact the Commission have acted just recently on 30 April last in proposing an amendment to the Fourth Directive to include limited partnerships, including the GMBH &amp; Company KG.  There is a draft proposal, therefore, under discussion which it is supposed will include ordinary partnerships and unlimited companies, a proposal I certainly would not support and I am sure neither could Deputy Flynn.  The point is, however, that Brussels is watching what we are doing in relation to limited companies. The GMBH case is perhaps the nearest problem which exists of an entity which is a limited company while not so named.</P>
    <P>I have put down a number of amendments which have already been conceded by the House.  I have tried to respond to the points made by Deputy Flynn.  I am very grateful for his assiduous attention to the Bill and for his most constructive and helpful contributions both on Second Stage and particularly on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to query some items that the Minister of State has referred to and also to pose him a few further clarifications which, while he may not be in a position to deal with this evening, he might very well take the opportunity of doing so in the Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First of all, I would like to make reference to page 2 of his script this evening where he refers to profits being made by individual members of a particular company and the fact that there is a wider definition being put forward in so far as the liabilities of a company are concerned. The difficulty with this, I would suggest, is that what the Minister of State's script says has no authority in law. Regrettably, when these matters come to be tested in the courts subsequently, barristers and legal people make reference to statements made by Ministers in this House in support of positions being taken.  This has no weight of law and <Col N="779" /> is usually struck out in that the actual wording as laid out in the directive or in the Act of Parliament, as it will be after the President signs it, is the one that carries the weight.  While the Minister of State made a distinction and given a wider definition to what is intended under this legislation, which is welcomed by me, regrettably it will not carry any weight outside of this Chamber.  Perhaps, the Minister of State might take the opportunity in the Seanad to widen the scope or to amend the section so as to provide for the intention which he has expressed here this evening.</P>
    <P>While the Minister of State might wish the Registrar to take a liberal view or take a particular view in any one set of circumstances that, in effect, also has no force of law and it will be for the Registrar to carry out the instructions as they are exactly laid down in the legislation.  I would like, if I may&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I missed the last point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>It purely means that the Registrar at this time is not in a position to implement the legislation as it exists at present.  I do not think he is going to be able to do it when the new legislation comes in.  Certainly, the Minister of State in his speech is giving him a certain flexibility in dealing with certain types of companies who might be claiming exemptions under the new legislation.  He is not entitled to that.  He will have to take it exactly as he finds it in the legislation which the Minister of State is now promoting.  If there is a change to be made and a wider definition to be entertained, then the Minister of State might consider referring to it again in the Seanad by way of an amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to refer the Minister of State back to section 16 of the Bill as published and not the amended Bill after Committee Stage.  I would like clarification on that section where a company controls the composition of the board of directors or holds more than half of the equity share capital of another company. <Col N="780" /> Under section 16 of the Bill the holding company must publish details of its shareholding in the subsidiary along with accumulated reserves and the profit and loss account of the subsidiary.  What I am anxious about is this.  Does this obligation to publish apply where the control is indirect, that is, where the control is through the medium of a number of subsidiaries? Perhaps, the Minister of State might be in a position to clarify that, if not now, then at a later stage.</P>
    <P>I would also like to make particular reference to chapter 34, page 39 of the originally published document.  I have not cross-checked it against the amended Bill but I will make reference to it at chapter 34, subsections (1) (c) and (d) where details of indebtedness are required.  The Fourth Directive, and in particular the UK Act implementing the directive into British law, required details of secured debt and security given by the company whereas the Bill as drafted by the Minister of State requires details of the security from whatever quarter it is given.  Thus, the situation could arise where the company which has debts secured by a third party would be required under the Act to give details of that security whereas such details are not required either under the Fourth Directive or under the UK Act.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that the Minister of State is disadvantaging companies as against their competitors and counterparts in the UK.  We could take a situation where a company have given a mortgage over a property owned by the company to secure a debt and where they have given further security such as a guarantee by the proprietor or by some other third party.  Normally one would not have to refer to the third party security in the accounts and such a reference is not required under the UK Act or under the Fourth Directive.  In conformity with what the thrust of what the Minister has been attempting to do here, we should not be disadvantaged as against the UK Act.  Perhaps it needs clarification or an amendment of chapter 34 when it comes before the Seanad.</P>
    <P>I presume the reason the Minister did <Col N="781" /> not refer to the implementation date is that he still has not finalised his attitude on the matter.  Strong representations have been made to the Minister not just in the House but also by the accountancy bodies and others.  I reiterate that representation in the hope that I could persuade the Minister to consider small companies because they do not have the expertise, the experience and the office plant to deal with what is required under this legislation which is a very detailed breakdown of their business.  Whether the companies are small or major they are still required to make quite a lot of disclosures.  They have to accommodate themselves to new accounting practices. Even though most accounting practices have been in place for some time, it has to be understood that they are involved in new arrangements.</P>
    <P>There is an expense involved which could be minimised by having a gestation period of not less than 18 months.  This was originally intended under the directive to allow companies to gear up both financially and administratively in order to deal with the demands of the legislation. It is not unreasonable to give 18 months before the implementation date as we are not the most tardy of the EC countries to take on board international legislation.  The Minister did not give any undertaking in that regard either on Second Stage or Committee Stage.  I can only deduce from that that he is favourably disposed towards my recommendation on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Once again I ask the Minister to confirm publicly tonight or at an early date that the publishing requirements of the Act will only apply to accounting periods commencing on or after 1 January 1987.  That would be only fair.  This year the Minister could compare the accounting practices with those of last year rather than getting people to make a complete reappraisal and re-assessment of their 1986 figures in order to accommodate him.  If he now gives the indication that the implementation date is 1 January 1987, they can bring into operation the new arrangements and we weed out all the difficulties and the mistakes.  It would <Col N="782" /> be better to have the mistakes teased out now in the gestation period rather than to have the registrar send back the whole file for re-examination on an ongoing basis.</P>
    <P>I was rather amused by the Minister's reference to the fact that Brussels is watching us.  Brussels is always watching us.  We seem to be very concerned about what they think about us in Brussels.  We can be over-concerned.  Other countries have not been as accommodating to Brussels as we have.  The Minister should not go overboard in implementing legislation to accommodate EC directives that come from ideologies and political systems far removed from our traditions.  Other countries have adopted a <i>laissez-faire</i> attitude towards the implementation of this legislation.  They adopted the rather dubious formula of partial implementation, but we decided to take it on board holus bolus.  While the Minister took on board most of the exemptions permissible under the directive, at the same time there were certain areas where he could have been more generous in his attitude. If Brussels thought that we were dis-honouring the spirit or the word of the directive so what?  This legislation is only applicable to Irish companies.</P>
    <P>As we know thousands of these companies have gone into liquidation or had receivers appointed over the past few years.  All the major companies have no difficulty with this.  Their accounting practices and machinery are well capable of taking on board this matter it they had to.  As the Minister knows, accountancy offices in this town have been burning the midnight oil changing status for all these companies who have the financial wizardry and the financial muscle to accommodate the change.  They changed their status so they will not be laden with any difficulty under this legislation, but the small company will be.  It will have a debilitating effect on some companies. Regrettably, if it is applied rigidly, as the Minister indicated it will be, then it could result in some job losses in industries where strategic information will be made available through the disclosure measures as outlined in this legislation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="783" /> I ask the Minister, as I asked the former Minister, to consider the question of the new style companies of incorporation such as the proprietary companies. While he did not give it the complete bucket of cold water, he certainly gave it a fair douse of it.  I know that Minister of State would not be averse to creating a big name for himself in the world of commerce by taking this on board.  I will not tease him about it.  When the Minister is considering this matter in the Seanad he should have a little concern for the thousands of small Irish companies, the bedrock of Irish commercial society, who could benefit enormously if he created a new form of incorporation that would not involve them in the very wide-ranging disclosures that exist in this legislation. I know the Minister will say that the provisions of this directive are mandatory on us and that they are not negotiable in any way.  They are negotiable.</P>
    <P>After the next Government come into office I will be making strong representations to them, when the next review comes up under the directive in 1988, to insist on a much wider threshold as far as the exemptions are concerned so that virtually all companies, except the very large private and public companies, can be brought under the small category as outlined in the directive.  I know this will have a very big impact on financial reporting. It is very far-reaching in its consequences on business.  There is no question that it will require a lot of retraining of administrative staff to evaluate the impact in the first instance and to implement it afterwards.</P>
    <P>Information is the most valuable resource a company can have, and to have it laid bare so that it can be poached by industrial creditors or competitors is a serious disadvantage.  I have no doubt that many companies will be seeking to invoke the exclusion clause if they discover that disclosure would injure them seriously.</P>
    <P>We must do nothing to alarm business or reduce the possibilities of getting companies <Col N="784" /> in there to invest, particularly US companies in the hi-tech industry, particularly in chemicals and pharmaceuticals. I am sure they will be determined that they will be constituted as branches so as not to have to comply with disclosure regulations.  If they were to disclose their turnover and analyses of all their business dealings, they would be open to poaching by their competitors.  They will look for time and therefore I hope a long gestation period will be given so that if they need to exclude themselves they will be given an adequate opportunity to do so.</P>
    <P>This legislation will be seen hereafter as a body blow to Irish commercial development and the Minister now in the House will long be remembered for section 13 of the original Bill as published. That section was an &ldquo;Open Sesame&rdquo; for disclosure.  I admit that the European Court would have taken some delight in bringing us to heel in that regard, and I wish they would be as active in following up other non-conforming countries.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister seriously to give as much time as possible before implementation so that the business community can adjust and make any changes necessary. This legislation is very far reaching and means a fundamental change in company law and limited liability status and I forecast that one day we will regret passing it.  However, we have no alternative to complying with EC law.</P>

      <P>I should like to respond to some of the fair points made by Deputy Flynn.  I would point out that it is the words in the Bill that will have the force of law, and I am quite satisfied in relation to the meaning of section 2 (1) (a), dealing with companies not trading for the acquisition of gain by members.  I am sure it will be interpreted in the courts not as a wish expressed by the Minister speaking here in a debate but as the law as written.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister consider <Col N="785" /> amending it to read that any profit made by any company would be interpreted in a certain way?  Would he consider that between now and the Bill's introduction in the Seanad?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The words in the Act when it becomes law will be quite clear and will be so interpreted in the courts. I am satisfied that the definition now in the Bill is quite clear and unambiguous. In regard to the registrar, I disagree with the Deputy's suggestion that he will not be in a position to implement the law.  He will have to interpret the law as it is presented to him under the various company Acts of which this Bill is about to become part.  Those Acts give the registrar the right to interpret and to have recourse to the courts.  He would use these rights in a judicial and sensible manner.</P>
      <P>Section 16 refers to the holding companies. It goes back to the 1963 Act, section 155 (2), which defines clearly in law the matter raised by the Deputy, in particular in relation to his point about directors of subsidiaries.  Subsection (3) of that section defines the position when one company is a subsidiary.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to third party debt, the provisions being made concur with the 1981 United Kingdom Act dealing with companies. This is referred to in Part 3 of <Col N="786" /> the First Schedule, paragraph 48, subparagraph (4) which states that in respect of each item shown in a company's balance sheet there shall be stated the aggregate amount of any debts disputed in respect of which security has been given and an indication of the nature of the security so given.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>My understanding is that this would require that third parties would have to be included in sub-paragraph (4) (b).  With regard to the implementation date, it is unfair of the Deputy to say that we are in the vanguard in implementation of this directive.  I understand that to date Belgium, Denmark, France, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom have adopted national legislation implementing the Fourth Directive.  That, in addition to the fact that at the moment we are before the court on an indictment for not implementing the directive, indicates that we have been somewhat tardy in implementing it.  I cannot agree with the Deputy in what he has said.  Apart from Spain and Portugal who have just joined the Community, the other countries concerned are Greece and Italy and the latter have been condemned by the court for failure to implement the Fourth Directive.  I cannot agree with the Deputy when he says we are ahead of the posse with regard to implementation of the directive.  We are not and we are now before the European Court of Justice for failure to do that.</P>

      <P>During 1985 two posts of civilian driver were attached to the Office of Deputy Ted Nealon, Minister of State for Arts and Culture at a total salary cost of £20,543.18.  Expenses <Col N="583" /> amounting to £5,515.05 were paid to drivers, and the mileage allowance paid to the Minister of State during this period amounted to £16,730.95 in respect of his car.</P>
      <P>Minister of State, Deputy Seán Barrett had the use of a State car in his capacity as Government Chief Whip and the Minister of State for Women's Affairs, Deputy Nuala Fennell, used her own car, rather than employing drivers, and received mileage allowances of £4,626 during 1985.  Occasionally, Deputy Fennell, availed of the use of a State car for official purposes and the estimated cost of this in 1985 was £2,500.</P>
      <P>If Ministers of State had been provided with official cars and Garda drivers the estimated cost in 1985 would have been on average £84,000 per user.  The operation of the alternative scheme in my Department whereby Ministers of State use their own cars and employ civilian drivers has resulted in savings of £118,084.82 for 1985.  The overall savings accruing from the operaition of the alternative scheme in 1985 for all Departments is £550,500.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> As the Deputy will be aware, I am the regulatory authority for the insurance industry and my primary responsibility is to ensure the solvency of the insurance companies operating in the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware of the high cost of public liability insurance and the difficulties many companies face because of these costs.  This situation has evolved from the <Col N="590" /> heavy losses experienced by insurance companies on their liability accounts &mdash; losses which in 1983 amounted to nearly £36 million on an income of £52 million. Faced with losses of this magnitude insurers have increased premium rates generally, and have become increasingly cautious about the type of risk they will accept.</P>
    <P>The high cost of liability insurance is directly related to the high cost of claims. The Government is taking action on a number of fronts to reduce the number and cost of claims.  The Minister for Labour has established a board to promote better safety practices in the work-place. Fewer accidents will, of course, result in fewer claims.</P>
    <P>In addition the present jury system of determining awards has given rise to excessive and unpredictable awards, leading ultimately to increased premium costs.  The Government recently announced its decision that in future High Court actions for personal injuries arising from negligence will be decided by a judge sitting alone without a jury.  The Minister for Justice has published a Bill to give effect to this decision.</P>
    <P>Arising from the difficulties in the market at the present time, I have made an arrangement with the Irish Insurance Federation whereby any company which is having difficulty in obtaining a quotation, may have its case referred to the federation.</P>
    <P>I am hopeful that these measures and others under consideration at present will lead to stabilisation in claims costs and easier market conditions.</P>

      <P>Generally, ownership of vehicles can be identified by reference to vehicle registration numbers.  However, where a person disposing of a vehicle delays or fails to submit the statutory transfer of registered ownership form to the appropriate motor taxation office, the local authority's records will not reflect the true position in relation to ownership of the vehicle.  Also, on extremely rare occasions, the relevant particulars could be incorrectly recorded; where this occurs, every effort is made to correct the error immediately.</P>

      <P>In the 1985 Road Plan, this scheme is scheduled to commence in 1987.  On 6 May 1986, I approved the local authority's outline plans for the scheme.  This approval, which is without prejudice to any statutory procedures that may arise, enables the local authority to proceed with the detailed planning of the route and to initiate procedures for the acquisition of the land needed to implement the scheme.  Subject to the outcome of any such statutory procedures, the target commencement date can be achieved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The cost of the scheme will be met in full by my Department.  To date, road grant commitments totalling £1 million, including £500,000 in the current year, have been notified to the local authority to meet preliminary costs arising on the scheme.  I am concerned to get this scheme underway as soon as possible and am pressing for accelerated target dates for each of the remaining planning stages. The scheme will form part of the vitally important ring road around Dublin.  I <Col N="603" /> recently announced that all sections of this ring road are expected to be in construction, as targeted, by 1988.  The current estimated construction costs for the entire project is £120 million approximately.</P>

      <P>The actions of certain bodies (such as vocational education committees) are excluded from investigation under the Second Schedule of the Ombudsman Act, 1980.

      <P>The provision of a suitable road system constitutes part of the ongoing forestry operations of the Forest and Wildlife Service of my Department.  The programme involves firstly the provision of the necessary roading to facilitate the management of newly planted areas in their formative years, secondly the provision of access roads for harvesting and extraction of timber from plantations and thirdly maintaining and up-grading forest roads as required until all thinning cycles have been completed and the crops clearfelled.  All roads are designed to carry the maximum load consistent with the conditions obtaining in the relevant sites.</P>

      <P>On the tourism side, while it is difficult to measure precisely the impact of tourism expenditure on job creation, it is estimated that over the period in question the number of jobs dependent on such expenditure by the State was of the order of 88,000 a year.</P>
      <P>As regards fisheries, the main programmes aided or financed directly by my Department which contributed to productive employment during the period referred to were schemes for fishery harbour development and improvement, the construction and modernisation of fishing boats, fish processing projects, aquaculture and mariculture projects, the development of inland fisheries and marketing and research projects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to forestry, in addition to the ongoing work of the forest and wildlife service on the maintenance of the existing forest estate, the principal activities of the service which contributed to productive employment were in planting, harvesting, road-making and amenity development.  During the four year period from 1982 to 1985 inclusive, approximately 27,000 ha. were planted, 4.2 million cubic metres of timber were extracted from State forests and sold, 565 <Col N="612" /> kilometres of forest roads were constructed, three forest parks were created, one new large pulpwood processing firm, which had gone into liquidation, was reopened.

      <P>A body of persons established for charitable purposes only may claim exemption from tax under the provisions of sections 333 and 334 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, in respect of income applied to those charitable purposes.  The question of whether or not a body is established for charitable purposes only is determined under general law.</P>
      <P>Claims for charity exemption for tax purposes are made to the Revenue Commissioners. The question of entitlement to such exemption is one for that administration in the first instance and for the appeal forum or the courts where an applicant might not be satisfied with the ruling at the administrative level.</P>

      <P>If the Ministers of State had been provided with official cars and Garda drivers it is estimated that the cost would have been on average £84,000 per user. Accordingly the estimated saving under the new arrangement in 1985 was in the region of £40,000.</P>

      <P>The statistics for deaths from lung cancer in recent years are set out in the following table.  The exact percentage of people who died from lung cancer who were smokers is unknown.  However, international studies would indicate that 90 per cent of those who die of lung cancer are smokers.  Cigarette smokers are on average ten times as likely to develop lung cancer as non-smokers.</P>

      <P>Directions given by the Minister for Agriculture describe the division of duties between veterinary officers of local authorities and environmental health officers in regard to the inspection of meat and meat products for the purposes of the Food Hygiene Regulations.  In accordance with these directions, environmental health officers may be assigned to assist veterinary officers and <Col N="623" /> should ordinarily supervise meat and meat products at retail outlets to ensure fitness for human consumption.  In cases of doubt the environmental health officer should consult the veterinary officer.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 101 to 104, inclusive and 106 together.  Further to my reply to a question on 15 April, 1986 and my replies to supplementary questions arising therefrom (Official Report Vol. 365 Cols. 636-640), there is one issue which I would like to clarify. During the supplementary discussion on my previous reply I may have given the impression that the HOPE Organisation received a grant of £30,000 from the Dublin Youth Services Council in respect of the year 1985 in addition to the £68,000 received in grants in 1985 from the Eastern Health Board.  The sum of £30,000 mentioned was, in fact, the total amount received in revenue grants by HOPE from agencies such as the Dublin Youth Services Council and the Department of Social Welfare over the period 1978 to 1985.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate that my Department would not be privy to information of the detailed nature sought by <Col N="626" /> him in respect of various discussions and correspondence over recent months between the council of the Hope Hostel and officials of the Eastern Health Board. In the circumstances therefore, I can only suggest that the Deputy might wish to approach the Eastern Health Board direct in these matters.</P>

He had then exhausted his 26 week entitlement to injury benefit and his claim was transferred to disability benefit.  A disability benefit claim was authorised from 17 April 1986.  However, due to an administrative error payment of benefit ceased from 19 April 1986.  Therefore, there was a delay in issuing payment for the period <Col N="627" /> from 19 April 1986 to 2 May 1986, the date of the latest medical certificate received.
