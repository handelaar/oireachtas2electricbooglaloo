      <P>May I ask the Taoiseach if it is his intention to make any statement <Col N="2" /> today or to give the House some opportunity to discuss the recent U-turn by the Government on social welfare.  It would seem the latest proposals by the Government represent their third attempt to deal with this matter of the equality directive&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>May I put it to you, a <Col N="3" /> Cheann Comhairle, that the Government, in this rather extraordinary statement last night, seemed to indicate there would be retrospection.  Such retrospection would necessarily involve legislation. Therefore, I think we can take it that legislation has at least implicitly been promised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank Deputies for the interest they have shown in the Bill.  It is important legislation which will benefit many thousands of existing and intending building society borrowers. The measures proposed are designed to deal with a number of aspects of building society operations about which there has been widespread public concern.  It also opens up to societies the prospect of at least the first step towards new powers <Col N="11" /> which may possibly be extended further in due course.  I will recall briefly once again the main areas covered by the Bill.</P>
      <P>Regulations can be made permitting new forms of lending.  Initially, societies will be enabled to provide bridging finance.  Tiered mortgage rates are to be prohibited in the case of loans taken out before 1 August to which such rates do not apply on that date.  Tiered rates will also be prohibited in the case of new loans except for a six month period from the passing of the Act.  Rules can be prescribed in relation to redemption fees, valuation reports, choice of insurer, legal costs and mortgage protection insurance.</P>
      <P>There has been a welcome for the legislation from many Deputies though some have expressed some misgivings or pointed out other areas which they consider need to be addressed.  I must reiterate what I said at the outset.  I see this Bill as simply a first step towards a wider revision of legislation affecting building societies.  Recent events must, of course, encourage me to think very hard about the nature of the further measures which should be proposed but certainly the present Bill is not, and was never intended to be, the last word on the subject.</P>
      <P>I have some difficulty in understanding the general thrust of Deputy Burke's contribution. The conclusion I had to come to was that he appeared to be very lukewarm in his support for the measures in the Bill, measures which are quite clearly designed to be beneficial to house purchasers, both those on existing mortgages and those who will in the future be seeking mortgages.  I got the impression that the Opposition were not prepared or did not want to be seen openly to oppose the measures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy sought assurances for Committee Stage that individual sections of the Bill would not result in increased mortgage repayments.  The Bill is a very carefully balanced one which provides for a number of changes; the abolition of redemption fees, production of valuation reports, giving a choice of solicitor and measures to restrict or reduce legal costs, <Col N="12" /> all of which are designed to assist the house purchaser.  The abolition of certain tiered interest rates will also be beneficial to house purchasers, bearing in mind that tiering is in many cases introduced at a level well below the amount of the average loan.  What I think is not often realised by some people is that a number of societies commence their tiered rate at £20,000 or, in the case of one major building society, £21,000.  As the House will appreciate, in the case of some of those societies virtually all the mortgages they advanced in recent years have been charged at a rate higher than the base rate prevailing.</P>
    <P>The Bill gives me the power to prescribe purposes for which loans not secured by way of first charge on property may be made by building societies.  I have already said in discussions with the societies that I would like to have their views as to how that new power would be applied.  In that context I should like to see the setting up of some representative body from whom the views of the building society movement in general could be obtained.  From the point of view of the preparation of further legislation it is important that the Government have access to a forum from which the views of various sections of the building society movement in general can be obtained in a balanced way.  There is already in legislation reference to the Irish Building Societies Association.  That association represents the four largest of the ten or so building societies in operation and from that point of view represents the societies responsible for the vast proportion of mortgage business.  On the other hand, I am anxious that the views of the smaller societies, and particularly those societies that are expanding and introducing new and interesting approaches in their operations, should be obtained as well.  There are difficulties in this regard which need to be addressed in that the association does not represent those smaller societies. In order to get a balanced approach it is important that their views should also be heard.  In that context I am pleased to say I recently had a meeting with the smaller societies who came together <Col N="13" /> under the Confederation of Irish Industry and I found that meeting very useful and informative.</P>
    <P>I referred to the balance that is provided for in the Bill.  Section 3 will give the Minister power to make regulations regarding the types of loans, whether secured or unsecured, which societies may advance.  I have already indicated here in the House and elsewhere that it is my intention to make regulations which would allow societies to make what is known as bridging finance available.  The enabling provision of the section means that if it is considered appropriate in the light of the monitoring of the operation of societies to allow them to become involved in other areas, the Minister may make regulations in that regard.  I am quite satisfied that the balance between section 3 and the additional functions which might be assigned to societies would, with the attendant revenue to the societies therefrom, more than offset any loss of income through the abolition in other sections, notably section 6, of some of the practices which are regarded as unacceptable by the general public.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer briefly to the contribution made by Deputy Yates.  It was a most interesting and thoughtful contribution which merits close study and attention.  The Deputy referred to the role of the registrars of friendly societies and commented on the powers and resources available to them.  There is no doubt the registrars have a very heavy workload.  As I previously indicated, I am considering further legislative proposals on building societies and in that context the question of supervisory arrangements will receive attention.  That will be all the more important if that legislation is to enable the societies to move into areas of the provision of further services.</P>
    <P>Deputy Yates also commented on aspects of the election procedure of societies.  That matter was referred to in the discussion documents on building societies and I will certainly look at ways in which improvements can be introduced into that area.  We are probably all in agreement that there is no doubt that <Col N="14" /> there could be improvements introduced into the method of election employed by some of the societies.</P>
    <P>However, I would like to ask the House, in the context of the remarks of Deputy Yates, to consider carefully section 10 of the Building Societies Act, 1976, and to note powers which are conferred on the Minister.  I concluded my opening statement on Second Stage of the debate by saying that, in conjunction with the making of regulations following the enactment of this Bill, I intend to use those powers in that connection.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies, including Deputies Yates, Allen, Seamus Brennan, De Rossa and McCreevy, referred to the building society management expenses and some emphasis was placed on the level of advertising.  I note that concern has been expressed from time to time on that matter.</P>
    <P>The discussion document which was published earlier this year referred to the question of whether there should be direct control imposed on the expenses of societies.  I should like to hope that in general enhanced competition and the conditions in the market place, some of the changes which will be brought about through the enactment of this Bill, and the further legislation which I have promised will result in a general improvement in that area.  In that context, however, I should, in reply to Deputies' suggestions, again refer the House to the Building Societies Act, 1976, and in particular to the powers which are vested in the Minister in section 76 of that Act.</P>
    <P>I was taken aback at the contribution made by Deputy Noel Treacy because he seems to be opposed to just about every part and section of the Bill.  I find it extraordinary that Members of the House could find in this legislation nothing that appealed to them or which seemed to them to be in the interests of their constituents. I certainly do not think that was the general view of Deputies who spoke. Neither does it seem to represent the view of many other people who have expressed an interest in this area.  For example, the Deputy suggested that <Col N="15" /> redemption fees were necessary in order to prevent borrowers from switching their loans to other institutions.  My reason for setting out to give the Minister power to prohibit the practice of charging redemption fees is that from the point of view of the individual borrower and the general public that is an inherently unfair charge.  I can see no merit in the case argued by the Deputy.</P>
    <P>Deputy Wilson expressed the hope that the societies would find it possible when they were allowed to make bridging finance available to charge a rate for that finance which would not be far in excess of the mortgage rate.  I share that hope and have noted the comment of the Irish Building Societies' Association in a submission to me some months ago in which they said: &ldquo;There is no reason why this finance should not be offered within the building society system and at a substantial cost saving to the home buyer.&rdquo; In proposing to allow the societies to provide this type of finance following the enactment of this Bill, I am more than hopeful to do so on the basis which promoted that part of their submission.  I am sure the House and the public will watch with interest how the societies approach that new area.</P>
    <P>I thank Deputies generally for the welcome which the Bill has been given and for the variety of points which they made regarding other matters which are not addressed specifically in this legislation. As I have said several times, I can assure the House that my intention is to return to the House with further legislative proposals on building societies as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The question of addressing legislation in this area is quite difficult.  A debate has been ongoing for some time regarding the activities of building societies and the need perhaps for redefinition of their role.  There is no doubt that societies have changed very much in the scale and type of their operations from the time when the building society movement originally set out and many of them are now very large and they are essentially financial institutions.  From that point of view the <Col N="16" /> further legislation will need to examine what precisely should be the future role of the building society movement.</P>
    <P>Other things are happening also which I referred to at the outset of my contribution in this debate.  There is the draft EC directive which I suspect will not come into force for some years but other moves are afoot at EC level which may bring about greater access to markets at an earlier date.</P>
    <P>The change in the British legislation from a relatively early date will allow British societies to establish abroad and that brings with it the possibility that some of them may seek to establish here. There is increased competition in the marketplace and within the existing Irish market there is evidence of growing interest on the part of the banks becoming involved in the provision of home loans.  The example in the neighbouring island in recent years has shown that increased competition by other financial institutions into the home loans market has brought about radical changes, all of which have resulted in a better package and range of measures being offered to the borrower at more attractive prices.  I had hoped it might have been possible for some of those changes to have been introduced into Irish conditions either by the building society movement acting collectively or through individual societies leading the way in that regard, but that has not happened and, partly for this reason, some of the provisions in this Bill are now being introduced.  However, it is of fundamental importance, bearing in mind the proportion of home loans that are funded and provided by building societies, that we wet out to ensure that the building society movement is examined carefully and is provided with legislation and with controls to ensure it can continue to play a positive and important part in helping towards the very high aspirations of Irish people towards home ownership.</P>
    <P>Naturally, when new proposals of this nature are introduced they are of particular interest to the principal persons involved in that area.  As the House will know, in relation to much legislation the <Col N="17" /> interest groups involved will express their views, sometimes very forcefully, and that is as it should be.  It is an important part of our democratic process that people who have views or involvement in relation to legislative matters should be able to express those views publicly whether they are critical or not of the proposals.</P>
    <P>In conclusion let me say, however, I have been dismayed that in recent days part of the response in relation to this Bill has been translated into personal vilification of me and untrue accounts of meetings which I had with the Irish Building Societies Association.  I regret that that unhappy element should have been introduced into the debate &mdash; not in this House I hasten to say &mdash; and I feel it incumbent on me to refer to it in passing. I wish to say that in my continued consideration of this and the further legislation I do not intend to allow that campaign of vilification to influence me in any way in my approach or the approach of the Government towards the introduction of orderly and progressive legislation regarding the future operations of the building society movement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. J. O'Keeffe)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the following Order in draft:</P>
      <P>Trustee (Authorised Investments) Order, 1986,</P>
      <P>a copy of which Order in draft was laid before the House on 14 October 1986.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="18" /> The purpose of the draft order before the House is to amend the list of investments in which trustees may invest funds, unless expressly forbidden by the instrument, if any, which creates the trust. The order is made under the Trustee (Authorised Investments) Act, 1958.  The principal purpose of this legislation is to protect the beneficiaries of trusts by offering a range of suitable investments. Although a trust deed may specify wider powers of investment on the trustees, many trusts and analogous funds are confined to investments authorised under the Act.</P>
    <P>Under Section 2 of the Act the Minister for Finance is empowered to amend the list of authorised trustee investments by order.  A draft of the order must be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas and a motion of approval of the draft must be passed by each House.  The list is kept under review and changes are proposed when appropriate.  The latest amendment was made in July 1985.</P>
    <P>I ask the House now to approve a draft order adding three new investments to the list, namely investment in interest-bearing deposit accounts with two banks &mdash; Ansbacher &amp; Company Limited and Smurfit Paribas Bank Limited &mdash; as well as investment in units of Bank of Ireland Gilt and Bond Fund.  The draft order also proposes the deletion of investment in interest-bearing deposit accounts with Royal Trust Company (Ireland) Limited from the list, as the company are no longer engaged in banking operations.</P>
    <P>I will deal first with the additions.  The two banks, Ansbacher and Smurfit Paribas, have been recommended for trustee status by the Central Bank.  In recommending any bank for such status the Central Bank takes into account the standing of the bank, its capital levels and its record of compliance with Central Bank licensing and supervisory requirements. The institution must also have gross assets and gross domestic assets in excess of £25 million.</P>
    <P>The Bank of Ireland Gilt and Bond Fund invests only in securities which are <Col N="19" /> themselves authorised for trustee investments, namely Government fixed interest securities.  The managers of the fund have confirmed this policy and I am satisfied that units of the fund are a suitable investment for trustees.</P>
    <P>The deletion of interest-bearing deposit accounts with Royal Trust Company (Ireland) Limited is appropriate as the company, formerly Royal Trust Bank (Ireland) Limited no longer holds a banking licence.  Although the bank was both profitable and unquestionably solvent, the parent company, Royal Trust the Canadian Trust company, decided in 1983 that the subsidiary should be wound down as part of a rationalisation scheme. The winding-up process is now virtually complete with no loss of funds to depositors or other creditors.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance is obliged to consult with the following persons in regard to the terms of any order he proposes to make under the Act: a judge of the High Court nominated by the Chief Justice, the Governor of the Central Bank, the Public Trustee, the Chairman of the Irish Banks' Standing Committee, the President of the Incorporated Law Society of Ireland and the President of the Stock Exchange-Irish.  These statutory referees have all been consulted and no objections have been raised to the amendment of the list.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied the proposed deletion and the three additions to the list are appropriate.  The additions will expand the investment options available for trust funds and will facilitate the operations of trustees, solicitors, accountants, the courts and others bound by this legislation. I, therefore, commend the motion for approval by the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>We are happy to support the motion to extend the list of authorised trust banks to include the two nominated banks in this instance.  I will make some comments in relation to the nature of the authorised trustee accounts and the type of deposit holders who will be affected by this order.  As the House is aware, all court funds have to be lodged <Col N="20" /> in authorised trusts as set out under this order.  That includes a very wide variety of people whom the law has a special obligation to protect.  I refer particularly to wards of court, people who have been deemed incapable of looking after their own interests because they are of unsound mind and to infants who have been awarded court decrees sometimes for very substantial sums.  The funds that accrue to these people from court decrees or settlements have to be lodged in the authorised trust accounts by the President of the High Court or those acting on their behalf.  The courts have no option but to place the accounts accruing to the benefit of these people into one or other of the authorised trust funds.  That is as it should be because, as the Minister has indicated, the procedures applied before a bank is included in an authorised trust fund are very comprehensive to ensure the protection of the funds lodged in court for people incapable of managing their own affairs.  Having ensured the protection of these funds by introducing this order, the Government, are making a savage attack on the funds, with the deposit interest retention tax.  It is not known widely outside this House that money lodged for the benefit of wards of court, infants and people who are generally recognised as being under a special disadvantage&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I do not think anyone here or elsewhere would make that suggestion.  However, if people are obliged to place money on deposit in these trust funds which, by definition, are liable to DIRT, then the very people for whom we have made laws to protect will have their basic income reduced as a consequence of interest deductions.  Funds placed on deposit for the categories to whom I have referred should be exempt from deposit interest retention tax.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Government will take due note of that and, in considering the case I made, perhaps they will consult with the officers of the wards of court, the office of the President of the High Court and anyone else who has responsibility for looking after disadvantaged people.  They should ask how they see the application of this tax to funds placed on deposit in authorised trust funds.  I hope the Minister will engage in such consultations because we are very anxious to ensure the status of these trust funds and to ensure that the position of those who are obliged to place their funds on deposit with them will not be undermined or attacked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We welcome the fact that two new <Col N="23" /> banks are being added to the list.  One, the Smurfit Paribas Bank Limited, has a very significant place in the whole role of Irish business.  Ansbacher and Company Limited are a foreign bank with an established record here also.  The whole scope of financial institutions for attracting deposits is a matter of major consequence for us but, unfortunately, it is not yielding the dividends it should.  Some of those already on this list are pursuing their major banking programmes outside the country.  I welcome the fact that Smurfit are big and mature enough to operate successfully elsewhere but I would welcome it even more if the conditions for investment and deposit-taking in this country were more attractive than they are at present.</P>
    <P>We are concerned to create a role for financial institutions in which they can develop having regard to the fact that they are the base of the whole commercial enterprise in this country.  Unfortunately, in view of the DIRT, the climate is not as healthy as it should be. Interest rates recently have risen to an all-time high rate, in real terms well over 13 per cent.  This is a direct consequence of the Government soaking up the limited amount of money available for investment for deposit.  Government gilts offer a return of something over 13 per cent and they are not subject to the tax I mentioned.  Demand for the limited money supply is pushing up interest rates here which is creating critical problems for every level of commercial activity. It affects farmers, business people and mortgage holders&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make the point that while we welcome the fact that two new banks are being added to the list, I am quite satisfied that in a reasonable climate for investment, especially for deposit holding in our financial institutions, the Minister would not be just adding two to the list but perhaps 12.  We <Col N="24" /> should be attracting much more investment in financial institutions in this country, as it could and should become a major centre for financial services.  We have very considerable advantages as we are in the same time zone as London. We have a very sophisticated level of knowledge and capacity in our financial institutions, finance houses and banking institutions which, when tested elsewhere, is recognised to be not just among the best but the very best.  There is great scope for developing this huge sector in the economy but the Government through their policies are doing quite the opposite and are erecting a major barrier against it.</P>
      <P>Those are the only two points I want to make.  In accepting and adopting this proposal from the Minister I wish to stress that the two points are of major importance. In relation to my first point, I urge the Minister to engage in immediate consultations to ensure that that section of society, decreed by law to be especially disadvantaged and requiring the protection of the courts for their income and property, should not be subject to DIRT on the money they are obliged to place in funds as laid down by the courts.  If he engages in such consultations perhaps we could re-establish the protection which has always existed for disadvantaged sectors in society.  Subject to that, we support the proposal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. J. O'Keeffe)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad this proposal has the support of the Opposition. I will reply to points made by Deputy O'Kennedy.  He displays a fundamental lack of knowledge about the operation of trustee accounts because the normal procedure in relation to trust funds and those held under the protection of the courts is that on a long-term basis they are invested in Government gilts. The list of trustee authorised investments inclues all securities of the Government, securities guaranteed as to capital and interest by the Minister for Finance, the stock of the Bank of Ireland, the securities of the ESB and Bord na Móna etc.  Therefore, there is a very wide and <Col N="25" /> comprehensive list available and authorised under the Act.  Obviously, for anybody making medium to long term investments in gilts or for someone who has the authority to do so on behalf of others, such as a trustee, that is the area in which they normally will invest their funds.  I appreciate why Deputy O'Kennedy wants to drag in the retention tax at every opportunity but it is entirely irrelevant to the situation.</P>

The list includes interest bearing deposit accounts with a very wide range of banks.

      <P>Perhaps, there is a difference between the experience of someone who is a former solicitor who dealt with the cold face of these things as opposed to a barrister who deals with it at an entirely different level but let us not get into that.  I am saying that that is normal practice.  What we are talking about today is the extension of the list of authorised investments.  Naturally, if the trustees or the President of the High Court or the officers working under his control feel it is in the better interests of wards to divert funds into interest bearing deposit accounts, either with the existing list or the expanded list, that is the proper thing to do but as a matter of practice my understanding is that that is not the normal manner in which medium to long term funds are invested when they are under the control of the courts.  In so far as the Deputy raises the point about the impact of retention tax on specially disadvantaged people, the list is very wide and apart from the normal practice it includes a side range of authorised investments which are not subject to the retention tax.</P>

      <P>When I used to draw up deeds of trust I normally included a provision to remove the requirement of having to invest in authorised securities but from the State point of view, as I am sure the Deputy will appreciate, the list has to be somewhat restrictive.  It normally comes into operation in relation to funds in court and it also comes into operation when there is a trust deed which does not remove the restriction. We are probably at one on that point. The purpose of the list is protection and from that point of view any additions to the list are carefully selected.  There is a well defined procedure laid down under the 1958 Act for the examination of any proposed addition and for referees to be consulted and there are various criteria <Col N="29" /> to be taken into account in the examination by the Central Bank and so on.

On the other question of the operation of the various banks referred to in this list, I want to make it clear that all the banks on that list are established under Irish company law.  They are both registered and licensed here and provide a whole range of banking services including bonding, foreign exchange and so forth.  It is a considerable advantage to the country that they are here in such numbers.  It is <Col N="30" /> an indication of the confidence in the future of the economy.

On the wider issue of Ireland becoming in the future a major centre for financial services, on that score I would be <i>ad idem</i> with the Deputy.  The measures to which I referred earlier are perhaps a small step in that direction but it might be better in this whole area to proceed with a step-by-step approach.  In time, the prospect exists that we could develop such a major centre here, something which cannot be done overnight.  I would not exclude that possibility over a period of time.

      <P>The primary purpose of this Bill is to provide for the establishment of a unified harbour authority, to be known as the Shannon Ports Authority, which will take over, manage and operate the existing harbours at Limerick and Kilrush together with a number of publicly-owned piers in the Shannon Estuary.

The Bill also provides enabling powers for the future amalgamation of Foynes with the new authority.</P>

    <P>As well as rationalising the structure of harbour authorities in the Shannon Estuary, the Bill also contains provisions <Col N="32" /> which will permit a major reform of the general structure of the country's harbour authorities &mdash; a structure which has remained unaltered since the passing of the Harbours Act, 1946, which in turn was based on the recommendation of the Ports and Harbours Tribunal of 1930. The tides of change have been unrelenting in the meantime and the time has come to take cognisance of that fact in our legislation.</P>

      <P>I regret that copies of my speech have not yet arrived but they are on the way.  Discussion of the Building Societies Bill did not take as long as was anticipated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of amalgamating the various harbour authorities in the Shannon Estuary was first raised almost 30 years ago in 1958.  Since then successive Ministers have entered into consultation with the various interests concerned with a view to trying to reach agreement on the establishment of a Shannon Ports Authority. In particular, developments over the last few years have shown the potential of the Shannon Estuary for heavy industry.  These include the ESB coal burning power station at Moneypoint, the Alumina project at Aughinish and the oil jetty at Shannon Airport.  These developments highlight the need for a single authority for the estuary.  The Shannon Estuary is recognised as one of the finest in Europe.  It is one big natural resource; it is not split with disparate self-contained units.  This asset has been recognised by a number of domestic and international industrial developers. While the estuary continues to hold major potential for the future it is fair to say that it has fared relatively well in terms of development.  My view is that the best way to manage and market one big national natural resource is in its totality. That is why I am so enthusiastic about the concept of a unified ports authority for the area.  Over the past four years I have had detailed and extensive discussions with numerous local interests in the area and, with a few notable exceptions, there is I believe now a broad consensus in favour of a single ports authority which should lead to a more economic development of port facilities and encourage the further development of the already recognised natural advantages of the Shannon Estuary.  These advantages include its geographic location, its width and its natural sheltered deep water which can at present <Col N="35" /> cater for vessels of up to 200,000 tonnes deadweight and, with dredging, could cater for vessels of up to 400,000 tonnes deadweight.</P>
    <P>Against this background it is the responsibility of the Oireachtas to legislate to meet the wishes of the interests in the estuary region as to how what is probably their most valuable natural amenity should be managed and developed and, as such, I am sure it will be welcomed by the House.  It goes without saying, of course, that the ports in the estuary are only one part of the equation; we must not forget the major contribution to the development of the hinterland which is made by Shannon Airport and the Shannon Industrial Estate.  In this regard, the continued efforts of the Shannon Free Airport Development Company are to be lauded.</P>
    <P>Numerous advantages should flow from the establishment of the new authority. I would just like to mention what I believe to be the main advantages.  It will bring about a unified approach to the future planning, development and promotion of the estuary.  It will help to eliminate the possibility of undesirable dissension between different harbour authorities in the estuary, particularly in relation to questions of jurisdiction and entitlement to harbour dues; unnecessary and costly duplication of facilities and services can be more easily avoided, leading to a better overall deployment of scarce financial resources.  Last but not least I also believe that the existence of a unified ports authority will help in attracting further industrial development to the estuary area as a whole.</P>
    <P>Regrettably, the new authority initially will not include Foynes Harbour Trustees at the outset.  I am satisfied that the advantages of a unified authority far outweigh any disadvantages envisaged by the Foynes Harbour Trustees who have been historically opposed to being included.  I have, however, been encouraged by Limerick Harbour Commissioners and other local interests to proceed to set up the ports authority initially without Foynes while providing <Col N="36" /> in the legislation for the eventual incorporation of the Harbour Trustees into the ports authority.  While reluctant to proceed without Foynes, I have come to the conclusion that, instead of bringing unity and co-ordination to the new authority, the forced inclusions of Foynes could prove counter-productive in that it could lead to serious divisions within the new authority at the vital initial stages.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, I am proposing the establishment of a Shannon Ports Authority at this stage without Foynes but I am making provision in section 13 of the Bill for their inclusion at a future date.  Whilst I do not doubt the sincerity and conviction with which the Foynes Harbour Trustees hold their belief, I am still disappointed and not fully convinced at all that this is the best approach.  I say this particularly in the knowledge that the trustees propose to embark on a further major harbour development scheme costing in excess of £5 million.  It is a pity that such a scheme could not be devised as part of an overall strategy for the estuary drawn up by a Shannon Ports Authority.</P>
    <P>The difficulty with independent development schemes in an entity such as the Shannon Eastuary is that they can lead to lack of cohesion and wasteful expenditure of scarce resources through duplication of facilities that the creation of the Shannon Ports Authority is intended to avoid.  This is something I would ask the trustees to consider if they have not already done so.  At the same time, I must hasten to add that the Government fully appreciate the very important role played by Foynes Harbour in the economic well-being of the surrounding region.  This has been borne out by the State grant of £500,000 and local loans fund loan of £1.9 million which were provided in the recent past towards the extension of the east jetty at Foynes. I firmly hope that the Foynes Harbour Trustees will soon come to see the new authority not as a threat but as an opportunity and that the occasion of their amalgamation with the authority will not be too far away.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, I have had detailed <Col N="37" /> and extensive discussions with numerous local interests and it is safe to say that, in the course of those discussions no issue has aroused more comment or controversy than the thorny question of the size and membership of the proposed authority. Indeed, on the general question of the size and membership of harbour authorities a common characteristic of submissions received from various interests in response to the Green Paper on Transport Policy published in November 1985 was that almost all of them, while recognising the desirability of smaller authorities in general, saw a need for their own particular sectional interest to be represented on any new harbour board structure.  In the particular case of the proposed Shannon Ports Authority, many people have advanced cogent reasons to me as to why one area should have greater representation than another and so on.  I believe that all concerned must ultimately accept, however, that the composition of a meaningful ports authority for the entire Shannon Estuary can be built only on compromise.</P>
    <P>There is no end to the possible number of permutations of representation and size of the proposed Authority.  Ideally, I would have wished to have an authority of ten members or fewer but this creates difficulties in a situation where, for example, Limerick Harbour Commission alone, as at present constituted, is a 27-member body with wide representation including local authority interests.  The legitimate desire for representation of a wide variety of interests along the estuary makes it all the more difficult to contain the size of the new Authority.  Bearing in mind these factors, I have decided that the composition should be on the basis of eight local authority members, divided equally between the counties of Clare, Kerry and Limerick as well as Limerick Corporation, two chamber of commerce members, two members from the Confederation of Irish Industry, two representatives of labour interests, two elected shipping representatives and five Ministerial nominees.  This is provided for in section 4 which also provides that <Col N="38" /> the Minister may make regulations specifying the manner in which the local authority members are appointed to the authority.</P>
    <P>The reason for these regulations is that the four local authorities who are to be the appointing bodies cover a very large geographical area, including areas which are quite remote from the estuary.  Local authority members from the remote areas could not possibly have the same interest in the development of the estuary as those, for example, from electoral areas bordering on the estuary.  The regulatory powers in section 4 accordingly are intended to enable the Minister to devise a system whereby only those local authority members with a legitimate interest would have the right to appoint local authority members.  It goes without saying that regulations under this subsection would only be made after the fullest consultation.  I feel power to make such regulations is in the overall interest of the estuary.  Subject to any regulations which may be made under this section, the appointment of the local authority members to the Shannon Ports Authority will be carried out in accordance with the procedures under the relevant Local Government Act.</P>
    <P>I am taking the opportunity of the establishment of the Shannon Ports Authority to change the traditional structure of harbour authorities under harbours legislation whereby a large single harbour authority, representing mainly sectoral interests, has full responsibility for the management and operation of a particular port or harbour.  This structure originally emanated from a recommendation in the report of the Ports and Harbours Tribunal, 1930, which considered that the management of a port was primarily a matter for local bodies and that the citizens of the locality should be responsible for its operation subject always to the supervision of the State in the public interest.</P>
    <P>It is my view that present day commercial considerations and the competitive requirements of a modern port require a less unwieldy and more dynamic <Col N="39" /> structure than that provided for in existing harbour legislation.  I have decided accordingly that, while responsibility for overall policy and future planning and development of the Shannon Estuary will rest with the new Authority, it will delegate to a smaller board of management general responsibility for the day to day administration of the estuary.  Section 5 of the Bill provides for the establishment of the board of management.</P>
    <P>I believe that the proposed two-tier structure will be more in keeping with the modern-day requirements of a major harbour and that the new arrangements will have the effect of facilitating efficient operation and administration.  They should enable the ports authority to divorce itself from the execution of settled policy in most areas, thus allowing it more time to concentrate on the important area of long-term planning and overall policy co-ordination infettered by the more mundane business of running a busy port on a day-to-day basis.  I also believe that the smaller board of management will be able to deal more effectively with the various pressures and problems which will undoubtedly arise in the early years of the new Authority and that it will be less subject to potential conflict of interests which can so easily arise in a large representative body such as the proposed ports Authority.</P>
    <P>Naturally, the precise division of functions will require careful consideration in the light of consultation with the new Authority.  The idea of a two-tier Authority arose essentially out of the special position of the Shannon Estuary, but there may be merit in the application of some similar structure to major harbours elsewhere in the country and this is something which I will be considering especially in the light of experience with the new Shannon Authority.</P>
    <P>In pursuing the establishment of the Shannon Ports Authority, I have always had uppermost in my mind the concern to ensure that the interests of staff being transferred will be fully protected. Section 8 of the Bill provides for the <Col N="40" /> transfer of staff from the existing authorities to the new Authority on terms or conditions not less favourable than those which they may at present enjoy, while sections 9 and 10 provide for the interim continuation of existing superannuation schemes and the introduction of new schemes.</P>
    <P>I would now like to deal with the overall question of rationalisation and amalgamation of ports in general which is naturally a subject of wide interest.  The Green Paper on Transport Policy in the chapter dealing with ports, refers to the size and membership of harbour authorities and indicates my intention to introduce amendments to harbours legislation to provide for the disbandment of existing authorities and their replacement by smaller boards.  The Green Paper also mentions the possibility of grouping contiguous harbours.  There has been much and varied reaction to these proposals.  A predominant view, particularly among those who would be affected, seems to be that the amalgamation of ports has little to recommend it, although greater co-operation between ports is undoubtedly something for which there may be scope.  The suggestion has also been made that rationalisation of ports would eliminate competition and would not be in the public interest.  I consider this view to be too dogmatic; the concept of competition between ports needs to be carefully examined.  We live on a small island. Resources for capital investment in ports of infrastructure are limited.</P>
    <P>Competition at the charges level without regard to the need to provide for asset replacement and then relying on State assistance for that purpose is not competition at all.  It is arguable that there are too many small ports competing for the same volume of traffic.  Amalgamation of ports may not be the only answer, but if new investment is required to meet a particular need of a region and involves State subvention, a decision could be made by the Government as to which of two adjacent ports should be developed.  Such a decision could be painful, particularly for the loser, but may <Col N="41" /> prove necessary in the interests of effective investment.  In conclusion, it is clear that, even where natural groupings suggest themselves as, for example in the Shannon Estuary, substantial difficulties can arise in effecting amalgamation.  This is not a reason, however, for not addressing the problem.</P>
    <P>It seems appropriate therefore that the Harbours Bill should contain the necessary provisions to enable the issues I have just described to be adequately addressed. Section 15 (1) of the Bill provides, accordingly, that the Minister may by order dissolve, reconstitute or amalgamate a number or any of the harbour authorities specified in the first column of the First Schedule of the Harbours Act, 1946, as amended.  In the case of Dublin, I envisage early reconstitution of the Port and Docks Board in line with a previous Government decision in the context of the financial restructuring of the Dublin Port and Docks Board.</P>
    <P>I am also availing of the Bill to provide for the possible extension, with appropriate alterations where necessary, of the two tier management system proposed for the Shannon Ports Authority to the other main harbour authorities &mdash; Cork, Dublin and Waterford.  This can be considered in the light of experience with the Shannon Ports Authority.  In addition, the Government have already decided in the context of devolution to local authorities, that harbours which now catered for little or no commercial traffic should be handed over to local authorities.  It is intended that this decision be catered for in the present Bill.  Section 15 also makes provision in relation to these matters.</P>
    <P>While on the general subject of ports policy, I should like to refer briefly to some other measures which are being taken in the light of the review of this area which led to the publication of the Green Paper.  Steps are being taken to ensure that, in future, all harbour authorities review their rates and charges on a regular basis and to encourage rationalisation of rates structures.  The general aim will be to ensure that harbour authorities pay their way by charging economic rates and thereby producing. <Col N="42" /> realistic surpluses.  Through a gradual implementation of a policy of charging realistic rates, users will pay for services provided and the call on the taxpayer for State assistance will diminish.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, in line with the target set for public investment projects in the public capital programme, it is now the policy that investment proposals by harbour authorities should achieve a realistic return on investment.  Except in the most exceptional circumstances, the availability of a local contribution of 25 per cent, at the very least, will be a prerequisite for the consideration of State assistance for any port development project. Moreover, in evaluating proposals for investment in harbours, care will be taken that Exchequer assistance is not provided for the purpose of encouraging the diversion of traffic from one port to another.  All these measures are designed to improve the financial position and overall environment in which our harbours operate.</P>
    <P>The remainder of the Bill before the House is concerned with tidying up minor matters and standard provisions which are in the main self-explanatory.  In particular, section 16 of the Bill implements standard provisions in relation to the remuneration of chief officers of harbour authorities in accordance with Government policy.  Sections 17 and 19 in effect dissolve the Limerick Harbour Commissioners, Kilrush Urban District Council and Clare Castle Pier Trustees as harbour authorities on the establishment of the Shannon Ports Authority.  Section 18 rectifies a technical drafting defect in the Harbours Act, 1976, which established the Bantry Bay Harbour Commissioners. Section 20 provides that every regulation made under the proposed legislation will be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas and will be subject to annulment.  Section 21 contains the short title and collective citation.</P>
    <P>The present Bill, as I have stated, is primarily designed to give statutory effect to the wishes of local interests in the Shannon Estuary region to establish a unified harbour authority for the geographical unit of the estuary.  I have <Col N="43" /> confidence that, as such, it will command the full support of the House and I have no doubt also that, now that local interests are about to achieve their longsought objective, they will put forward a united effort to ensure that the new authority becomes a dynamic force in meeting the needs for a developed portal infrastructure in an expanding local economy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have to enlarge on the magnificient local resource that is the Shannon Estuary.  It is an environmental lung which stretches from the Atlantic to my county, where the Shannon arises.  For its spaciousness and the huge vessels it can take &mdash; and with a little dredging the even greater tonnage it can take &mdash; it must impress people with its importance, and in particular its potential for economic development in that area.  The Minister's speech ended on a note about investment and the importance of investment.  That is almost a sick joke in the present economic climate, when investment never was so low so badly needed in our community.  This is an area that attracts the attention of people who want to see major development there.  It is a pity, some people say, that it is not on the eastern side of the country, or the south eastern, facing Europe but, then, it was the Atlantic Ocean that provided us with it in the first place.  Therefore, that is a foolish kind of wish.  We have to accept it as it is.  We must accept its amenity and commercial value and its potential for development.</P>
      <P>The Minister has mentioned a major economic development in the area.  I am proud to record it in the House &mdash; lest it be forgotten in a welter of propaganda &mdash; that Aughinish, Moneypoint and so on were the products of the vision of the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that one of the purposes of the Bill was to remove causes for dissension.  I shall revert to that later.  The House will also have the privilege of contributions from Deputies Gerard Collins and Daly who have a deep <Col N="44" /> interest in this whole matter.  The elimination of dissension, in the way that the whale eliminated Jonah's dissension by swallowing Jonah, is not something we regard as desirable.  There seems to have been a pitch to swallow the very effective Foynes Harbour Authority which has served this country well in its development up to now.  When I was Minister I had the privilege of meeting representatives of the Foynes Harbour Authority.  There are two features of Foynes which are very important and should command the attention of the House.  One is that it has been commercially successful on a large scale.  The second &mdash; one which ties into the Minister's philosophy and causes a certain contradiction in the thinking behind the speech we have just heard &mdash; is that Foynes did this practically without Government grants.  Foynes Harbour Authority received, I think, approximately £500,000 in grants over a quarter of a century.  They had guarantees from the Local Loans Fund but a loan is a loan and they are addressing themselves to the repayment of their loans.  Deputy Collins indicates to me that I said a figure of £500,000.  The figure was £571,000 to be precise.  The Foynes people, in the case they put to me, certainly convinced me that they were entitled to their independence.</P>
    <P>That takes me to another point that worries me about this Bill and that is that there is surreptitious legislation in it. Foynes is stated openly to be at risk of being taken over by ministerial ukase or fiat.  Admittedly, there is a slight democratic safeguard in that this would have to get a majority vote in this House.  I do not like it as a method of legislating.  It is conceivable at some time in the future the Foynes people would want to join the rest of the estuarial authority but the way to do so would be to introduce a Bill and have it fully debated here.  Foynes is not a tinpot operation.  Consequently it should command that much respect in the House, that of a separate Bill.</P>
    <P>The second thing that worries me about the Bill is section 15 where the Minister again takes powers to himself to do all <Col N="45" /> kinds of things with the other harbours. We had problems &mdash; admittedly they are less severe now than they were a couple of years ago &mdash; in the port of Dublin.  If any major amalgamation or restructuring were to take place, either in the compilation of the board or in an amalgamation between Dublin and Dún Laoghaire, that proposition also should come before the House as a separate Bill.  I have had communications with a number of other people in various harbours and ports throughout the country who fear what was foreshadowed in the Green Paper, namely, compulsory amalgamation or elimination as an effective port in our economy.  I am thinking of, say, Greenore, Dundalk, Drogheda, Clogher Head, and Annagassan Pier, that whole area.  Why should the Minister take that power in a Bill which is <i>ex professo</i> dealing with the Shannon Estuary? Why should that Bill give him power to deal with all those places that are not necessarily thought of now?  But the Minister is taking power unto himself in this Bill so that he could do that.</P>
    <P>I have had communications from New Ross.  Somebody thought of wedding New Ross to Waterford and the people in New Ross were very concerned about this, but not in any petty way &mdash; the Minister seemed to imply that it was out of self-interest &mdash; or in a get money for development type of attitude irrespective of what happens in other ports in the vicinity.  They indicated that they were not in competition with Waterford in that the products they were importing and exporting from New Ross were totally different, mainly fertiliser, as against Waterford from which the main export at that time was cattle, and I hope that trade will continue.</P>
    <P>What I do not like about this Bill are its implications as much as its overt purpose to establish a Shannon Ports Authority. For that reason we shall be putting down amendments, arguing strongly on them, in the hope that we can improve the Bill.  I do not think we can make it a good Bill without excluding the section with regard to Foynes, without excluding the section which gives the Minister so <Col N="46" /> much power in relation to ports and harbours throughout the country.  I am convinced that we just cannot do so.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the size and membership of an authority.  I agree with him that a large, unwieldy authority is something that could be detrimental to the development of any port or area.  The old joke that a camel is a horse designed by a committee holds in cases like this.  It depends on how large is one's committee. The device settled on by the Minister as far as this Bill is concerned seems to be to have a representative Authority of 21 but, within that, there will be a smaller board who will effectively carry out the developmental and commercial work of the port.  How the Authority will relate to what looks like an executive committee will be very important with regard to the development in that area.  I could not agree more with the Minister in his objectives, namely, to improve efficiency and competitiveness in the area.  I can foresee paralysis if the relationship between the 21-member Authority and the smaller executive board is not developed in a rational manner.  Indeed some of the staff representatives are fearsome that it is a device to exclude Labour representatives from the executive board.  We should take cognisance of that, especially as the Minister has just told us that this may form the model and pattern for other boards, that we will have a two-tier system involved in other boards as well.</P>
    <P>The House will have to tease out and examine that position.  It will be of general interest in the House and I hope that this Bill will get full discussion here.  Some commentators have already come rationally to the conclusion that it is not merely an innocent little Bill with regard to Shannon but it is the forerunner of other Bills and in particular one which deals with the Dublin Port and Docks Board which has now got entangled with the ambitions for Dún Laoghaire.  The Taoiseach announced that there would be a separate authority for Dún Laoghaire.  I do not know what type of authority it will be; it was an off-the-top-of-the-head statement <Col N="47" /> in the context of political developments at present.</P>
    <P>In the Seanad Official Report of 18 June 1986, volume 113, column 867 the Minister of State, Deputy Nealon, stated that the Minister:</P>
    <P>indicated in the Green Paper that he proposed to introduce amendments to harbours legislation which would provide for the disbandment of existing boards or authorities and their replacement by smaller boards some of whose members would be appointed by the Ministers, that the Government had decided that legislation should be prepared for the reconstitution of the Dublin Port and Docks Board&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>That would indicate it will not be under the shadow of this Bill.</P>
    <P>&mdash; and that the management structure for the new Dublin Port Authority, as well as for Cork, Waterford and the new Shannon Ports Authority would be a two tier structure, modelled on the lines of the division of responsibility in local authorities between executive and reserved functions.</P>
    <P>I would be very much afraid of that pattern because as this House well knows public representatives are not at all satisfied with the amount of executive authority now obtaining in the administration of local authorities and with the considerably curbed and restricted powers which the elected representatives have.  I sound a note of warning about that.</P>
    <P>With regard to the constitution of the port authority there are five ministerial nominees.  Qualifications of the five ministerial nominees should be spelled out in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>No doubt Deputy Collins who is very much into that scene will be able to explicate on that later.  Why are there five nominees?  Does the Minister want to categorise the five people, for example, one who would have expertise in accountancy, one who would be an <Col N="48" /> expert on marine affairs, one who would be an expert on importation and exportation and so on?  I would like some information from the Minister in that regard.</P>
      <P>Were it not for the fact that the Minister decided to include section 20, the Fianna Fáil Party would, from the very beginning, have opposed this Bill.  I am not saying that we are not going to oppose Second Stage.  We are waiting for some enlightenment from the Government side.  We are glad that this saving section is included.  It states that every regulation made by the Minister under this Act shall be made before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after it is made.  If a resolution annulling the regulation is passed by either such House within the next 21 days on which that House has sat after the regulation is laid before it, the regulation shall be annulled accordingly but without prejudice to the validity of anything previously done thereunder.  There is some salvation in that as far as we are concerned.</P>
      <P>I referred to Foynes earlier.  There seems to be petulance in the Minister's speech today and throughout his speech in the Seanad with regard to Foynes, that they did not play the game as far as he was concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a threat in the Minister's speech.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>There is, as Deputy Collins says, a threat in the Minister's speech.  The people in Foynes spent £6,250,000 on development over the last quarter of a century and, as Deputy Collins indicated, £571,000 of a direct grant is all they were looking for.  That is what we are seeking from public and semi-State companies.  Every political party wants to see commercial viability, profits being invested in further development and quite considerable employment potential.  There are over 300 people directly employed in Foynes.  As this House knows, in circumstances such as that there are spin-off effects which I am not in a position to enumerate for the House. It is important to remember that that is a rich agricultural area of Munster <Col N="49" /> and that the agri-imports and exports from Foynes are very substantial.  It is an important centre for fuel importation. What should delight all of us is that they have a £3 million programme for development. They may even have plans for a more substantial development, I am not too sure.  This surreptitious legislation is something that this House must be wary of.  In the past I indicated that the House must be vigilant about arrogating of power to himself by any Minister without full discussion in the House.  I prefer straight up legislation as far as the amalgamation of ports or the development of other ports is concerned instead of giving powers in a Bill like this for the development of Shannon that can be exercised in relation to other areas of the country.</P>
      <P>I had representations from the Tipperary North Riding area &mdash; the Chair will appreciate this &mdash; with regard to their interest in the area.  They would not like to be excluded as they use the facilities in that area to a great extent.  One thing which has been impressed upon me, and no doubt the Deputies from Clare will speak on it, is that Clare seems to have lost out considerably as far as representation is concerned.  The Kilrush Urban Council were a harbour authority in their own right.  Clare is getting representation on the board.  I am in agreement with the principle that too unwieldy a board with affect the competitiveness of the commercial viability of the operation but what we have here is the abolition of the Kilrush authority and not compensation in the new representation; Clare County Council just get their two representatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole coast of Clare is important from a developmental point of view.  I should like the Minister to reflect on the weakness in the Bill.  We will oblige him in regard to amendments on Committee Stage if it is not defeated on Second Stage.  Tarbert Pier, Saleen Pier, Kilteely Pier and Clarecastle Pier are also coming under the control of the authority. Deputy McEllistrim will have a particular interest as the area being taken in is from Sarsfield Bridge to a line joining the Kerry Head with Loop Head with the <Col N="50" /> exception of Foynes, but there is a threat to Foynes in the Bill, as I mentioned.</P>
    <P>I would be grateful if the Minister would indicate what implications there are in the Bill for the ports I have already outlined, the Dublin-Dún Laoghaire area, New Ross and Waterford, the Greenore-Dundalk area and other areas, for example, Rosslare which is a thriving port, and Arklow.  All of these are, in a sense, under what I would call ministerial threat from powers taken in this Bill.  At the risk of being accused of repetition I should like to impress on the Minister of State once more that whatever has to be done by way of development in that line should be done by straight forward Bills brought before this House with regard to the specific harbours and not by a kind of creeping interference under the umbrella of this Bill.  We do not want ukases or fiats.</P>
    <P>I accept the principle that it is important to look at State investment with a view to commercial viability.  I do not think that funds should be expended in any kind of unplanned or irrational way but the wise men of one decade become the foolish people of the following decade.  Who could have thought that a large industry like Aughinish would be established in the Limerick area which changed the whole basic criteria on which judgments were made?  Who is to say the same will not happen at Greenore or Drogheda or Annagassan or Clogher Head right down the east coast or the south coast or the west coast.  We need to be careful about making judgments for posterity which we are not entitled to do.</P>
    <P>This Bill has excited great interest in Fianna Fáil and in other parties also and I hope to make way for other speakers.  I mentioned already that Kilrush has been left out in the cold.  Perhaps people with riparian rights on both sides of the Shannon between Sarsfield Bridge and the line I mentioned should also be taken into consideration as far as the activities of the authority are concerned.  I will not go so far as to say they should select somebody to represent them.  Perhaps they may think that local authority representation is sufficient but they should <Col N="51" /> not be left out of account in deciding what this authority will be.  Section 4 (b) (1A) (a) (v) in regard to elected members needs some clarification.  I presume there is a definition later on as to how they are to be elected.</P>
    <P>I would draw the attention of the House to section 4 (b) (1A) (b):</P>
    <P>The Minister may by regulations specify the manner in which the local authority members are appointed pursuant to paragraph (a) (i) of this subsection, and any such regulations may make provision for such matters relating to such appointment as the Minister considers proper.</P>
    <P>That is in line with the fears I expressed, of creeping arrogation of powers by a Minister and it requires the attention of the House.  The setting down of the number of elected members under (v) may be covered by section 7 and I would like the Minister to confirm that.</P>
    <P>Section 13 (3) &mdash; and I am sure Deputy Collins will have a lot more to say on that as he has expert knowledge of that area &mdash;says:</P>
    <P>The Minister may by order amend or revoke an order under this section (including this subsection).</P>
    <P>That is a very rough statement and a rough provision.  I will say no more about that now but we will have lots to say about it later on.</P>
    <P>In section 15 we have these powers again:</P>
    <P>(1) The Minister may by order dissolve, reconstitute or amalgamate as he may consider it necessary or desirable ....</P>
    <P>It is a ukase.  One would not find that kind of power anywhere.</P>
    <P>... so to do any one or more of the harbour authorities specified in the first column of the First Schedule (as amended by this Act) to the Act of 1946.</P>
    <P>I have the Act of 1946 here.  A list of three and a half pages of authorities are <Col N="52" /> put at risk by the powers being taken by the Minister there.</P>
    <P>I want to comment on section 16 which has been the subject of considerable debate in this House in connection with other Bills.  It is a very tricky area.  I am not just criticising for the sake of criticism.  It is about how to pay the higher executives in our semi-State, State or public companies.  Every day we hear that people of undoubted ability who have proved themselves in the commercial field have moved out of the public sector and into private business.  I objected before to a larger paragraph incorporated in some previous Bills where the Minister for Finance and the Minister for the Public Service were also equipped with powers to interfere with the free collective bargaining of workers in organisations. While this provision is an attenuated version of what we have been having in other Bills, I still take exception to it.</P>
    <P>I want to make a couple of remarks on the Minister's speech and then I will conclude.  Some of the points made by the Minister have been covered already. It is a unified approach, even if it is not the unity of the whale and Jonah as I already said.  The idea is that dissension will end when this provision becomes law. I would see in the Bill a source of trouble and dissension until the overall Authority define their relationship to the smaller board who are under suspicion from many areas, not merely from the point of view of smooth administrations but also of the workforce.</P>
    <P>As I have said, I agree with the Minister that we must avoid duplication of facilities where we have not got all that much money for investment.  At the same time the powers taken by the Minister with the limited knowledge that any Minister must have, even with the best advisers, deal with a specific place at a specific time and without taking cognisance of future developments which may be quite adventitious to the whole operation. We do not know who will decide to locate where, in other words.  This is something we do not want people to be dogmatic about.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="53" /> The Minister said: &ldquo;I also believe that the smaller board of management will be able to deal more effectively with the various pressures and problems which will undoubtedly arise in the early years of the new Authority and that they will be less subject to potential conflict of interests which can so easily arise in a large representative body such as the proposed ports authority&rdquo;.  I see that as a very weak statement, a statement that really impugns the procedure we normally have in committees and councils and even in this Dáil.  Of course there will be dissension, of course there will be conflict of interests, of course there will be disagreement on policy, but what is the normal procedure of this House or of a county council or corporation?  Discuss it, debate it, vote on it and make a decision on it.  If the Minister has not that much confidence in the type of port authority he is fashioning in this Bill, then the whole exercise is fruitless.  That would be really an attack on a democratic process that has been developed over a long period, finely honed and acceptable generally in our community.</P>
    <P>I have dealt with the two tier structure. In his speech the Minister said that the Government have already decided, in the context of devolution to local authorities, we agree with that on this side of the House; it is gaining support throughout our community and throughout the EC also that harbours which now cater for little or no commercial traffic should be handed over to local authorities.  I ask the Minister when he is replying to indicate whether there would be restrictions on a county council when they had had the devolved powers to develop a particular harbour.  For example, if the Government cut themselves off from Annagassan Pier and allow the county council to provide £5 million for development, does the Minister envisage a freedom for the county council?  I took that merely as an example and it may not be a particularly fortunate one, but I am asking if the Minister envisages any restriction on the county council to develop.  If he does, he seems to be throwing the corpse of a port or harbour to the county council <Col N="54" /> because central Government see no further use for it.</P>
    <P>I have made the point about lack of investment at present.  All the statistics that we get and read about indicate that if there is one thing we need more than anything else it is investment.  At present, there is neither private investment nor public investment.  I agree with the principle that public investment &mdash; which we are dealing with here &mdash; should proceed along certain, very well ordered principles, the principle of return, the principle of provision of employment and so on.  It is a sick joke to hear any member of this Government talking about rational development.  There is no kind of development at present.  I hope that the estuarial area and the Authority &mdash; if the Bill gets through this House &mdash; will be alerted to their prime responsibility which is the responsibility to develop the area.</P>

      <P>It is interesting to note for those who have a deep interest in what is involved in the setting up of an esturial authority to cover the Shannon estuary that no member of the Fine Gael or Labour Parties is present in this House and that no member of fine Gael or Labour offered to speak when it was their turn to speak on this Bill.  I mention that now in the hope that it may pinch the consciences of one or two of them to induce them to come in and at least pay lip service to the Bill which is here purely for political reasons.  I will have more to say on that in the course of the next few minutes.</P>
      <P>Every effort possible was made over the years by one or two important members of the Fine Gael Party in the city of Limerick &mdash; one of them in particular a former Member of this House &mdash; to set up this estuarial authority.  Some of us have watched their efforts carefully over the years because we knew that their intentions were not honourable.  We know from the first Bill that was published that it was hoped that the Government and the Minister &mdash; then Deputy Peter Barry &mdash; would rush through that Bill at that time and that they would use their political muscle to take over the assets of the Foynes Harbour Trustees and use them to bolster up other areas within the region and in particular the harbour trustees in the city of Limerick who were not able to provide for themselves in the economic sense.  It did not happen then.  Over the years many efforts have been made to resurrect this estuarial Bill but they have failed and I am satisfied that this will fail today.  If the Minister wishes to contest that with me let him be prepared for a vote on Thursday afternoon and let him get word to his party Whip that he had better keep the truce here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome, as would any member of the House, any effort to provide additional employment opportunities for the young people.  During the course of <Col N="56" /> another Bill on a similar subject introduced by the Minister, Deputy Mitchell, some time ago on the establishment of the concept of free ports, enshrining it in our legislation, we made a very solid case for the inclusion of the Shannon Estuary, by including it in the Bill as a free port. When the Minister replied he did not have anything positive to offer for the 20,000 young boys and girls who are unemployed in the mid western region. There was no soft soap talk from the Minister on that occasion such as that given by the Minister of State, Deputy Nealon here today with regard to the many fine attributes of the Shannon Estuary. At that time we were talking about only Cork, and we know full well the reasons why.  The Government were trying to hold up their declining support in that region.  Now we are told that Shannon is a wonderful place, that it has powerful potential when a blind eye was turned to it on that occasion.  The Minister, Deputy Mitchell, should be here today to answer for his part in that matter but the Minister is sending his junior Minister in an effort to keep himself away form the well deserved criticism that can be levelled at him for his part in this.</P>
    <P>This Bill has more in it than meets the eye.  I do not accuse the Minister of State of political chicanery or side-stepping but there is something about this Bill that does not meet the normal standards applicable to Bills such as this.  The famous section 13 deserves to be highlighted at every opportunity.  If the Bill gets through Second Stage we hope that that section will be deleted from it.</P>
    <P>Last May the Minister, Deputy Mitchell, came to Foynes to officially open an extension to the jetty.  As a member of an Irish Government he was welcome there, but as a Minister who had done nothing for Foynes his presence was questionable. Foynes had embarked on an extensive and expensive extension to their port facilities.  Promises made with regard to Government grants had been reneged on.  The port authority trustees were put to the pin of their collar to try to meet the financial commitments to pay money due for that great extension which <Col N="57" /> was necessary for the development of the port.  Total public investment to date in this area is £571,000.  There are 500 people and therefore 500 families making a good living from the port which is our deepest port on the western coast and many others depend indirectly on its success also.  Every day that port handles ships up to 35,000 tonnes dead weight which no other port on the west coast can handle.  One could compare the jobs provided without cost to the State to the jobs provided by the IDA involving a State expenditure of £10,000, £15,000 or £30,000 per job.  In Foynes the people on their own initiative, with little help from the Exchequer have provided something worthwhile and the concern now is that their best interests might not be served if they are swallowed up in this estuarial authority.  On the last occasion the Government tried to force them in.  This time there is a slightly different approach in that section 13 says that Foynes may stay out but that the Minister at a future date, by ministerial order, can force Foynes back in.</P>

      <P>That is not a manly way in which to approach the problem. It is sneaking, it is the back door method.  The carrot and the stick method is used by this Government.  The carrot and stick were indirectly used by the Government when they refused to honour their financial commitment to Foynes to help them build the east jetty extension and the whisper was out that if they kept quiet and became part of the esturial authority, they might get a little more.  The end result was that they got a small grant. I asked a question of the Minister on 12 March 1985 as to the amount by way of grants he proposed to allocate for that year to harbours and ports but the answer given must have been a grave embarrassment to those who try to represent the Government parties in the mid western region.  The information given to me showed that Cork Harbour got £4.8 million for the development of a deep <Col N="58" /> water wharf at Ringaskiddy.  There is a natuaral deep water facility in Shannon; however Cork got £4.8 million; Drogheda got £300, 000, Dundalk £80,000, Tralee and Fenit £90,000, Wicklow £5,000 and Rosslare £132,000.  These were for lifeboat facilities and nobody would object to that.  But Foynes got £200,000 and Sligo who could not boast of even 250 people working there got £470,000 for the completion of a harbour dredging scheme.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>When this Bill was published last May it was publicly criticised by the Minister for Energy as is clear from the front page of <i>The Kerryman</i> of 16 May 1986.  He criticised it because of the exclusion of Foynes from the control of the proposed harbour authority.  That is worth noting because he is the second most important <Col N="60" /> man in the Government.  If he publicly criticises a Bill, section 13 of which is a trap door for wiping out the autonomy of Foynes at the stroke of a ministerial pen, then we must be on our guard.  If what he said can be regarded as an indication of the Government's intentions in regard to using the powers which the Minister wants under section 13 to take away from Foynes its independence to pursue its own business, in the economically viable and successful way it has been operating over the years, then there is great cause for concern.  I want an assurance that the indication, which can only be read into what the Minister for Energy said, is one which has been misrepresented.  Of course, one way to take the Minister out of his misery is by not having the Bill processed or by deleting section 13.</P>
    <P>There is genuine concern about Foynes, where there are almost 500 people working and whose assets are at present valued at approximately £20 million.  The assets of the port users are also valued at £20 million.  Its successful operation would be hindered if it was part of an estuarial authority.  There are excellent facilities are available in Foynes. Even though facilities are vitally important we all recognise that unless you have good labour relations &mdash; as is the case in Foynes &mdash; a port is useless.  We are all very proud of labour relations in Foynes and having regard to labour relations in ports generally I am sure Members will agree that where we have excellent relations we must do everything we can to preserve them as they are necessary for the successful operation of any port.</P>
    <P>The Minister implied this morning that there is dissension in the estuary area.  I do not think that is so as I have not seen any.  He said the development of a port authority will help to eliminate the possibility of dissension between different harbour authorities in the estuary, particularly in relation to questions of jurisdiction and entitlement of harbour dues.  I accept that but there is no dissension on the question of which port can provide the facilities because Foynes is the only port that can provide the facilities which commercial shipping needs. <Col N="61" /> No other port would be able to handle ships up to 35,000 tonnes dead-weight. The Minister is wrong.  If he is trying to make a case for the inclusion of Foynes, against its will, in the estuarial authority he should stop now.</P>
    <P>When the Minister, Deputy Mitchell, visited Foynes on 16 May 1986 he said he intended and hoped that Foynes would be included in the estuarial authority from the outset.  He regretted that Foynes was outside the domain of the Shannon Ports Authority for the time being.  I mention that because the words &ldquo;time being&rdquo; are important.  He went on to say he was still disappointed and not fully convinced that their approach was the best one.  I refer to that because implicit in those words is an indication that the Minister has every intention of using section 13 of the Bill if it is ever introduced in the House.  His remarks must be coupled with what the Minister of State, Deputy Nealon, said today that while he did not doubt the sincerity and conviction with which Foynes Harbour trustees hold their brief, he was still disappointed and not fully convinced it was the best approach.  He said he made this remark in the knowledge that the trustees propose to embark on a further major harbour development scheme costing in excess of £5 million.  The Minister said it is a pity that such a scheme could not be devised as part of an overall strategy drawn up for the estuary by the Shannon Ports Authority.  I fear, because of the way the Minister's regret is so clearly stated and because he went on to talk about the development which is costing £5 million, that he was showing up clearly his stick and carrot approach.  I want to warn the Minister that if he interferes in any way with the development of Foynes Harbour or with the livelihoods of the 500 people who work there he will have a lot to answer for in this House.</P>
    <P>As I have already said, we would welcome any work in the estuary and any move which would help to attract further major industries there.  We have been successful in that regard in the past as is evidenced by the existence of the power <Col N="62" /> generating station on Tarbert Island, the Moneypoint generating station in County Clare and the Alumina plant on Aughinish Island and which is only about 400 yards north of Foynes.  We want to see more industrial development such as the development which has taken place at Askeaton in County Limerick.  There must be as much development as possible on both the north and south sides of the estuary, with north Kerry being included in any development on the south side.</P>
    <P>The Government should devote their energies to developing properly this fine natural asset.  We have many State agencies including the IDA who are costing hundreds of millions of pounds every year but who are not doing anything worthwhile for the development of the Shannon estuary.  They own large tracts of land on both sides of the estuary but they have done nothing with it.  We would like to know what input the Shannon Free Airport Development Company are going to have into the development of the Shannon estuary.  Are they going to be allowed to have any input?</P>
    <P>Another layer of bureaucracy is now being created and we do not know what powers they are going to have.  Will they have greater powers than the IDA to develop the estuary?  Will they have the same budget as the IDA?  Will they have representatives abroad to meet industrialists? If we are serious about developing the Shannon estuary I hope this new creature which is being created by the Minister of State will have the necessary powers.</P>

If one could take any indication from the attitude of the Minister of State, Deputy Nealon, as to where Government moneys are going to be spent we can rest assured that the Shannon estuary region is going to be hard done by.  In 1985, he took twice the amount of money to Sligo than he pumped into the entire area of the Snannon estuary which stretches 60 miles from the city of Limerick to Loop Head and Kerry Head.  If that is an indication of Government support for the development of the Snannon estuary, let us hasten the day when there will be a change in Government.</P>

      <P>I am not going to pull back from it.  If the Minister's attitude, on the basis of fairplay for other regions, is as indicated by him in the way public moneys have been disbursed, there is great cause for concern in the Shannon estuary region.  However, we look forward to a change very quickly when we will not have the concern we have now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Large amounts of money are collected by the Limerick harbour authorities, who are based in the City of Limerick, in respect of ships which discharge their goods at Moneypoint, Tarbert and Aughinish. A high proportion of those fees should not have been invested in particular areas.  Developments would not have taken place in those areas but for the fact that the county councils there ploughed a lot of money and effort into them before they were provided.  Some <Col N="64" /> of that money should have been invested in areas from whence the landing fees came in Counties Clare and Kerry, Huge amounts of money are being collected annually from these areas in County Clare and County Limerick.  I will leave it to my County Clare colleague, Deputy Daly, to make the case for the people who sent him here to represent them.</P>
    <P>Deputy McEllistrim has indicated that he is going to participate in this debate and he will make his case.  There is a big case to be made.  Even if this Bill gets through without section 13 &mdash; we will be moving an amendment to delete section 13 if this Bill reaches Committee Stage &mdash; two representatives from County Clare on the board of 21 is not going to give adequate representation to that county which provides the whole northern bank of the estuary.  They will have no greater say than two representatives on, say, a chamber of commerce or the CII.  That is wrong.</P>
    <P>It is equally wrong that County Limerick which has 40 miles of the southern bank of the estuary should have only two representatives on the authority by way of members of a local authority.  The same applies to County Kerry.  Out of a body of 21 people six members are to represent the Counties of Kerry, Clare and Limerick.  That is not right or proper. I appreciate that if one has too large a board it will be an unwieldy body to get to move and I would be prepared to discuss that aspect reasonably and fairly but it is not good enough that the three counties on the Shannon estuary should be limited to six representatives out of 21, bearing in mind that there will be two representatives from a chamber of commerce, two from the confederation of industry and five from the Minister.  That is not good enough.  I should like much discussion on this point and the Bill amended to ensure a fairer representation on the board.</P>
    <P>I would help the Minister on the matter by way of amendment when it comes to that stage and would urge him clearly to define for us the qualifications of those he intends to nominate to fill the five vacancies which he can fill on that board. <Col N="65" /> We would like to know who these people might be, their qualifications and interests.  That is very important.  I want the Minister to spell out very clearly if section 13 remains, if the port authority at Foynes continue to be the success story they are and if they want to stay independent, outside the umbrella of the port authority, will the Minister force them in against their will?  I know that he is trying the carrot and the stick game and has been for a considerable period of time. Does he now feel that this is the time to tell if they will be forced in?  We would welcome a definite statement of intent from him and the Government on this point.  This is necessary, because the Minister for Energy in Tralee last May stated his views.</P>
    <P>There are many people dependent for their livelihood on the continued success of Foynes harbour, who would be deeply worried if the control of their own affairs, successfully managed to date, were given to a larger authority on whose board they would have no representative as such, other than two from the county of Limerick. These people have every right to be concerned and to expect that their public representatives would seek clarification of the situation.  This is a very serious matter, indeed, which we would like clarified.  I look forward to hearing what the Minister has to say and, depending on what he does say, we shall know where we stand when we go to Committee Stage with regard to amendments to the Bill in which I have a specific interest.</P>

      <P>As somebody coming from Limerick, I should like to take this opportunity of saying a few words on this Bill which I welcome.  The port of Foynes has been mentioned on numerous occasions by Deputies Wilson and Collins. That port is recognised worldwide by ship owners and charterers as the only general cargo port in Ireland capable of handling large vessels, leading even the ports of Limerick, Cork and Belfast.  That port is recognised in world shipping circles by the masters and owners of vessels for prompt turnaround of ships.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="66" /> This Bill is long overdue.  I must refer to the famous section, section 13, which has been mentioned here today.  Prior to the Minister's decision to allow Foynes to remain outside the new port authority, there were many scare stories throughout west Limerick.  Everywhere I went I was told that the Minister would insist on the inclusion of Foynes.  I was told at the Limerick County Council meetings, being signalled out by the Opposition, that responsibility for the people of Foynes was mine at that moment.  I was told that I was pressurised by sections belonging to my own party not to support the inclusion of Foynes.  If possible, would the Minister make public the names of those who made recommendations to him personally and through his office requesting him to take in Foynes?  If that were to happen, I could see some people on the other side blushing, people who will come in here later today and take on the line that Deputy Wilson was advised to take by his colleague as regards Foynes.</P>
    <P>I am conscious of the position at Foynes where we have had between 400 and 500 people working.  For the vast majority of my lifetime I have been a member of the Transport and General Workers' Union and was always conscious of what employment and unemployment meant, also as somebody who all his lifetime was a worker.  I was one of those who emigrated at a young age in 1944 with a number of my colleagues in a ship to Birmingham where arrangements had been made with the powers across the way by the Government then in power here.</P>
    <P>Section 13 was used by Deputy Collins here.  He said that the Minister, for some deliberate reason, wanted to connive at a later stage to force Foynes under the port authority.  I am sorry that Deputy is not present at the moment, but I should like to ask him why did the Minister not avail of that opportunity last May when no change was needed in the legislation? I was one of those who made constant representation to the Minister in that respect and pressurised him as much as <Col N="67" /> possible.  The Minister for Communications is not somebody who yields easily to pressure.  He told me that he sat down for four days examining the position of Foynes, the achievements and the potential employment there.  For that reason he was satisfied to grant my request to exclude Foynes.</P>
    <P>There was, of course, disappointment in west Limerick among the Fianna Fáil members because they had already told the people that this would not happen. Two weeks after the Minister's decision was taken, I was literally abused at a Limerick County Council meeting because I put in notice of a motion congratulating the then Minister for his very wise decision.  I knew well what it meant to those people that the Minister had not forced Foynes in.  It was an awful blow to the Fianna Fáil Party in west Limerick because they had thought that they had something to handle, that they had a nettle to grasp.  Our party in west Limerick never lost an opportunity to ask the Minister to examine the position of Foynes.</P>
    <P>Foynes can be very proud of their record.  I remember when the extension was opened in May the Minister said there was a doubt as to whether Foynes would be allowed in but he made it clear to me he would only bring in Foynes under section 13 if they so desired.  Since that time the number of people employed in Foynes Harbour has increased.  That is clear evidence the Minister was right.  If the names of those who are opposed to my suggestion were printed in Kerry, west Limerick and Clare there would be many red faces.  It is only natural for people to concentrate on their own interests and think of what it means to their constituency.  As far as I am concerned I will never lose an opportunity to make sure that Foynes are on their own.  I hope members of the party opposite will not be influenced by others in their party from that county and change their minds.  I gave a commitment to the people and workers in Foynes and I wish to put on record my appreciation <Col N="68" /> of what Deputy Mitchell has done as Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>It is unfortunate that this Bill which has been the subject of discussion for almost 20 years should be the cause of so much frustration and anxiety. While the overall concept of an authority for the development of the Shannon Estuary is one which is broadly welcome there is widespread disagreement with the measure now before the House.  That dissatisfaction is not confined to the benches of this side.  Reservations have been expressed by numerous people on both sides on the inadequacies in the Bill. When you measure the potential of the Shannon and recognise the magnificent natural resource we have in the estuary which has not really been exploited up to now and when you look at the variety of interests involved in the estuary, it is understandable that there would be anxiety about the representation aspect.  The Minister did not deal with this adequately.  When the Minister visited some of the areas and met with some of the interests involved in the estuary he did not take into account the views expressed to him.  The representation which is in the Bill is not satisfactory from the point of view of those in County Clare whom I represent and is totally unsatisfactory as far as the estuarial sub-committee of Clare County Council are concerned.</P>
      <P>I should like to see a management development plan for the estuary.  Fish farming is carried out in Carrigaholt.  The oyster beds in Poulnasherry are being developed.  There is traditional salmon fishing from Kilfedane to Limerick city on both sides of the estuary.  Power stations have been built at Tarbert and Moneypoint.  Numerous sites have been identified and planning permission has been granted for developments of one kind or another.  When all that is taken into account one can see the need to have the fullest possible representation on the authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not happy with the legislation. The setting up of a management authority or an authority within an authority <Col N="69" /> is detrimental to the overall objectives that would be desirable from the point of view of having an authority set up to look at the management of the estuary, taking into account its amenities, environmental value and the uses to which it can be put. If you look at the speeches which were made in the Seanad you will see there was dissatisfaction there with the representation. Much concern was expressed by Senators.  I do not want to quote all their reservations but Senator Honan expressed clear reservations about the authority when the Bill was before the House in June.  Senator Howard referred to the representation from the Clare side.  He stated at column 869 of the Official Report:</P>
    <P>If the balance of representation proposed in the Bill remains unaltered there will be a serious imbalance and this will be against the northern bank.</P>
    <P>The northern bank is the Clare side of the estuary which is over 90 miles in length and comes under the jurisdiction of Clare County Council.  We believe the lack of representation from the Clare northern bank of the river will be seriously detrimental to the best interests of the port authority and to the future plans the authority will make.  There is a lack of representation from the Clare side.</P>
    <P>The Minister is well aware of the fact that the Kilrush Harbour Authority, who were the Kilrush Urban Council, are being abolished under this legislation. Nothing has been written in to the new port authority to replace them.  The Minister may determine who may be the representatives from Clare County Council on the new authority.  He could draft regulations to ensure there will be represenation from the Kilrush electoral area on the authority, but that does not get over the fact that Kilrush Urban District Council as a harbour authority are being abolished and there is no provision in this legislation to replace any of the people who are at present members of that authority. The Kilrush Harbour Authority have been a very forward looking and determined body in the promotion of <Col N="70" /> Cappagh.  Unfortunately, because of circumstances beyond the control of the Kilrush Urban District Council, it has not been possible for them to undertake the kind of development necessary at Cappagh and in the general area of Kilrush. One of the reasons for this, and it runs right through this legislation, is the lack of financial provision to enable them to do the work necessary.  The lack of financial resources to enable the Kilrush Harbour Authority to develop Cappagh has hampered them in their work for the last 25 or 30 years.  On numerous occasions Kilrush Harbour Authority sought financial assistance from the Minister even to undertake a feasibility study of possible developments which could be undertaken at Cappagh.</P>
    <P>As the Minister knows, within the existing financial limitations laid down in legislation, the Kilrush authority are not in a position to raise even limited finances to enable them to carry out that work.  In my view the main reason for the difficulties facing these authorities is the lack of financial commitment to deal with the major issues facing them.  It is a good move to get the Minister to consider what a new authority would look like from the point of view of representation and the objectives they should try to achieve, but an authority which does not have the necessary finances to carry out certain projects is one that is weak and has a foundation which will be undermined straightaway.  As I said, it was lack of finance which hampered the Kilrush Urban District Council from developing Cappagh.</P>
    <P>When Moneypoint was under construction there was a great deal of increased traffic using our roads.  These heavy vehicles brought by road materials which could have been brought through Cappagh harbour had it been developed, but the harbour authority did not have the financial resources or the legislation to enable them to raise the necessary finance.  When Moneypoint was under construction we saw little or no increase in traffic at Cappagh but immense damage was done to the roads of west Clare.  Enormous financial problems <Col N="71" /> were created for the local authorities who tried to maintain a road structure which was not designed to carry such heavy vehicles.  In fairness, the ESB made contributions to the council to enable some repairs to be undertaken, but the damage to the foundation of our county and arterial roads will not be remedied over the next ten or 20 years and will involve huge expenditure of taxpayers' money. Most of this could have been avoided if Cappagh harbour had been utilised.</P>
    <P>It is very disappointing for members of the Kilrush Harbour Authority to find, after all their years trying to maintain and develop Cappagh, that a new authority are being established on which they will not have any direct representation.  There are other areas which are not represented on this board, nor are they likely to be represented.  This legislation, I believe, is not satisfactory from their point of view.  When the Minister came to Kilrush a couple of years ago numerous bodies interested in the development of the estuary spoke to him and got assurances that their views would be listened to.  They are very frustrated and disappointed that their views have not been taken into account and that they will not be represented on the new authority, except perhaps by a Minister who might take their views into account when appointing his nominees.  This is not satisfactory because these people believe they should have direct representation so that they will have a say in how the authority will develop in future years.</P>
    <P>The smaller ports on the estuary on the Clare side have been neglected.  An interest in Clarecastle is being developed by a newly established company, CW Shipping, set up by a young Clare businessman, Mr. Whelan.  He organised a very successful operation to undertake some development in Clarecastle, and probably in other smaller harbours.  This will lead to extra jobs in the area.  People like Mr. Whelan are to be congratulated and supported, but what do they get form the present authority at Shannon?  They were frustrated and inconvenienced in every way when they tried to establish <Col N="72" /> legitimate businesses on the estuary because of vested interests and controls which are more or less decided in the Limerick harbour authority offices.  They decide who should or should not develop a business on the estuary.  Young people find this very frustrating and annoying. We now have a facility at Moneypoint that is creating additional business on the estuary.  There are young business people interested and willing to invest their time, effort and money in shipping, in tug boats, in the establishment of a new harbour at Clarecastle, and so on, but their efforts are frustrated because of the vested interests and controls imposed by the Limerick Harbour Commissioners. These people are being given the run-around. They have been forced almost into having to take legal action to endeavour to establish legitimate businesses in the estuary.  If this is to be the position under the new estuarial authority proposed under the provisions of this Bill is it any wonder that people are expressing reservations about the representation?  Is it any wonder also that people are loud in demanding that they have adequate and full representation on this authority so that there will be an end put to the restrictive practices at present frustrating young business people attempting to establish industries in the estuary?</P>
    <P>There are a number of development agencies operating in the region.  It is true to say that over the years there has been no co-ordinated approach to industrial development in the Shannon Estuary area.  There is the Shannon Free Airport Development Company, which deals with Limerick, Clare and North Tipperary, with no authority to deal with projects in the estuary.  The IDA have identified sites in Kerry but, to my knowledge there has not been a site identified on the Clare bank of the estuary in the 90 miles from Loop Head to Limerick city.  There has not been one industrial site identified or purchased by the IDA for any project of any importance at a time when the whole development of the estuary is supposed to take off.  On the other hand there is a different IDA regional office handling the Kerry side. <Col N="73" /> There is total confusion, with no overall approach to the development of the estuary from an industrial viewpoint.</P>
    <P>This may well be something with which the new estuarial authority should deal. Is it not odd, to say the least of it, that none of the development agencies with responsibility have any representation whatsoever on the new authority?  There is SFADCo, which has been responsible for the promotion of small industry, delegated to deal with the food processing industry and others involved also in the promotion of the overall duty-free area in Shannon.  There is the prospect of additional duty-free ports being established under legislation already introduced. Is it not odd that a company like that would not be represented on the new estuarial authority?  Would it not be sensible to have some overall approach to the estuary on the part of the IDA rather than having different offices, agencies and regional managers dealing with different areas of the river?  There can be no overall approach to development within the estuary as long as that type of attitude obtains.  It would be sensible and reasonable that bodies like the IDA should be involved.  Certainly SFADCo &mdash; which has responsibility for promotion of small industry and is very much involved in various parts of my constituency in the provision of industry should be involved.</P>
    <P>Would it not be reasonable that the fragmented approach to overall industrial promotion be examined on the establishment of a new authority such as a ports authority, that when appointing people to that authority account should be taken of that fragmented approach? There is the fragmented approach of two different regional offices, with regional managers, one dealing with one side of the river and the other with the opposite side.  Then there is SFADCo with responsibility but with no voice in saying how that responsibility should be exercised in the overall development of the estuarial authority as a unit.  As long as that obtains we shall continue to see the fragmentation and lack of effort which have hampered development not only in <Col N="74" /> the estuary but in many other areas as well.</P>
    <P>I believe that lack of representation is a glaring omission from the proposed new authority.  Before we reach Committee Stage the Minister might examine the possibility of ensuring that the industrial promotional agencies, whether it be the IDA, the county development teams, SFADCo or whoever, would have some input into or voice on the estuarial authority. If that were done, even at this late stage, we might eliminate the handicap suffered in the development of industry in areas like Shannon, Clare and north Kerry, particularly from the fragmentation, overlapping and waste of human and financial resources.  Certainly that should be examined on the establishment of the estuarial authority to ascertain in what way it can be remedied.</P>
    <P>In the estuarial sub-committee of Clare County Council established some time ago to examine the legislation and the whole area, to ascertain the possibilities for development, there was widespread criticism that the huge volume of revenue now accruing from the Moneypoint development on the Clare side of the estuary, is being paid directly to Limerick Harbour Commissioners.  They have been very critical of the fact that the revenues accruing from traffic moving in and out of Moneypoint is being paid to Limerick Harbour Commissioners, with no account being taken of the damage done already to the infrastructure in Clare by the development of that power station.  I want to emphasise, from the point of view of people in Clare, that it is most unsatisfactory, especially bearing in mind the hardship they have suffered with broken down roads, the breaking of boundaries and division of farms occasioned by the erection of huge pylons in the vicinity of the Moneypoint station. At a time when there is financial benefit to accrue to the region and county, after all of the hardship they have suffered in the past five or six years since the power station was built, it is indeed disappointing to see those financial benefits from Moneypoint going to the Limerick <Col N="75" /> Harbour Commissioners.  That is unacceptable to Clare Council.  I feel it is unacceptable.  A proportion of the financial returns now accruing to the Limerick Harbour Commissioners is entitled to be paid to Clare County Council.  The sub-committee of Clare County Council have said they are not prepared to accept the situation in which the fees generated by Moneypoint are paid to Limerick Harbour Commissioners.  Clare County Council want to see that situation rectified and fairly soon.</P>
    <P>The whole position in Clare is very unsatisfactory from the point of view of the provisions of this Bill.  For years and years we were given to understand that Clare would be given full and adequate representation on the establishment of a new ports authority.  They are not being given adequate representation and they are dissatisfied.  I want to express that dissatisfaction here.  Clare County Council are also dissatisfied with the way in which this matter has been handled by the Government.  The Minister for Communications came to Kilrush, he met Clare County Council and has met numerous deputations over the years.  It should be remembered that the Government have been contemplating this legislation for the past four years.  Even bearing in mind the views expressed in the Seanad by Senators of the Minister's own party that the representation is not satisfactory from our point of view, there has been no attempt made to change that representation.  Certainly we shall have to consider putting down amendments at a later stage in order to rectify that position.</P>
    <P>Overall the Shannon Estuary has not been developed to any great extent.  It is a piecemeal operation which is going on in different places and by different organisations with no overall co-ordinated approach.  We urgently need a co-ordinated overall approach to the development of the estuary, one that will ensure that people's rights are safeguarded, that there is a balanced development between the various strands of <Col N="76" /> activity that are taking place within that estuary area, that there is care and concern for the protection of the environment and that the magnificent natural amenity there will be relatively pollution free.  Every effort must be made in the overall development of the estuary to ensure that there will never be any prospect of polluting the area of the estuary which is pollution free at present.  In the overall balanced development of the estuary fishing interests, industrial interests and the recreational and amenity interests should be taken into account. There is enormous potential there for developing water sports and other recreational amenities.  That potential is unexploited and underdeveloped.  To date all these factors should be taken into account in a new estuarial authority who must be fair to every section, who will be reasonable in their representation and who will take account of the various and different views expressed in that area.</P>
    <P>We cannot accept any longer in my constituency the kind of mismanagement we have got from this Government in the past four years.  The whole prospect of industrial development in the estuary has been damaged by a Government who have been uncaring in their attitude to employment in that region.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce is demonstrating a very keen interest in photo-call sessions at present in the industrial area of Shannon to try to convince people that he has some commitment to industrial promotion and development in the estuary.  We are very sceptical about that.  We have not seen any major drive from that Minister to increase employment in the mid west region.  Any industrial development that has taken place in that region in the past number of years has been undertaken under Fianna Fáil administrations.  For the first time industrial jobs in the mid west region are declining, with a loss of 1,000 jobs this year.  Any of the projects &mdash; Aughinish, Moneypoint, the Tarbert generating station &mdash; or any of the developments that took place in the estuary or in the Shannon free airport industrial development zone were undertaken <Col N="77" /> by Fianna Fáil.  Because Fianna Fáil have been out of office for the past four years we are now seeing the result of the neglect of this Government, and in particular of the Minister for Industry and Commerce who comes from the region, in dealing with industrial development in this area.</P>
    <P>I was present when the Minister opened an &ldquo;industry&rdquo; in Shannon.  On the day of the opening I asked who was employed there but was told that there was nobody employed.  To the best of my knowledge nobody was ever employed in that company.</P>

      <P>The people of County Clare are very sceptical about any promises coming from this administration.  They hoped that this Bill would go down with this Government the same as the last esturial authority Bill went down with the Minister for Communications, Deputy Barry, at that time.  Unfortunately, the Government in a last ditch effort to try to demonstrate that they are <Col N="78" /> doing something in the region, are now rushing through this legislation to have it on the Statute Book before they are thrown out of office.  I suggest to the Minister that he might not go any further with this Bill after Second Stage.  He might just leave it there and let it die peacefully the same as its predecessor died under the last Coalition Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankPrendergast" hpid="Mr. Prendergast Mr. Prendergast">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Prendergast</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill even though it has very severe limitations, particularly in relation to the members of local authority appointees proposed in the Bill.  In that regard the proposals of the Limerick Harbour Commissioners in their 1983 document were far more generous than those proposed by the Minister.  Between 1983 and 1985 the Limerick Harbour Commissioners proposed that the Authority be comprised of four people from Limerick Corporation, four from Limerick County Council, four from Clare County council, four from Kerry County Council and one from Tipperary North Riding County Council.  They then went on to list chambers of commerce, the Confederation of Irish Industry, labour interests, shipping interests, Minister's nominees, the IDA and so on.  I had the privilege of serving for 13 years as a member of the Limerick Harbour Commissioners.  During that time we engaged in very serious expenditure on the development of the Shannon Estuary.  I am absolutely appalled at the lack of balance and downright ignorance or misrepresentation by some Senators from County Limerick and from County Clare, namely, Senator Rory Kiely from County Limerick and Senators Tras Honan and Michael Howard from County Clare.  Anybody reading their contributions in the Seanad and knowing the history of the Limerick Harbour Commissioners on their attempts to develop the overall estuary for the benefit, not of the contiguous Shannon estuary area, but of the entire country, could only be appalled.  One would question the situation whereby these statements could be made in the <Col N="79" /> Seanad without these people first having investigated the facts.</P>
      <P>In a submission to the Minister for the establishment of a Shannon ports authority the harbour commissioners outlined the history of their own position and their overall proposals for the development of the one single estuarial authority.  They stated that a single unified port authority, representative of all interests on both banks of the estuary as well as being favoured by the Limerick Harbour Commissioners, also received the support of Dr. Nathaniel Lichfield, planning consultant, of Dr. Brendan O'Regan, former Chairman of the Shannon Free Airport Development Company, of the mid-West regional development organisation and of almost all Ministers for Transport since 1965 when the late Mr. Erskine Childers was responsible for harbours.  They went on to say that the concept of a unified port authority meant that the existing harbour authorities would be dissolved and their assets and liabilities merged, that provision could be made for local committees for the purpose of preserving the links between the members of the local community and their traditional ports.  The advantages claimed for a unified port authority were the cohesive and progressive forces which could be generated by a broadly based port board fully representative of all the sectors on both banks of the estuary; the elimination of undesirable dissension between harbour authorities and others in the Shannon Estuary which, if allowed to continue, could have very adverse effects on industrial development; the avoidance of unnecessary duplication of facilities and services; the improved co-ordination of planning; better deployment of financial resources; and a stronger position than at present in any future negotiations with governmental and EEC funding agencies and with major port users.  That was a key factor in the whole thinking of the Limerick Harbour Commissioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Also, the fact that most estuaries in Europe were, or had come under the control of one authority since World War II was seen as concrete evidence of the <Col N="80" /> effectiveness of the proposal which we then submitted to the Minister.</P>
    <P>Following a report by Dr. Nathaniel Lichfield, regional planning consultant, in favour of the establishment of a unified port authority, negotiations commenced in 1966 under the chairmanship of Dr. Brendan O'Regan, former Chairman SFADCo.  The mid-west RDO took over from Dr. O'Regan in 1969 following which agreement was reached to set up the Shannon Ports Joint Committee in 1971.</P>
    <P>The Shannon Ports Joint Committee consisted of representatives from the harbour authorities of Limerick.  Foynes, Kilrush, the Department of Transport and Power and Kerry County Council. The committee worked well for over three years and in April 1974 submitted agreed heads of legislation to the then Minister for Transport and Power, Mr. P. Barry.  Subsequently over three years later in May 1977, the Harbours Bill, 1977, which contained provisions for the establishment of a Shannon ports authority was introduced in Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>The Harbours Bill, 1977 was not in accordance with the agreed heads of legislation submitted to the Minister in 1974 by the Shannon Ports Joint Committee. Provisions of the Bill were not acceptable to any of the harbour authorities of the Shannon Estuary, the FHT being particularly aggrieved.  The proposed legislation subsequently lapsed following the change of Government in June 1977.</P>
    <P>In November 1981 the then Minister for Transport, Mr. Patrick Cooney, invited representatives of LHC, FHT and KUDC together with Mr. R.B. Haslam and Mr. P.J. Barry to a meeting in Limerick. At the meeting the Minister stated that he believed that the general development of the Shannon Estuary could most effectively be achieved by the establishment of a single ports authority with control over the entire waters of the estuary and that proceeding in this way would facilitate future planning and development and would be of considerable help to local interests in promoting the estuary <Col N="81" /> as a suitable location for further large scale industrial projects.</P>
    <P>Following the intervention of the Minister, Deputy Cooney, it was agreed that representatives of the three harbour authorities would resume their discussions under the chairmanship of Mr. Haslam, with a view to securing agreement on the establishment of a Shannon port authority and that if, after a period of three months areas of disagreement still remained, these would be clearly identified, together with the reasons for them, in a report from Mr. Haslam to the Minister.</P>
    <P>The discussions concluded in January 1982 when the representatives of the FHT stated that the FHT no longer agreed in principle to a single estuarial authority and wished to maintain their own autonomy and continue with their responsibilities for the port of Foynes as outlined in the Harbours Acts of 1946 and 1947.  In concluding the discussions, the chairman, Mr. Haslam, stated that he had no other option but to report to the Minister for Transport that, while the LHC and KUDC were agreeable in principle to the establishment of a single ports authority for the Shannon Estuary, the FHT were not in agreement and, therefore, there was no purpose in continuing the discussions.  Recently, in October 1983, the FHT reaffirmed their previous decision not to participate in a unified estuarial authority in a letter to the KUDC.</P>
    <P>The situation there is that under legislation dating from 1823 the LHC are responsible for the waters of the Shannon Estuary, with the exception of those warters under the jurisdiction of FHT and the piers vested in KUDC, the county councils and the Office of Public Works.</P>
    <P>The waters under the control of the LHC include the Aughinish Alumina marine facility, the Moneypoint coal terminal, now nearing completion, the Tarbert power station oil jetty, the Foynes Island oil terminal (Cement) Ltd, Shannon Airport oil jetty and Limerick Docks.</P>
    <P>The LHC have always acted with responsibility in the best interests of the <Col N="82" /> development of the Shannon Estuary and will continue to do so pending the formation of a more broadly based port authority which the LHC believe offers the best way forward for the orderly development of the estuary.</P>
    <P>The LHC, in co-operation with other organisations (i.e. Mid-West RDO, SFADCo, IDA, local authorities, other harbour authorities) have always been exteremely active in the promotion and development of the Shannon Estuary over the last 20 years.  In recent years over £850,000 has been expended by the LHC in the Shannon Estuary in the provision of essential new facilities and services, in the improvement of existing services and in economic and physical studies, including the construction of the oil jetty at Shannon Airport in 1973, dredging studies for 500,000 dead weight tonnage vessels, and the provision of improved navigational aids, tugs, a new pilot boat and other harbour craft.</P>
    <P>There is considerable evidence in support of the claim that the availability of the vital data accumulated in the course of the studies initiated and paid for by the Harbour Commissioners over the years, together with their promotional efforts, were important contributory factors to the decisions of Aughinish Alumina Limited, which provides 800 well paid jobs and is a valuable asset to the country, the ESB, and more recently, oil refining interests to locate in the Shannon Estuary. The LHC's foresight in constructing an oil jetty at Shannon Airport was fully vindicated by the decision of the Soviet airline &ldquo;Aeroflot&rdquo; to refuel at Shannon using Russian aviation fuel imported directly through the jetty; this new business estimated to be worth over £4 million per annum provided a most welcome boost to the airport and to the Mid-West Region.</P>
    <P>In 1983 we published a report which highlighted the feasibility of developing the navigational channel to cater for 400,000 tonne vessels at the relatively modest cost, in current terms, of £5 million.  The findings of that study also disclosed that the subsequent cost of maintenance dredging will be minimal. <Col N="83" /> That report was of invaluable help in promoting the harbour as a deep water location to interested industrialists.  I presume that the law is based on the reasonable man.  I can understand very well the kind of local patriotism of public representatives and of people on local authorities who are afraid that by this whole concept of the Limerick Harbour Commissioners to develop the estuary as a whole, they were in some way trying to take over responsibility.  That is not true.</P>
    <P>There was great soul searching by people like me who were public representatives on the Limerick Harbour Commissioners when we put forward these proposals because we agreed to do so in a manner which would have the effect of limiting the powers of the Limerick Harbour Commissioners and extending them to people in the surrounding areas like the ports.  I am talking about Kilrush and Foynes in particular.  I have a vested interest in that proposal because I am the regional secretary of the ITGWU for Limerick and Clare and I dealt with the labour people on all sides of the estuary.  Therefore, I was very anxious that there be manifestly fair and just representation by all the port authorities in which my union, the ITGWU, play a very constructive, significant and worthwhile role as anybody who understands the situation knows very well.</P>
    <P>Therefore, it was with great distress and anger that those of us involved with the Limerick Harbour Commissioners read the downright unfounded and misguided statements by people in the Seanad and from other areas about alleged ulterior motives of the Limerick Harbour Commissioners.  As I mentioned in quoting from our submission to the Minister, all the evidence from all over Europe has indicated that we are best fitted to qualify to an optimum degree for European grants from what funds are available to us if we do so with an overall remit or mandate for all of the estuary.  This was proven in Rotterdam and it applied on the Clyde in Scotland, both of which areas have developed intensely as a result of applying that <Col N="84" /> format.  This and nothing more was what the Limerick Harbour Commissioners had in mind.  It was statesmanship, nothing else, the belief that the vision must always be finer than the view, and we did not want to get into the area of colonising the surrounding districts or taking them over.  There was nothing of that nature and I want to disabuse anybody who holds that idea that there was.</P>
    <P>The belief, the understanding and the accepted position of the Limerick Harbour Commissioners was that in the event of an overall unified ports authority Foynes, not Limerick, would become the nerve centre.  This was because Foynes unquestionably in the entire estuary has the physical resources and the wherewithal to deal with big ships that are capable of coming in.  This would benefit everybody in the region; not just Foynes and Limerick but Clare and Kerry and up as far as your own county, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, of North Tipperary, so ably represented for many years on the Limerick Harbour Commissioners by your colleague, Labour Councillor Tom Shanahan.</P>
    <P>In the brief time left let me wear another hat as Chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Commercial State-Sponsored Bodies.  I refer to a proposal which will affect directly the operations of all the existing harbour authorities on the Shannon Estuary.  That is the proposal by the ESB to become involved at Moneypoint in the bulk purchase of coal and its sale for commercial redistribution.  That will have a disastrous effect on employment and industry not alone in the mid-west region but here in Dublin.  I have before me a document, a letter from Coal Distributors Limited of Dublin, in which they outline their extreme concern at the fact that the ESB have drawn up plans to enter the coal trade through their new importation facility at Moneypoint.  The letter is addressed to me as chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Commercial State-Sponsored Bodies and dated 7 April of this year.  They say a planning application had been lodged with Clare County Council for permission <Col N="85" /> to erect the necessary plant and that more recently the Minister for Energy was reported as saying he would be introducing legislation to permit the ESB to proceed with their plans.  The company are upset that the State, which already controls or heavily influences 87 per cent of the primary energy input, was now seeking through the ESB to gobble up the remaining 13 per cent which is represented by the private sector in the form of the coal trade.  They maintain that such a development would have very undesirable consequences, including the total concentration of primary energy sources in the hands of the State, causing unemployment for the very large number employed by the coal trade.</P>
    <P>They go on to make the point that the ESB should not be afforded this right by way of legislation in that they could very well be <i>ultra vires</i> the rules of the EC in that they might be forming some type of State monopoly to go into other interests in that area.  It might seem incongruous for a member of a socialist party to appear to be opposing the expansion of the State sector.  I am not saying that.  I am saying that more than £835 million has been sanctioned by this House for spending on the Moneypoint project.  It is the largest ever single investment by the State and has not yet been completed. Before the ESB become involved in any ancillary activities they should complete what they set out to do.  Moneypoint generates 915 MW, almost 50 per cent of output requirements of the nation on the wettest and coldest day of the year.  They should first be going about that business effectively.  I am not saying they should not engage in ancillary activities.  That is all very commendable when done following consultation with other interests in that field.  There should be no legislation that would allow the ESB to get involved in a project that would cause terrible disruption in my city.</P>
    <P>We have had not one dispute in the docks in Limerick since the introduction of Limerick Cargo Handling Ltd., a model of its kind, following the Con Murphy report.  They will be completely wiped out as will employment in the coal <Col N="86" /> distributing industry in Limerick city, in Clare and in Kerry.</P>

      <P>The ESB need legislation to move into this distribution area and I am deeply concerned that they have already become involved in it without getting any mandate from this House, without Oireachtas permission.  Is this a &ldquo;test market&rdquo;?  I am anxious to establish that their present activities will confer no rights on the ESB in this area.  We are talking about taxpayers' money.  When the House approved this massive expenditure on Moneypoint no reference whatever was made then to this coal distribution and sale.  It is not directly related to the ESB mandate.  It is primarily to generate electricity, and it could be said that they are competing against themselves, because if I do not want to use electricity, maybe I should buy coal.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Education if in view of the continuing serious repercussions that have occurred since the withdrawal of a remedial teacher from a school (details supplied) in Dublin 5, he will immediately restore the appointment for the benefit of the large number of pupils requiring very special attention attending this school.</P>

      <P>Since the Deputy last asked this question in October 1985 and May this year, the application from the school in question for a remedial teacher has again been considered.  There is a large number of <Col N="87" /> schools applying for a limited number of remedial teaching posts and the allocation of this limited resource has to be carefully considered so that posts are created where the need is greatest.  I hope to make a decision shortly, following which the Chairman of the Board of Management will be informed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>The application for a remedial teacher in this school was made four years ago.  This is an area in which there are a lot of problems, and there is a great need for a remedial teacher.  Many of the classes have as many as 39 infants and a large proportion of them have great difficulties and often leave being unable to read or write.  There is a very obvious need for a remedial teacher in that area. The last time I asked this question the Minister gave me an assurance that he would look favourably on the application. I am disappointed that there has not been some success since then.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that that is the same answer I received 12 months ago on the same question?  At that time talks were on-going between the various agencies concerned with the health and psychological services appertaining particularly to primary school pupils.  When will they talk through their problems and come to a resolution? There is not an integrated psychological service for primary school pupils.  It happens in isolation and often there is no referral back to the teacher.  There is no link between the health services, the <Col N="90" /> psychological services and the school authorities.</P>

      <P>I am aware that a Department of Education psychological service is not available to all the national schools, but the service provided by the health boards is used very widely by the school authorities in the placement of pupils in special schools.  BA students cover educational psychology in their training in considerable depth and often the normal class teacher is well equipped to deal with the psychological development of the child.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 and 13 together.</P>
      <P>My Department has received sketch plans from the school authorities for the provision of a further eight classrooms and ancillary accommodation at the Holy Family national school, River Valley, Swords, County Dublin and these are being examined.  My Department will in the near future be in communication with the chairperson with a view to agreeing the level of local contribution for the project.</P>
      <P>Detailed design work may then be undertaken by the school authorities but the question of authorising the invitation of tenders will not arise for consideration until this phase of planning has been completed satisfactorily.  I am not in a position at this point to say when building works may commence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the delay in providing the future phase of building referred to in the questions, the Deputies must be aware that my Department are currently, and have been for some time, processing a considerable volume of applications for grant assistance for national schools and it is no longer practicable for my Department to provide grants for buildings before the need actually arises.  At present these schools at River Valley have a total staff of two principal teachers and 21 assistant teachers.  The original building provided 16 classrooms of traditional construction, and at present a further phase of building comprising eight semi-permanent classrooms is under construction and nearing completion, with grant-aid from my Department.  This will <Col N="93" /> give a total of 24 classrooms coming into 1987.  The third phase of building would bring the accommodation up to 32 classrooms, which should be sufficient to provide for the projected enrolments for some time to come.</P>
    <P>While every effort will be made to provide sufficient accommodation to cater for the enrolments expected in September of next year, I would not be in a position at this point, having regard to the prevailing financial constraints, to give an absolute commitment that the accommodation will be available precisely on the date required.  I have no doubt that suitable arrangements can be made should there be a timelag in the completion of the third phase of building.  I hope, however, that such timelag if it arises will be of minimal duration.</P>

Is he prepared to accept that full planning permission has been given for the permanent classrooms?  Why is there a delay in going through sketch plans and the level of local contributions?

Work is proceeding in that context as fast as possible. There were difficulties with the local authority in regard to planning as the pitch of the roof had to be changed.  I am not prepared to give an absolute commitment now that the accommodation will be available on the precise date because I cannot do so.

It is then up to the chairman's architect to prepare the working drawing, subsequent to which the bill of quantities can be prepared, tenders invited and contracts placed.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State gave the impression that the holdup was due to a planning delay in the local authority. Will the Minister of State confirm that there is full planning permission for a permanent extension and that the delay is as a result of the Department deciding to change the pitch of the roof?

It will be a matter for the Government to decide what percentage of that £10 million will be allocated to sport.

        <i>(Dún Laoghaire):</i> However, I am well aware of the excellent submission made by the Athlone authorities with regard to sporting facilities for that area.  Indeed, there were many submissions of a similar nature from various parts of the country.  It would be unwise to make announcements about things we propose to do until we know exactly how much money we have to do certain things and until we are aware of the amount of money which will be available for sporting facilities in 1987. At that stage, as I said earlier in reply to Deputy Mitchell, we will be making our plans known.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Minister is planning these regional centres will he enter into discussions with all the local interests so that these centres can be as multi-faceted and multi-purpose as possible? What I have in mind is that a centre of this kind could be used by a community as a major educational facility or as a religious facility so that the building would not be for just one purpose.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dún Laoghaire):</i> I fully concur with the Deputy's viewpoint with regard to the multi-purpose use of facilities. One of the problems we have had in this country over the past number of years is that we have a number of centres throughout the country none of which is entirely satisfactory for multi-purpose use.  Unfortunately, a number of centres have deficits as a result of not having regular income.  In planning facilities for the future we must be aware of the need to provide facilities that not alone help people to involve themselves in sport but will also generate income to help each centre run itself on an ongoing basis.  If there was more co-operation between the various communities and sporting bodies in particular areas we could make better <Col N="100" /> use of the moneys we are spending at present.</P>

      <P>It was submitted as early as June 1986 immediately following the advice on the second level allocation. Is the Minister aware of the serious deficiency in the discretionary non-pay section of the committee's allocation and that this very serious and large deficiency arises because this element is substantially less than the comparative sum <Col N="101" /> expended last year?

The school authorities will be aware that the purchase price sought for the site was considered to be excessive and that negotiations have not yet been concluded. It was also made clear to representatives of the school in the course of a recent meeting in my Department that because of the current difficult financial climate it would not be possible for my Department to provide an allocation for the purchase of the site in the current financial year.  It was also indicated to them that the Department had become aware of the possibility of suitable existing accommodation being available in the area and that the Department were obliged under current policy guidelines to reserve decisions on the provision of capital for new school buildings until it was evident that sufficient suitable accommodation was not available in existing school buildings within a reasonable distance.</P>
      <P>My Department will be completing their inquiries and negotiations in these matters with all possible speed and will then communicate with the school authorities without delay.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister of State indicate when official recognition was given to Gaelscoil Míde?  He stated there has been no change of policy.  Will he agree that a couple of years ago when a suitable site was identified and a price tag put on it, no matter how firm or otherwise, the Valuation Office confirmed they were not satisfied but gave an indication as to what might be satisfactory. Will the Minister confirm this? Because of the tremendous work done by the board in this case, the price tag has now been reduced to what could be considered a satisfactory level or consistent with the original level indicated by the Valuation Office.</P>

      <P>This all-Irish school was provisionally recognised by the Department in 1981 and was given permanent <Col N="104" /> recognition in 1983.  I am aware of the valuation the Valuation Office put on the site and there was quite a deal of difference between that and the price per acre demanded by the vendor.  I am not aware that this price has been reduced but I know that discussions have not yet concluded in that regard.  I am also aware, as was made known to the meeting in the Department, that there is a possibility of sites becoming available in the parochial school in the general area and discussions in that regard have not concluded yet either.</P>

Will he now accept that there has been a shift in policy with regard to this Gaelscoil?  The initial negotiations were on the basis of the purchase of a suitable permanent site in or around the general locality.  He has now put it to us that departmental policy is that alternatives in terms of existing school buildings should be looked at.  That, in fact, marks a shift in policy in relation to Gaelsocial Míde.</P>

      <P>I put it to the Minister that that is a very definite new shift in policy in relation to the Gaelscoil.  I am only responding, a Cheann Comhairle, to the Minister's mention of the programme for action.  This represents a very definite news shift in policy, particularly in relation to Gaelscoil Míde.  Is he now saying to me, to the board and to this House that the Department are taking a new direction in relation to their consideration of what might be suitable?  Is he saying the Department are satisfied that a primary school building in existence in the area in an English language environment is regarded as an appropriate environment for a Gaelscoil?</P>

Secondly, it is necessary that under the current policy guidelines being pursued by the Department alternative suitable accommodation, if available, should be examined prior to proceeding any further. Thirdly, discussions in relation to the site purchase price and the availability of suitable accommodation are not yet concluded.  When they are we will then proceed with the matter.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11 and 47 together.</P>
      <P>I have recently met with representatives of the Union of Students in Ireland and of Universities United on the question of third level tuition fees.  I am aware that the chairman of the Higher Education authority in his foreword to a report published in September 1986 expressed the concern of the authority about increases in fees.</P>
      <P>As the Deputies will be aware, the question of tuition fees and the grants and scholarship schemes are at present under consideration by the Government in the context of the 1987 departmental Estimates.  In these circumstances it will be appreciated that I am not in a position to make any further statement in relation to these matters at present.  I will, of course, as I indicated to the student representatives, be doing every thing possible to keep fee increases to as low a level as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the Minister's reply to Question No. 47 which he has taken in conjunction with Question No. 11, is he aware of statements by the Minister for Education at a seminar in Ballyfin College on Sunday last at which he is reported to have said that the days of high fee rises were over?  Will the Minister of State confirm that our students, and particularly their parents, can look forward to a fee freeze for third level education in the Estimates currently being prepared for the Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy may take it that all these remarks and reports will be taken into account in the consideration of the departmental Estimates. The Minister is aware of the concern of parents and students and also the relevant authorities in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>They are grand, sweet words and I thank the Minister for them, but they do not mean anything.  There is <Col N="108" /> nothing concrete in what he has said.  I asked if there will be a fee freeze in the light of the huge increases granted in particular over the past two years.  Will he accept that all the relevant documents, in particular the NESC document and the chapter contained therein on the provision for education, have pointed out that the high level of fee rises has meant that access to education is being denied more and more to sectors of our young population?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is aware, for instance, that if fee levels do not keep pace with inflation one would be reducing the element of income of the educational institutions which derives from fees.  It is naturally the intention of the Minister to keep fee increases as low as possible. That is being dealt with in consideration of the Estimates which are at present being discussed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12 and 34 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware of complaints at the late issue of results this year in the technological and trade certificate examinations and also in the area of secretarial studies.  In recent years, up to and including 1985, the results of the examinations referred to were issued at the end of September.  The Deputies will recall that the work of the examinations branch of my Department was disrupted at an earlier stage this year and that any such disruption has a knock-on effect on all the operations of the branch.  I appreciate, however, that the late issue of results and certificates can cause problems for candidates and for institutions, and I have instructed my Department to review their priorities and procedures with a view to ensuring that all results and certificates are available at an appropriate time in 1987 and in future years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. L. Fitzgerald Mr. L. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the results of trade examinations for block release students for 1986 were not issued until the beginning of October, almost six months after the examination took place?  By contrast the results of the leaving certificate examination were issued about 20 October. The processing of the trade and technological examinations has been given a low priority by the Department in recent times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason for the delay in issuing the results was due to the teachers' dispute.  Priority was given to the running of the examinations in May and June and to the issuing of the results of these examinations.  Traditionally, priority is given to those examinations which are perceived as being the ones for which results are most urgently required. In the case of the trade examinations, a <Col N="110" /> large proportion of the candidates attend block release courses of study and from the point of view of further study would not require certificates for a considerable time after the examination.  I have already instructed the examinations branch to examine priorities in this regard.  It is proposed to computerise the examinations system beginning with the intermediate and leaving certificate examinations.  I expect a significant advance in this area over the next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. L. Fitzgerald Mr. L. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the results are of critical importance to those going on to higher level courses.  They are particularly important to those students who wish to compete for jobs.  Without the evidence of a certificate they are placed at an extreme disadvantage.  Last year certificates were made available in May after special pleas were made.  That was almost 12 months after the examination.  There was no teachers' strike then.  It is not good enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The aim of the branch is to issue all results by 1 September and certificates by 30 November.  As regards the technical schools summer examinations, in 1983 they were issued on 29 September; in 1984 on 27 September and in 1985 on 26 September.  The examinations branch have been instructed to examine their priorities in this regard and I hope the introduction of computerisation will enable the staff to issue the results on time.</P>

      <P>Under the terms of the school lease, national school buildings are intended to be used exclusively for the education of the pupils attending them.

My Department have encouraged the use of school premises after school hours by community and other such groups.</P>
      <P>The position as regards post primary schools in the inner city area of Dublin is that the vast majority of these schools are secondary schools and are, therefore, privately owned and managed.

The existing school is to be converted so as to provide four standard classrooms and the overall accommodation will be six classrooms.</P>
      <P>The tender documentation for the project has been prepared and the question of the invitation of tenders will arise for consideration in the context of the 1987 capital allocation to my Department for national schools building which has not yet been determined.  I am not, therefore, in a position to say when building works may proceed.</P>

      <Col N="121" /> With regard to national schools in particular, my Department are currently processing upwards of 800 applications for grant assistance towards the cost of major schemes involving either the building of new schools or the extension of existing schools, and they also deal annually with a similar volume of applications for grant assistance towards the cost of improvements to national schools.  The precise dates at which projects may proceed must always be related to the exact capital allocation made to my Department in any year.

      <P>In the case of primary schools, nine applications for the establishment of all-Irish primary schools were received in 1986.  One was subsequently withdrawn, that of Castletroy, County Limerick. Three new schools were sanctioned at Portmarnock, County Dublin, Kilcock, County Kildare and Cobh, County Cork. In Monaghan, an existing school established an all-Irish stream therein, obviating the need for a separate school.</P>
      <P>Four applications, which came from Mahon and Parklands, Cork, Southill, Limerick and Ballycreagh, Tallaght, County Dublin, were rejected in accordance with the Rules for National Schools on the grounds that these areas are within reasonable distances of existing all-Irish schools.</P>

While the Minister may quote the Government's <i>Programme for Action in Education 1984-87</i>, will he agree that the Department are using delaying tactics to delay sanction of such all-Irish schools?  I put it to the Minister that the Department's words about the provision of such schools so that the furtherance of Irish can be encouraged sound fine particularly to parents who have expressed a wish to have their children schooled in that medium but that their words and promises are very hollow in view of the fact <Col N="124" /> that there are at present eight schools awaiting sanction?  Will the Minister agree with me that Monaghan had to give in to pressure when the Department refused them sanction for an all-Irish school, when they had to take the much less attractive option of having an Irish class within in existing school?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if she will make an urgent statement to clarify the situation for thousands of families whose social welfare entitlements have been drastically reduced by recent social welfare changes and in particular how it is proposed to maintain their income in the weeks and months immediately ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mrs. Hussey) Gemma Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mrs. Hussey)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the first phase of the equal treatment measures implemented last May the reduced rates of benefit paid to married women were replaced by the standard rates and the duration of entitlement to unemployment benefit for married women was increased from 312 to 390 days, thereby bringing it into line with that for all other insured workers. Some 46,000 married women and their families benefit from these changes at a cost of £18 million in a full year.  This was a substantial improvement in the benefit entitlements of those married women. For example, married women on disability or unemployment benefit got an extra £5 per week.</P>
      <P>Up until now, married women were effectively debarred from applying for unemployment assistance.  This position is now changed and from this week married women may qualify for unemployment assistance subject to satisfying the means test and providing that the applicant is available for work and is genuinely seeking work.  In other words, married women will be treated in the same way as all other applicants for unemployment assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the new dependency arrangements which also came into force during this week the existing presumption that any married woman who was living with her husband is automatically a dependant will disappear and any person, male or female, who is in employment or in <Col N="131" /> receipt of a social welfare benefit in his/her own right will, in general, not be deemed as dependent on the spouse for the purposes of qualifying for increases of benefit.  A person will be regarded as dependent on the spouse only where he or she is being wholly or mainly maintained by that person.</P>
    <P>There are also new dependency arrangements for children.  Married women, and therefore their families, will benefit substantially from these changes. For example, where only the wife works and her husband is a dependent she will be entitled to the full adult and child dependent increases as long as her husband is not on benefit.  At present she can only qualify if her husband is an invalid.</P>
    <P>In families where both spouses are economically active there will be offsetting gains and reductions.  In this case each spouse will be entitled to 50 per cent of child dependant increases when claiming benefits.  Up to now married women could not claim for their children. Reductions in the entitlements of some husbands will occur but this is inevitable because the previous adult dependency arrangement was not defensible.  Up to now the social welfare system gave a husband an increase for his wife not alone where she was in employment but even where she was entitled to benefit in her own right.</P>
    <P>The manner in which the measures are being implemented is exactly in keeping with the intentions of previous Ministers for Social Welfare.  When the directive was adopted by the Council of Ministers in 1978 the then Minister who is now Leader of the Opposition had a statement inserted in the Council minutes which made clear his intention not to provide increases in payments in respect of adult dependants who were either in receipt of benefit or in employment.  That insertion in 1978 read quite clearly:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Nothing in this Directive prevents arrangements being made to control dependency payments so as to avoid paying increases of benefit in respect of a spouse when that spouse is already <Col N="132" /> receiving benefit or is in employment, or to control payments of increases for children, provided that these measures are applied without discrimination on grounds of sex.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the insertion put in by the Minister for Social Welfare in 1978, who is the present Leader of the Opposition and the person asking this question today. Furthermore, the implications of the new dependency arrangements were fully outlined to this House during the passage of the equality Bill in 1985 and the Opposition had nothing to say on the matter then.  About 90 per cent of social welfare families are not affected by the new dependency rules.  Because of the new definition of &ldquo;adult dependant&rdquo; some married men will no longer receive an increase in payment in respect of their wives.  The Government were naturally concerned at the impact of this on existing recipients and have introduced measures to cushion the effect of the new arrangements.  Where a spouse is in employment with earnings of less than £50 per week he or she may continue to be regarded as an adult dependant.  The cost of this measure is an extra £4.6 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>A special payment of £10 per week is being made to a married man who, as a consequence of the revised definition of dependency, loses the increase in payment in respect of his wife.  His payment will continue to be made for the duration of his claim up to a maximum period of one year.  This measure will cost £4.3 million.  These measures are already in place and take effect this week.</P>

      <P>Families which qualify for the transitional weekly payment of £10 may also qualify for further assistance <Col N="133" /> in respect of rent or mortage commitments. This additional alleviating measure, which I announced on 29 October, is intended to provide further assistance per week in respect of rent and mortgage commitments to families who qualify for the £10 transitional payment. As I said in the Dáil this morning, I expect that the remaining details of this measure will be finalised by the Department within a few days and each individual family will be contacted by my Department.</P>
      <P>The only remaining scope for further alleviating measures is in the context of the 1987 Estimates and the Government have decided to incorporate a review of the equality provisions in their current consideration of the Estimates.  As was stated yesterday, any changes that may arise from the review will be made retrospective from the implementation of the new dependency arrangements.</P>

      <P>The Minister has spent approximately six minutes dealing with a category of persons who are not involved in my question.  I would like the Chair to bear that in mind when deciding on the length of supplementary questions which he will allow me.  My question specifically asks the Minister to deal with the situation of the poorer and weaker section of our community whose incomes will be drastically reduced from this week.  I did not ask the Minister about families who will be fortunate enough to gain.  I am asking her specifically about the very large number of families, 20,000 or more, whose already inadequate and meagre incomes will be specifically reduced as and from this week by the action of the Minister.</P>
      <P>Is the Minister aware there is deep, far-reaching anxiety throughout the community about the changes she is imposing and that that anxiety is added to very considerably by a great deal of confusion, that very few people know exactly what will happen?  Will the Minister acknowledge that this is the third bungling attempt which she has made to deal with this directive?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="134" /> First of all, we had the original proposal. Then, in response to pressure in this House from all sides, there was a suggestion that supplementary welfare officers could intervene to assist families who will be deprived.  Now we have a further statement, a climb down, a U-turn by the Government to the effect that something will be done in the context of the forthcoming Estimates.  Will the Minister acknowledge that the whole situation has been bungled by her and the Government?  Furthermore, will she deal specifically with my question as to what steps she proposes to take to maintain the income of families pending this nebulous and half-promised change arising out of the work on the Estimates?</P>

      <P>I would remind the Deputy that I have answered the question quite clearly in the first place but I am very intrigued by the Deputy's position on this.  From 1978 to 1982 the Deputy was in a position to implement a directive which he had personally designed from an Irish point of view but he did not do it.  He paid no attention to the discrimination against 46,000 working women at that time.  He did nothing whatso ever to redress that discrimination and, what is more, when he inserted that statement into the Council's minutes he had no thought of the alleviation of hardship. He never thought of the two measures which this Government put in to help people who would be affected by this.  He simply did not care about the equality issue.  He was absolutely afraid of it.</P>

      <P>I feel that the general public do not appreciate Ministers, particularly the Minister for Social Welfare, attempting to score cheap political debating points on this matter.  I am asking a very serious question of the Minister. I suggest that it is now acknowledged by the Government that there is going to be severe hardship for a number of families.  It is suggested further by the Government that they attempt to deal with this hardship through their consideration of the Estimates.  I ask the Minister to acknowledge that no action by means of Estimates or otherwise can affect the situation this week, next week and for the next month or so.  Is the Minister prepared to take any immediate action to alleviate the hardship which her action is callously and deliberately causing to a large section of our community, particularly in view of the fact that the arrangements she purported to put before this House in regard to community welfare officers are not going to work? Has she any other proposal to put to the House or to the people to deal with this very serious situation?</P>

      <P>I have already made it quite clear that the Government in designing the alleviating measures &mdash; which were not envisaged by the Deputy opposite when he devised the Directive in 1978 and did nothing about equality for the following year when he was in a position to do so &mdash; will put the worst <Col N="138" /> effects of what the Deputy designed in 1978 further from poor families.  Also I make no apology whatsoever for including extra alleviating measures with the assistance of the Department of Social Welfare which will as I said clearly in the Dáil on several occasions, today, yesterday and on other days, be contacting each individual family where both are on social welfare benefit to see what further alleviating measures we can provide.  It seems that the Deputy is asking us to undo the equality Directive, to take away the assistance that has been given to 46,000 families, to take away the married woman's right to her child dependency allowance, all because he is afraid to face up to the realities of what he designed in 1978.</P>

      <P>I can assure Deputy Owen that with enemies like Deputy Haughey I am sure of my friends.  The then Fianna Fáil Government in a decision dated 6 November 1978 declared that the Irish delegation at the COREPER meeting of 15 November 1978 should press for the inclusion of the statement I read earlier in the minutes of the Council of Social Affairs Ministers of the EC at which the Directive was adopted.  The Minister for Social Welfare at that time was Deputy Charles J. Haughey.  I will read the statement again: &ldquo;Nothing in this Directive prevents arrangements being made to control dependency payments so as to avoid paying increases of benefit in respect of a spouse when that spouse is already receiving benefit or is in employment, or to control payments of increases for children provided that these measures are applied without discrimination on grounds of sex.&rdquo;</P>

Therefore we spent an extra £9 million on alleviating measures and are designing a further measure to help people.  As I said, I make no apology for the Government having made a decision in the light of the concerns expressed that we will look again in the context of the 1987 Estimates and within the amount of money available to us to see if anything further can be done on a retrospective basis.  That is the present position and it must remain until the Government have had time to look at the money concerned.</P>

Does she believe that any family on low income can suffer a loss of up to £47 a week and survive without going into the depths of despair and poverty?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already made clear that this has been a matter of considerable concern to the Government. We have been at great pains to try to help people who would find themselves in a much worse position were it not for the alleviating measures we announced.  That has been part of our great concern.  Interestingly enough, we are being criticised by the Opposition for having expressed that concern.  It is important to explain that some families will certainly stand to lose money under this Directive but they would lose far more if we had not taken the alleviating measures we have taken. The families who are affected by equal treatment, even after the loss of that income, will still remain at the highest <Col N="141" /> level of social welfare because the vast majority of families in receipt of social welfare have not a spouse working or have not a second person in the house in receipt of a social welfare benefit.  That simple fact seems to have been lost sight of.  We have provided these alleviating measures.  We will be contracting 8,000 families where both are on benefit to see what further help we can give them with specific difficulties.  Furthermore, the Government in that context and as soon as possible will be looking at what further measures can be taken.  That is the position. It is far better than the position envisaged by the Opposition Leader when he designed that Directive.</P>

Does the Minister understand the effect these changes are already having on families in very poor circumstances?  Does she appreciate how difficult life is for them, even without this further deprivation which is coming at Christmas, a time when families are expecting a little extra rather than a huge cut in their income?

      <P>I and the Government have shared the Deputy's concern of the effect of this directive.  That is why we applied an extra £9 million to try to cushion the effect of the equality directive which on the one hand benefited an enormous number of families and, on the other, caused some difficulties where there were anomalies in our system.  Concern has been generally expressed about the position of social welfare recipients. I must refer to the claim made earlier in this discussion about increase in benefits generally.  This Government increased the rates for long-term social welfare recipients by 40 per cent over the past few years, well ahead of inflation, unlike the record which was so proudly trumpeted by the Leader of the Opposition.</P>

      <P>Before the adjournment of the debate for Question Time I was making the point that there would be very hostile resistance on the part of interests in the coal distribution industry to the involvement of the ESB in this whole area.  I quoted from a document which was a legal opinion from a Mr. Scott Crosby, solicitor of the EC office of Kemmler Rapp Böhlke and Crosby from their law office in Brussels in March of this year.  They said it would be illegal and <i>ultra vires</i> the Constitution of the EC Treaty, for the ESB to become involved in coal distribution.  They also made the point that any act of Irish public administration or of the Oireachtas to enable this plant to be built there would be illegal.  I appeal to the ESB to engage in the widest possible range of consultations before they consider going into coal distribution. I have received advice from our members of the Irish Transport and General Workers Union in the Shannon Estuary in the Limerick-Foynes-Kilrush area, that if the ESB persist in this without proper consultation it could well happen that the entire estuary will be closed down because the unions will see to it that the pilots whom they control are taken off the Shannon Estuary.  That effectively will put a manacle on the Shannon Estuary and on all business on either side of the banks of the river Shannon. I thank the Minister, above all other Ministers, because he had the mettle to grasp this problem and put it before the nation and the House.  I commend him for that and I hope that this Bill is enacted as soon as possible for the benefit not just <Col N="197" /> of the Shannon region but of the rest of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasMcEllistrimJnr" hpid="Mr. McEllistrim Mr. McEllistrim">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McEllistrim</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill because eventually we will have a unified harbour authority to control the Shannon Estuary.  The ports of Limerick and Kilrush will be amalgamated in one unit to be known as the Shannon Ports Authority. This is very welcome from the point of view of County Kerry because, in the past, we got very little recognition in relation to the Shannon Estuary.</P>
      <P>However, I am very disappointed that there is no allocation of finance from the Government to set up this ports Authority or for the development of the area within the Shannon Estuary when it becomes a port authority.  Efforts have been made over the years to set up this Authority and it is now being set up without Foynes participating.  The fact that Foynes is not included is very disappointing and this is probably what stopped the port Authority being set up in the past.  Foynes should be included because it is important to remember that 700 people work in the Foynes area.</P>
      <P>I said that no finance was available from the Government to the port Authority for its development.  Not long ago there was an investment of £4.5 million in Cork harbour but there is nothing available for the Shannon Estuary. Linked with the setting up of a ports authority, there should be a commitment from the Government to have finance made available in that area also.  In the past, the Shannon Estuary attracted heavy industry to the area.  There are two generating stations in the estuary, an oil generating station in Tarbert and a coal generating station at Moneypoint.  Tarbert generating station is half mothballed at present and, strange as it may seem, it can produce electricity much cheaper than Moneypoint.  That was not always the case as oil was dearer.  I often tried to raise this matter in the House and I brought it to notice of the chief executive of the ESB.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was surprised today to hear Deputy Prendergast say that he was disappointed that Moneypoint would deal with coal <Col N="198" /> distribution in the future.  This will generate jobs in the south west region. Deputy Prendergast said that this would affect Dublin and Limerick.  I can understand how he would be perturbed if Limerick were to be affected but we welcome the bringing of jobs to the south west and to the Shannon Estuary.  I am delighted that the ESB intend going into the coal distribution business.  I mentioned the fact that heavy industry had been attracted to the Shannon Estuary in the past.  There is the Alumina plant at Aughinish and the oil jetties at Shannon and Foynes.  Limerick Harbour Commissioners have been getting away with murder in the Shannon Estuary due to the fact that the dues taken by the harbour board for the last year were something in the region of £1,392,000.  A sum of £286,000 was taken in dues from Moneypoint and Tarbert but there was no investment in the area.  A sum of £275,000 in dues was received from Aughinish and £152,000 from the oil jetty at Shannon Airport.  That was a considerable amount of money collected every year especially when one realises that there was no investment in the estuary area.</P>
    <P>County Kerry has a great interest in the Shannon Estuary especially in view of the fact that the IDA have purchased 602 acres in the Ballylongford-Tarbert area.  There are 302 acres owned privately on the Kerry side also.  We are hoping for great developments in that area of the estuary adjacent to Kerry.</P>
    <P>The survey done by An Foras Forbartha a number of years ago stated that the best and most suitable part of the Shannon Estuary for a port is at Ardmore Point in Ballylongford, County Kerry. There is very deep water there &mdash; deeper than the Shannon Estuary- and if heavy industry is attracted to the area it will have to be located around the Ardmore-Ballylongford area.  The IDA have 1,000 acres of land to facilitate any industrialist who might think of setting up an industry there.  The An Foras Forbartha survey made suggestions on the type of industries which would be suitable for the <Col N="199" /> Shannon Estuary.  It named six industries. The first of these was an oil-related industry.  Kerry County Council have granted planning permission to a company for an oil refinery in the Ballylongford area of County Kerry.  They could also grant planning permission to other companies who may be interested in that particular area.  The survey also suggested a heavy steel manufacturing industry, a pharmaceutical industry, a heavy chemical industry, a lead smelting industry and a steel platform production industry.  These industries were suggested by An Foras Forbartha after they had carried out an extensive survey of the Shannon Estuary a number of years ago. When the Minister is replying, some time next week presumably, he should mention this survey, speak about it and say what are the views of his Department.</P>
    <P>In view of the fact that there is 60 feet of water at Ardmore, near Ballylongford, An Foras Forbartha came up with the conclusion that the Kerry section is the best location for heavy industry.  The Shannon Estuary is without doubt the finest waterway in Europe.  It is also the deepest waterway in Europe.  It is rather strange that it has not been utilised much more over the past four or five years. There has been no commitment from the Government to have heavy industry established along the Shannon Estuary, especially in the Kerry area.  That area is crying out for employment.  The percentage of people unemployed in the north Kerry area is 21 per cent as against the national average of 18 per cent. County Kerry has the third highest rate of unemployment in the country.  Heavy industry along the Kerry area in the Shannon Estuary would be very welcome.  I am disappointed that over the past four or five years the IDA or the Government did not make an effort to provide industries for us.</P>
    <P>I spoke about the advantages of the Shannon Estuary and the deep water it contains.  At the mouth of the Shannon there is 150 feet of water.  As you enter <Col N="200" /> the mouth of the Shannon there is a sandbar. The depth of water around the sandbar is 80 feet.  Inside the sandbar the water is 120 feet deep.  The Minister of State in his speech referred to the type and size of boats in the Shannon Estuary and said that if the estuary was excavated it would be able to take much bigger boats.  In the past I had a survey carried out on the sandbar in the mouth of the Shannon.  The sandbar is solid and if it were removed it would not silt up again. About five or six years ago the estimate I received for removing the sandbar was in the region of £2 million.  Possibly, it would be double that figure today.  We should be prepared to remove the sandbar as when removed there would be 120 feet of water all along the Shannon Estuary.</P>
    <P>The estuary is very suitable for heavy industry.  There are two generating stations and there would be no difficulty in providing power for any heavy industry which may set up there.  Tarbert generating station could be put into full capacity and power could also be taken from Moneypoint.  Kerry County Council have provided a very adequate water supply to the Ballylongford/Tarbert area. This area would also be very suitable for heavy industry.  Kerry County Council would be prepared any time to provide any facilities which may be required by an industrialist setting up on the Kerry side of the Shannon Estuary.</P>
    <P>The Shannon Estuary can take vessels of 200,000 tonnes.  As I said, if the sandbar was removed the estuary could take vessels of up to 400,000 tonnes.  Vessels of any size can shelter inside the estuary. The area near Ballylongford is a very sheltered area, and is very suitable for big boats.  In the event of a storm boats would have great protection in this area. As I said, 21 per cent of the population in County Kerry are unemployed.  At present, we need development in the Shannon Estuary.  We can supply the skilled workers from north Kerry.  They have had plenty of experience in the past.  It was workers from north Kerry and west Limerick who built the Aughinish plant and the Tarbert generating station.  Many <Col N="201" /> of those workers also gained work at Moneypoint.  Therefore, there are workers available in both County Kerry and west Limerick who are very experienced in the building of factories and oil refineries, etc.</P>
    <P>The geographical location of the Shannon Estuary could not be bettered.  We should all make a tremendous effort to promote that estuary in view of the fact that there will be an amalgamation of all the ports.  With the goodwill of the IDA, the Government and everybody involved, it is possible to attract industry into this area, especially heavy industry. Near the Ballylongford area, from Beal Point in County Kerry, the estuary is protected from the ocean swell.  There is great shelter and deep-water anchorage which can accommodate very large vessels.</P>
    <P>I should like now to deal with the setting up of the board.  I notice my county council will get two members.  Limerick County Council will have two representatives as will Clare, Limerick Corporation, the Chamber of Commerce of Ireland and the Confederation of Irish Industry.  There will be two people representing the labour force.  This gives a majority on the board to Limerick.  It would be much better to have one person selected from the Chamber of Commerce in Tralee or Listowel and one from County Limerick.  County Clare can put in their own claim, but at least we should get better representation on the board as the most advantageous parts of the estuary are in County Kerry.</P>
    <P>It is a good thing we will eventually have a unified port authority.  I am extremely disappointed that Foynes were not encouraged to come in.  That is a very important port where there are 700 people unemployed.  It would be a great asset and advantage to have Foynes included under the Shannon Estuary authority.</P>
    <P>I notice the Minister will have five nominees on that board.  May I suggest to him that these should be from the counties that are involved, that is, Clare, Kerry and Limerick?  I mentioned previously the Moneypoint project and <Col N="202" /> importation of coal by the ESB.  I believe there has been some agreement with some coalmines in the United States to import coal and have Moneypoint as a distribution centre for the whole country. I welcome that because it will mean jobs for the southwest and jobs are very badly needed there.  As we are going to have a unified port authority in Shannon, we should have free port facilities made available to us.  I notice that my colleague, Deputy Lyons is here today.</P>

It would suit the Leas-Cheann Comhairle's own county as well, because his county infringes on the Shannon and part of his constituency touches on the Shannon Estuary.  His constituency would benefit from this facility.</P>
      <P>The Shannon Estuary, as we know, stretches from Loop Head to Limerick, Ballybunion, Ballylongford, Tarbert, Glin, Foynes and Askeaton.  It takes in a very large area that is crying out at the moment for development.  There is great unemployment in the counties of Clare, Kerry and West Limerick.</P>

      <P>The development angle will be very important.  We will have to see a great investment in that area if we are going to have any development at all.  I assure the Minister he will get every facility from my own county and the council of which I am a member, Kerry County Council, if anything is needed for Shannon estuary by way of development.  We provided most of the facilities earlier in Kerry by way of land, an adequate water supply and anything else required.  We even approved planning permission for an oil refinery.  In the future when the authority have been set up I can assure the Minister that my county and my council will be active participants in this estuarial authority.  I hope we will be successful in attracting heavy industry to that area which will be the source of much employment in the years to come.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have an opportunity to contribute to this debate.  Before I deal specifically with the Bill I should like to refer to a number of points made by previous speakers, particularly Deputies Wilson and Daly who seem to be confused about which Governments were in power and who was <Col N="204" /> the source of inspiration for development in the region.  That is something we could deal with in an election campaign.</P>
      <P>There was one contribution which infuriated me.  It was that made by my esteemed colleague and a Deputy for whom I have the highest regard, Deputy Prendergast.  He came into the House and strongly criticised the ESB proposal for Moneypoint and their distribution proposal.  It is audacious of him to refer to a matter in another constituency in the manner in which he did.  The ESB proposal has the full support of County Clare.  His attitude was astounding.  He said that the ESB should not engage in ancillary activities or be afforded the right to go ahead with a State monopoly. These statements ill-become a man of his experience.  He said that if this development went ahead the unions in Limerick &mdash; he is secretary for the area &mdash; would close the estuary and towing and tuggage would cease.</P>
      <P>He has no mandate to make such a statement on behalf of the workers in Kilrush and west Clare.  The ESB proposals have the full support of the workers in Moneypoint.  I hope at some future date he will see fit to reconsider and withdraw his remarks.  It is very serious that man from the region should comment on a proposed development in an under-developed area.  While jobs may be lost in other areas other jobs would be created at Moneypoint and in the Kilrush area.  As a Deputy for the area I see it as my responsibility to outline this to the House and to state that the proposals have the full support of the people in Clare, the Clare County Council, Kilrush Urban Council and the workers.  I hope Deputy Prendergast will take that into consideration if he has any further remarks to make in relation to this proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and compliment the Minister for bringing it before the House. It has been a subject for discussion over 23 years.  It was discussed within the Government for some time.  Everyone recognises that the Shannon Estuary is one of our finest natural assets.  It is also regarded as a European asset.  We are <Col N="205" /> fortunate to have this facility.  The people of Clare are very fortunate to live along the banks of the Shannon.  The potential of the estuary has not been fully realised.</P>
    <P>We welcome the idea of a unified authority but we have strong reservations about the nature of the Bill and the make-up of the board of management.  So concerned were Clare County Council about the Bill that a special committee on the estuary was set up.  I am a member of that committee.  We made a submission to the Minister and he met a deputation. He has also heard from Kilrush Urban District Council.  Clare County Council are extremely concerned about the fact that they are the local authority which border the entire northern bank of the river.  We are talking about 93 miles in all. That is 20 miles more than the combined southern bank which includes Kerry County Council, Limerick County Council and Limerick Corporation.  There is one authority on the northern bank and three on the southern bank.</P>
    <P>In any future development on the northern bank of the estuary Clare County Council will be responsible for the infrastructural development.  They are the roads authority, the sanitary services, the planning authority and housing authority.  The responsibility laid on the shoulders of Clare County Council is not reflected by the fact that only two members of the council will be nominated to the estuarial authority.  I am gravely concerned about that as are the council. Some may refer to this concern as parochial or local patriotism.  The people in Clare are not renowned for their selfishness or parochialism but for being fairminded, progressive people.  We are concerned that this authority be successful and grow from strength to strength.  Hopefully it will be a vehicle through which major development will take place.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister and his officials listened carefully to what was said in the Seanad and in this House in relation to the structure of the authority.  It is imperative that the local authority which have a major contribution to make in infrastructural development on the bank be <Col N="206" /> adequately represented; otherwise the authority cannot work properly.  It is suggested in the proposal that only two representatives out of a total of 21 come from County Clare.  Kilrush Urban District Council is not mentioned at all. Despite numerous meetings with the Minister there is nothing in the Bill which refers specifically to Kilrush.  I appreciate that I have received many assurances from the Minister that someone from Kilrush will be nominated to the authority when he makes his nominations.  I appreciate his goodwill and have every confidence that he will do so.  However, in 20 years' time this Minister may not hold the same portfolio and a different Minister might not have the same commitment to County Clare, so that the proposed position might not obtain.  I urge the Minister to put down an amendment to provide for representation of Kilrush Urban District Council on the estuarial authority.  It is imperative that this be done.  I am not satisfied with an assurance.  It must be written into the legislation and be binding on any future Legislature.</P>
    <P>Much has been said about Limerick Harbour Commissioners.  I do not wish to be added to the list of knockers of that authority but one must examine their record.  It will be seen that it is not good. The record of Foynes compared to Limerick is quite interesting.  The development that has taken place in Foynes at the expense of Limerick raises many questions.  The tonnage that went into Limerick in 1985 was 485,000 tonnes.</P>

      <P>A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I extend my gratitude to you for giving me permission to raise this matter. I want to assure the Minister of State that I am raising it in a totally non-contentious and non-partisan way.  I am concerned about the matter referred to in <i>The Irish Times</i> this morning relating to the destruction of a late Iron Age monument in County Kildare.  I want to draw the Minister's attention to the implications of this happening from two broad general points of view.</P>
      <P>There is the serious aspect of the destruction of the monument itself, but perhaps more important than the actual damage done to the monument are the implications of this sort of happening. That would lead us to a decision to take come urgent action.  I understand the damage to this monument happened some time ago and it was only given publicity yesterday and today.  Normally I would worry about raising a matter like this in case it would direct public attention to the sites and perhaps involve a number of sightseers coming to the site and perhaps doing further damage.  We have to be careful in a situation like this not to exacerbate the position and cause unnecessary additional harm.</P>
      <P>The monument is one of considerable significance because it is a late Iron Age monument and because, until now, the only visible evidence of any significance was a standing stone.  As we know, critics suggest these standing stones are not of any great importance in that they could have been simply of agricultural origin, but this incident establishes that while there is a standing stone, it could indicate that there is an important monument involved.  That apparently is the situation here.  There is the lesson to be learned that standing stones, even single standing stones, may have far greater significance themselves than they would indicate, and they alert us to the fact that there may be important archaeological remains in the immediate vicinity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a bit disappointing that although there was a preservation order placed on <Col N="208" /> this site in 1973 the site has recently been severely damaged.  We have to ask what is the value of these preservation orders if, despite their being made, damage can still follow or, to put the question another way: is there something we should be doing about preservation orders to ensure that they mean what they say that they are instruments for the preservation of important monuments?</P>
    <P>The Office of Public Works are the body concerned and have responsibility for national monuments.  In this case they must offer some explanation of why the preservation order could be so flagrantly disregarded.  We go on from there and ask what action will be taken.  Apparently the people responsible for the damage are a commercial concern.  It is sometimes argued that protecting our heritage and preserving our archaeological wealth has to be modified by the needs of the farming community and that it is unrealistic, unfair and inequitable to ask farmers to inhibit their farming activities in the interests of ancient monuments.  From my experience &mdash; I do not know if the Minister would agree with me on this &mdash; that conflict rarely, if ever, arises.  Most farmers are as proud of the monuments on their land as anybody else.  If they are aware of the importance of the monuments farmers generally can be relied on to protect them, and certainly not to deliberately interfere with them.  I do not think that applies where commercial concerns are involved. People involved in building and construction, and indeed local authorities, perhaps understandably, give priority to other concerns rather than to the interests of our archaeological heritage.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will be able to tell us what action she proposes to take in this case, not necessarily from a purely punitive point of view but from an exemplary point of view.  Something should be done which would indicate to everybody that people cannot casually or with impunity interfere with our ancient monuments.  I am sure there is no need for me to emphasise to the Minister the growing interest there is in our heritage. It is becoming increasingly clear with <Col N="209" /> every year that passes that, particularly in regard to prehistoric times, or in so far as prehistoric monuments and relics are concerned, we have an almost priceless heritage.  For a long time we were aware only of Newgrange and its significance. Now there is increasing evidence that there was a civilisation in Stone Age Ireland about which it is important we should know more and more, indeed a civilisation which has left us a unique heritage.</P>
    <P>There was a booklet published some time ago &mdash;<i>Monuments in Danger</i>, I think, was the title of it &mdash; which showed that the situation varies from county to county, that in some counties the heritage is reasonably safe but that in others the rate of destruction is catastrophic.  I would ask the Minister to examine the position from that point of view, to have regard to those counties where there is a catastrophically high rate of destruction of our ancient monuments.</P>
    <P>I shall revert for a moment to the question of preservation orders.  Obviously the situation is not satisfactory.  Of course we need an archaeological survey of the entire country and then to go on from there to take the necessary effective action to preserve.  Some places have done wonderful work.  For instance, in Corca Dhuibhne on the Dingle Peninsula, there was an archaeological survey carried out which is of very great value and another has been carried out in County Donegal. What is really needed is an archaeological survey of the entire country and, based on that survey, we should devise effective preservation mechanisms.  It is sad that preservation orders can be made and then disregarded.  I suppose the answer there is to try to arouse public opinion.  The resources of the Office of Public Works, I am sure, are limited.  I do not suppose we can expect them to police every site or even the more important ones in the country.  Perhaps if we had a really informed public opinion, it would go a long way towards dealing with the problem. That informed public opinion should necessarily comprise all of the elements of the local community.  Perhaps the most important way of arousing such public <Col N="210" /> opinion would be through the schools. There are also many other ways through local community organisations, indeed through the farming organisations.  I am quite satisfied that part of the remedy for the threatening situation confronting us in regard to our monuments is an aroused and alert local body of public opinion.</P>
    <P>Apart from this monument &mdash; which has hit the headlines, as it were &mdash; there have been recently a number of other incidents which have been disquieting. There are people who should know better who seem to think there is something desirable, profitable or beneficial from their point of view in taking or removing artefacts from important archaeological sites.</P>
    <P>I asked to raise this matter on the Adjournment to get a report from the Minister on this particular incident but also to ask her to talk to us about the legislation on hands for this area, whether in view of incidents like this and others which have been reported over the past 12 months or so, the time has come for major legislation in an endeavour to cope with the problem and to protect our archaeological heritage.  It is still enormous, still unique but is under threat and, in some areas, even disappearing.  I would urge the Minister to give serious consideration as a matter of urgency to fairly comprehensive legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mrs. A. Doyle)</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend Deputy Haughey for bringing this matter to the attention of the House this evening. Indeed we have absolutely no disagreement in relation to the horrific act which has brought this to the front page of our papers today.  Can I say categorically that I deplore this act of vandalism, for that is just what it is and it can be called no less.  The company who own the land and who have desecrated this ancient burial place were well aware of its status as a national monument and of the fact that it was the subject of a preservation order under the National Monuments Acts.  Whether it was premeditated or due to negligence is beside the point.  They owned the land and had responsibility for <Col N="211" /> the safekeeping of the heritage it contained.</P>
      <P>For the record I will outline the facts of the case before moving into the area of new legislation.  The Long Stone at Kilgowan is a granite monolith about seven feet six inches high and is unusual among standing stones in that it has a small cross with slightly expanded terminals cut on one face.  It stands at the north west end of an esker ridge running north west to south east at an attitude of 400 feet to 500 feet.  Gravel digging in this ridge was noted in 1969 and this led to the monument being listed under the National Monuments Acts in 1971.  In spite of this, it was noted early in 1973 that gravel extraction was continuing to progress in the direction of the monument. The land in question had then come into the ownership of Naas Concrete Ltd.  who sought permission to remove the stone in order to extract gravel without further hindrance.  The Commissioners of Public Works responded with a preservation order in May 1973.</P>
      <P>The lands then passed to Spollen Concrete (Naas) Ltd.  Correspondence with this firm and a subsequent site meeting in September 1975, when the boundaries of the protected area were pointed out, elicited assurances from the firm that no further disturbance would take place within this area.  That bears repeating: correspondence with this firm and a subsequent site meeting in September 1975, when the boundaries of the protected area were pointed out, elicited assurances from the firm that no further disturbance would take place within this area.  Subsequent inspections indicated that this undertaking was being observed at the time.  However, in May 1985 the commissioners were advised by Kildare County Council that an application had been submitted by the Spollen Concrete Group for permission to extract gravel from various lands at Kilgowan including the area covered by the preservation order.  The commissioners objected to such operations within the area covered by the preservation order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="212" /> On 3 November 1986 the chief archaeologist of the Office of Public Works received a report concerning further damage to the site.  He immediately contacted the Kildare County Council who stopped the work.  The Office of Public Works arranged also for the site to be inspected on the same day by an archaeologist from the Office of Public Works who found that an access route had been cut through the preserved area to an area to the east of the site where further gravel was to be extracted.  Information was also obtained from a local antiquarian that during bulldozing operations on the previous Friday, 31 October 1986, he had noted two exposed inhumation burials, a head to the west and surrounded by flagstones and the scattered remains of other skeletons.  At the time of inspection spoil had been thrown up on either side of the new access route and also down the slope so that no archaeological features <i>in situ</i> could be seen although numerous pieces of bone and flagstones were visible in the spoil.</P>
    <P>Having secured the suspension of the work which was damaging the site, the Commissioners of Public Works are considering the action they must now take in pursuance of their functions to protect our national monuments.  They await the advice of the Chief State Solicitor on the one hand in regard to prosecution proceedings.  The commissioners are also in communication with the county council in regard to the limits which must be set to any future gravel extraction in this area.  I state unequivocally that court proceedings will follow if only for exemplary reasons rather than punitive reasons as the Deputy pointed out.  Regrettably, the present law is not a great deterrent in as much as the fines therein would make little difference to a firm such as we are now referring to.  I am horrified that a company of such repute should show such disregard for the heritage of the people of Ireland.  It is far too great a price to pay for progress.  The damage has been done and cannot at this stage be repaired. However, certain saving measures must now be taken to minimise the effects.  An archaeological investigation will have to <Col N="213" /> be undertaken to recover as much information as can be retrieved from the archaeological deposits which have been exposed but remain partially intact.  The spoil will have to be tilled back and this will have to be done under archaeological supervision.  The visual aspects of the site will have to be restored as closely as possible and this will be done.  Finally, the law has been broken and the matter will have to be dealt with by the courts.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer briefly to some of the aspects the Deputy referred to in relation to the value of a preservation order if this sort of thing can be done apparently without any regard for the law.  Our main problem in this area is the very richness of our heritage.  We have so many sites worth preserving and so many national monuments that the State alone could never caretake them all, much as we would like to do so.  We depend to a large extent on the vigilance of local groups and local historical societies. It was from such a group that initially this act of barbarism was brought to our attention in recent weeks.  I commend them for their vigilance and their interest in our heritage.  We all owe them a great debt of gratitude.</P>
    <P>Basically, the key to the problem of protecting our heritage in future is local vigilance.  Members are aware that the Seanad has completed Second Stage of the National Monuments (Amendment) Bill, 1986.  I hope to deal with Committee Stage in the next fortnight.  Among other things, we increased the punitive deterrents in relation to this type of vandalism of our heritage to the limit that we possibly can in relation to the fact that they are heard in a District Court.  Even if we were to increase them further and if the jail sentence were to be longer I do not think it would make much difference in terms of the case we are now talking about.  Money is not the object, it is a total disregard for the heritage of the Irish people.  This is an appalling aspect of the case we are dealing with today.  We have done what we can in relation to increasing the fines and/or jail sentence. We also included specific reference to <Col N="214" /> local interested historical groups in calling them into the whole role of protecting our heritage and caretaking it in as much as they can be our eyes and ears on the sites throughout Ireland.</P>
    <P>I hope when this Bill reaches the House &mdash; I expect it to be in the Dáil as soon as we resume after Christmas &mdash; it will have a swift passage.  There is an increasing awareness and appreciation by some of the wealth, not only in monetary terms but in interest terms, that these sites are generating.  We see increasing desecration, vandalism and thefts from these sites.  It is not wanton vandalism.  It is more insidious than that in that those who are desecrating and stealing from our historic sites and national monuments appear to know what they are after and know what they are doing.  It would appear they have a market or a destination for what they are thieving.  That is why it is up to all of us to ensure a very swift passage of this legislation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Haughey asked is it not time for more comprehensive legislation. Would that it could be.  Regrettably, if we waited until all the constitutional constraints were ironed out we would have to wait too long and would have to stand by while more vandalism and desecration took place in relation to our heritage. Even though this Bill may fall short of what all of us would like in some areas, it is far better than waiting for Supreme Court decisions to iron out any constitutional implications that may still remain.  The whole area of compensation is very vexed.  In the meantime it is worth while proceeding with the amending Bill, which we will be bringing before the House and which is now in the Seanad, as an interim measure, until we are all ready to proceed with more comprehensive legislation.  I know this will be welcomed by all sides of this House when we can sort out any constitutional difficulties that still remain.</P>

We incorporated all we could without getting into the constitutional area.  If we get into an area it will be immediately challenged in our courts&mdash;we have drawn interest to these sites &mdash; we would not then be in a position to follow through in relation to penalties or punitive measures of one kind or another.  We have gone as far as we can go.  We will be moving major legislation as soon as we can without any constitutional threat to the legislation.  We have taken advice from the Attorney <Col N="216" /> General in relation to this and he feels we have done as much as we can.</P>
      <P>To get back to the issue that brought us here this evening.  I was appalled when the details of this case were brought to my notice.  I was appalled that it was done by people who should have known better and by people to whom we should have been able to entrust our heritage.  Unfortunately, that was not the case and I repeat that the full rigours of the law will now be applied.</P>

      <P>In early 1985 it become evident to my Department that a number of problems needed to be resolved in the Clondalkin area&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>a shortage of post-primary pupil places in North Clondalkin.</P>
      <P>a surplus of places, at least in the short term, in South Clondalkin when the new Deansrath School opened.</P>
      <P>the need to provide suitable accommodation for the all-Irish primary and post-primary schools in Clondalkin.</P>
      <P>My predecessor considered that the best solution would be to place the three schools, namely Collinstown Park Community College, Coláiste Chrónán Vocational School and Deansrath Community College under the management of County Dublin Vocational Education Committee and for the committee to formulate an enrolment policy that would ensure the provision of post-primary education for all the pupils from the Clondalkin area.

On the contrary this sum was increased to £1.313 million to provide for anticipated expenditure on a number of projects include in the west Cork development package to be administered through my Department's scheme.

      <P>The basis for the general requirement of a minimum of four grade Cs in higher level papers in the leaving certificate examination for purposes of the higher education grants scheme is to give financial assistance to students who reach a high standard in the leaving certificate but who, because of family financial circumstances, might not be in a position to proceed to a university or other approved third level course of education. The higher education grants scheme is, <Col N="155" /> therefore, based firstly on attainment and secondly on the need for financial assistance. There is special provision made in the case of students obtaining a grade C or higher in higher level paper in the subject, Irish and mathematics, and also in certain science subjects.</P>
      <P>The academic entrance requirements, for admission to the various third level educational institutions and selection of students to be admitted to certain faculties are matters for the authorities of the institutions concerned and, also the NCEA academic entrance requirements are operated by third level institutions separately and irrespective of whether applicants for admissions qualify for higher education grants.</P>
      <P>The VEC scholarship scheme provides for financial assistance to students to attend regional technical colleges and colleges of technology and the academic requirements are a minimum of two grade Cs in higher level papers.</P>

      <P>The syllabus in civics in the curriculum for national schools urges that teachers should foster in their pupils a sense of national identity.  Among the suggestions made in this regard is the teaching of the history of the national flag and the significance and respect which should be accorded to it.</P>
      <P>In so far as secondary schools are concerned, the position is that civics is an obligatory non-examination subject for junior cycle pupils.  The special object of a course in civics it to ensure that the pupils acquire an adequate knowledge of, and a proper respect for, local and national institutions and of their own rights and responsibilities as citizens.  The national flag is specifically mentioned as one of the topics to be dealt with on the civics syllabus.</P>

      <P>The preparation of tender documentation for the proposed new national school at Frenchpark.  County Roscommon, is in the hands of consultants in private practice who have been engaged by the school authorities.  When these documents have been submitted and found to be satisfactory, the question of invitation of tenders will arise for consideration subject to a review of the accommodation to be provided.  This review is necessary as there has been a recent decline in numbers attending the school.</P>
      <P>A decision as to when tenders may be invited for the project must also await the determination of the 1987 capital allocation to my Department for national schools building.  I am not, therefore, in a position to say when building works may commence.</P>
      <P>Any delay in this case was mainly due to the fact that changes in the planning approach proved necessary.  It was originally through that to extend the existing school was an appropriate option, but this course was ruled out because of the poor condition of the existing building and on grounds of cost.</P>

      <P>The National Youth Policy &ldquo;In Partnership With Youth&rdquo; is being implemented on a phased basis.  As part of the policy, responsibility for youth affairs and appropriate staff has been transferred from the Department of Labour to my Department.  The pivotal structure for implementing the policy, the national youth service with a nationwide framework of local youth service <Col N="163" /> boards, is being put in place.  I have given approval for the establishment of 15 <i>ad hoc</i> local youth service boards in 1986. The remaining boards will be established in 1987.  Consistent with their primary role in the delivery of youth services within the national youth service, grants to youth organisations have been increased by £65,000 in 1986.  These increased funds allow for the employment of additional youth workers and the expansion and development of programmes for young people.  I have also provided additional funds for increased in-service training of youth workers, for programme development and for the establishment of a youth exchange bureau as proposed in the policy.  Total expenditure for 1986 on the national youth service is estimated as £5,439,800. The breakdown of this is as follows:&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Deputy will already, I believe, have received a letter from me indicating I had agreed to a rescheduling of the placing of a contract for work on the proposed new all-Irish national school, Tralee, County Kerry.  The details of this decision have been conveyed to the chairman of the school's board of management.  The two factors with which I feel the school authorities and the Deputy will be most concerned are that arrangements are now in hands, in consultation with the successful tenderer, for the commencement of work, and that a substantial capital allocation will be available for work on the project in 1987.  The finalisation of the contract arrangements will take some little time yet and, accordingly, I am not in a position to give a precise date as to when work on the site will start.  I will <Col N="165" /> communicate with the Deputy as soon as I have definite information on this point.</P>

      <P>There are two sources of funds in my Department's vote which would appear to cover the type of activity referred to in the Deputy's question, viz, Subhead E (grant-in-aid for Cultural Relations with Other Countries) and Subhead I (North-South and Anglo-Irish Co-operation).</P>
      <P>In allocating funds under Subhead E, I am advised by an independent Cultural Relations Committee on the merits of particular cultural projects abroad so as to enable me to take the necessary decisions.</P>
      <P>As regards Britain, a full list of projects assisted in the current year is attached.</P>
      <P>Under Subhead I, organisations which meet the criteria that their activities promote North-South or Anglo-Irish co-operation are assisted.  As regards Anglo-Irish co-operation, Anglo-Irish Encounter was initiated in July 1983 by the Irish and British Governments and is the organisation receiving such funds.  Encounter arranges periodic conferences and seminars on economic, social, cultural and other matters with a view to promoting mutual understanding and co-operation. In 1985 one such conference concerned Irish Studies in Britain.  Encounter has received the following grants from my Department's vote (Subhead E): 1984/85 &mdash; £30,000 and 1986 &mdash; £10,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate that it is <Col N="166" /> not possible to be specific about future intentions in relation to the disbursement of such funds.  In all cases the main criteria applied are the merits of the activity and the availability of funds.</P>

      <P>The local improvements scheme relates to farm road projects eligible for EC aid under the western package.  The western package includes the western region of Ireland designated as less favoured under EC Regulation 75/272.  In 1985, designated areas were extended under Regulation 85/350.  Arising from the first review of the package by the Department of Agriculture, the EC Commission is considering the question of the application of the package to the additional areas designated in 1985.  If the Commission agrees to this proposal, the local authorities concerned will then be notified to this effect.</P>

In fact, I am glad to say, there has been a substantial decrease in the number of deaths due to road accidents over recent years.  In 1978, for example, the figure was 628.  The figures for the last three complete years show a very welcome reduction &mdash; 535 in 1983;465 in 1984 and 410 in 1985 and there is good reason to hope that this downward trend will be maintained in the present year.  Provisional figures issued by the Garda Commissioner for the first nine months of this year show that the number of persons killed in road accidents is 266, as compared to a figure of 314 for the same period in 1985.  I am glad to say too that numbers of serious injury cases also continue to decline.</P>
      <P>I need hardly say that the figures I have quoted, while showing an improving situation, give absolutely no grounds for complacency.  I believe that very many of the tragic accidents that occur are avoidable through the exercise of still greater care by all road users.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the suggestion that a special police traffic crops should be set up, the Garda Traffic Corps are, of course, <Col N="182" /> already established and operating in all Garda divisions.</P>
    <P>The Garda Síochána can be relied upon to continue to discharge the vital role they have in relation to the protection of road users.  I wish to make the point, however, without in any way diminishing the contribution that the gardai have to make in this area, that road safety is a matter for which we must all be prepared to accept our own share of responsibility.</P>

The view is that any available finances should go towards providing much needed additional places in third level education rather than using funds on hostel accommodation.  The Department would be prepared to consider on its merits a proposal from NIHE and TCE for the provision of self-financing student hostel accommodation on or off the plassey campus, providing that it catered for the needs of the students of both institutions and was supported by both of them.  The Department would, however, prefer to see accommodation for the students in NIHE and ICE provided by private interests off the Plassey campus with the general support of both institutions and in co-operation with them.</P>

      <P>The proposals originally approved in principle to be grant-aided by my Department for Castledermot national school, County Kildare, were the provision of an extension which would give the school nine classrooms overall.  Because of the constraints of the site and the educational requirements of the scheme, it was necessary for my Department to propose a two-storey design for a proposed extension of two classrooms.  The local authority refused to grant permission for the development and an appeal against the decision was also rejected.  My Department's professional advisers are at present considering possible revisions of their design approach, and also have under consideration proposals submitted from a design consultant engaged independently by the school authorities.  My Department have noted that enrolments have declined at the school, and are having projections of enrolments reassessed with a view to establishing whether all of the accommodation proposed in the extension may be required in the long term.  The outcome of the reassessment will be communicated to the school authorities as soon as possible.

The processes still to be pursued prior to the starting of the project are: preparation of the tender documentation, the invitation of tenders and the placing of a contract.  I am not, however, at this stage <Col N="193" /> in a position to project a likely time schedule for these processes.</P>

      <P>My Department have agreed in principle to grant-aid the cost of a prefabricated building to replace the present accommodation used by the No.2 national school, Monasterevan, County Kildare. The accommodation to be provided comprises a classroom, toilets and ancillary facilities.  The processes still to be pursued prior to the starting of the project are the submission of a report on the result of the tender competition for the project, and subject to receipt of a satisfactory result and a sufficient capital provision to my Department in 1987 for national school building, the placing of a contract.  I am not, however, at this stage in a position to project a likely time schedule for these processes.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Education the reason for the delay regarding the grant for the provision of toilets at the Church Avenue national school, the plans for which were drawn up by the Office of Public Works some considerable time ago in August 1985; and if he will notify Deputy Keating when this money will be made available.</P>

      <P>The scheme which my Department requested the Office of Public Works to draw up for provision of new toilets for Drumcondra national school, Church Avenue, Dublin proved to be too costly. My Department's professional advisers <Col N="194" /> are considering the question of a revision of the scheme and the details will be conveyed to the school authorities as soon as possible.  The matter to be resolved at present is not so much the availability of a grant allocation but the question of securing a scheme at reasonable cost.  I will, however, arrange for the Deputy to be informed of developments.</P>

      <P>The lease referred to in the question was drawn up between the Commissioners of Public Works, and, jointly the Sisters of Mercy and His Grace, the Archbishop of Tuam.

I am satisfied that all the terms of the lease have been complied with in full.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Labour if the duration of the work experience programme for a person (details supplied) in County Wexford could be extended beyond the six months period <Col N="195" /> in view of the fact that her entitlement for unemployment benefit would be at a higher rate of payment than the current level of pay with the work experience programme.</P>

      <P>The work experience programme administered by the National Manpower Service of my Department is designed to help young people who have left the educational system and who have not yet secured their first job.  Under the programme, participants are placed, with the co-operation of employers, in a variety of workplaces and obtain real experience of the world of work.  Each programme lasts for 26 weeks and participants are paid a weekly allowance of £34.50.  In order to ensure that the maximum number of young persons can benefit from the scheme, no programme is extended beyond the 26 weeks period. This ensures the best possible use of the funds available and also ensures that suitable work experience places are shared among the young people available.</P>
      <P>I regret that, in view of all the circumstances, it is not possible for me to extend the work experience programme in which the young person, about whom the Deputy asks, is participating.  The Department of Social Welfare operates a scheme under which it is possible for unemployed persons to undertake voluntary work without affecting their entitlement to unemployment benefit or assistance.  This scheme may be of help in this case.  Inquiries can be made at any employment exchange or office and I have passed details to the Deputy.</P>
      <P>I should like to assure the person in question that the National Manpower Service will make every effort to help her find employment suitable to her needs.</P>
