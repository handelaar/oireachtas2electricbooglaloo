      <P>Referring to something said yesterday by the Minister of State, Deputy Barrett, let me ask the Taoiseach what is the position regarding the Estimates this year and when may we expect the Book of Estimates to be published? I remind the Taoiseach that we are already, according to the Government's programme, at least two months behind time.  Perhaps even at this stage the Taoiseach will tell me when we may expect the Book of Estimates.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This Bill is a first step towards a radical overhaul of the legislation governing building societies.  Its purpose is to deal with a number of matters relating to the operations of societies which have given rise to some dissatisfaction with the societies among the general public, while at the same time enabling societies to expand their services by permitting them for the first time to engage in lending other than by way of mortgage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before I go on to outline the measures contained in the Bill, I feel it is incumbent on me to refer to recent developments in relation to building society interest rates. When I met with the Irish Building Societies Association on a number of occasions recently, I made it clear to them that the level of any increase in interest rates should be determined in a responsible way, taking account of the potential impact on borrowers and the housing programme.  Following the failure of the association to reach a common agreement on rates, one society has announced an increase of 3 per cent in their mortgage rate.  I am convinced that this is an overreaction to developments in the financial marketplace and imposes an unnecessary burden on the society's borrowers.  The level of the increase is particularly disappointing when account is taken of the structuring of the most recent interest rate increases by some of the associated banks, which were designed to alleviate the impact on personal borrowers.  The attitude behind this decision must give rise to some reconsideration on my part of possible further legislative proposals which could confer wider powers on societies.  With power comes responsibility and the latest developments do nothing to enhance my confidence in the sense of responsibility of some, at least, of the societies.  I think the House may take it that I shall be <Col N="952" /> returning to this topic again in the near future.</P>
    <P>I propose now to spell out briefly the areas covered by the Bill:</P>
    <P>&mdash;It will allow building societies, for the first time to advance loans other than on the security of a mortgage. My intention is, initially, to permit societies to advance bridging finance;</P>
    <P>&mdash;It will prohibit the charging of tiered interest rates to existing borrowers by any society where such a regime did not apply on 1 August last;</P>
    <P>&mdash;It will place a total prohibition on tiered rates for all loans taken out on or after 23 October as from a date some six months after the passing of the Act.  This latter clause is to allow the societies time to adjust their offer rates accordingly;</P>
    <P>&mdash;It will also enable rules to be prescribed for societies in relation to the following matters:</P>
    <P>(a)  Prohibiting or restricting the charging of redemption fees when a person is paying off a mortgage.  This is an unnecessary and unfair charge imposed on building societies' customers when they are actually in the process of paying back the sum outstanding;</P>
    <P>(b)  The making available by the society to the borrower of the valuer's report on the house being purchased. I consider this to be reasonable when one realises that the borrower pays for the cost of such report;</P>
    <P>(c)  The right of the customer to freedom of choice in deciding with which company to insure the house;</P>
    <P>(d)  Precluding or restricting the building society from charging the customer its legal costs in investigating title, thereby removing the present burden on borrowers of having to pay two sets of legal fees at time of purchase; and</P>
    <P>(e)  The arranging by a building <Col N="953" /> society with an insurance company of mortgage protection insurance for its borrowers.</P>
    <P>The value of the contribution made by building societies to the housing programme, particularly over the past twenty years or so, has been acknowledged time and again.  As the major source of mortgage finance for house purchase &mdash; last year they provided some 64 per cent of the total &mdash; their practices, charges and interest rates have a very direct bearing on the lives of a large segment of the population.  House purchase is the biggest financial commitment undertaken by the average person and the costs involved &mdash; both initially and for many years afterwards &mdash; can represent a very sizeable demand on the individual's financial resources.  For this reason, it is reasonable for the public to expect that we, as legislators, will ensure that the framework within which building societies operate will afford the borrower a degree of protection against practices the justification for which, to say the least, is questionable.</P>
    <P>The building societies, for their part, have more and more forcefully insisted on the need for legislative changes which would free them from some of the restrictions under which they operate at present.  Deputies will be well aware of the major changes that have been taking place in financial services on a worlwide basis, with many institutions exploring areas outside their own traditional field of operation.  An aspect of this development has been the recent enactment of a new Building Societies Act in Britain.  Given the fundamental similarities between our own societies and their British counterparts, it is not surprising that the Irish societies should seek a similar widening of their powers; the pressure in this direction is all the greater since that new British legislation will permit societies to have subsidiaries in other countries, including Ireland.  Such a subsidiary operating here would, of course, have to meet the requirements of our own law regarding <Col N="954" /> the establishment of societies and the conduct of their business.</P>
    <P>At EEC level, discussion has commenced on a draft directive on mortgage credit designed to permit community mortgage credit institutions to establish themselves in member states other than their own and also to provide their services across national boundaries.  While it will certainly be some years before this draft directive reaches implementation stage, it is clearly necessary for Irish building societies to gear themselves for a new era which will present them with both opportunities and challenges.</P>
    <P>Conscious both of a degree of public dissatisfaction with some aspects of building society operations and of the need to face up to the changes in the financial services area, the Government last year set up an inter-departmental committee to consider the operations of building societies and the legislative and regulatory environment within which they operate.  Following consideration of the report of this committee, a discussion document was issued on which various interested parties were invited to make submissions.  I am using the document itself, together with these submissions, as a starting point in the development of legislative proposals.  There are many complex issues to consider in shaping these proposals, and in order not to delay the implementation of certain measures about which there is a widespread consensus, I invited the Irish Building Societies Association to agree to the adoption of a voluntary code of practice.  This would have dealt with certain building society practices which have been a cause of regular complaint from the general public and which were adverted to in the discussion document.  The IBSA indicated, however that they would prefer to have detailed and full discussion on an entire range of matters which could be considered and addressed in legislation.</P>
    <P>The Association wishes to discuss a range of issues as broad as those covered in the recent British legislation to which I have referred.  As this Act is almost 300 pages long and includes some 20 schedules, Deputies will appreciate that it <Col N="955" /> could have taken a very considerable length of time indeed to complete the discussions which the building societies were seeking and to prepare and draft legislation which might emanate as a result.  Meanwhile, house purchasers would continue to suffer from the practices to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>Another factor in my decision to proceed at once with the short Bill we now have before us was the step taken by a major building society in announcing the introduction of tiered rates of interest on mortgage loans.  Not only did this seem to me to be a retrograde step, at a time when competitive forces have eliminated tiered rates elsewhere but I was particularly taken aback by the downright unfairness of applying these tiered rates to existing borrowers.  Many of these would, of course, have chosen the society in question because of their policy of applying the standard mortgage rate to all loans.  While they would, of course, understand that the interest rate was variable, in accordance with normal building society policy, they would have had every reason to assume that the variation would simply be in response to the normal economic and financial forces which influenced societies &mdash; until yesterday &mdash; in setting their general level of rates.  They would not have expected the society to change the ground rules for their borrowers after their mortgages had been executed.</P>
    <P>I would now like to fill in a little more detail regarding the areas covered by the Bill, which I summarised at the outset.</P>
    <P>Section 2, while it simply amends a definition in the 1976 Act, is of very fundamental and potentially far reaching importance.  This is because the definition in question is that of the very term &ldquo;building society&rdquo;.  Up to now, societies have, by definition, been limited to raising funds in a number of ways for the purpose of making loans to members secured by way of a mortgage.  Under the new definition, in addition to the making of mortgage loans, a society is defined as an institution with the further purpose of making loans &ldquo;with or without security&rdquo;<Col N="956" /> in accordance with regulations made by the Minister for the Environment under section 3 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 3, complements the provisions of section 2 by setting out the power of the Minister for the Environment to prescribe these regulations.  These can deal with the purposes of and conditions attaching to loans, other than the rate of interest, and can also specify whether or what security is required.  This power is exercisable after consultation with the Registrar of Building Societies, who is responsible for the prudential supervision of societies, and with the consent of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>An ancillary power to make regulations is also conferred by section 3; the Building Societies Acts may be amended in such ways &ldquo;as may reasonably be necessary or proper&rdquo; as a consequence of the regulations concerning new types of loans.  A positive resolution of both Houses will be necessary to give effect to such regulations.</P>
    <P>As I have indicated, the powers under section 3 will be used, initially, to permit building societies to offer bridging finance to their borrowers.  I hope that this power which introduces a new element of competition into the market for bridging finance will be used in a manner that will confer advantages on borrowers and that will be a first demonstration of the ability of societies to offer new services on attractive terms.  I will certainly be observing closely the use that is made of this new power and I will be influenced by what I see when considering what wider powers might be conferred on societies both under this section and in the context of further legislation.</P>
    <P>I have referred to the question of tiered interest rates and to my disappointment and surprise at attempts to spread a practice that should instead, I believe, be dying out.  Section 4 contains the measures which I have promised to deal with this issue.  Deputies will be well aware of what is meant by tiered rates: for the purpose of the Bill, we have defined the term, in section 4 as an interest rate on a <Col N="957" /> loan which is determined either by the amount of the loan or the amount outstanding at any time, and which is higher than the lowest rate available to members of the society generally.  In this context, &ldquo;loan&rdquo; means a loan secured by a mortgage relating to a dwelling.</P>
    <P>Tiered rates will be prohibited where the mortgage was created before 1 August 1986 and a tiered rate was not being charged on that date; and where the mortgage was created on or after 23 October &mdash; the date of publication of the Bill.</P>
    <P>However, in this latter case, the restriction on charging a tiered rate will apply after some six months has elapsed from the passing of the Act.  This is to allow societies who now operate on the basis of tiered rates to bring their interest rate structure on the investment side into line with the new requirements on the lending side.  After the six month period to which I have referred, however, tiered rates cannot be charged on loans taken out on or after the publication date of this Bill. These measures thus herald the end of the practice of charging tiered rates for all future loans.</P>
    <P>As a natural consequence of the prohibitions on tiered rates which I have outlined, section 5 confers on any borrower who is charged a tiered rate in contravention of the preceding provisions the right to recover from the society any excess amount he has been charged.  It also specifies that a borrower cannot be held to be in breach of his mortgage agreement by refusing to pay any excess amount demanded through the imposition of a tiered rate in contravention of the provisions of section 4.</P>
    <P>Section 6 confers on the Minister for the Environment the right, after consultation with the Registrar of Building Societies, to prescribe rules in respect of several important matters.  These powers are in addition to powers already conferred by section 10 of the 1976 Act. Rules prescribed under the new powers will become part of the rules of any society to which the regulations apply one month after the making of the regulations.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="958" /> Perhaps one of the most important matters on which rules can be prescribed from the borrowers' point of view, is the prohibiting or restricting of the charging of redemption fees.  As Deputies will know, the rules of societies generally allow a charge of several months interest to be charged where a borrower wishes to redeem his loan.  As I have already indicated, this strikes me as a most unfair and unjustified charge.  Indeed, one might well expect to be rewarded, rather than punished, for early repayment of a loan.  The justifications sometimes offered &mdash; administration costs, losses while seeking a new outlet for the money &mdash; are not at all convincing keeping in mind the size of the charges and the fact that societies are in a position to invest any surplus funds they may have in a range of very profitable investments.</P>
    <P>Another practice that has been the subject of much annoyance to many building society borrowers is the refusal of societies to give the borrower sight of the valuation report on the property &mdash; while nonetheless expecting him or her to pay for it.  Again, this is a blatantly unfair practice, and the Restrictive Practices Commission have recommended the making of a restrictive practices order to deal with it.  Instead, I am taking the opportunity of dealing with it in the present Bill by providing for the power to prescribe a suitable rule or rules.  The Restrictive Practices Commission have also recommended measures to deal with the restrictions imposed by societies on the choice of insurer on the property securing the loan.  This clearly restricts competition in the insurance market and prevents a borrower from choosing an insurer of his choice and seeking the best terms available.  Again, there is provision in section 6 for the prescribing of a rule removing or restricting the right of a society to limit the borrower's choice in this way.</P>
    <P>The expense involved in house purchase is such that one would imagine that the best interests of lending institutions, as well as borrowers, would best be served by ensuring that no unnecessary <Col N="959" /> additional burden is imposed on borrowers. For this reason, I find it very hard indeed to understand the attitude of societies to the question of the legal investigation of title to properties offered as security for loans.  The insistence of societies on having title examined by a solicitor appointed by themselves from very restricted panels means that not only is there duplication of work &mdash; since the borrower's solicitor must do the same thing &mdash; but duplication of expense for the borrower, since it is he or she who must pay both sets of legal fees.  The need for this is mystifying since in Britain and Northern Ireland societies are quite satisfied to accept the borrower's solicitor. Even where societies operate on the basis of a panel, it generally comprises the vast majority of solicitors engaged in conveyancing in the society's area of operation. This not only results in substantial savings to borrowers, but, by eliminating the duplication of work to which I have referred also helps to reduce delays.  I am, therefore, providing, in section 6, for a power to prescribe rules precluding or restricting a society from charging its legal costs in investigation of title to the borrower.  If societies want a separate solicitor, they will have to pay for the privilege.</P>
    <P>Finally, rules can be prescribed regarding the arranging by a society through an insurer nominated by it for the provision of mortgage protection insurance.  As Deputies will be aware, this is a form of life assurance designed to ensure that the loan will be repaid if the borrower dies, and is to be distinguished from the insurance on the mortgaged property, to which I have already referred.</P>
    <P>All publicly funded house purchase loans made available through local authorities now automatically include a small charge, incorporated into the repayments, in respect of mortgage protection insurance.  Provided the borrower is actively at work and is under 55, the cover comes with the loan.  I would like to see building societies making similar arrangements <Col N="960" /> for their borrowers, and the power to make rules in this respect is intended to encourage and facilitate the practice.</P>
    <P>In addition, there are existing powers to prescribe rules available to me under section 10 of the Building Societies Act, 1976.  I intend to use these to deal with certain other matters identified in the discussion document.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>We all agree that there is a need for legislation to update the operation of building societies, the last major review having been carried out in 1976.  My regret about this piece of legislation is that it was born not in a spirit of agreement between the Minister and this important financial section of the Irish economy, as it should have been, but rather in an atmosphere of belligerence and confrontation.  To debate today's measure which is in theory designed to control building society rates without referring to the decision by one society to increase rates by 3 per cent would be unreal.  This is more so with the threat of the remaining societies to increase their rates by 3 per cent and there is even talk of one society increasing by more than 3 per cent.  I fervently hope this is not true.</P>
      <P>The implications of the increases will be to add more than £60 per month to the standard mortgage of £30,000, a shattering prospect for already hard-pressed families.  This savage increase has been brought about by a number of factors, and the Minister and the Government must take the responsibility which is theirs.</P>
      <P>In the case of the Government, their total mismanagement of the country's finances has resulted in a collapse of confidence in the money markets which has driven general interest rates to record levels, taken against inflation.  Under Fianna Fáil they were 3 per cent below inflation.  Now, at minimum, they are 10 per cent above inflation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The factors that have particularly brought this about are the record current budget deficit, the spiralling national debt, the unacceptable levels of foreign <Col N="961" /> borrowing, and the litany could go on to include 100,000 of our people emigrating and a quarter of a million unemployed. In the Minister's case, his Rambo-like posturing against the soft target of the building societies which has provided him with the occasional favourable headline in the short term, has resulted in a poisoning of the atmosphere between the societies and himself to the detriment of thousands of hard pressed families.</P>
    <P>A further example of this was the tinker-like fight between himself and one of the chief executives of a building society on the airwaves of this nation this morning. This is no way for a Minister to behave in dealing with such a sensitive issue and with one of our major financial institutions.  There is a better way, and we in Fianna Fáil when in Government showed that way.</P>
    <P>Can I remind the House that on one previous occasion when the societies were suffering temporary inflow problems we arranged that EC funds would be made available to them and guaranteed against exchange rate losses, thus protecting the mortgage holders.  Unfortunately, I have to say to the Minister that your huffing and puffing about the societies and that the mismanagement of his Government will have blown the roofs off many families from today.</P>
    <P>The Minister is a racing man, as we all know, and to use a racing parlance, he is flattering to deceive.  To return to the Bill, with the changes that are to be brought about, resulting from EC decisions, which will result in an influx of British and continental societies into the country, our national interest would best be served by a comprehensive measure which would strengthen the base and clarify the role of how we see our societies in the future within the Irish economy.</P>
    <P>One area in which we feel there is a potential for greater competition is the banking area.  Comprehensive legislation should cover the possibility of extending the rights of the societies to enter into the banking arena.  Unfortunately, the Minister has missed the opportunity because he has no specific objectives other than apparently to seek short term <Col N="962" /> political gain by being seen to attack the soft target of the societies.</P>
    <P>We in Fianna Fáil recognise that there is considerable room for improvement in the operation of the societies.  We feel that the Minister has lost the opportunity to protect the vital national interest because surely one area of job creation in the future must be in the financial services area.  It is consequently vital that we have a strong home base to tackle the competition from Britain and the EC.  It is obvious that the British Government's legislation which gives their societies access to the Irish market is drafted not with the interest of the Irish economy or the Irish people in mind, but with the expansion and increased profits of their own societies in mind.</P>
    <P>The societies play a major role here representing as they do over 120,000 mortgage holders and approximately 800,000 to a million depositors.  It is incumbent on Governments to deal with the societies and their borrowers and depositors in a responsible way.  This sense of responsibility was sadly lacking with the introduction of DIRT, which has driven up to £1,500 million of savings from this country since its introduction last January.</P>
    <P>The societies cannot be isolated from the movements in the money market and we in Fianna Fáil are particularly concerned at the threat that mortgage rates in the future will be based on the performance of rates on the Dublin inter-bank market.  Inter-bank rates always have been much higher than mortgage rates.  There has been recently a difference of up to 4 per cent between the inter-bank rate and the home loan rate. The overall management of the economy by the Government is consequently of vital importance to the societies, to their mortgage holders and their depositors, so when this Government run a current budget deficit of £1,500 million, which is the highest in money and percentage terms in the history of the country, this has a traumatic effect on the funding of the Government in the money markets which in turn has a catastrophic effect on mortgage holders.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="963" /> The managing director of one of the major societies was recently quoted as saying that the imposition of DIRT on its own will bring 0.5 per cent increase in mortgage rates.  It is ridiculous and unrealistic for the Minister to say, as he recently did &mdash; he said so again today &mdash; that such increases would not be acceptable to the Government.  The reality is that he will not be able to interfere with market forces.  If he has any doubts on that score, he might consult with the Minister for Finance whose reported comment on the recent threatened 4 per cent mortgage rise was that there was very little the Government could do about it.</P>
    <P>Having expressed my regret at the lost opportunity in this legislation I will refer to some of the Minister's proposals in the Bill.  Section 4 relating to tiered rates has been the most publicised and commented on section in this Bill.  In principle, we in Fianna Fáil are not opposed to the removal of the two tiered rates structure but we need a guarantee that our fears about this move are groundless.  We fear that the removal of the premium rate for large borrowers will result in a reduction in their repayments but at the expense of the standard scale mortgage holder.  In a recent editorial <i>The Irish Times</i> said it was illogical of the Minister for the Environment to contend that removing tiered interest rates increases competition among building societies and must therefore be in the borrowers' interest and that what will happen despite the Minister's best intentions&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Deputy give the date of that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have it here. The editorial went on to say that what would happen despite the Minister's best intentions is that the £85,000 borrowed instead of paying the premium for a large loan, will get his loan at the same rate as everyone else and that the underlying level of basic mortgage rate would then be likely to rise.  Will the Minister confirm that this will not happen?  If the Minister cannot confirm that the standard rate will <Col N="964" /> not go up so as to benefit those on large mortgages we will firmly oppose this section.  I cannot disagree with the fears expressed in <i>The Irish Times.</i> It is essential that the Minister guarantees the House and the people that the proposal will not result in the standard rate mortgage holder having to meet increased repayments.  Of course, tiered rates are not the exclusive domain of the building society movement.  The principle of multiple rates in banking has been long established. I would like the Minister's comment on that.</P>
      <P>The second section of the Bill which has received close comment is section 6. In principle, we welcome the prohibition or restriction of the charging of redemption fees, the making available to the borrower of the valuation report, the alteration in the insurance of the property, changes in legal costs and the arrangement of mortgage protection insurance.  However, just as with the proposal to abolish tiered interest rates, we fear that these measures will result in extra repayments for mortgage holders.</P>
      <P>In relation to redemption fees, and property and mortgage property insurance, we welcome the proposal the abolish them.  However, the societies claim &mdash; and I would like the Minister to answer the point &mdash; that this will lead to a reduction in their income, which cannot be met by greater efficiency within their operations and will have to be passed on to the already hard-pressed borrower.</P>
      <P>In relation to the proposal to allow borrowers to see valuations, the societies claim that those who carried out valuations on their behalf would find it hard to insure themselves against third party actions if their valuations were found to be negligent.  This, in turn, would lead to a rise in valuations which would be passed on in the form of increased mortgages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to emphasise that I welcome the Minister's suggestions in this area but they need to be clarified and expanded on.  I want to be assured that it will not lead to increased charges for mortgage holders.  I suspect the Minister intends to clarify these suggestions and examine them more carefully now that he has the <Col N="965" /> initial PR hype out of them.  The Minister has been very careful in the drafting of the Bill to use the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; in section 6 (1) instead of &ldquo;shall&rdquo; prohibit redemption fees and so on.  The section reads</P>
    <P>The Minister may, after consultation with the Registrar, prescribe rules in respect of any one or more of the following matters, either generally or by reference to a specified class or classes of rules or societies, denoted by reference to such matters as the Minister may consider appropriate.</P>
    <P>It is essential in operating this section that the Minister should be very careful not to rush into a decision, the long term effect of which will be to increase the cost to the mortgage holder.</P>
    <P>I note that the Minister and the societies have met and have been reported to have discussed the operation of this Bill and the prospects for future legislation.  I hope that commonsense will prevail on both sides and that the interests of the mortgage holder and investor will be protected and that they will not be the victimes of a fit of pique on either side.</P>
    <P>The position of the building societies needs to be examined in the light of their changing role and in the light of UK and EC legislation.  However, this review of the Building Societies Act of 1976 has been done in too much haste and in too much confrontation.  Also, not only does the Minister seem intent on this, but he is pushing ahead regardless of the potential increase in mortgages which will result from his proposed legislation.</P>
    <P>In recent months, rates have already gone up and will go up again because of the implications of DIRT.  The Minister must recognise this reality and also the reality that mortgages constitute the single most important expenditure of 120,000 Irish families.  We are concerned that the reality may be that the implications of this will heap more increases on mortgage holders, and the Minister's windowdressing and piecemeal tinkering with this whole area will, in the long run, not hide this fact.  The director of one major building society said that the effect of all this is that the basic mortgage <Col N="966" /> rate will be increased, that the fellow with a £20,000 mortgage will end up paying more, while the fellow with a £50,000 mortgage will pay less.</P>
    <P>We will not oppose the Second Stage of this Bill but we will carefully examine each section on Committee Stage and will oppose any section which the Minister will not guarantee will not pass on increased mortgage repayments to families who can no longer bear the burdens being placed on them as a result of this Government's actions.  It is essential for the long term future stability and security of mortgage holders that a general election be called so that the present uncertainty, confrontation and unsatisfactory state of this major financial sector of our economy can be clarified.  This general uncertainty is bad because it relates to increased interest rates.  It is vital that this uncertainty be removed and this can only be done with a general election.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important Bill.  During the last year particularly I have invested a lot of time in researching in depth this whole area which is of interest to a lot of people who are interested in helping themselves and who are not looking to the State to build their homes.  It would be wrong if this debate was to be seen in the shadow of current developments in relation to interest rates.  They are a separate issue.  I acknowledge that there are straightforward financial market factors in relation to capital outflows due to speculation on sterling, external trading relations and to a lesser extent on DIRT which mean that any financial segment of the market has to be attractive to depositor rates.  The issues in this Bill are different. The issues in this Bill deal with basic consumer rights and the legislation of a movement that has its origins in the 18th century, the principal legislation for which is governed by the UK Act of 1836. The subsequent changes which took place in the 1976.  Act are only a consolidation of minor changes which have taken place. There has been no review of consumer rights and the policy formation of what <Col N="967" /> we want building societies to do in the overall financial markets.</P>
      <P>I have some critical things to say about the building society movement and their managers.  In the past I have sent greetings to them across the national airwaves and through the media.  I am glad this morning that they are here face to face to hear it.  We must analyse the background. Building societies together with friendly societies developed during the second half of the 18th century in response to a prevailing economic and social trend at that time.  The early societies were true building societies as they built homes and were mutual.  They existed to provide each member with a house paid for from their funds.  Developments in Irish building societies have the same legislative background as those in the UK.  The growth in the seventies and early eighties has been extremely rapid.  In 1974, the building societies accounted for 44.6 per cent of total mortgage finance.  In 1980, this figure had risen to 74.2 per cent. Similarly, building societies have increased their share of the savings market from 9 per cent in 1967 to 20 per cent between 1979 and 1981.  This performance has been achieved with no significant change in their legal framework. The societies raise most of these funds through share investments but to the investor these are more akin to deposits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The shareholder in a building society is analagous to being a depositor in a bank rather than being a shareholder in a company.  Voting power in a society is not normally weighted according to the value of shares held resulting in one person one vote.  Therefore, it is impossible for even a substantial number of members to have sufficient votes to enable them to exercise control over the society.  That is the theory.  This is evidenced by the fact that the concept of one person one vote when there are 100 members is very simple but when there are 100,000 members it is impossible to pursue in terms of true democracy. Between 1971 and 1981, 243,000 new houses were built, half of which were <Col N="968" /> financed by borrowing.  The Blackwell report of the NESC projected that over the period 1981-91 there would be an additional need for 293,000 houses.  I understand that that information is now out of date and was slightly optimistic.</P>
    <P>In Ireland, a group of five societies dominate the building society industry. They account for in excess of 90 per cent of total assets.  These societies are different in size.  In 1984, for example, the total assets of the big five as it was then amounted to £2.428 billion.  Of this figure the Irish Permanent had assets of £1.023 billion.  Large building societies are comparable to banks.  They are largely anonymous with branch networks throughout the country.  The present legislation and their operation as a cartel has resulted in them being very profitable.  Their profits in relation to post tax return on gross assets are higher than the Bank of Ireland or Allied Irish Banks.  I would like to turn to a particular table which proves that.  If we look at the post tax return on gross assets the figure for the Bank of Ireland for 1981-2 was 0.77 and in the following year it was 0.54.  For AIB, the figure in 1981-2 was 0.8 and in 1982-3 it was 0.71. Over the same period the figure for the Irish Permanent was 0.89; for the ICS, 1.13; for the Irish Nationwide, 1.84; for the EBS 0.64 and for First National, 0.8. Those figures clearly prove that they are extremely profitable and opposite to the perception of building societies which is that of non-profit making organisations.</P>
    <P>The legislation relating to the registration and supervision of building societies is primarily regulated under the Building Societies Act, 1976, with subsequent technical amendments made in 1980 and 1983.  The 1976 Act consolidated with amendments the preexisting law.  Under these Acts the control and supervision of societies is vested in the Registrar of Friendly Societies who has various powers of inspection and the withdrawal of certain rights, for example advertising.  An annual report has to be submitted to the registrar annually.</P>
    <P>I would now like to turn to some recent developments in relation to the building <Col N="969" /> society movement in the context of the financial sector.  Building societies are now at a crossroads in two respects.  First, in relation to their legislative environment further to the EC Directive of 1984 and the publication and subsequent decisions further to the Green Paper in the UK, it is proposed that many of the statutory constraints and powers would be loosened so that societies could act in other areas adjacent to mortgage finance such as estate agency and brokers for insurance.  The second area of change is with regard to the savings market.  At the top end at present they are under pressure from the effectiveness of growth bonds and at the lower end they are being pressurised by the attractiveness of post office saving certificates many of which are index-linked.  These are becoming increasingly attractive and will be more so at times of high inflation.  It is in the context of changing circumstances that I decided to do an in-depth study of building society operations in Ireland.  As this progressed, I became gravely concerned about (a) their policies, (b) the effectiveness of the registrar and (c) the legislation governing them.  The public and shareholders' interests are not being well served in any of these three areas.</P>
    <P>With regard to their policies and decisions, it has been very noticeable that there has been a huge growth in three areas of their expenditure: new branch networks, management expenses and fees and their advertising budget.  If we look at the figures for advertising expenditure by the big five building societies as it was we will see that in 1979 they spent £2.21 million.  Total building society expenditure on advertising was £2.61 million.  In 1980, the figure for the big five had increased to £2.75 million and for the total building society sector to £3.2 million.  In 1982, these figures had gone up again to £4.49 million for the big five and £5.07 million for total building society sector.  In 1983, the big five were not satisfied with that level of expenditure and spent £6.07 million and the total building society sector went to £7.2 million.</P>
    <P>I will now turn to management <Col N="970" /> expenses.  I will come later to the AR11 form which has to be submitted to the Registrar of Building Societies.  That form is totally inadequate in terms of the details which have to be provided.  One can see from that form that total management expenses for the Big Five in 1979 were £8.33 million and for all building societies, £10.07 million.  In 1980 that figure went to £11.11 million for the big five and £13.77 million for all building societies.  In 1982 there was another staggering jump.  The Big Five decided to spend on total management expenses £20.98 million and while the amount for all building societies was £20.39 million. The figure shot up again in 1983 to £27.08 million for the Big Five and £31.47 million for all building societies.</P>
    <P>Put simply we are dealing with a situation where management expenses of the Big Five, which includes expenditure on branch network, advertising and other promotions, salaries, perks and other expenses, went from £8.3 million in 1979 to £27.08 million in 1983.  This morning the Fianna Fáil spokesman said that the building societies would have to pass on any loss of income due to the abolition of the redemption fee and any loss of income due to the restrictive practice they operate with insurance brokerage.  I put it to Fianna Fáil that if they look at those figures they will see that there is plenty of spare change to be picked up at a time when their advertising expenditure is three times that of the banks and in 1984 was three times the expenditure of the building societies in the UK.  I do not see how it can be argued for one second that in the interests of a movement that is given special legislative consideration it is in the interests of the people that they serve that they should so wastefully chase their own tail in search of deposits to add to the normal cost overheads of the movement by having such a huge budget on new branch networks and on advertising.  I will deal with those areas later.</P>
    <P>I should now like to return to their policies and decisions.  New branch networks are costly and their current rate of growth has resulted in management and <Col N="971" /> administrative cost ratios that are out of line with the asset growth they are reporting.  I should like to give another set of figures which are very interesting. I should like to look at the global figures for management expenses, as per the AR11 form submitted to the Registrar, as a percentage of mean assets in 1983 and 1984.  The figure for the Irish Permanent was 1.42, for the EBS, 1.57, the First National, 1.58, the Irish Nationwide, 1.20 and the ECS, 2.04.  In 1984 they increased, relatively speaking.  The Irish Permanent went up by 22 per cent, the EBS by 27 per cent, the First National by 41 per cent and the Irish Nationwide by 50 per cent.  The question arises, if that expenditure did not take place could it not be the case that the differential between the lending and the deposit rates could have been reduced or could a lot of these restrictive practises that this legislation obliges building societies to get rid of not have been removed?  It is my belief that if there was greater accountability in the building society movement the shareholders of the societies would say that that was what they wanted.  That was the way to pursue this instead of having to legislate in an area where commonsense should have prevailed.</P>
    <P>It is questionable whether these management policies have been in the interests of depositors as surely the future trend will not be in blocks and mortar for offices in terms of new branch networks but rather in electronic financial services. Similarly their colossal advertising budgets are a wasteful burden on the building society movement.  Currently they are three times that of the banks, and, in effect, the dog is chasing its own tail.  The net effect of growth and expenditure in these areas has resulted in far greater overheads for the societies.  This can only mean that any possibility of reducing the margin between the deposit rate which in July 1985 when I was studying it, was 7.25 per cent and 11.85 per cent will be dissipated.  All of this is verified by the fact that as a percentage of mean assets the top four building societies have shown <Col N="972" /> increases between 1983 and 1984 of between 22 per cent and 50 per cent in overall management and administrative expenses.  Thus the blunt question arises, is this current expenditure policy at the expense of the interests of shareholders and home buyers?</P>
    <P>The second policy area where I would be critical of building societies is that there has been virtually no innovation in the type of mortgages offered to house buyers due to the lack of competition within the building society cartel.  With the exception of endowment mortgages, and a slight change in savings services, the building societies have been very slow to either promote new housing initiatives or to submit new proposals to the Government for the potential on export markets.  That was until the Honohan inquiry was held.  The operation of the cartel has been very tight in the past with an exclusion to new members, previously the Mutual Building Society was expelled and we all know of the ongoing difficulties between the ICS and the other societies. For the Irish Building Society Association to refute the operation of a cartel in my view in the past was unfair and I hope this week marks a new departure in relation to its break up.  It is my belief that it is in the interest of individual societies that that should be pursued.</P>
    <P>I have referred to the Registrar of Friendly Societies as a toothless lion and I state this because I believe he does not exercise sufficient scrutiny and accountability over the societies and their top management.  Any concept of accountability must first of all understand the term mutual which is used to indicate an organisation of which the ownership and ultimate control is vested in the members broadly on a basis of equality rather than in proportion to financial interest.  I categorically state that the current election system operated within the building societies does not reflect that term of mutualisation.  In practice the election system does not result in outside candidates having a chance of election and it is only by co-option that new members are appointed.  The proxy form system seems to ensure retention of the <i>status.</i><Col N="973" /><i>quo</i> board directors.  Thus the onus on the Registrar is all the greater to ensure accountability to the public and to the shareholders.</P>
    <P>It has to be acknowledged that his office has been under funded, under staffed and has lacked a continuity of policy due to a change in personnel in recent years.  In this area I should like him to take the following steps to ensure greater accountability: (a) a reform of the details of management expenses that have to be provided in the AR 11 form; currently only global figures are required here and I believe a full breakdown should be given; (b) the registrar should publish guidelines in relation to compensation for retiring directors, especially in the event of a merger; (c) the full rights of shareholders should be clearly published on all deposit books and (d) the conditions relating to declaration of interest by board members should be the same as those operating for company directors.  I will return to that later.</P>
    <P>In relation to the legal framework governing societies I believe that the 1976 Building Societies Act should be amended along the lines of the Industrial and Provident Society (Amendment) Act, 1978 (section 25) whereby the Registrar of Friendly Societies where deemed necessary can appoint a director to the board of a society if it is deemed necessary. I also believe the Department of the Environment should examine whether it is correct to assume that market forces will dictate competitive interest rates while there is a cartel in operation and that it may in fact be necessary while it is in operation to vest new powers in the Minister to provide statutory controls on the lending margins of building societies.</P>
    <P>Consideration should also be given to whether there should be some form of limit on management and administrative cost ratios within societies.  I readily accept that this should only be used in emergency circumstances where the Registrar feels that such action is justified. In order to give Irish building societies an equal opportunity to compete with foreign international institutions it is essential that the current legislation <Col N="974" /> is reviewed in the event of traditional barriers in financial services markets being broken down throughout the world.</P>
    <P>I note that Deputy Burke this morning referred to the building societies as a soft target.  I have never found the building society movement to be a soft target. They are a well organised and articulate group who can defend their interests extremely well.  The changes that are being sought here in terms of consumer rights are the very same as those that exist in terms of practices for mortgagees in the UK.  The direct effect of information technology and the EC financial services directive will be that UK building societies will have full and free access to the Irish mortgage market before long. If the Irish building society movement want to respond to this competition and retain their market share &mdash; we all want to see a strong indigenous Irish movement &mdash; then they must make these changes of their own accord.</P>
    <P>Building societies resent my comments and criticisms of their operations but they must address themselves to the issue of public scrutiny beyond their current legal obligation.  It is in their own interest in terms of securing a sound future that they should do this.  At no stage in my comments have I dealt with the relative tax treatment of building societies <i>vis-à-vis</i> other financial institutions.  Whatever about my views on DIRT, in the interests of home building, building societies should have a favourable position within a tax led savings market.</P>
    <P>Section 6 deals with the major part of the legislation.  When I spoke out on these issues I received a deluge of correspondence. I will not delay the House by relating individual cases but there were cases of people who had to pay three solicitors for the conveyancing of one house.  With a 1½ per cent charge on a £30,000 houses the amount involved is £450.  There were cases of people selling houses in the UK and coming back to live in Ireland and <i>vice versa</i>.  They could not understand the difference in the way they were treated by the UK and Irish building societies.  People who are in the insurance <Col N="975" /> business wrote to me and explained that they could arrange their own house insurance at a reasonable rate but were debarred from doing so and were told they must go to a specific insurer.</P>
    <P>I greatly welcome the Minister's plan to facilitate the early issuing of loans after completion date and so obviate the need for bridging finance.  I have heard harrowing cases in relation to delays on the issuing of loans finance which led to severe hardship.  In the recent past there have been cases of people extending their mortgages and availing of the grants for the renovation and repair of houses.  They were again subjected to all the extras &mdash; valuation fees, research fees, insurance changes and so on.  There is the impression that many mortgagees who are clients of building societies are not happy and I am doing the building societies a service by pointing this out to them. One of the first rules of commerce in any business is that the customer is always right.  I do not believe that that <i>modus operandi</i> holds true in the building society movement.</P>
    <P>Tiered interest rates have not been my highest priority in relation to the inequities that arise.  However it is totally absurd for any society to turn around after a number of years and say they intend to change the terms of your mortgage without your having any say in the matter. That is unfair and would not be tolerated in any other line of business.</P>
    <P>I welcome the changes that are being made.  They are long overdue.  It is deeply regretted that it requires legislative change to deal with these matters.  If there was no legislative change the fact is that UK building societies would have obliged Irish building societies to change anyway.</P>
    <P>In relation to other legislative changes it is worth underlining that in the case of a credit union the registrar has power under section 25 of the Industrial and Provident Society Act 1978 to appoint someone to the board.  No such facility exists in relation to building societies.</P>
    <P>I would not like to see excessive statutory control in relation to interest rates <Col N="976" /> but the behaviour of the building societies is analogous to that of a spoiled child. Quite frankly they are only waiting for a general election and a change of Government so that this legislation can be scuttled. I do not know if that is true but it is my belief.  The antics of Fianna Fáil whereby they were very upset by the timing of this legislation give credence to that.</P>
    <P>On 16 July last year I called for a public inquiry into the activities of building societies and was very pleased when the Government subsequently announced the commissioning of the Honohan report.  That report dealt with some aspects of the issues I raised.  The question of extending building society finance beyond the area of mortgages needs to be looked at.  During my research last year I saw a letter from the chief executive of one building society which advised a mortgagee that he or she could get additional facilities on his or her mortgage for items other than their house.  I do not know if it was for a holiday, the purchase of a yacht or whatever.  I saw that letter and can produce it.  We should call a spade a spade.  I am not suggesting that is done by every building society or that it is always done by any building society.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>At the time of my comments I challenged the building society on three occasions to a debate and they declined.  Perhaps some of the issues which I could have raised, such as that one, might have enlightened them somewhat.</P>
      <P>On a more positive note, I am very involved in policy formation for small businesses and one aspect which is of great concern to me is the huge increase in bank charges.  I hold no candles whatsoever for the banks relative to the building societies.  Bank rates have increased out of all proportion in terms of handling charges.  There may be cases where individual building societies would be able to provide, on a personal basis, cheque book facilities for individuals or businesses. In the context of the EC liberalisation this must be looked into and certainly I would not oppose it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to turn to the area of the election of the board.  This is the greatest injustice. At the moment there are rules as laid down by the Registrar of Friendly Societies in relation to the election to a society of directors and board members. If I am a share investor in a society I am entitled to be a candidate.  If I and several colleagues in my House decide to put my name forward as a candidate and I write to the secretary of the building society saying that I wish to canvass everybody on the share register, I understand from the register that with regard to some societies the secretary can refuse to give me access to the share register to distribute my canvassing literature, if the secretary deems that it is not in the best interests of the society.  I am not saying that applies to all societies, but to certain of them.  Obviously if there are people in a very powerful position in a society they might resent outside interference.  We have had a recent example of an attempted election by one person on to one society.  My experience is that by the procedures of notification of an early pre-emptive strike it is extremely possible for someone to garner the votes necessary to become elected.  This can be the case.  People will know the society to which I am referring. It can be that people are sent out proxy. <Col N="978" /> forms to see which member of the family they are going to vote for in relation to the election of directors in one society.</P>
    <P>I should like to see a declaration of interests, as for private companies, of every director regarding any business &mdash; be it architectural, advertising, a legal practice &mdash; to see if in any way there is a relationship between the director's own business links and the society's links. Shareholders are entitled to have this information and it should be made fully available in all cases.  I am not happy about the co-option system on to individual boards.  I am not looking for anything different from the provisions under the 1963 Companies Acts which might be available under the new companies legislation which is due to come before this House before long.</P>
    <P>If that is not done, in the interests of accountability the registrar or the Department should be allowed to have a nominee on the board.  Under those rules full accountability is guaranteed.  That is the only fair way to proceed.  Basically, building societies regard their share investors as depositors in a bank.  Perhaps from their point of view it would be unworkable to give every person a vote, but the reality is that most people who put money into a building society do not realise that it is like putting money into a company on a one person one vote basis as opposed to putting money in a bank. They just see it in terms of their rate of return.  That is why all the rules and all the shareholders' rights should be clearly displayed on the deposit book.</P>
    <P>Could the Minister, in reply, give me some answers in relation to the studies that he has done on the difference between the lending and deposit rates, how they compare with rates in other financial institutions and whether he is satisfied that there is no scrutiny whatsoever by the Department of the Environment, the Registrar of Friendly Societies, or previously by the National Prices Commission, or by anybody else. Nobody analyses the profit margin of building societies to see whether there is scope in terms of alleviating the rate to <Col N="979" /> mortgage holders or having more attractive rates for depositors, whether the margin, be it 4 per cent or 5 per cent, is fair.  Would the Minister specifically clarify whether under this Bill he has enabling powers to make changes in that area?  I do not believe that it would be at all satisfactory or correct, in terms of interference in a financial market, to prohibit the increase of rates &mdash; I am not talking about relative rates such as tiered, but overall rates &mdash; to go beyond a certain level.  That level of interference could be construed as nationalisation of a sort.  It is more important to assure the public that the margin between the deposit rate and the lending rate is fair and competitive and that there is no unnecessary luggage.</P>
    <P>Is the Minister satisfied in relation to the disclosure that each building society makes on the AR 11 form to the registrar, whether there should not be guidelines for compensation to retiring board members.  Here is a very interesting topic.  Last summer there was a proposed merger between the EBS and the Irish Permanent Building Society.  I am very glad from the point of view of the EBS that they did not go along with this, but that is only a personal observation.  It could theoretically happen that if a big society were subsuming a smaller society that might not be in the interests of the smaller society but it might be in the individual interests of directors who might have the necessary power in terms of their authoritative position within the society.  I am not saying that this has happened and it may never happen, but hypothetically it is possible that the compensation given to certain directors in the circumstances of a merger would be so great as to be attractive.  Guidelines should be issued in such cases.</P>
    <P>I should also like to know if it is true, as many letters which I have received suggest, that individual directors of individual societies have certain perks. Would the Minister clarify the situation in relation to loan facilities available to individual directors, give some breakdown of entertainment expenses, or <Col N="980" /> some detail &mdash; perhaps not issued to the public if it is of a personal nature, but at least issued in detail to the registrar or the Department &mdash; in order to be satisfied that the best interests of the share investors are being met.  I believe that in relation to one society expenditure between eight directors in one year amounted to £731,000.  Are there any personal commissions with regard to the total lending in relation to individual building societies?</P>
    <P>In reply, perhaps the Minister could clarify the legal situation about new entrants to the building society sector, or if this is in the new legislation.  Entry should be absolutely wide open to anybody who wants to set up a building society tomorrow morning.  I should like the Minister's assurance that individual mortgagees would have sole right of choice of insurance for their house and that there would not be an insistence on a third solicitor in terms of conveyancing; that the issuing of loans would be very prompt to obviate the need for bridging finance and, in relation to building society management, I call on the managers of the societies to review their level of expenditure of advertising and justify why this is so high.  Similarly, I would call on them to try to keep moving away from the cartel, as they have started to do this week.  I would ask them to justify their expenditure on branch offices as opposed to agencies which would be a lot cheaper, and to explain why they have not spent as much on new electronic financial services as they have on blocks and mortar in new branch offices.  I would like some clarification regarding an opening of the door in relation to election procedures.  I would like to see uniformity for all societies so that outside candidates could have a fair crack of the whip.</P>
    <P>I have no vendetta or difficulty with individuals in the building societies.  I do not know any of them personally and I have never had a problem with any of them but the deluge of correspondence I received last summer verifies that many people feel that there has been a cloak of secrecy around the building society <Col N="981" /> movement.  It is in their interest in terms of accountability and satisfying their clients that that cloak is lifted.  I hope that at the end of the day they will be part of a vibrant and growing financial sector that will be able not only to repel imports in the advent of EC changes but will be able to attract extra deposits from Northern Ireland and the UK and return profits to Irish building societies.</P>
    <P>I wish this legislation well and I hope this debate will not be shrouded in the current difficulty in relation to interest rates.  We are trying to achieve something different from the current topic of rates of interest.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, share the wish of Deputy Yates that this debate might not be shrouded by the current debate on interest rates.  I think that hope cannot be fulfilled because the Minister in introducing the legislation this morning prefaced his remarks with reference to recent developments in regard to interest rates.  He even went so far as to say that these developments would require him to give consideration to possible further legislative proposals which would confer powers on societies.  He said that with power comes responsibility.  The implication of his remarks was that the building societies, particularly in regard to very recent developments, have not been acting responsibly having regard to the powers they have.  I would like to put all of this in context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we talk about building societies we cannot discuss the position in which they operate in isolation from the whole position of financial institutions and current interest rates.  We should ensure that we do not react to immediate developments by trying to plug holes without trying to ensure that Government actions will in no way bring about the consequences they complain about in introducing legislation of this kind.  The Minister for the Environment complains about the level of interest rates for building society borrowers while overlooking entirely in the course of his address the whole climate in which this decision has been taken.  The House should not <Col N="982" /> address any issue as important as this with that blindfold imposed on itself.</P>
    <P>The current real interest rate is about 10 per cent, the highest for many years. It is at a level which makes it impossible to have any degree of balance, equilibrium or confidence in the markets.  It has brought about a position where even the Government stockbroker is offering Government gifts at the unprecedented rate of 13.5 to 13.75 per cent.  They are still not able to find sufficient takers for Government stocks at that unprecedented rate.  The Minister spoke about the responsibility of building societies to borrowers.  I take that point but surely there is also a responsibility to the taxpayers who will inevitably and eventually have to fund the cost of the interest rates now being offered by the Government on Government gilts.  The question arises as to why that has happened.  Why do the taxpayers of the future have to face the burden of meeting the cost of these enormous interest rates being offered by the Government?  That question should be answered before we start hurling charges at building societies or other financial institutions who have to operate in conditions brought about by Government. This Government deliberately, and despite our constant warning from day one in this House, introduced a tax which has had a most disastrous effect on all financial institutions.  The deposit interest retention tax was introduced purely for the sake of adding further to the tax take which now exceeds well over £6,000 million.  The effects of that on the money markets have been even more disastrous that I, as spokesman for Fianna Fáil, indicated at the time.  On the day that tax was introduced I warned the Government of the consequences it would have. I was proved to be inaccurate to one extent only; the fears I had at the time were understated rather than exaggerated. If there is an outflow, even in the space of one year, of at least £500 million from our financial institutions do we expect interest rates to stay stable and normal?  We are being asked to ignore the fact that the Government have to <Col N="983" /> increase the interest offered on Government gilts which is a direct consequence of their own actions.  The Minister then comes in here as he did this morning to pillory individual building societies.  I understand that other building societies may feel the need to follow suit over the next few days.  How can any Government reasonably fix their target on building societies or banks when those institutions are reacting to the conditions deliberately brought about by the Government?  It is time the Government answered for those consequences.</P>
    <P>The reason I am taking part in this debate is to invite the Minister for Finance to explain how this issue will affect building societies or how he sees it as being in any way effective or affected by the general lack of investment confidence in the banking system, building societies, Government gilts, never mind manufacturing or other industry at this time.  That is one of the most shortsighted, damaging actions ever undertaken by a Government.</P>
    <P>I am not at this stage going to discuss the equity of it because that is of no consequence to this issue.  Before we can reasonably deal with the whole question of the amendment of legislation affecting building societies we must realise that this can be done only in the context of legislation affecting the financial institutions generally.  I want to place on record that as long ago as 1980 when I was Minister for Finance I initiated within the Department &mdash; the record must still be there &mdash; an examination of the whole role and authority of the Central Bank, the legislation affecting the Central Bank and its control over financial institutions generally, with a view to seeing how best we could introduce a rational system throughout our financial institutions.  I would have expected that I would have been in a position the following year at least to bring proposals before this House, or at the most in two years.  Here we are five, six years later and we are reacting only in one event, the building societies because they are big news today.</P>

      <P>They are big news today and were yesterday and last week, and we have a Government reacting to the understandable concern about the level of interest rates in building societies without doing anything at all to address the fundamental problem which is the pressure on interest rates that they have brought about.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Yeats asked in relation to the banks, what about the interest rates of banks?  I have mentioned the current interest charges and the difference, which is now historically high, between the deposit interest and the overdraft interest.  At this moment I cannot put a precise figure on it but it is away outside what would be normally acceptable in any commercial activity.  Why?  Why are bank charges at the level they now are? Why is the whole business climate being burdened by the level of these charges of interest rates?  Why do the building societies find themselves for one reason or another as they see it &mdash; I am not going to take on the role of Spokesman for the Environment for our party &mdash; obliged to increase interest rates by at least 3 per cent to maintain the level of deposits? Why are all these distortions in the market taking place?  It is that we have not only failed to attract deposits into our financial institutions from abroad but we have driven out such deposits as at least would maintain a certain level of equilibrium from domestic depositors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We will never know just how damaging has been the effect of DIRT but we can quantify to a certain extent what is gone. We can never quantify what was not invested.  We warned from day one that that barrier which was being erected deliberately by the Government would be seen by external depositors in our financial services system as being a clear warning to them that this was no place to invest.  Oh, yes, a statement of exemption <Col N="985" /> for non-resident account holders which would be made available to the Revenue Commissioners was meant to ensure that they would not be subject to this DIRT, but anyone who lives in the real world knows that any external depositor will above all else refuse to make any such declaration purely because of the apprehension he has that this would be made known or available to the revenue authorities in his own country.  Even if there is no foundation for the apprehension, even if our Revenue Commissioners, whose bona fides I accept &mdash; would under no circumstances disclose any details in relation to individual accounts, and it is of no consequence if depositors who may be seeking a haven outside for moneys that are not being fully disclosed to their own revenue authorities are apprehensive. That is the end of it, and I could not begin to estimate the drain on the whole deposit funding in our financial institutions as a consequence of what we have lost in that direction.</P>
    <P>If ever we needed investment and deposits in our financial institutions, now is the time.  The Exchequer, the public purse, cannot cope any more.  We are all agreed on that.  We can cope no more with extra commitments in public expenditure. If that is to be the case the only basis on which we can fund our private housing sector programme or public housing sector programme as it is at the moment or any other development programmes is through private investment and when we have tried to encourage that we have done the very opposite; then the Government complain about the level of interest rates for which they themselves are directly responsible.  For that reason I ask this Government again to please pull down the <i>cul-de-sac</i> signs that they have erected over the last few years particularly in relation to DIRT.  There were others also from the beginning which affect the private house market. The infamous residential property tax has lost the Revenue Commissioners more than it ever even claimed could accrue to the revenue.  The decline in private house building at that level of the market has had disastrous effects on the construction <Col N="986" /> industry and, let it be said, on the revenue yield.  The stamp duty yield which has declined so much there has been a matter of considerable concern even for the revenue authorities and the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>Do the Government feel free to take any effective action at this stage?  I do not believe so but I ask them to pull down the <i>cul-de-sac</i> signs at least to ensure that when another Government come in they will be able to start with a reasonable prospect of engaging in normal investment.</P>

      <P>I want to turn to matters that arise and have been dealt with by the Minister and by Deputy Yates. The financial services in this country have some very special characteristics and have a major potential which should not be ignored by any Government, particularly at this time.  In the first instance, does it need to be said that they are labour-intensive at a time of crushing unemployment?  Because they are labour-intensive at every level we should be promoting particularly a climate for the development of the financial services. We should promote the development of the financial services by way of a comprehensive Government policy.  We have some very considerable advantages.  We have the knowledge, the capacity and the commercial expertise in our financial services sector, but instead of applying it to our own advantage we are exporting it.  The major finance houses in this city will confirm that the response elsewhere to the young, junior management staff who have gone out to live and work in New Zealand, Australia, Canada and America has been to ask us to send as many more as we have because they are making a major contribution to their programmes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The second point I want to make is that the building societies have very considerable advantages because of the proximity to the London market; we are in the same time zone as London and that confers very considerable advantages on the financial services sector here, and we have the same language.  All of this can be promoted but instead the Government plug a few little holes here and there in the Building Societies (Amendment) Bill, promising, even in introducing it, that there will be another to follow soon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Third, I would ask if he must always react to what the others do?  If we really were developing a policy for strengthening the financial services sector, we would not simply be reacting to the others, we would invade their territory. If some of our people in the commercial sector can succeed abroad, having departed from the very unhealthy investment climate here, there is no reason the people in the financial services sector cannot do so as well.  There are some areas where the building societies' role can be enhanced and extended.  It is clear that because of the major level of public expenditure on local authority housing here, which is higher than that in any other country in the European Community, one must ask how much more in the public purse can bear.  We have an obligation to provide for what was called in the 1890s the housing of the working class when the whole local authority housing programme was introduced. We can be proud of everything we have done in relation to local authority housing, but the help of the building societies could be enlisted in providing housing on a home ownership basis for that segment of the market &mdash; and this is happening to a much greater extent in the UK and elsewhere.  It would achieve two things at the same time.  We could <Col N="988" /> reduce the burden on the taxpayer and encourage home ownership which is a very welcome feature of the whole building society programme with all that goes with that in terms of house maintenance and protection of the asset.  The discussions between the Minister and the building societies should prepare for the day when they will expand their role beyond what it is at the moment as is the pattern particularly in the UK.  We would find the idea of old age pensioners here being able to finance housing for themselves through building societies very strange to contemplate.  But this is happening in the UK and in the North.  I would like to see that kind of development encouraged.  I would like to think that this Government, and certainly our Government coming into office, would engage immediately in discussions with the building societies in that area.  We do not want to see them having to react to the others coming in and offering services they do not yet provide.  This is an area we should build on.</P>
    <P>I will not take on the role of spokesman for the environment but I want to place this debate in context and I want to record that it is not good enough for any Minister of a Government with collective responsibility to come in here to this House complaining the morning after an announcement from one building society about the level of interest rates, when the Government of which he is a member is responsible for the total distortion in the money market, for the unprecedented interest rates.  If we can get this Government to make some sense at this point, the complaints that are at present being directed against building societies may not arise and the breathing space that they and others require will be forthcoming. I hope it will not be necessary to come back with another amendment to an amendment Bill.  That is not the goal of this House.  If we react like that every few weeks we are acknowledging that we do not have the control here and that we do not wish to, but that we wish to complain about those who are forced to react to our mistaken actions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I know the building societies fairly well because I have a business that has an agency from two different societies and I am a mortgage holder. I know about the general perception of building societies and the value of the services they have provided to many householders over the years.</P>
      <P>I am flabbergasted at the contribution made by the Opposition spokesman on Finance this morning on this Bill which will alleviate some of the costs to mortgage applicants.  He did not refer to any section of the Bill but defended a recent increase in their mortgage rates recently by one of the building societies.  That is all he did.  The major part of his contribution sounded more like an answer in a budget debate and that is not what this Bill is about.  The conduct of the Opposition spokesman leaves a lot to be desired.  He did not refer to the reduced costs for mortgage holders which are a part of this legislation but only said that the DIRT tax was the main cause of the drain of finance from this country.  DIRT tax is not the main cause of money leaving. In the six months since DIRT wax was introduced we have collected £5 million more from it than was originally anticipated. Are the Opposition telling us that the higher rates of income tax which were reduced by 3 per cent because of the introduction of DIRT, should not have happened?  The building societies have had DIRT tax at the rate of 28 per cent for as long as I can remember and the 7 per cent increase to 35 per cent has been blamed by the building societies chiefs for the 3 per cent increase in mortgage rates.  They say that an increase of £7 in the £100 interest earned would mean an increase of £25 to £35 a month on the average £20,000 mortgage.  Who are they trying to cod?  Anyone involved in business would not countenance such a suggestion.  It does not make any sense and neither the building society movement nor any Member of this House can convince me of it.  I would like to hear comments in answer to that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The introduction of a system in which the mortgage applicant will only have to pay a standard charge to the building <Col N="990" /> society solicitor is long overdue.  It is unacceptable that a mortgage applicant should have to pay a tiered rate to the building society solicitor and have to pay somewhere in the region of £400 to £450 to the solicitor.</P>
    <P>I hope this is the first step in improving the position of the mortgage applicant.  I have already asked the Minister for the Environment to ensure when this legislation is passed that a single rate and a single contribution should apply to local authority applicants.  I welcome that provision in the Bill and I am astonished that neither of the two Opposition spokesmen mentioned the savings that this would mean to people but only said that the building societies were an easy option.</P>

This is another important point which this Bill addresses and I fully support it.  Thousands of people have had to pay a redemption charge in order to sell their houses and at the same time have had to pay the full cost of applying for a new mortgage.  That is totally unacceptable and I am delighted that the Minister has done something positive in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not accept that a financial institution should enter into an agreement with a person, and ten years later change the terms of that agreement by the introduction of a tiered rate.  As the Minister said this morning that is particularly unacceptable to people who joined a building society because it had a single rate when <Col N="991" /> they joined.  I am glad the Minister stopped one of the main societies from introducing a tiered rate.  The rules should not be changed in mid stream.</P>
    <P>In relation to building societies deciding where people should insure their houses we have learned from the various reports that substantial fees are paid to the various insurance companies by the building societies and that house insurance is a big income earner.  An individual who takes out a mortgage should not be compelled to insure the house through the building society when such insurance can be looked after locally by hundreds of thousands of agents throughout the length and breadth of the country.  There should not be a monopoly and I would be delighted if something could be done in that regard.</P>
    <P>I would also welcome an extension of the building society funds to ordinary people.  I never accepted that the banks should be the only people allowed to run a financial system and that the building societies should not be allowed to compete. This year we learned of the handling charges which the banks introduced and of the income as a result of those charges on small businesses and individuals who use the banking system.  We heard that the return of income in this area will be more than the total interest collected on loans for the year.  That is an unacceptable precedent and the Minister, with the Minister for Finance, should look into the question of widening and broadening the scope of financial areas through the building societies.  The broadening of the building society services will make competition more keen.</P>
    <P>If the cost of advertising for the building societies is three times as high as those of the financial institutions, reducing such costs could mean a reduction in mortgage interest rates.  The main building societies are well known to everyone and intensive advertising is uncalled for.  A reduction of one-third in their costs could give a 0.5 per cent reduction to the ordinary mortgage holder.  This debate will give an insight into the workings of building societies to the general public.  After all, <Col N="992" /> 64 per cent of mortgages are with the building societies and people are entitled to know where their repayments are going and how profits are spent.</P>
    <P>The building societies have done an excellent job over the years where farmers have got into financial difficulties with the banks.  On numerous occasions they have provided help for such families by granting them mortgages.  That has been very important to a large number of family farms as interest rates were at their lowest since the early seventies.  It should be remembered that the building societies have helped hundreds, maybe thousands, of people.</P>
    <P>I wish to comment on Deputy O'Kennedy's contribution as to the reasons for a 3 per cent increase in mortgage rates by one building society &mdash; I presume the others will follow suit.  Certainly the supply and demand of finance is very important and if money is scarce you must pay more for it.  I agree with the Deputy that a 3 per cent increase is too high, a rate of 2 per cent or 2.25 per cent would have been sufficient for the reasons I gave earlier.  The imposition of DIRT cost building societies a mere 7 per cent increase.  I wish to remind Deputy O'Kennedy and other members of the Opposition that in October 1982 the interest on mortgages was at the rate of 16.75 per cent.  Deputy O'Kennedy had many plans in regard to finance but he did not stay with us, he went to Europe. It is very unfair to say that today's rates are appalling compared to then because the average rate over a long period has been in the region of 12 per cent or 12½ per cent.  Even the 3 per cent proposed by one society merely brings the rate up to the average of 12 per cent or thereabouts. I believe that this is a short term increase and that criticism reduces confidence in the building societies.  This is what has happened and I disagree totally with the scurrilous comments made by Deputy Séamus Brennan on the radio. He tried to deflate and undermine the whole financial system of the State. However, it did not work and the proposed increase will be shortlived.  I will not accept the argument from anybody <Col N="993" /> that householders and new mortgage applicants are not entitled to a single repayment each of between £200 and £300 from insurance companies.  It is open to thousands of people throughout the country to avail of such repayments.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Kennedy spoke about local authority housing.  I can tell him that the long waiting lists of thousands of people waiting for such houses have been shortened considerably because of the new reconstruction grants.  Members of the House doubted the effects of these grants on employment in the building and construction industry.  Now, one in every five people who own houses has applied for and got these grants and the State is committed to an expenditure of £100 million to cover them.  House owners themselves have invested between £250 million and £350 million in reconstruction work and consequently the construction industry and employment in it have benefited to that extent.  People who say that these grants have not created employment in building do not know what they are talking about.</P>
    <P>The Bill will mean that those who wish to sell their houses to people who take out mortgages can do so.  We were never so well off in regard to house ownership, and the building societies have played a major part in that, and I hope they will continue to do so.  However, I would welcome a reduction in the cost of mortgages. It is a pity we did not have some positive reaction instead of criticism of this legislation.  As I said, mortgage holders and new applicants will benefit much more than they did five years ago and I hope the Bill will go a long way towards ensuring that local authority housing loans will be reduced from the point of view of solicitor's costs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to support the excellent contributions of Deputies Burke and O'Kennedy.  Listening to the Government speakers, from the Minister up, one would think that the building societies had not made any contribution to the Irish economy.  This legislation has been hastily prepared and is totally hypocritical because it is an effort at political <Col N="994" /> posturing by the Minister and the Government to the people.  The people will show their reaction to that when the question is put to them.</P>
      <P>I have been associated with a building society as a district agent and I have always been impressed at the way the societies operate.  I cannot accept that they are not prepared to face up fairly and squarely to any legislative proposals put to them.  It is important that we ensure that any legislation introduced will maintain equality of opportunity in the financial markets so that all involved in financial institutions will be on an equal footing.</P>
      <P>I would point out that building societies, due to legal restraints <i>vis-à-vis</i> other institutions are inhibited in the matter of developing and expanding the financial service they give to our people.  This Bill is only a piecemeal effort despite the fact that the Minister for the Environment, inside and outside the House, has promised comprehensive legislation.  All we see is this Bill put forward by the Government as a propaganda effort to try to represent to the people that the Government are doing something for mortgagees.</P>
      <P>There cannot be mortgages unless there is investment and there will not be investment if we do not offer inducements to the people to invest in financial services &mdash; the money will not be there. I regret more than most people that mortgage rates have to be increased by 3 per cent but we must appreciate that this is due to market forces.  We must also remember that the associated and commercial banks increased their rates by 3 per cent on two occasions, and unless the other finance houses move accordingly their financial base will be eroded seriously. It is worth repeating that we have a small open economy which is affected by major international movements and it is wrong to suggest that one group of financial institutions should be allowed to react to such international and domestic movements and others should be restrained from doing so.  People who suggest otherwise are not speaking of movements in the financial world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="995" /> Deputy Farrelly castigated my colleague, Deputy O'Kennedy, for speaking as if he was replying to a budget debate. I would remind Deputy Farrelly that Deputy O'Kennedy is a former Minister for Finance. He is the present Opposition spokesman on Finance.  He has a duty to speak on financial matters affecting this country at any time he rises to speak in this House. We warned the Government during the budget debate last January that the imposition of DIRT would have devastating affects on the financial base of our nation.</P>
    <P>I remember speaking after midnight on the night of the budget warning the Minister for Finance, Deputy Dukes, of the consequences of his decision.  He only laughed at our suggestion.  Deputy Farrelly referred to the fact that our Exchequer will receive £5 million more from DIRT than was estimated in the budget.  I submit to Deputy Farrelly that if DIRT remains that £5 million will soon be reduced to a deficit £5 million.  There is positive proof that £1.5 billion has left our shores this year as a result of DIRT. That is a tragedy because if there are not the liquid resources to go around and there is no cash flow within the economy the financial institutions will be short of money.  Consequently, interest rates will rise and the economy will stagnate.  That is what has been happening under this Government in the past four years. Unemployment has risen to almost 250,000 and added to that about 80,000 have left our shores.  Many companies have gone out of business yet the Government continue to impose severe financial constraints on our institutions and on our people.  So long as they continue to do that the economy will contract and will go into a deeper recession.</P>
    <P>I have listened to the comments of the various Government speakers.  It seems that the word &ldquo;profit&rdquo; is a dirty word, so far as they are concerned.  One would think it was a crime to make money. to create wealth and to redistribute that wealth to create opportunities and ensure that our economy expands.  Deputy Yates criticised the building societies with <Col N="996" /> regard to the sum of money they have spent on advertising and on promoting their services.  The building society industry has served this country for about 125 years but only gave a real service and came into the market place in the past 20 years.  Until the Building Societies Act, 1976 there was no type of fair legislation which would enable them to give a real service.  Since 1962 the building society movement has expanded throughout the cities and provincial areas.  Specialising as they do in providing a particular service, finance for housing construction and mortgages, they have to compete with other institutions for the basic commodity which is the peoples' money. Surely, they must advertise their services. They must expand and develop.  The associated and commercial banks have been based across the country over the years.  The building society movement had to get in there, acquire properties, provide a service, employ staff and create jobs in the construction industry by way of the building of office accommodation. They have given a major service and created major opportunities for many people.</P>

      <P>We can compare the services of the building societies to those of the banks in areas where they have been in existence for many years.  The banks employ many young single women. If they marry the banks will re-employ them on a temporary basis thereby saving vast sums of money.  The building societies have to compete on that basis.</P>
      <P>One would think from listening to speakers this morning that there was no competition between the building societies. The building societies have been very progressive in the services they provide to the public.  There is ferocious competition at all times between the building societies.  This has led to a tremendous service being offered to both borrowers and investors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to put the other side of the picture lest people would think that this Bill is designed to clear up a situation which does not exist.  There is no point in creating a myth that this Bill is going to do something for those who have to borrow money to provide their own houses because the real impact of this Bill will be that the cost of money to the institutions and, ultimately, to the borrower will be higher in real terms than it is today.  The building societies have trustee status similar to the banks.  Money invested in those societies is secured for the investors.  At any one time the building societies hold sums in the region of £500 million in Government gilts and stocks.  Surely, that is a major contribution to the domestic borrowing requirements of the Government.  We can contrast the security of investment and the service being given with other financial companies who have gone into liquidation and for whom the Government may have to carry the tab.  That situation can never develop with regard to the status and structure of the building society movement.  We can contrast it to the PMPA where innocent people invested money in an Irish company. That company went to the wall because their liquid reserves were not sufficient <Col N="998" /> to meet demands.  Consequently, those poor innocent investors were the victims and the Government of the day had to carry the can to preserve the jobs, the service and risks which had been carried by the company.  Due to weaknesses in our legislation many companies which were set up in recent years and who took a lot of investors' money want into liquidation while re-investing money in overseas companies.  That is the positive approach we must look to in comparing the financial scenario in this country.</P>
    <P>Deputy Farrelly referred to the fact that interest rates in 1982 were 16.75 per cent but he did not refer to the fact that Fianna Fáil who were in Government at that time had a direct interest subsidy of 2.75 per cent on that interest rate.  The Coalition came into office in November 1982 and abolished that interest subsidy in the 1983 budget.  Where then was the compassion, respect and assistance that borrowers and mortgage holders needed from this caring Government?  How easy it is to forget what happened in the past and the disastrous decisions made that affected mortgage holders.</P>
    <P>I should like to give statistics that will show the level of service given by the building society movement to our people. To date they have about 1,500,000 investors and hold money in trust for those people.  In effect, the investment is gilt-edged. Building societies have about 150,000 mortgage holders and they have helped people who would not qualify for loans elsewhere to purchase houses. Those people may not have been in a position to qualify for a local authority loan because of their income or, due to financial circumstances, may have been refused a loan by the associated banks. The building societies have given a tremendous service over the years and have brought the lending area to a fine art.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes to allow building societies, for the first time, to advance loans other than on the security of a mortgage. I welcome that development as I am sure building societies do.  However, bearing in mind what the Minister has said it appears that he is expecting the <Col N="999" /> societies to provide bridging finance. There is no reason why those societies will not do that.  The Minister has hinted that he will expect the building society movement to refund premiums charged on bridging finance when the mortgage has been arranged.  Anybody providing a service, irrespective of the time involved, must be paid for that service.  A person lending a car to a friend would not expect to have the cost of the petrol used by that friend to be charged to his account and in the same way building societies cannot be expected to hand out money without getting a return on it for their investors. Investors expect a return on their money. I hope the decision to permit building societies to provide bridging finance benefits consumers and I expect the societies to produce a positive structure that will protect borrowers while on bridging finance.  I have no doubt that the societies will charge the minimum interest possible for the duration of the bridging period.</P>
    <P>The Minister proposes to prohibit tiered interest rates.  In my view the proposals in the Bill are designed to hurt the building society movement.  Deputy Yates gave profit figures for the movement but he neglected to quote the comparative figures for the associated banks, concerns that have greater protection under legislation and carry on their business privately.  If the tiered interest rates are abolished the building societies will be expected to operate at a disadvantage <i>vis-à-vis</i> the banks and the other financial institutions.  It is obvious that in order to compete with other financial institutions they must have a tiered investment rate; they must provide incentives for people to invest money, whether it is £1, £1,000 or £100,000, in their societies.  If they are not permitted to pay a tiered investment rate they will not attract the money needed to meet the demand for house mortgages.</P>
    <P>It has been the philosophy of building societies down the years to attract as many investors as possible and the majority of them invest small sums of money.  We must recognise that building societies borrow short term and lend long <Col N="1000" /> term.  In order to sustain the funds needed to carry mortgages they must offer an attractive tiered interest rate for the investor and the mortgage holder.  The majority of mortgages are £20,000 or less and those who can afford to buy bigger houses should pay an extra amount on the money loaned to them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not possible to buy a house for £20,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>On the other hand we must recognise that the bigger the income of a person the greater the mortgage he or she will qualify for.  Such people will get a very high tax relief.  If we abolish the tiered system we may find that the tax relief on mortgages will be reduced or abolished.  The Government's action is discriminatory.  Tiered interest rates ensure that equality prevails for the small investor and the small borrower.  It would be anti-social to remove the tiered interest rate.</P>
      <P>The Bill proposes to abolish redemption fee charges.  That area is very important for preserving the financial security of mortgages and societies.  Those societies must retain the legal right to charge those fees in order to protect their business against loss of mortgages to banks and other financial institutions who may, as they do in Britain, offer building sociiety borrowers a free transfer of loan with no legal costs.  That may be in order here for one building society that enjoys the privilege of having a parent bank but other building societies are not in the same position.  It is obvious that that move is discriminatory.  After acquiring a mortgage a bank or other financial institution will be free, if this Bill is passed, to increase the mortgage rate thus eliminating the original advantage the borrower had.  By transferring those people into a different environment at the particular time there is nothing to prevent the second institution increasing the rate to the detriment of the borrower.  The redemption charge exists to protect the investment and the mortgage and to ensure that mortgages cannot be transferred easily or quickly to the detriment of the investors or the society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1001" /> In Britain societies have re-imposed redemption fees because of the need to protect the mortgage business from attack by other institutions.  It is sad to say that this Bill is being prompted on the basis of British laws that relate to building societies.  We must recognise that there is no prohibition on building societies in Britain charging redemption fees if they see fit.  Redemption fees are imposed in order to protect the investor, the borrower and the society and to ensure that there will be balance in our financial structure.  If there were no redemption fees building society administration costs would escalate.</P>
    <P>I welcome any proposal in any Bill that makes information available to consumers and which creates a climate of opportunity and fair play but we must be sure that the proposals in this Bill will not ultimately be to the detriment of the investor or borrower.  It is proposed in the Bill to make available to the borrower the valuer's report.  This is an important aspect.  In order to protect himself from professional negligence claims the valuer will carry out a more detailed survey with a corresponding increase in cost to the mortgage applicant.  At present architects and surveyors report to the society on the property, its value and condition.  Based on that report a mortgage is offered to the applicant.  The charges are based on the amount of the mortgage irrespective of the price of the house.  If the house costs £100,000 and the mortgage is £30,000 then the cost of the valuer's report is based on the £30,000.  If the position is changed the cost of the valuer's report might be based on the total cost of the house because not only will the valuer have to report to the society but he will have to give a report to the mortgage applicant.  There will be increased charges for the borrower.  That is the other side of the coin.  I represent a rural constituency where people live many miles from an architect's or surveyor's office.  They will be saddled with a mileage charge for the architect or surveyor to inspect the property.  That is discriminatory <Col N="1002" /> and imposes extra costs on the borrower.</P>
    <P>It is proposed to give the customer freedom of choice in deciding where to place his house insurance.  There are two types of insurance which are mandatory for building society clients.  One is the mortgage protection policy which the building society movement pioneered in order to ensure people would be protected in the event of death of either of the partners.  None of the other institutions have followed suit.  Recently local authorities have started to examine the position of mortgage protection insurance.  The building society movement, recognising the importance of the family and the need for protection of the family, have always insisted on mortgage protection insurance.  There is also the normal house insurance.</P>
    <P>Over the years building societies have given their clients a range of insurance companies from which applicants can choose.  Some societies offer three companies and others up to six or seven companies. It is important that there is a choice.  Building societies include the annual insurance premium in the monthly mortgage repayments of their borrowers. If this Bill allows mortgage holders to arrange their own cover with their own insurance company, there will be extra administrative costs involved; the companies will have to carry out checks and the mortgage holder will have to pay the premium annually.  At present building societies include the insurance premium in the monthly mortgage repayments.  Is that not a fair system?  In the event of an insurance claim by a mortgage holder they would have the support and assistance of the building society behind them and would probably have their claim dealt with expeditiously as a result.</P>
    <P>In the United Kingdom people can choose their own company and place their house insurance with them.  On average only 1 per cent of all mortgage holders choose to pick their own company. Surely that is positive proof that the present system is the ideal one and is in the interest of the mortgage holder.  I <Col N="1003" /> see no reason why the names of insurance companies should not be included in the application forms of mortgages.  The applicant could decide which company to use.  Applicants would be saved much time and worry in getting house insurance.  We must ensure that we take a positive look at both sides of every proposal.</P>
    <P>Another proposal is to restrict the building society from charging the customer legal fees in the investigation of title thereby removing the present burden on borrowers of having to pay two sets of legal fees at the time of purchase.  I would welcome a change in this area but it has been proved over the years that on many occasions the building society solicitors find some problem with the title.  Many titles have been perfected as a result of the involvement of building society solicitors.  There is no reason why the position cannot be changed and only one solicitor be involved.  Each building society has a panel of solicitors.</P>
    <P>There is no reason why, with the co-operation of the Incorporated Law Society, a panel of solicitors' names should not be available to mortgage applicants so that they could choose a solicitor, consequently having only one legal charge.  Once that solicitor's name was on the building society panel, the expediting of mortgage applications and the thoroughness of investigation of title in the interests of the mortgage applicant and of the society would lead to a more positive conclusion and a more rapid decision in the signing of a mortgage.  The Incorporated Law Society would have a major role to play in this matter in ensuring co-operation with investors in building societies, with would-be borrowers and the building society industry, so that when this choice would be available that society would provide the necessary legal services, to the advantage of the customer and the borrower.</P>
    <P>If those legal fees were to be charged to the society, they would cost something in the region of £4 million per annum and one could add a further £1 million or <Col N="1004" /> £2 million in VAT for the State.  If the societies have to carry that burden somebody has to pay for it and it will be the investor and, ultimately, the borrower. There will be an added burden unless this situation can be resolved.  Making a <i>carte balanche</i> decision and having an open-ended proposal to change the situation will lead to further pressure on financial resources and institutions, on investors in those institutions and, ultimately, on those who buy or borrow money &mdash; the mortgage holders for whom we are all interested in getting a better deal.</P>
    <P>As I said, the tragedy is that the long promised legislation concerning the building society industry as a whole has not materialised.  This Government have produced this hastily prepared piecemeal legislation.  One must question the reasons for so doing at this time.  They must accept collective responsibility for the financial state of the country.  There is urgent need for major legislation to upgrade and change the financial area of services.  All institutions must be able to compete on an even basis, having equality of opportunity in attracting investment, in reinvesting that money and in providing security for their investors. That is not the situation today.  Some financial institutions enjoy a better climate of support from and through legislation than others.  Until these anomalies are removed, we cannot hope to lift the economy and ensure equality of opportunity for our citizens and our financial houses.</P>
    <P>The income of our building societies will be reduced under this Bill in certain cases.  The DIRT tax had serious implications for the building society movement and for the whole area of finance. The composite rate of tax has been abolished, confidentiality of investment has gone.  All other institutions compete on this basis with the building societies, which was not the position until the budget of 1986.</P>
    <P>There are some loopholes in the Finance Act of 1986 which we pointed out to the present Minister for Finance, Deputy Bruton, when the Bill was going through.  The building society movement <Col N="1005" /> have to compete with the associated banks and life assurance companies in attracting funds and investors and providing resources for mortgage holders and for borrowers.  At the moment, the life assurance companies can provide more incentives and inducements to attract investment because of these loopholes in the Finance Act, by making available investment opportunities guaranteeing 13 per cent free of DIRT, because this money is invested in gilts which are free of that tax.  Consequently they are in a much more advantageous position than are the other financial institutions. This has been pointed out on several occasions inside and outside this House and has been brought to the attention of the Minister for Finance and his Department.  However, nothing has been done about it.  These are areas in which changes can be made.  That would be positive legislation which would protect our financial institutions, ensuring that investors would have a fair range of opportunity for investment in this island.</P>
    <P>As far back as last spring, after the budget, the Government issued a first issue of bonds guaranteeing 10 per cent tax free in return, soaking up £520 million in a few short days.  That has led to market forces dictating the present interest rates. Yet the Government had available to them on foreign markets money at 1.5 per cent, perhaps carrying an exchange risk but at least the money at home would be available to the financial institutions and to the people to improve the country's economic position.</P>
    <P>I have spoken about the disastrous effect which the proposals in the Bill will have on finance and on the building society movement, but I have welcomed the positive aspects of the legislation.  I speak as somebody who understands the building society industry and wants to ensure fair play to all institutions.  That has not been available to the building societies from this Government over the last number of years.  About 18 months ago the Bank of Ireland proposed to acquire the Irish Civil Service Building Society and the then Minister for the Environment, Deputy Kavanagh, gave <Col N="1006" /> this House a commitment that he would bring forward legislation to prohibit that take-over.  That legislation never came forward because the Bank of Ireland, representing as it does the ultra right wing conservative groups in the country with which the Fine Gael dominated Government associated were able to persuade the Taoiseach and the Minister for the Environment that that bank were owed some favour for their involvement as State bankers in the past.  Without any legislation and behind doors a private deal was done and the Irish Civil Service Building Society were put under the control of the Bank of Ireland.</P>

      <P>Deputy Mitchell is talking about something totally different.  Let him not get confused regarding our financial institutions.  We are talking here about the building society industry.  This Government did a private deal with one of the biggest financial groups in the country and put under that group another financial institution.  That was totally unfair and discriminatory.  It has placed the Irish Civil Service Building Society in a very advantageous position <i>vis-à-vis</i> the other building societies.  How can we say that the present legislation will be fair across the board when the range of services being offered by the banks cannot be offered by the building societies, with the exception of the Irish Civil Service Building Society?  It is obvious that Fine Gael friends in Government and out of Government and involved with the ICS building society &mdash; and we know them well &mdash; were able to get together with the Taoiseach and other members of that Fine Gael Cabinet to do a private deal. That is the way this Government have been run for the last few years and particularly have been run for the last few <Col N="1007" /> weeks in this House, with Deputies making private deals with the Taoiseach or the Minister for Social Welfare in order to get their support to stay in office for power's sake.</P>

      <P>I am outlining the financial situation and the duty of Government to ensure that the financial stability of our nation will not be eroded or destroyed.  We have Government by blackmail and at a cost to the ordinary citizen.  Until such time as the Minister brings forward positive progressive legislation to ensure that equality of opportunity prevails there is no point in proceeding with this type of Bill or in coming in here trying to hoodwink the people of this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ICS advertise their money moving facilities and Bank of Ireland managers have green application forms offering incentives to existing investors to transfer their money to ICS.  That is unfair.  It is up to this Minister and the Government who have collective responsibility for that private decision which led to the development of that situation to ensure that it no longer prevails.  It is a tragedy that a commitment given by the Minister for the Environment in this House to bring about that legislation was not fulfilled. The commitment was given by the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Boland, whose arrogance and ill tempered attitude has been much of the cause of mortgage holders and borrowers having to pay more for their money.  The Government should take responsibility for that.  The decision to allow the Bank of Ireland to acquire the ICS was a disgraceful, obnoxious decision by the Government.  It was totally discriminatory to the other financial institutions and particularly to the building societies.  In the interests of the people the Minister should withdraw this Bill and introduce a much more wideranging and positive Bill.  He should amend financial legislation in this House so as to <Col N="1008" /> create a climate of opportunity for our people and equality of competition among all financial institutions so that the building societies, could prove once again that their positive level of service and respect for investors and mortgage holders can be expanded thereby improving the economic climate and also the whole financial position of each individual citizen who enjoys the privileges of investing with a building society.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I will refer to the last point made by Deputy Treacy in regard to the friends of Fine Gael in the Bank of Ireland and the ICS.  I accept that no one financial institution should have an unfavourable opportunity over another. Perhaps that arrangement does need to be looked at but to extend that argument to say that because of the friends Fine Gael have in the Bank of Ireland they get favourable treatment is taking logic beyond any reasonable conclusion.  If the Deputy mentioned the AIB I might have given him some kudos for it but it is rather precarious to say that a certain bank got favourable treatment because of an arrangement with Fine Gael.  I would like to see any unfavourable treatment that the financial institutions might be receiving because of the arrangement between the ICS and the Bank of Ireland put on an even keel.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I was very surprised to hear Deputy Treacy arguing for tiered interest rates.  That is an extraordinary argument from an Opposition Deputy about a Bill which is going through this House in the public interest.  The Deputy said that the average mortgage is £20,000. That may be the average mortgage in the west of Ireland but it seems very low.  In Dublin city one will not purchase a house with a mortgage of £20,000.  The average mortgage in Dublin city is around £35,000.  With tiered interest rates people are paying mortgage interest far in excess of that allowed against income tax.  There can be no justification for the continuation <Col N="1009" /> of tiered interest rates.  It is extraordinary to hear Opposition Deputies arguing in favour of tiered interest rates and for the removal from the Bill of sections dealing with tiered interest rates.</P>
      <P>I welcome in particular the proposals on the charging of redemption fees.  As the Minister said in his speech, one might well expect to be rewarded rather than punished for early repayment of a loan whereas, if one tries to redeem a mortgage there are up to three and four months repayments in penalties for so doing.  I find that extraordinary.  I welcome the fact that the Minister will be looking again at building society legislation. This has been put to him in recent times and he has to take on the challenge which he is being presented with.  I look forward to seeing more detailed legislation before the House and I hope it will be introduced in this session.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Kennedy said that building societies have to do what they are doing because of the market they are in.  Building societies are operating the way they are because of the adversarial system in this House.  Because of that system when we are on the other side of the House we argue against all legislation that is brought before us and the Opposition do so when we are in office.  The building societies know that a substantial number of Deputies in this House will embarrass the Government but will not attempt to embarrass the building societies.  The Opposition know that when all the mud is flying they can do what they want.  I ask Deputy O'Kennedy or any Deputy opposite to say when was the last time mortgage interest rates were reduced by 3 per cent at any one time?  It has nothing to do with the market place but with the weakness this House to represent the people we are supposed to represent. There are people running building societies who know that we have not got the juice to deal with them.  If we were in their position we would probably say that it is a free enterprise society and do the same thing.  Our primary duty in this House should be to do what we consider best for the public just as the people <Col N="1010" /> running building societies want to do their best for those who invest with them. Our duty is in the public interest and we are not serving that interest.  When I see a 3 per cent reduction in building society mortgage interest rates at any one time I will be quite happy to listen to reasoned arguments for a 3 per cent increase at one go.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Kennedy said we must abolish DIRT.  He said that this is the single biggest problem facing the country.  I would like to see deposit interest retention tax abolished particularly for many people on very small incomes.  I would love to do it, but what are Fianna Fáil offering?  Are they saying that we should replace it with farm tax?  No, Fianna Fáil do not want farm tax.  They are against land tax, capital gains tax, wealth tax, income tax, corporation tax, VAT, rates and charges.  Are they in favour of cuts? No.  When Deputy O'Kennedy comes into the House and tells us what he is in favour of when it comes to paying for the cost of running the State, then his arguments can be taken seriously.  Is he then suggesting that we should borrow more?  Surely not.  On all of the money that has been borrowed, mainly when Fianna Fáil were in Government, we are paying an interest rate which is contributing to the upward swing in interest rates today.  It is part of the formula, and if we are to follow on to the logical conclusion of what Deputy O'Kennedy says we will borrow more and therefore cause interest rates to go up again.  The tens of billions of pounds borrowed by Fianna Fáil when they were in office is contributing to the sorrowful situation that we find ourselves in.  We are not the masters of our own destiny, but that has nothing to do with market forces.  That was man-made.  That was deliberately politically manufactured, and this is the road they want us to continue to travel.</P>
    <P>I want to say a word about the term &ldquo;building societies&rdquo;.  It is a total misnomer and I hope that future legislation will abolish that term.  First of all, building societies are not building anything. They are financial institutions.  They are <Col N="1011" /> no longer societies.  Where is the mutualisation of building societies?  There is no mutualisation in building societies.  They run their businesses in the very same way as any private or public limited company. There is no difference whatsoever.  The legislation may say that it is a society and even a building society, but it is involved in neither building nor anything that could be termed a society in terms of mutualisation.  The building societies have behaved in the same arrogant manner as the financial sector generally and in that I include in particular banks like the AIB who come running to this House when they get into any sort of trouble.  The people who are supposed to know about finance go and buy into the ICS and then they come back here and ask this House to build it up, but when they want something they behave with absolute arrogance and increase their rents by 3 per cent at one go.  Building societies are financial institutions along the same lines as banks and they are putting interest up now 3 per cent at one go.  It is outrageous to hear the Opposition suggesting that the Government should back off, withdraw this Bill and not think of any further action.</P>
    <P>The line has been drawn by the building societies.  They are on one side and we are on the other side.  Our duty is to serve the public interest and it is time that we took the building societies on. Until we take them on they will continue to act as they do.  It is time to look at the way the building societies are being run, at the family control of building societies. Are building societies investing in public houses?  Deputy Yates referred to a letter from the chief executive of a building society &mdash; I do not know which society &mdash; saying that finance was available for other than house building.  Are the building societies involved in the purchase of high turnover public houses in this city and country?  That needs to be looked into. What is being done with these investors' funds which are supposed to go into house building?</P>
    <P>Building societies have branches at every crossroads.  If one building society <Col N="1012" /> opens a branch in an area they all open there.  One building society advertises itself as having more branches than Sherwood Forest.  They think that the public cannot see the wood for the trees.  They are at every crossroads, in every village. In the village of Inchicore where I grew up about six building societies have offices now.  How are the resources of these building societies, which are supposed to be available for lending, used?</P>
    <P>I was the first person in recent years to push in this House the question of a lottery in Dublin Corporation.  There was a great deal of derision about it and many people here said that it could not be done. It can be done.  I have argued for years on the same lines, that local authorities should be allowed to go into private business and financial operation.  In particular they should be allowed to set up as building societies.  They are already acting as building societies, as lenders of money to people who buy their own homes but at the lower end of the market, the more insecure end where there are likely to be problems about repayments.  Why should local authorities not be allowed and encouraged to compete with building societies in the way that the Irish Life Assurance Company are encouraged to compete as a State body with private insurance companies?  That can and should be done.  We have the outlets for local authorities, particularly in areas such as Dublin where we could use those outlets as building society offices to compete with the private sector.</P>
    <P>Competition from abroad would be beneficial to the general public.  We should not exclude building societies from abroad.  Many people abroad would see investing in this country as beneficial. Building societies from abroad could come in here and encourage investors here to avail of their facilities and put some of the building societies in this country on their toes.  They need competition. What good do building societies offer outside their supposed mutualisation and their supposed friendly society type lending arrangements?  Do they give much employment?  Who is employed in a local building society <Col N="1013" /> office?  I will tell you.  More than likely it is a retired bank manager.  The whole worth, the whole involvement of building societies in the community needs to be examined.  That is why I feel that a detailed and thorough public examination of the role of building societies is overdue.</P>
    <P>The control of building societies, the perks available to those who control building societies, the preferential loans available to those who control building societies, the cars available to those who control building societies, the entertainment expenses and the fees paid to those in control of building societies, should be subject to certain parameters and to public inquiry in view of the outrageous 3 per cent announced by one building society in recent days, and in view of the confrontation with which this Government are presented now, we should set up a full public inquiry to look into these secret matters which the shieks of the financial world in this city have enjoyed for a very long time.  We should examine it to see if they are enjoying this at the expense of the poor man and woman on a mortgage who are in very tight circumstances who are now going to be faced all of a sudden with a 3 per cent increase in their mortgage rate.  A public inquiry is needed, not an inquiry which will report next year or the year after. There is no reason why an inquiry should not be able to report by the end of January. An inquiry should be set up into the whole workings of the building societies, examining the matters I have mentioned and the worth of these societies &mdash; if that is the correct term to use &mdash; to the community in view of the arrogant manner in which not just building societies but financial institutions in general have been behaving.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  It contains many innovations which are long overdue.  I welcome the commitment in the Minister's speech on moving Second Stage that he will be returning to this area in the not too distant future.  I hope that he will take in some of the suggestions which have been made here today when he so returns.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I am always surprised, if not amused, at the contortions which many spokespersons for free enterprise and capitalism in this House get themselves into in arguing on the one hand for total free competition and, on the other, when it does not work out for their friends in whatever sector, they argue for aids and support, and cry &ldquo;foul&rdquo; and &ldquo;unfair&rdquo; when particular institutions pull a fast one on some other institution. It was demonstrated very clearly here this morning by Deputy Treacy of Fianna Fáil when he spoke about the Irish Civil Service Building Society being taken over by the Bank of Ireland and how unfair this is to the rest of the building societies.  On the other hand, he is arguing for free competition and arguing that the building societies should not be restricted or controlled in the way that this Bill is proposing to do.  Whatever about the people in this House, at least the people outside this House should be aware of the contradictory arguments and positions which various Deputies take in this House.</P>
      <P>I was interested in Deputy Gay Mitchell's very spirited denunciation of the 3 per cent increase in the mortgage rate of the Irish Nationwide Building Society.  I agree with him that it is a disgrace.  But Deputy Mitchell is a member of Fine Gael which is a major element in the present Government who brought in overnight a Bill to save the Allied Irish Banks in their unfortunate investment in ICI and handed out what, in the long run, will be taxpayers' money for the rescue of ICI.  There is no emergency Bill here today to restrict the building societies in raising their mortgage rates by 3 per cent in one go.  If Deputy Mitchell is seriously concerned about the effect of this increase on the mortgage holders, then he should be demanding special legislation to control not only the very minor areas which are being dealt with in the Bill before us today, but the building societies and their activities and the way that they virtually rob the mortgage holders of this State when they choose to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They should also control the other <Col N="1015" /> major institutions who apparently have a free hand in what they do in relation to our economy.  I refer briefly to a glaring example of what they appear to be able to do.  We were told in recent weeks that £1,500 million left this State and it must have been taken out with the connivance of the financial institutions.  That is equivalent to 30,000 jobs and it was taken out of this State by the people we are told to look up to, the people who it is supposed would create jobs if they were given a chance.  Yet they strip this country of its financial resources and send them out to Britain, America, Japan, Hong Kong, wherever the profit rate is better than it is here.  When it is all boiled down what we are talking about is profit and profit rate.</P>
    <P>The quickest way to make a profit in a capitalist society is to feed off and exploit a need which every citizen of this State has, a need to have a house.  The families of this State cannot live a decent life without adequate shelter.  The financial institutions which we are told are the backbone of this country, the building societies, the banks and the insurance companies, are exploiting that need. That is what we are talking about here today.  All we are talking about, despite the great worries being expressed by Fianna Fáil, is a few minor adjustments to the law relating to building societies. We are not talking about preventing them from milking the mortgage holders in any significant way.  We are talking about restricting them here and there.  We are not talking about taking any action in relation to the 3 per cent hike by the Irish Nationwide Building Society.  The private enterprise nature of the business of loaning money to people to house themselves have many of the worst features of loan sharking which we have, on numerous occasions, criticised in this House.  Every citizen and every family has the right to a decent place to live.  Until such time as a Government exists in this State which is prepared to ensure that that is provided at a reasonable cost and does not require a family or a person to put into hock 20 to 30 years of their life to supply themselves with, we are only codding ourselves talking <Col N="1016" /> about restricting this or that or tying up the building societies in relation to charging for a second solicitor or not allowing mortgage holders to see surveys and so on.  They are important and useful reforms but they will not, in any circumstances affect the major outgoings which a mortgage holder will have to meet at the end of this month or at the end of next month because of the operations of the financial institutions of this State.</P>
    <P>The Irish Nationwide Building Society have announced an increase in the mortgage rate of 3 per cent.  That in itself is a lie.  It is an attempt to confuse people. What it is in fact is an increase of one third of the rate which is being charged. It is being increased from 9.5 per cent to 12.5 per cent, a third of the rate that this company is charging to its mortgage holders.  Successive Governments have refused to take any legislative measures which would enable them to control the interest rates charged by societies.  In fact in section 3 of this Bill, where the Minister is taking additional powers to control the activities of the society, he specifically excludes control of interest rates.  So who is codding who in this House today?</P>
    <P>Successive Governments have abdicated their responsibility to manage the financial affairs of this State.  The financial institutions and the speculators can do what they like.  They can rip off this country whenever and as often as they wish.  They can create black holes at will. They can export the money which this State needs to create jobs and export it to wherever they choose to create jobs elsewhere, because they may get an extra rate of profit.  In fact the primacy of this House, the democratically elected representatives of this State have refused to take control of the economy of this State and have failed miserably to ensure that the wealth created by the working people of this country is kept there to ensure that jobs are created here.</P>
    <P>I am reminded of a poem called The Rebel by Padraig Pearse where he warns that in the society that he dreamed about the men with their keen long faces in their counting houses would not easily <Col N="1017" /> give up the power they have to control our lives.  That is the reality today despite our political independence.  This House is powerless to do anything about it.  The board of the Central Bank which in our legislation of 1942 is supposed to ensure that our institutions act in the interests of the community appeared in recent weeks to be enthusiastically involved in the speculative activities which have virtually wrecked interest rates and investment in this State.  Is it any wonder?  The present board of the Central Bank comprises representatives of the other private banks and similar commercial interests.  I argue that the board members with private and commercial financial interests should be sacked from the board of the Central Bank and replaced by people who would protect the interests of the community and back the law, weak as it is, in the interests of the common good, in the interests of the ordinary man who must slave each day for a paltry wage.  I am not talking about protecting the institutional investors who can shift their money around at will to increase their incomes. The important question in this matter is, who runs the country; the banks, the building societies, the insurance companies and their directors, or this House, the people who are elected to run the country?  It is obvious from events over the years and in recent weeks that this House certainly does not run the country.</P>
    <P>This Bill is welcome in so far as it goes but it is relatively minor legislation.  I agree to some extent with what either Deputy Treacy or Deputy O'Kennedy said in that it is window dressing to try to give the impression that the Government are concerned about the building societies. The reforms are welcome but they are minor.  The Bill does not attempt to deal with management expenses, directors fees, expense accounts with the vast advertising in which building societies are engaged or with the duplication of offices all over the country.  There are four or five such offices at virtually every major intersection in any town or city.</P>
    <P>The proposal to abolish redemption fees and tiered interest rates and the <Col N="1018" /> reforms in relation to solicitors and insurance fees and so on are very welcome but it is regrettable that Deputy Boland does not intend to break the cartel of building societies.  It has been suggested that because the Irish Nationwide Building Society independently increased their rate by 3 per cent in the last day or two a break up of the cartel is indicated.  I do not believe it has broken up.  The Irish Nationwide Building Society are flying a flag to see how far they can go and the other building societies will watch the reaction to see what they can get away with.  If they get away with this 3 per cent they will all increase their rates by 3 per cent.  There is no question of the cartel being broken up because the personal and financial interests of those at the top of the building societies rests in maintaining the cartel. Officially or unofficially they will operate their cartel, just as do other financial institutions.</P>
    <P>In 1985 the building societies loaned out £428 million to over 18,000 borrowers. The Housing Finance Agency loaned out £116 million to over 5,000 borrowers.  The local authority loaned £75 million to 5,000 borrowers and the banks and the insurance companies lent relatively minor amounts for house purchase. The building societies control 90 per cent of the borrowing that exists for house purchase.  If one wants a loan one must go to the building society or else to the Housing Finance Agency to get a loan.  One will not get a Housing Finance Agency loan unless one's income is below a certain level.  In March 1986 the total assets of the building societies amounted to just under £3,000 million.  The ten Irish building societies have come a very long way from their roots when they were first established as co-operative and friendly societies.  They are now run by the self-perpetuating clique whose main objective is not the provision of low cost finance for housing for the maximum number of people, as has been suggested on the Fianna Fáil side, but for the self-advancement and financial gain of this small clique at the top who run the societies. It is clear from the comments today <Col N="1019" /> that neither Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael nor, one must assume, the Progressive Democrats, given their political philosophy, will do anything to undermine the domination by the building societies of housing finance.</P>
    <P>I understand that the Taoiseach ordered an inquiry into the building societies and that a report, the Horohan report, arising from that inquiry was never published.  Deputy Yates seemed to indicate this morning that he got a look at it, but I wonder how many other Deputies in this House got their hands on it.  I have not seen it and I do not know if any mortgage holder outside this House has managed to see it either.  Why has it been kept secret?  However, the Department of the Environment published a discussion document on legislative and regulatory arrangements in regard to building societies in April 1986.  It contains reasonably interesting and informative information but it is far from a radical document which would ensure the proper control of building societies.</P>
    <P>Theoretically seven out of the ten building societies are mutual societies owned by their members but, in practice, they are controlled by a self-perpetuating group.  In living memory a director nominated by ordinary shareholders has never been elected to the board of any of the ten building societies.  This was clearly illustrated in the case of the First National when Henry Murdock sought nomination to the board on a platform of reasonable reforms.  He was unsuccessful and withdrew eventually when the building societies co-opted a professor of business on to the board.  One practical way of dealing with that problem could be through fiscal, legal and administrative pressure to force the building societies to behave more as co-operatives or self-helf societies, which was intended in the first place.  This could be done by legislation in regard to the election of directors, through postal voting facilities, a role for the Central Bank in their regulation and taking away tax benefits which would make them less attractive to their current bosses.</P>
    <P>I referred to management expenses: <Col N="1020" /> those of the Irish building societies are consistently higher than in the United Kingdom.  They totalled £40 million in this country in 1984 and there has been a rapid rise in expenses from 1.6 per cent of mean mortgage assets in 1975 to 2.19 per cent in 1984.  One of the greatest costs is in the massive duplication of fancy offices by the building societies.  There is hardly a crossroads which does not have five or six such offices.  In Phibsboro, virtually every vacant shop has been taken over by a building society and another one is opening shortly.</P>
    <P>Building societies are among the biggest advertisers, and the Irish Permanent have had an advertisement on RTE every night since the station was founded.  Why should building societies feel they must compete with each other? They are supposed to be mutual self-help societies offering aid to those with small investments and to potential house buyers who need loans.  Advertising is a total waste of money, obviously there is a need for a certain amount to ensure that the public are aware of the services available but constant, repetitious advertising between all the building societies is unnecessary.</P>
    <P>The directors of building societies are extremely well rewarded financially.  The Irish Permanent paid their eight directors an average of £11,100 per annum for merely attending a few meetings each year in the case of their non-executive directors.  In addition, directors were paid £282,000 under other headings which means they were paid £35,000 each on average or a total of £46,000 each per annum.  That is the average figure based on the number of directors but, in practice, the likelihood is that most of the money went to the head of the company who was not appointed on the basis of skills in open competition but who inherited his position as head of the Irish Permanent Building Society from his father.</P>
    <P>The EBS pay their directors £6,000 per annum plus a sum of £124,000 in other remuneration.  The First National paid an average of £7,300 plus £137,000 spread over all the directors.  Why are we never <Col N="1021" /> told by the building societies how this money is spent?  To whom it is paid? These are global figures which appear in their annual reports but we are never told to whom the money is paid and why. There should be total disclosure in regard to remuneration to directors.  There should also be a declaration of interest paid to directors of these societies. Section 41 of the 1976 Act dealing with building societies calls on directors to disclose interest in contracts with the society.  Section 43 calls for the disclosure of details of loans to directors or members of their families.  Clearly, from the information available, these laws are not implemented in a way which requires disclosure of information to shareholders.</P>
    <P>The tie-up of building societies with insurance companies is another area which gives cause for concern and is not properly revealed in the annual reports of buildings societies.  Each building society is linked to an insurance company and the directors of the building societies are often rewarded with directorships of the insurance companies.  This practice should be ended and borrowers should be allowed to shop around to purchase property insurance where they choose. This point is included in the Bill but there is no restriction on insurance companies and building societies breaking the cartel arrangement between each other.</P>
    <P>The building societies also force borrowers to go to one of their nominated solicitors and often the principals of the firms of such solicitors are on the boards of the building societies.  In addition, building societies force borrowers to pay the legal fees of the societies.  In every purchase three solicitors are involved, the purchaser's own solicitor, the building society's solicitor and the vendor's solicitor.  Clearly one solicitor would be sufficient for the building society and the purchaser.  I could go on and on detailing abuses in regard to the borrower by building societies, the manner in which building societies are run and the weak law which exists to restrict them.</P>
    <P>Building societies are slow in agreeing to pay out loans.  This Bill will now allow them to offer bridging finance and I <Col N="1022" /> should like the Minister to indicate what incentive there will be for building societies to keep the bridging loan rates of interest at least on a par with the rates charged for a mortgage.  Does the Minister consider that there will be an incentive for them to delay sanction for loans in order to keep applicants on high interest bridging finance?</P>
    <P>Much needs to be done in reforming the whole area of financial institutions. This House should control the actions of financial institutions in relation to the economy and the Bill is a very minor step in that direction.  Other major areas remain to be tackled to ensure that the ordinary person is no longer a victim of the greedy financial speculators who seem to run the country at present.</P>

      <P>I wish to make a brief contribution on the Bill, which I welcome. We have two types of Minister, the talker and the doer, and Deputy Boland is in the latter category.  We have been talking about attacking this problem for years and Ministers have been given an awful runaround by the societies in the most arrogant fashion imaginable.  It has taken until now for some Minister to tackle the building societies by way of legislation under which some protection could be afforded to house purchasers and shareholders in building societies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if he is aware of the widespread complaints regarding the condition of the county roads, especially in west and north Clare; and if he has any proposals to deal with the situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the condition of roads generally, including county roads, <Col N="1023" /> in County Clare.  Primary responsibility for the planning and execution of maintenance works on county roads rests with the local authority concerned and the expenditure involved falls to be financed from the authority's own resources.</P>
      <P>However, because of my concern about the county road network, I announced a new scheme of grants in July 1986 for strengthening of county roads.  I allocated a total of £5 million to local authorities for that purpose in the current year: £305,000 out of the total of £5 million was allocated to Clare County Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I would draw the Minister's attention to the fact that the money provided is inadequate to meet the situation in Clare.  The Minister must know that county roads everywhere are deteriorating rapidly.  Indeed their foundations need major overhaul and many times the amounts of money being provided will be necessary to restore the foundations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that but we have a very serious problem in regard to county roads.  It is getting totally out of control and it is beyond the financial capabilities of the councils to manage. Would the Minister provide more money for Clare County Council before our roads collapse altogether?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy and the House will appreciate that local authorities consistently have been calling for more devolved powers.  The power and responsibility for the maintenance of county roads have rested with the local authorities traditionally, and the making available by me of this money during the summer was the first occasion on which there was direct government intervention for the strengthening of county roads. The local authorities get large subventions every year by way of block grants with which to improve county and regional roads.  The block grant allocated <Col N="1024" /> to Clare this year represented an increase of 22 per cent on the previous year, amounting to £711,000.  In addition, money was allocated to certain councils under the western package for improvement of county roads used mainly for agricultural and forestry purposes. Through that scheme Clare County Council got another £265,000, which was spent, presumably, on county roads.  In other words, Clare County Council received an unusual amount of grant aid this year specifically for county roads. Because of their geographical position <i>vis-à-vis</i> the western package, the Clare authority got greater county road grant allocations than other councils.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>The position in County Clare is very critical.  The roads are deteriorating at a rapid rate and it will cost an enormous amount if remedial action is not taken immediately.  Would the Minister increase the amount being given as direct assistance to councils to deal with the county roads crisis?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>When I made the £5 million available to Clare County Council in July last I indicated it was my intention to double that amount, to make £10 million available to Clare next year.</P>

      <P>A regulation has been made and published to the effect that only registered contractors who have <Col N="1026" /> signed full contracts for the construction of houses can carry out the work for which applicants will qualify for grants. That being so, does the Minister agree that this would militate seriously against people who could employ registered sub-contractors but who, because they themselves are skilled tradesmen, could carry out work on their houses?  I compliment the Minister on his efforts to rule out blackmarketeering in regard to this work, but I suggest he should allow registered sub-contractors who are paying tax to qualify under the new scheme.  That would be a major improvement in the regulation.</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputy for his remarks in relation to our efforts to ensure that work which is grant-aided will be carried out by white economy contractors.  Perhaps the Deputy did not hear my reply, which had the implication that where individuals are having houses built on their own sites we are making arrangements that when they employ registered sub-contractors they will be eligible to apply for the grant.

Grant applicants whose brothers or fathers might be in the building industry and who pay PAYE in the normal course of events as block-layers or plasterers should be allowed to get them to construct their houses.

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for <Col N="1027" /> the Environment if he will allocate funds to enable improvement works to be carried out to alleviate persistent flooding in Skibbereen, County Cork; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The report of the Road Traffic and Flooding Study which has been submitted to my Department by the local authority contains proposals aimed at averting the danger of flooding in Skibbereen. This report is being examined in my Department and in the meantime the local authority have been asked to review the proposals in the light of the flooding which occurred in August this year.  The flooding proposals are closely integrated with the local authority's proposed sewerage scheme, plans for which will now require to be revised to take account of the measures proposed in relation to the flooding.  They are also inter-related with the road works proposals in respect of which the local authority have been requested to submit the additional information required for the evaluation of the proposal.</P>
      <P>The stage has not yet been reached where the question of the allocation of funds in respect of the proposals would arise.  When the necessary information and planning has been brought to the stage where decisions can be taken on the different elements in the proposals I will consider them as sympathetically as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that at least we have received sympathy from the Minister but is he aware that proposals to alleviate flooding in Skibbereen have been put forward for the past 30 years? Their examination should be complete by now.  Has the Minister got an interim proposal to alleviate the worst aspects of the flooding?  There is persistent flooding in Skibbereen.  Hurricane Charlie had devastating effects.  I would like to have a commitment from the Minister that he will allocate funds to carry out elementary works to alleviate the worst aspects of this flooding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>As I pointed out to the <Col N="1028" /> Deputy who is more familiar with them than either I or any other Member of this House, there are a variety of proposals for improvements in Skibbereen.  These relate to flood relief, a major sewerage scheme and road improvements.  Essentially, what I was saying in the formal reply is that it would appear it would be best to try to integrate those together so that the maximum benefit can be derived. I accept that the question regarding the flooding problem in Skibbereen is not new and is in urgent need of attention. The Deputy will be aware, in response to the flooding caused by Hurricane Charlie, of the level of grant aid which was allocated to Cork County Council which was in the order of £1.5 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am particularly interested in Skibbereen and I want to know what the Minister has done about the proposal which I sent to him to get rid of some rock which is causing flooding. This rock is part of the lien river.  If this rock was removed it would alleviate the worst aspects of the flooding.  The residents and business people of the town have suffered severe financial losses and they are looking to the Minister for an allocation of money.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;I would be prepared to sympathetically look at any realistic proposal of that nature.  There are major proposals which involve a diversion of the Ilen river which would lower its level, the provision of a relief road which in turn would act as a flood barrier between the river and the town, the upsiding of the sewers in the town to take surface water and a water pumping station.  They represent the long term solution.  I would be prepared to look sympathetically at <Col N="1029" /> whether an interim proposal could be carried out and subsequently integrated into a major scheme.  I will communicate directly with the Deputy in that regard.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The condition of the road network is subject to regular review by my Department in the context of the preparation of road plans and when considering annual road grant allocations. This review is based on scientific evaluations by An Foras Forbartha and on information provided by local authorities and my Department's inspectors.  One of the results of the most recent review is that the block grant to local authorities in 1986 is 21 per cent higher than the 1985 provision.  I also decided earlier this year to allocate £5 million for country road strengthening.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if he will consider making an order deleting the clause in relation to fee simple in the 1966 Housing Act where a tenant must have purchased his or her house for 25 years before they can freely dispose of it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">

    <Speaker pid="NedOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. E. O'Keeffe Mr. E. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>The only reason I put down this question was that tenants who have purchased houses under that Act and who have to dispose of them find <Col N="1030" /> difficulty if they have to provide a building society loan as, because of that clause, a building society is not prepared to fund the loan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>There are other reasons as to why the clause is there.  As the Deputy knows, the housing authority have the power to waive that clause in certain circumstances.  I would have thought that if a difficulty arose from time to time it might be best met in that way rather than by varying the overall provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that there are inconsistencies in many of these house purchase schemes?  Some of these houses were purchased on an annuity basis and if the annuity is paid off the former tenant puarchaser acquires full rights to transfer.  Therefore, there does seem to be variations between the different authorities.  Would the Minister not agree that there should be uniformity throughout the system?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>There is uniformity in some schemes but in relation to older dwellings the conditions may differ.  The only way to secure uniformity would be to recast the present scheme to bring it into line with previous schemes.  It would be impossible to recast the previous schemes to bring them into line with the existing one.  I am not sure if the Deputy on reflection would advocate that course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>If a tenant purchaser buys the house, should his position be regarded all that differently from a purchaser who buys his house through a building society or in any other way?  He is paying the full market value.  After a relatively short number of years goes by, is there any particular advantage to anybody in putting a tie on his rights to alienate, sell or remortgage the house? Is there any reason why he should be disadvantaged in that way simply because he bought it from a county council of corporation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The House will be aware <Col N="1031" /> of the extremely high cost to the State in the provision of local authority housing. Whilst the Deputy suggests that the purchaser buys a house at market value it is only in the recent scheme, introduced in the last few months by me, that the purchaser has the option to choose either the market value or a discount price based on the cost of the house less allowances for each year of tenancy and allowances equivalent to the new house grants. Because the house was provided as part of the local authority stock and the tenant received his tenancy through that local authority system it is felt to be incumbent upon the State to ensure that the house continues to be used for housing purposes, that that tenant has adequate housing and intends to live in the house and on becoming a tenant purchaser he would not immediately thereafter sell his interest in the house to some other person, thereby bringing about the result that having sold the house he would once again become an applicant for local authority housing.  As I said, there is a provision which allows the local authority to waive this particular provision in individual cases.  It is my understanding that where a case is made to the local authority as to why this should be done their response from a purchaser's point of view is generally satisfactory.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if he will make a statement on his discussions with the building societies regarding their proposal to increase mortgage rates; if he will indicate the measures he intends to take to more effectively control mortgage rates; the measures, if any, he intends to take to assist householders who face an increase of as much as £80 per month; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>In the first instance.  I <Col N="1032" /> would refer the Deputy to what I said about building society interest rates in my Second Stage speech on the Building Societies (Amendment) Bill, 1986, this morning.</P>
      <P>Over the past week I have met with representatives of the major building societies on a few occasions to discuss interest rates and other matters.  I indicated my concern that the size of any increase in the mortgage rate arising from recent increases in interest rates generally should be kept to a minimum in the interests of house purchasers and the housing programme.  I also made certain suggestions about methods of applying any increase so as to alleviate the impact on borrowers.</P>
      <P>In the event the Irish Building Societies Association did not on this occasion agree a common position in regard to interest rates and announcements of new rates are to be made by individual societies. The level of increase which has already been announced by one society is in my view unwarranted.  A major problem in this regard is that the approach adopted by this particular society inevitably puts pressure on other societies and institutions operating in the financial markets. I am extremely disappointed that this position should have arisen and am actively considering its implications.</P>
      <P>A responsible approach by the societies to the determination and application of increases in interest rates is the best assistance that can be offered to householders at this time.  As the Deputy is aware, the Government already provides, from scarce resources, a generous package of tax concessions and grants to assist householders in purchasing, maintaining and improving their homes and additional assistance towards mortgage repayments could not be contemplated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">

      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>There will not be, if I get answers from the Minister.  The Minister has described the increase of 3 <Col N="1033" /> per cent as unwarranted and suggested that building societies should keep their interest rates to a minimum.  I understand he said this morning that he regarded an increase of 2 per cent as the most that is required.  In view of the fact that in the Bill before the House restrictions on building society interest rates are excluded I should like to know if the Minister has any other proposals in mind for controlling them or ensuring that if societies raise their rates to what he regards as an unwarranted figure he will have some control to prevent them doing that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not quite correct for the Deputy to say that the Bill before the House specifically excludes control provisions in relation to building society rates generally.  It would be more correct to say that the Bill does not provide for control, it does not include an exclusion provision.  However, traditionally it has been the approach of successive Governments to allow building societies to respond as necessary to movement in interest rates generally.  That requires a responsible attitude on the part of the societies.  If it was felt that the response of the societies was less than responsible in the prevailing circumstances in the market that would pose grave questions for a Government.  It is to be hoped that that will not arise.  I am sure there will be general agreement that it would be very serious if we reached the stage that the Government were having questions posed to them in the Parliament of the tenor of the question Deputy Mac Giolla asked.</P>

      <P>The Minister has not replied to my question.  He has told us that the position could be very serious if certain things happened but I must put it to him that these things have occurred, he has negotiated with building societies and told them of the limit beyond which they should not go.  The societies have gone beyond that limit and I should like to know if the Minister has spoken to his Cabinet colleagues about this, as he promised on the radio this morning. What are the Government prepared to do in response to this defiance by the building societies?  Has the Minister reached a decision in regard to controlling the societies who defy the Government and the Minister?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>So far we have had an indication from one society but, as I indicated, once that intention is implemented a great deal of pressure is put on colleague societies and other financial institutions. When I discussed this matter with the societies last week I suggested three different options to them based on my firm belief that the present rise in interest rates is of a temporary nature.  I suggested that the societies should consider either deferring the adjustment of repayments for some time until the <Col N="1035" /> market returned to stability and the temporary hike in interest rates fell.  I suggested that the societies would have the option of recovering whatever the additional charges were at a later date.</P>
      <P>Secondly, I suggested that they might recover the additional cost by giving the mortgage holder the option of having the mortgage period extended rather than increasing the monthly repayments.  I had hope that the societies would show an interest in my third option which was that they should consider notifying borrowers of a fixed repayment sum for a fixed period ahead.  For example, that the borrower's repayment for the years ahead be fixed so that the borrower would know with certainly what he or she had to pay over a 12-month period.  I suggested that at the end of that period the account of the borrower should be examined to see how the repayment profile had performed as against actual movements in interest rates with a subsequent adjustment in the ensuing period.  The adjustment could be up or down, depending on the way the market had moved in the meantime.</P>
      <P>That has obvious attractions for borrowers in that it introduces a certainty for them over a reasonable period ahead.  I hoped it would have had attractions for the societies in that it would reduce the considerable administrative costs to them in notifying changes to their borrowers from time to time.  I asked the societies, if they adopted that fixed repayment sum over a specified period, to allow borrowers the option of repaying in less than 12 monthly instalments over an annual period so that a borrower might have the option of excluding a particular month such as the month of December. Many borrowers might prefer to pay a fixed sum in 11 instalments so as to use their repayments as a vehicle for saving or to have additional cash in the month of December.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With the exception of the society which announced an increase, and has notified me that they do not intend to implement any of the options I have outlined but <Col N="1036" /> would consider hardship cases made to them, I have not had any clear indication from the other societies as to whether they are prepared to implement any of the three options.  I have not been notified by those societies of their specific proposals regarding rate changes.  In order to ensure that the House is fully informed I should like to state that some of the other societies have indicated to me that they believed that if one society went ahead of the pack and set a rate level which might not be considered necessary by those societies they would feel it very difficult not to seek to match that offer level so as to remain competitive within the general building society movement.</P>

I am satisfied that these bodies, which are familiar with local circumstances, are competent to set such standards.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10, 50, 60 and 61 together. The objective of waste disposal policy is to ensure that all wastes, and particularly any hazardous waste which call for special disposal arrangements, are safely disposed of without risk to public health or to the environment.  The proposal to provide a central waste transfer station at Baldonnel to facilitate the export of hazardous wastes for which suitable disposal facilities were not otherwise available was a primary element in national waste strategy which was first announced over five years ago.  Since then, it has become evident that new initiatives in the private waste disposal sector could have a significant bearing on the proposal and it was necessary to review it in the light of these developments.  The proposal is still under detailed examination.  I will make a public statement in the matter as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister confirm if the Baldonnel facility has been discontinued or if there is still a possibility that it may be used?  Will he indicate whether it is the view of his Department that the question of dealing with hazardous wastes is a matter of national policy or if it comes within the ambit of local authorities?  Does his Department have any monitoring capability by way of scientists to ensure that these materials can be disposed of safely?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The question as to the future of the Baldonnel proposal is still under consideration.  I hope to make an announcement about it in the near future. As far as policy responsibility is concerned the obligation is shared by national and local government.  If, for example, the private sector disposal arrangements were to become reality there actual implementation and monitoring would almost certainly involve local authorities or various public authorities at a local level.  However, there is an overall obligation on national Government to ensure that there are adequate disposal facilities available for the different types of hazardous wastes which are <Col N="1039" /> being produced or which may evolve. There are no scientists in my Department but the resources of various State bodies are available and there are public authorities who have the necessary technical expertise which may be required in order to provide monitoring arrangements in certain circumstances.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ToddyOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>This arises from the housing regulations 1980.  Anyone applying for a grant is made aware of the regulations regarding fittings and so on in the documentation which is supplied to them.  Many people still persist in having these fittings in garages and develop them for residential purposes which is not permissible.</P>

This regulation should be relaxed.  I urge the Minister to consider changing this regulation. As tomorrow is the closing date for the receipt of applications will the Minister confirm that if people who wish to apply for a grant give their names to the Department without filling in an application form they will be considered for a grant?  There are many people who are not aware that unless they apply before tomorrow they will not be eligible for a grant.</P>

The provision of funds for this scheme will not arise until this examination is finalised.

This firm manufacture containers for export. <Col N="1046" /> They are unable to extend their premises due to the sewerage scheme being in its present position and in the circumstances, as there is a question of job creation involved, would the Minister please consider approval of the scheme as a matter of priority?</P>

      <P>This question was asked just 12 months ago and at that time Deputy De Rossa was informed that legislation was in preparation.  I am glad to hear the Minister's reply.  I presume he is aware that the new draft register is being prepared at the moment and will be on display in about a month or five weeks' time.  That is the register that will be in force when the next election is held, if it is after April.  Can the Minister assure us that the legislation will be introduced in time to enable disabled persons to be on the register for postal voting, the one which will be prepared for April 1987?</P>

      <P>In the likelihood that the next general election is fought on the basis of that register which is at present being prepared and will come into force in April next, assuming that there is co-operation within the House, I think it would be possible to identify the people who will be eligible for postal voting on that register.  I hope that, if the draftsman provides the Bill in time &mdash; I know that the Opposition parties have indicated their support for the measure and I assume that it will not be held too long in the House &mdash; it might be possible to prepare work in that regard as soon as the Bill is enacted.  The Deputy referred to the fact that his colleague received a rather similar reply 12 months ago.  The reason for the delay is that as a result of an examination of the practices that had occurred during the postal voting provisions in the local elections of 1985 an entire revision and recasting of the proposals had to be carried out.  I was going to say to the Deputy that some of the things that have happened would make the hair stand on your head.</P>

I know that the Ceann Comhairle will discipline me if I appear to be anticipating what is in the legislation.  The House will appreciate that under any system that might be introduced there would be a period necessary when the person who would be potentially eligible as a disabled person for postal voting facilities would make application and produce proof of their disability. The administrative time taken in allowing for a scheme to be advertised <Col N="1049" /> and applications to be made and verified would need to be taken into account also. It is merely because of my uncertainty as to the administrative length of time that I cannot give a categorical answer to the Deputy.  The answer that I can give with best certainty and that ought to relieve the minds of Deputies opposite is that I expect that this procedure will be prepared and will come into operation for the first time in conjunction with the register that will come into force on 14 April next.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I introduced a purchase scheme for local authority dwellings on 30 July 1986.  The new scheme is generally similar to previous schemes but incorporates the new feature of allowing market value to be used in determining sale prices where this is more favourable to the tenants than the formula sale price. This change had been requested for some time by NATO.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 14 August 1986 I notified housing authorities of the Government's decision to return to them the responsibility for <Col N="1051" /> rent schemes for their dwellings as a further stage in the devolution of a wider range of functions to local authorities. The determination of rents for their dwellings is a function which naturally complements the responsibility of local authorities for the maintenance and management of their housing stock.  Any revised schemes introduced by housing authorities must be income related, with allowances for children, and special provision for hardship cases.</P>
    <P>There is no change in the status of NATO as the national representative body for local authority tenants.  Their views were expressed at the series of meetings held to discuss the tenant purchase and rent schemes and were taken into account in the decisions made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister on the decision to include market value for the operation of the purchase scheme.  It was a major step forward.  I will concentrate on the element of question No. 40.  Is the Minister seriously suggesting to this House that devolution of powers could be the terms used to describe a situation where the Minister gives the power to city and county managers to review local authority rents where the local authority members have absolutely no say in the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will know quite a number of the functions of local authorities are executed statutorily by the county manager.  A minority of the functions are known to the elected members as reserved functions.  One would expect, and I understand that it is happening in practice, that managers would discuss with their elected local authorities the provisions of any new rents scheme or any changes in the scheme so as to get the benefit of the advice, the experience and the understanding of the local authority members before any changes are brought about in rents schemes.  I consider the decision which was taken by the Government to be totally in line with the Government's commitment towards devolution of functions generally.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>There were consultations with NATO regarding their views in connection <Col N="1053" /> with the tenant purchased schemes and rents schemes generally.  As a result of those negotiations and having had the opportunity to have full consideration given to their views, the decision was then made in relation to the tenant purchase scheme and the new element in it in relation to market price.  I thank the Deputy for his remarks on that.  The decision was taken some time later to return to the local authorities the right to decide on the most appropriate rent scheme for their areas.</P>
      <P>I should make the point that in the general circular sent out to local authorities certain stipulations were laid down such as that rent must be income related and a smaller proportion of income would be deducted from low income households, that allowance should be made for dependant children and that special provisions be made for hardship cases. Of course, it is totally open to the organisation, and it would be appropriate for them, to have discussions with individual local authorities where their organisation is represented and where they have particular views to express.  More and more we hear at other times of the importance of giving to local authorities the greatest amount of discretion over their own spending and revenue collecting functions. The decision taken by Government in this respect was entirely consistent with that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the original intention of the 1973 decision was to remove the anomalies regarding one local rent being paid in one area for similar circumstances, similar type housing, similar family circumstances, income, etc?  Will he not accept that he is returning to this anomalous situation whereby in the town of Lucan, for example, one local authority rent will apply and people in similar circumstances in the town of Leixlip which is just up the road in another county will have a different rent to pay?  Surely it is in the national interest and fair play that there be a uniform rental policy which was the whole theory behind the decision.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>That applies in many aspects.  To say that there should be a national standardisation in relation to everything would seem to suggest that there is no need for individual local authorities and that all provisions would be operated on a national basis.  I am quite sure that that is not what the Deputy has in mind.  For example, he will be aware that the rate struck from one county to another varies and can vary quite considerably, so that ratepayers in what they would consider to be the same circumstances in two adjacent towns but in different local authority areas will be paying a different amount of rates.  The service charges being imposed by local authorities in pursuit of increasing their revenue also vary as between different local authorities.  Indeed, one of the consistent claims of local authorities is that they should be given more discretion to be able to decide on the appropriate level of local income commensurate with their demands and responsibilities.  That is what this decision is doing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister <Col N="1055" /> for the Environment (a) the estimated cost of sewerage and water schemes under way nationally; (b) the 1986 Estimate for these schemes; and (c) how he intends to make up the shortfall.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The total cost of the design and construction of the water and sewerage schemes under construction in 1986 is estimated to be about £407 million.  It is normal practice that many such schemes be designed and constructed over a period of years and the expenditure expected to arise in relation to them in 1986 is estimated to be about £85 million, of which £77 million will be met from the Public Capital Programme provision and the balance of about 10 per cent, in accordance with established practice, from temporary overdraft facilities.</P>
      <P>There is, therefore, no basis for the suggestion that the difference between the total cost of the schemes and the expenditure arising in 1986 represents a shortfall.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>It is temporary overdraft facility.  Is that going to be made up and will it not be made up by a Supplementary Estimate to the local authorities? For example, the local authority of which I have the honour of being chairman has a considerable shortfall in work that is under way &mdash; not in design and construction but in the actual work that is under way compared with the allocation they got from the Minister's Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the normal practice employed by local authorities in the operation of the sanitary services programme generally.  Local authorities have the facility to operate up to 10 per cent and that facility will, on the figures I have given, mean that the accommodation of the PCP provision and the local authority temporary overdraft facility will more than meet the expenditure this year.  A local authority then can, as is normal, at <Col N="1056" /> the beginning of the next financial year in January, draw down the amount equivalent to set off their overdraft balance at the end of this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister accept that the scheme he announced with such a fanfare of trumpets as being an injecttion of extra badly needed capital into the house building sector of the construction industry will in the first 12 months take money out of housing construction?  By <Col N="1057" /> abolishing the mortgage subsidy he will save approximately £3 million.  The removal of the traditional sector where the single house was built will represent a saving of about £2 million and the cost of a new scheme will be roughly £3.5 million.  The Minister will be saving approximately £1.5 million, taking approximately £1.5 million out of this hard pressed housing sector in this coming 12 months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that. Through a review of housing policy and identification of the need to stimulate activity in the legitimate new house building sector after detailed consultation with the Construction Industry Federation, we introduced this grant to encourage the purchase of new houses irrespective of size and of whether the purchaser had previously purchased a house.  We have eliminated the grant-aiding of houses built by black economy builders.  The Deputy's colleague, Deputy Fahey from Galway, congratulated me for taking that step not more than half an hour ago. As a result there are certain Exchequer savings, as there should be, because an intolerable situation was in operation over a number of years by successive Governments whereby houses being built by black economy labour were being grant-aided by money provided by the Irish taxpayer.  The change we have now made prevents that and instead that money will be funnelled into the grant aiding of houses built by builders in the white economy.  It is regrettable that it took so long to bring this about.  It was done on foot of a decision announced in the budget this year and it has met with the approval of the Construction Industry Federation.  Like so many of the things I have announced over recent months, it has met with the approval of virtually everybody who cared to comment on it with the exception of the spokesman for the Opposition.</P>

Is the Minister actually saving money this year by taking money out of the housing <Col N="1058" /> sector which otherwise would have been there?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I am diverting money which was being spent in the black economy sector of the construction industry and introducing a new grant which is confined to houses built by registered contractors. As I pointed out in my initial reply, it is estimated that over the next three or four years the cost of the new scheme, which is much more directly related to genuine employment, will be approximately the same as the cost of operating the other schemes.</P>

That represents an average value per approval of £2,000.  Allowing for payments made up to the end of September, which are £14 million approximately, the value of the outstanding approvals is £146 million.

    <Speaker pid="LiamSkelly" hpid="Mr. Skelly Mr. Skelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill.  It is a first step towards a radical overhaul of building societies.  One wonders why it took so long to get here.  Perhaps it was because neither the motive nor the person was there.  Past Ministers had not the will to do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not wish to delay the House because I would like to see it go through and I think the vast majority of borrowers from building societies would also like to see it go through.  I will, therefore, not go over the points mentioned by the various speakers or by the Minister.  Much of this can be left to Committee Stage.  I would add to some of the points made by Deputy De Rossa, many of which I agree with.  The building societies, since their foundation, have operated with increasing arrogance.  They were an elitist group who looked after themselves first and made loans available, under very restrictive circumstances, to members of the public who could meet the criteria laid down by them.  There was a certain amount of what I would term corruption in the operation of building societies. Large depositors got preferential treatment. During the building booms the builders had tremendous influence over the building societies.  They could direct house purchasers to certain societies knowing that they would receive preferential treatment there.  In that way the societies contributed to gerrybuilding in the city, to bad planning and to badly built estates.  During the sixties and seventies a person did not have much choice in selecting a house.  In order to have a prospect of a loan purchasers had to go to estates where the builder had influence with a society and could almost guarantee a loan.  Those people bought substandard houses and in the end we set up the national house building guarantee scheme to help borrowers.  The societies also contributed to that sort of thing in the double solicitors' fees which drove people mad.  It was intolerable to have to pay the building society's solicitor as well as one's own.  The society's solicitor often acted on behalf of the society and on behalf of the borrower.  If one was a friend to member of the legal profession <Col N="1106" /> one could get a loan by going to a certain solicitor.  It is well known in Dublin that if one went to a certain solicitor acting for a building society one would get one's loan.  As Deputy De Rosa pointed out these people feathered their own nests. When I say this I am talking from experience. For years the building societies got away with this.</P>
    <P>The building societies also had a very good link-up with so called property correspondents in the national newspapers, who would write glowing reports of the different housing estates and developments, without ever having seen the developments.  They did not mind taking a reward in the form of cash or kind for these glowing reports.  The sufferer in all of this was the struggling homebuyer investing his life savings in the biggest investment he would ever make.  We all sat back while the establishment in the form of the building societies, the legal profession, the insurance companies and the engineers ripped off the public and squeezed the borrower for every penny they could get.  Like other private and state agencies, through the power of money and PR they have been able to make glowing reports on their actions over the past two decades, as to how much they have contributed to our housing industry.  They did not contribute for nothing.  At every turn they squeezed money out of the people.  Looking back through time one wonders how we sat back and allowed them away with it.  That is one of the reasons I welcome this Bill.</P>
    <P>Building societies have often flouted the Minister for the day in either not meeting him or embarrassing him by increasing their rates whenever they felt like it, and in operating a cartel.  The ordinary people have been victims of this carry on.  If I was a director of one of these societies I would not be proud of the way they have operated and I would not like to be able to say I was a close friend of one of the people who have stood on the ordinary people over the last decades.  This Bill gives a measure of protection to the public.</P>
    <P>The building societies also operated in a very selective manner in giving loans. <Col N="1107" /> They laid down criteria which ordinary people could not meet.  Before being considered one had to have a deposit with them, of varying amounts, for a year or two.  People had to rely on the banks to get bridging loans.  In effect, the building societies operated a filter system: a person must have a job of a certain status, he must be a certain type of person, he must dress in a certain way and come from a certain district.  He would have to meet a whole string of criteria and then it would be who one knew and who might recommend one for a loan, and it would be an advantage if one had a friend who was a solicitor.  We had this argument during the debate on the Criminal Justice Act when we tried to identify those people who would even know a member of the lay profession.</P>
    <P>Things have changed in the past few years and the property market has gone down but in the good times the societies behaved at their worst and they did not help the ordinary person struggling to get a mortgage.  I wonder what kind of criteria the societies will operate when they get into the area of bridging finance. The Minister in his speech urged the societies to behave in a certain manner and they said they would rather have a full discussion on all the things they were interested in before they would do what the Minister wanted.  That is the way they have operated up to now and they have got away with it.  The Government have now intimated that they are answerable to the people and are introducing legislation to suit the people and which will enable the building societies to operate in a business manner.  The building societies were using a polite way of telling the Minister to get lost.  It was obvious that Ministers would have to get tougher and face this arrogance head on, as the Minister has done in this Bill, in the steps he has taken in relation to tiered interest rates, redemption fees and so on.  Will the cost of removing the building society's solicitor be passed on to the borrower, and will they try in their arrogance to drive a coach and four through this simple legislation which has a lot of spirit?  This <Col N="1108" /> is not arbitrary legislation.  Rather, it is a nudging piece of legislation inviting the societies to act in a certain manner in the best interests of the people.  This Bill is long overdue.  I hope the response of the societies is generous, that they will see the error of their past ways and will try to operate in a manner which will benefit the community.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on this long overdue legislation and I give three cheers for this small step along the way to social justice.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make two points in regard to the Bill and to substantiate them.  The first point is that we need a new financial services Bill covering the whole range of financial institutions, including building societies.  The second point is that unless the national economic situation is taken in hand very shortly the availability of funds, not just for building societies but for all institutions, will be so short as to possibly create a mortgage famine during the next six months.  I will substantiate that statement later on.</P>
      <P>The Bill is seen in too narrow a context, it must be seen in a broader context of a background of major changes in the financial marketplace and in financial services generally.  We only have to look at what went on in London with the so called &ldquo;Big Bang&rdquo; on Monday to see the radical changes which have taken place in financial institutions and in the financial marketplace generally.  If people are still not convinced that revolutionary changes are taking place in the financial world, they only have to consider that the EC in 1990 will be attempting to introduce an open free marketplace for financial services throughout the Community.  If you put what is happening in London side by side with events in Brussels it is quite clear that within the next couple of years we will be faced with substantial, revolutionary changes in the whole financial services industry.  That is why I called for the publication of a financial services Bill covering the whole range of financial services generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1109" /> There are three aspects to all these changes.  First, deregulation, the breaking down of differences between building societies and banks, banks and insurance companies and insurance companies and stockbroking houses.  Such deregulation has taken place massively in London in recent days and is a feature of a modern financial services industry throughout the world today.  Secondly, there is increased competition for deposits between the various institutions which is getting extraordinarily keen and has good and bad effects.  There is also very rapid innovation, the application of new technology to the financial services area and the development of new financial products offered to the public under all sorts of guises.  They are the dramatic and revolutionary changes which have taken place and they are all relevant to the legislation before the House today.  The Bill should be looked at in the context of the dramatic changes taking place in the financial services industry both in the UK and here.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that the consumers will gain from the current revolution in that they will probably get cheaper, more efficient and more flexible services because competition between the institutions will make them sharper which will, I hope, enable them to pass on more benefits to the consumer.  I do not have any great worries about the deregulation of financial institutions generally or building societies particularly but, having said that, the country must make sure that it gains &mdash; apart from the individual investor &mdash; through increased employment and earnings in foreign exchange.  All this requires a sense of direction and a strategic view of the role of building societies. My main criticism of the Bill is that it does not have a sense of direction or a strategic view of where building societies fit in.  A hint of what is possible was given by the Minister for Industry and Commerce recently in his announcement about Shannon Airport and the possibility of attracting offshore institutions to that area.  In making the announcement, which I applaud, the Minister gave us a hint of what is possible.  However, the <Col N="1110" /> broader view of the financial world is missing from this Bill and the vision attached to trying to open up international banking in Ireland does not come through.</P>
    <P>I welcome a number of aspects of the Bill, abolishing restrictive practices, redemption fees, the requirement to use a particular insurance company and particular solicitors.  These reforms are useful and one should not quibble unduly about them but they are marginal, minor changes.  As long as we do not pretend the Bill is a major reform of financial institutions or the building society movement, then some of the measures are welcome although I retain the right to quibble about some details and to seek to amend certain sections.  The attempt to abolish restrictive practices is welcome and that aspect of the Bill is consistent with the notion of deregulating financial institutions.  It is an attempt to level the playing pitch between institutions and is consistent with the philosophy of what is going on in the financial world, the advent of more open and even competition for deposits between various financial institutions such as building societies, banks and so on.  I have no problem in welcoming those aspects of the Bill, provided it is recognised that it deals with minor items.  It does not do anything about interest rates or reforming the financial sector generally.  It does not do anything about clearing up the difficulties between building societies and banks.  They are small detailed changes which are welcome but they do not tackle the root problem of charting a strategic course for the financial services industry.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the decision to allow new loans to be made by the building societies, although I suggest that the Minister should put a limit on this.  Section 3 does not mention the amount of the total funds they can spend on new loans; it just says they may give non-mortgage loans. Perhaps it would be more sensible to allow them to do this up to 10 per cent or 20 per cent of their total funding and put a certain limit on the amount of non-mortgage activity in which they can participate. That suggestion might be worth <Col N="1111" /> looking at in a positive sense because it is important that the building societies &mdash; whatever other areas they eventually end up in, banking, stockbroking or whatever &mdash; should retain the provision of housing finance as their main business.  That is still a major and important requirement.</P>
    <P>Over the last five years the share of mortgages financed by building societies has fallen from 68 per cent to 62 per cent of total mortgages.  Their share of new savings has also fallen significantly as a percentage of the total.  For example, the Bank of Ireland have recently taken over the Irish Civil Service Building Society and now provide certain banking services. The building society movement is decreasingly the provider of funds for house building.  I called for a financial services Bill instead of this marginal one because a major question is involved. Banks are moving into the territory of building societies, for example, the Bank of Ireland bought the ICS and the ICS provide cash cards and are proceeding in the direction of opening banking services. Does it mean that if building societies become banks our banks will become building societies?  Will they all be in the business of insurance and competing for deposits?  Will the legislators be asked to act as referees while all that goes on?</P>
    <P>The Government of the UK recently published a financial services Bill in which they tried to tackle the fundamental question as to who will do what in the financial world.  The building societies in the UK are issuing cheque books, doing foreign exchanges and selling stocks and shares. If all that is happening in Britain I can see it beginning to occur here, given the close financial relationship between the two nations.  It poses the fundamental question that is not referred to in the Bill, the relationship between building societies, banks and so on.  The key question is, if banks are starting to gobble up building societies can they really object if the opposite starts to occur?  Can we then say that they must fix interest rates in line with Government directives?  That might be grand in theory but in practice, with the international money market as <Col N="1112" /> it is, it would be difficult to see how any Government could do something like that.</P>
    <P>Within a few years we will see British and EC building societies operating here. That again is not mentioned in the Bill. Foreign building societies will have to be allowed to operate here under EC regulations.  If they start here in a serious way can we still attempt to regulate building societies in a real sense, given the intense competition?</P>
    <P>These issues raise two questions: do the provisions in the Bill go far enough to permit the Irish societies to meet the challenges they will have to face or will they crumble under international competition; two, will there be enough supervisory controls there to protect the consumer from the winds of international money markets?</P>
    <P>My conclusion is that the Bill is only a marginal one which does not address those fundamental issues &mdash; it only fiddles around the periphery of the building society movement.  What we need is a financial services Act into which new banking institutions, building societies, the whole investment banking industry and stockbroking will be tied up by comprehensive legislation so that we can chart a course for all those institutions and bring them together in some form of industry.  I estimate there are between 8,000 and 10,000 jobs possible in a financial services industry in Dublin alone provided we tidy up our act and pull the financial institutions together, so that instead of working against each other as at present we can get them to work for the nation and attract foreign financial institutions to establish bases here on our terms, obeying the regulations of the Irish Government.</P>
    <P>In that way we can build in Dublin and the country generally a financial services sector which will provide employment. Why is it that Singapore, the Isle of Man and Switzerland have had and are rapidly developing major financial centres whereas we are languishing as an outpost to which capital would not dream of coming from other countries.  Indeed some of our cash-flow, instead of coming <Col N="1113" /> has been leaving the country in recent months.  It would be far more intelligent if we developed a proper financial services industry so that we would be attracting money to the country instead of having it running out to areas that have attempted to build a financial industry.</P>
    <P>The Bill is a major disappointment in that respect.  There is a suggestion abroad that the Bill is doing something fundamental to tackle the financial services area, whereas it tackles only minor elements like solicitors fees and redemption fees.</P>
    <P>I wonder about the supervisory powers of financial institutions generally.  Should we start to tidy that up?  For example, the building societies come under a number of different regulatory authorities.  A building society in Ireland has to answer to the Department of the Environment, the Department of Industry and Commerce, the Central Bank, the Registrar of Friendly Societies and the Minister for Finance.  There should be a streamlined way in which that could be handled.  If we are to develop a proper financial industry here we must sort out that mess.  It would be far more sensible to have one agency dealing with financial institutions instead of five.</P>
    <P>The Honohan report, or some newspaper reports of what is supposed to be in it, refers to this and states that it is difficult and should be sorted out.  Unfortunately, none of these issues is addressed in the Bill.  Therefore, the Bill is a major disappointment.  I have called for a financial services Bill to tackle all of those areas.</P>
    <P>Such a Bill would give us an opportunity to benefit by the London deregulation known as the Big Bang.  There are many opportunities there for Ireland.  For instance, we could develop here as a base for international software, servicing the building of the financial centre in London which is becoming the third major financial centre after Tokyo and New York. We are close to London physically and financially and our Stock Exchange is connected with it.  We should try to find out how we could move in association with recent developments in London.  I <Col N="1114" /> ask the Government to establish a special group to see how we can benefit from these opportunities in the financial services industry, one of the major growth industries.  We should stop putting up <i>cul-de-sac</i> signs like the DIRT, the resident requirement for building societies and the resident property and wealth taxes.  If you add these up they bring less money to the country than they drive out of it.  Though they seem to fill some ideological niche, as national economic measures they are simply suicide because they say to international capitalists that they are not welcome here.  International capital does not have to come here, it does not owe us a living, and it will not come if the wrong signs are up.</P>
    <P>If the right signs are up indicating that we do not fiddle around with some of that ideological stuff, that we are interested in building a financially secure stable economy, that kind of money will come and we will be in a much better position to provide the kind of equality and equity we need.  At present, in striving for some type of equality we are scaring away so much investment that we will all be equally poor and sorry to live here.</P>
    <P>As a result of what Irish Nationwide have done in breaking ranks, the building societies will now be more dependent on the inter-bank market in setting their interest rates whereas until now they were not dependent on the open market in the same way.  In regard to unit linked funds, gilts, and shares the competition for scarce deposits will become intense and in theory that should mean lower interest rates.  In reality, if the institutions have to chase all the deposits they will be putting up their deposit rates to try to attract funds.  That will be passed on to the household borrower as happened with the Irish Nationwide today.  I am convinced there will be a mortgage famine in this country in the next six months.  Without being alarmist in any way as that only makes the situation worse I want to say as calmly as I can that I am convinced that by January or February next there will be a substantial mortgage famine in this country.  I will be very surprised if there is little or any <Col N="1115" /> mortgage finance available.  What has happened is that £1.5 billion has been chased out of the country by regressive legislation and unimaginative approaches to the financial marketplace by Government sources.  That amount of money leaving the country means there is little or no money left at home to borrow. What are the financial institutions going to start doing at the end of this year if the outflow continues?  They are going to start chasing the money at home.  The only way they can get a bigger slice of deposits is by putting up their deposit interest rates.  If they keep putting up their deposit interest rates they will have to pass on higher interest rates to the householder or investor.  That is inevitable.</P>
    <P>It is all very well to scream at building societies and accuse them of opening up offices all over the country, having lavish furnishing and too much advertising on RTE but it is marginal.  It is at the very fringe of the fundamental argument about financial services.  The real problem is that we have lost £1.5 billion and that loss is continuing.  If money continues to flow out, the only way Irish financial institutions can get money in is to compete for the money that is left in the country.  How are they going to compete for it?  By putting up their interest rates.  What are they then going to do?  They are going to pass it on to the person who takes out a loan.  The only solution is to stop that money leaving the country and the only way to do that is to take some imaginative steps.  First, get rid of DIRT.  Second, liberalise exchange control regulations.  Third, develop a financial services industry by publishing a financial services Bill.  We have got to show people that we want to keep that £1.5 billion here and that we are not scaring it off.</P>
    <P>In reply to a question on the residential property tax, I was told that it cost £4 million to take in £3 million.  DIRT might bring in £75 million.  How much of the £1.5 billion was that responsible for scaring off?  I dare say a lot more than £75 million.  Let us look at the national <Col N="1116" /> interest and not at some sectional interest where those with houses valued at over £65,000 pay an extra 1 per cent and let us sell the message to international capital and our own capital that it is welcome here.  If that money stays here there will not be intense competition for deposits and if there is no intense competition for deposits, interest rates will come down. If interest rates come down, building societies will not be putting them up by 3 per cent as happened today.</P>
    <P>The response to the crisis on interest rates does not lie in this Bill.  It lies in a more sensible understanding of what goes on in the financial marketplaces.  We will have a mortgage famine in this country in the next six months if we do not get action in the financial services area and the only solution is to produce in this House a financial services Bill.</P>

      <P>Deputy Brennan made some valid points but some were more relevant to the Minister for Finance.  I congratulate the Minister on bringing forward this Bill.  The first lines of his speech made it clear this is only the first of a number of Bills that will be introduced to deal with the problems facing building societies.  We have to accept the role building societies have played.  Over the last ten years they have provided the finance for 150,000 new houses and that has to be acknowledged.  The reason the Minister introduced this Bill was to eliminate some of the practices which have faced house purchasers down through the years, practices which no Government had the strength or will to tackle.  They are set out in the Bill.  The legislation being presented today is relevant to the needs of those who are buying houses and the nature of the Bill makes it relevant to the everyday lives of people because it affects them in a real way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The role of building societies has changed from being a social one to one where as a cartel they are one of the major financial institutions in the country. I would like to refer to the 3 per cent increase in mortgage rates.  The Minister must take more positive action.  Too often in the past we have seen bank <Col N="1117" /> interest rates dropping and the building societies dilly-dallying about reducing their rates.  The haste in which one particular society has increased their rates by 3 per cent is indecent.  This will put an enormous burden on many young people. Deputy Brennan raised some legitimate points which need to be tackled in the months ahead but that is for another Minister on another day.</P>
    <P>The measures set out in the Bill with regard to restrictive practices are welcome. I wondered whether we had any Minister or Government with the courage to tackle what I term the all-powerful mafia of the building society cartel.  I would go further and say that the treatment the media and public representatives receive when they question the work practices of the building societies and their legal representatives is disgraceful. Because of the way they have treated the public who have suffered as a result of the economic depression, I would put the building societies on a par with Shylock of the past.</P>
    <P>I welcome the measures set out in the Bill to eliminate the over-representation of solicitors whereby there is one solicitor for the purchaser, one for the vendor and one for the building society.  Over-representation arose because of a cosy arrangement between the Incorporated Law Society and the building societies. One building society who attempted to eliminate this practice some years ago faced heavy pressure from the legal profession. As a result this practice continues up to today.  I welcome the proposal to eliminate it and I hope the Minister will ensure there will not be any way round the measure he is introducing.</P>
    <P>I welcome the proposal to eliminate restrictive practices in relation to insurance.  Building societies, through their massive financial resources, have attempted to gag the media and public representatives when this practice was questioned.  Some months ago I questioned it and referred to the £1.3 million cream-off by the Irish Building Society for commission on insurance and set out my reasons why that practice should be eliminated by the Minister.  I submitted a <Col N="1118" /> second statement to the press but, because of a threat of a legal writ from a building society through a solicitor who happened to be a brother of the manager &mdash; that is the type of tie up we have to face &mdash; not only was the newspaper silenced but I was silenced.  I have letters to prove that.  The building societies have the resources to silence their critics and they have done it in the past and will try it again.  I welcome the courage of the Minister to take on building societies.</P>
    <P>I applaud the proposal in relation to surveyor's fees.  Those fees were a heavy imposition on house purchasers who did not have any freedom to decide who should survey the house.  Building societies imposed their will and the purchaser, who was paying the piper, never saw the report.  That was an unfair and illegal practice but, thankfully the Minister is attacking it.</P>
    <P>The Minister in the course of his speech told us that this was the first of a number of measures in relation to building societies. I hope he will investigate the other practices by building societies which were referred to in the Honohan report.  I understand that the amount for management expenses this year will be £40 million, a figure that is totally out of line with expenses in Britain.  The Minister for Finance should carry out an in depth investigation into the way building societies operate expenses.  A sum of £40 million is outrageous and borrowers or investors do not have any way of questioning it except at what I would call rigged AGMs.  When such matters are questioned real answers are never forthcoming.</P>
    <P>The procedure for the election of board members should be investigated.  The Honohan report points out that no person other than a board nominee has ever been elected to the board of a building society here because board members hold all the proxy votes.  That unhealthy practice which is open to abuse, and has been abused, must be looked at.  It should be covered by the Minister in his next piece of legislation.</P>
    <P>I share the concern expressed by Deputy Brennan in relation to the pressure <Col N="1119" /> on our financial institutions in regard to interest rates and I hope the Minister for Finance will take corrective action in this area.  I view the Bill before us as the first step in the elimination of many of the restrictive practices building societies operate here.  I hope the Minister, in conjunction with the Minister for Finance, will look at the restrictive practices operated by the legal profession in regard to house conveyancing and that the performance of the boards of directors and managements of our building societies are scrutinised in more detail.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to an old hobbyhorse of mine in the course of his speech, bridging finance.  I estimate that bridging finance adds 10 per cent to the price of a house.  Surely with a Law Reform Commission and a Minister responsible for this area we can update our property laws and eliminate some of the unnecessary practices in house purchases. An additional 10 per cent is a lot of money for house purchasers to have to pay.  If there is the political will that could be eliminated.  In giving building societies the power to provide bridging finance the Minister has a responsibility to set about eliminating a need for that finance.  He has the power as far as local authorities are concerned.  He can give power, by way of regulation, to local authorities to accept letters of undertaking from properly indemnified solicitors. Such a move would eliminate a lot of time and money in such transactions.</P>
    <P>There is an onus on us all to set about changing our property laws to make the whole area of house purchase simpler thereby saving house purchasers a lot of money.  We represent the ordinary person in the street, the person who is struggling to get money together to buy a house but such people are being ripped off left, right and centre by building societies, the legal profession and every professional body involved in house purchase and house construction.  Such people are easy prey, easy victims.  As politicians we have a responsibility to <Col N="1120" /> eliminate those practices.  Today the Minister took the first small step along a long road.  I welcome the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Brennan who said that the problems of the building societies are not dealt with in the Bill.  In my view the Bill was born out of anger and frustration arising out of a disagreement between the Minister and one building society in particular. Deputy Allen appears to know more than the rest of us because he told us that this is the first of a number of pieces of legislation that will be introduced.  The Minister should have dealt with all the problems concerning building societies in one Bill.</P>
      <P>I agree with some of the provisions of the Bill and, like Deputy Allen, I have been suggesting them for a long time. However, its provisions will result in borrowers having to bear more costs.  I welcome the provision in section 6 (e) in regard to societies arranging insurance through an insurer nominated by it.  I wonder why the Minister is preventing building societies doing this when he, and his Department, operate such a system under the Small Dwellings Act.  Mortgage protection policies for loans under that Act must be put through a broker in Dublin.  What is good for the goose is good for the gander, what the Minister is abolishing in regard to building societies should be abolished in relation to the SDA loans.  We discussed that matter at a recent meeting of the housing committee of Mayo County Council and many members expressed grave reservations about this new trend.</P>
      <P>I will be one of those who will be caught by the decision of the Minister to abolish the tiered system if the abolition results in a rise in interest rates.  Can the Minister guarantee that rates will reduce rather than lower rates being increased?  If so we welcome the move but many borrowers will be caught by the abolition of the tiered system.  It is unfair that the provision is to apply to one society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Legal costs have been referred to.  I do not see any reason for there being two or three different solicitors involved.  That <Col N="1121" /> change is welcome.  Perhaps for present borrowers the change has come a little late but I welcome it on behalf of future borrowers.  The Minister will have to take steps to ensure that costs are not passed on in a hidden way to borrowers.  The Minister might confirm if this is the first of a series of Bills.  Some of us do not believe it goes far enough and see it only as a response to a set of circumstances.</P>
    <P>As regards the surveyor's report I have had considerable experience in this area. The surveyor's report was for the building society and was strictly private.  It was an indication of what the actual value of the house was but it was not an indication of the worthiness of the house.  If, as appears likely should this legislation go through, the report is made public to the borrower the surveyor will have to be extremely careful about what he puts into the report.  In many cases the surveyor will err on the side of the report being of such a nature that the society will not advance money on the property.</P>
    <P>I welcome certain aspects of this Bill. I agree with Deputy Brennan that it is only the tip of the iceberg.  I would be glad to see the Minister bring in legislation which would put building societies into direct competition with the banks and which would give them the same advantages as banks enjoy.  Since the cartel appears to be broken up now there will be greater demands for money.  Competition will be intense and as a result the person at the bottom of the pile, the borrower, will have to pay the piper. One can understand the frustration of borrowers.  As a result of the competition for money between the societies they will not know how much their repayments will be in any one month.  One can understand the annoyance and anxiety that many families will experience in the coming months.</P>
    <P>The 3 per cent increase announced by one building society is a phenomenal increase for those paying 9½ or 10 per cent.  They will have to pay one third more than they paid before.  Many families will be unable to meet the increased repayments.  Constituents will try to get their loans restructured or try to get the <Col N="1122" /> local authorities to take over the loans.</P>
    <P>The Bill is a short one.  Some aspects of it are welcome but others need to be looked at again.  Deputy Allen dealt with the question of bridging finance which can cause tremendous problems for borrowers. If the number of staff in the Land Registry office was increased the various transfers could be dealt with quickly. Anything that could be done in this area would be welcome.  Deputy Allen suggested that the Minister might be able to make an order in relation to local authorities.  That would be far more beneficial than certain proposals in the Bill.</P>
    <P>There are proposals in the Bill which we all welcome but there are others which might prove hazardous for the borrower. We must always think about the borrower. Some of the remedies the Minister suggests will not ease the burden on the borrower but will add greatly to his problems.</P>
    <Speaker pid="VincentBrady" hpid="Mr. V. Brady Mr. V. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>It is most unfortunate that this legislation has been created out of ongoing battles and disagreements between the Minister and the building societies.  While we all agree that legislation is necessary to update their operations it is most unfortunate that we find ourselves in a position of non co-operation with the building societies which form an important part of our financial institutions.  The Bill coincides with the announcement by one of the leading building societies of a considerable increase in their rates.  As of now one cannot be too sure what the final increases will be.  We are still awaiting further announcements, I understand, from the other societies.  According to speculation it is expected that they will at least match the additional 3 per cent that has been announced by the Irish Nationwide Building Society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The implications of these increases will be very serious for tens of thousands of householders.  They will add to the average mortgage of £25,000 to £30,000 an average of about £60 per month.  This must be a shattering prospect for the already hard-pressed families who have been making all sorts of sacrifices during <Col N="1123" /> the past number of years.  These have made every effort to provide their own homes in order to bring up their families in decent surroundings.  They have not been a burden to any extent on the local authorities.  Certainly, they need and should be given encouragement rather than being hit for six time after time, which is most unfortunate.</P>
    <P>The Minister has been very harshly critical of the building societies for taking this action and whilst I do not for one moment wish to condone such a massive increase, which we all regret very much, nevertheless one must look at the background to the problem and the reasons for such major increases.  The Minister must take a major responsibility in this matter, as the total mismanagement by the Government of the country's finances has resulted in the virtual collapse of confidence on the part of the investor in the financial market.  This has driven general interest rates to record levels against inflation.  Indeed, the interest rates of our commercial banks are at least double the bank rates of other European countries.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that the Minister should have seen fit to pick out the building societies as his target.  It was never admitted by the building societies that there was a cartel arrangement, but very few people believed that.  The Minister must take some responsibility for the break-up of the mutual agreement that existed up to now between societies on their rates to investors and to mortgage holders.  It is obvious that the societies see themselves under major attack from the Minister and have decided, for their own reasons, to take their own actions in order to compete in what is already a very competitive financial market.</P>
    <P>The Minister did not exactly distinguish himself on radio this morning in what I can only describe as a dog-like fight between himself and the chief executive of one of the leading societies. That is no way for a Minister or a Government to behave.  Certainly, it is not the correct way to go about seeking a satisfactory mutual agreement which, in the better interests of the mortgage holder as <Col N="1124" /> well as being reasonably beneficial to the society, could have been arrived at.  The fact that the commercial banks are moving into building society business has not helped, either.  There is the major threat of an incursion into this country by foreign building societies, which will cause only further chaos in a market that is already undergoing serious difficulties.</P>
    <P>It was most reprehensible of the Minister on radio this morning to accuse a particular executive of mismanagement in his company.  That sort of carry-on is most irresponsible &mdash; unethical, indeed. It is part of the major bluff being carried on by the Minister in an effort to hide the real causes of the problems which the country faces today.  That is very evident in the financial structures and as far as lack of investment is concerned.  It is very obvious where the real problems lie.  The simple answer is that there is just no confidence in the economy any longer. People with money to invest are not prepared to take risks.  It is most unusual for people involved at high level in major financial institutions to come out so openly as they have done in the past week or two to say that until a general election takes place the shortage of investment will continue, as investors no longer have any confidence in the Government's ability to rectify the problems which are wreaking havoc in our economy at this time.</P>
    <P>The Minister's attitude to the building societies will not help the hard pressed houseowners and mortgage holders who today must be reeling with shock at the extent of the new interest rates on mortgages and literally desperately thinking how to continue keeping a roof over their heads.  This must be a major headache and worry for very many people today.</P>
    <P>Much more major legislation with regard to the role of building societies is required.  It is about time that the Government introduced legislation covering the possibility of giving societies the right to enter into normal commercial banking.  The societies since their formation have played a major role in helping people to provide their own homes and up to approximately 80 per cent of <Col N="1125" /> all mortgages have been obtained through the societies.  Those societies also have the very serious obligation to the public and the economy and should never forget their original objective when the societies were first set up.  I am afraid that many of them are inclined to do so and I shudder to think how the massive costs of the advertising that a number of societies have undertaken in recent years, some quite unnecessarily, will affect the mortgage holder.  There seems to be a competitive campaign &mdash; I would call it more than normal competition &mdash; of societies vying with each other in the advertising media.  They must be spending hundreds of thousands of pounds overall on their advertising, promotions and sponsorships. I do not feel happly with many of such sponsorships and have expressed that point of view on a number of previous occasions.</P>
    <P>The societies also must operate in the best interests of the depositors.  The larger percentage of these have their investments with building societies for some reason.  Society business has decelerated since the introduction of the DIRT tax, which has driven out of the country almost £1,700 million of savings, since its introduction last January.  The building societies cannot be isolated from the movements in the money market and one must be particularly concerned at the threats that mortgage rates in the future perhaps will be based on the performance of rates on the Dublin inter-bank market. Inter-bank rates have always been much higher than mortgage rates and if the difference were to close to any considerable extent &mdash; even in a small way, that would be a more serious blow to mortgage holders in the future.  The overall management of the economy by the Government is, of course, the vital cog as far as the financial institutions are concerned. It is indeed very obvious that any Government who run a current budget deficit of £1,500 million &mdash; which is the highest in money and percentage terms in the history of this State &mdash; must have a very serious and dramatic effect on the funding of that Government and of money markets.  This, in turn, has a disastrous <Col N="1126" /> effect on the small investor and as far as the building societies are concerned it also has a disastrous effect on the mortgage holder.</P>
    <P>The managing director of one of our major societies recently said that the imposition of DIRT will, on its own, bring a ½ per cent increase in mortgage rates.  It is ludicrous and dishonest for the Minister to say that such an increase would not be acceptable to the Government when in reality it was he and his Government who had been the major contributors to the difficulties in the money market, with consequential effects on the building societies and that sector in general.  The Minister's criticism of the financial institutions is very much in contrast with the attitude of his colleague, the Minister for Finance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank you, a Cheann Comhairle for giving me the opportunity to raise this matter on the Adjournment of the House.  I thank the Minister of State for coming in to let us know what he can do to remedy the situation which is very serious.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This school is situated on the main road from Cootehill to Cavan.  It was originally the school for the parish of Drung.  The old school was sold some time ago and a large prefabricated building replaced it. Needless to say, when the prefabricated building was new it was quite presentable and looked well but the effective life of most prefabricated houses is about ten years or 12 years at the maximum.  This building has been in existence for almost 20 years and it certainly shows the signs of it.  Very often the Minister has to listen to exaggerated stories in this House but I visited this school last week and the people were not exaggerating.  The condition of the school is appalling particularly now that we are facing the winter. The roof is leaking, the teachers have to run around with buckets to catch the rain <Col N="1127" /> coming through and the rat holes are quite terrifying.  I do not like rats.  I can tolerate mice but rats are sinister and dangerous.  The teachers indicated that rat droppings are visible all over the school each morning.  They have to take home whatever teaching aids and equipment they have.</P>
    <P>There is a strong parents association there and they are really frightened about the possibility of disease. With so many small children of four and a half and five years of age this adds to the horror.  The mothers are terrified.  The parents committee discussed the possibility that the Department would give them, pending the start of building, a grant to employ a company who deal with rat infestation. This would at least take the terror out of the area for a while.  I am not exaggerating. These are the circumstances we found.  The people are frustrated and are pressuring the board of management. The pastor, the Reverend Turlough O'Reilly, is a particularly caring man but the pressure the people are exerting on him is making him very upset.</P>
    <P>The people applied for a new school, bought a site and collected the money. There was no humming or hawing and no neglect.  They decided that a new school should be built and went about it in the right way.  The first shock they got was when the local authority refused them planning permission.  They did not expect that this would happen.  The Department of Education advised them to appeal to An Bord Pleanála and they did this.  As the House knows this takes some time. The result was that the appeal was turned down and they were then back where they started.  But the people were not put off by that.  They then started to look for another site and succeeded in getting one. They had the money collected, they had a site and they also had a declaration from the health authority that the building was unfit for human habitation.  If the same conditions as I saw last week applied in a factory, the factory Acts would apply and a factory owner would be forbidden to conduct business in such conditions.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1128" /> I put down a question some time ago and was told that a quantity surveyor was to visit the site last February.  He did not visit the site until July 1986.  Admittedly, it was not a great summer but had the building started it would be well advanced by now.  In the meantime, and these are the parents' words, the school became infested and the rodents ate anything that was left in the school overnight necessitating teachers to carry equipment to and from the school.  If clothes or any other items are left in the school overnight they are eaten by rats.  The teachers are busy keeping the rat holes covered.</P>
    <P>The parents spoke to me about the possibility of a strike.  Both during my time as Minister for Education and at any other time I have tried always to dissuade people from striking on the principle, as I said at the meeting, that whereas productivity can be made up for in a factory or a manufacturing business, in a school, and especially one where education is so necessary and is very often the only vehicle for social mobility, the time lost can never be replaced.  Mention of a strike shows how desperate the parents are.  They are terrified for the health of their children.  They continue to emphasise that hitherto they have tried all peaceful methods.  It would be a pity if the peaceful, persistent and efficient activity on the part of parents would appear to bring less success than demonstration and confrontation might bring.  That is part of my basic philosophy. They tell me they have informed the Department they intend to keep their children at home from school three days per week starting on 12 November until the tenders for the school are out and sanctioned.</P>
    <P>They were offered further prefabricated accommodation and they tell me that they have turned the offer down. I believe that in doing so they were right. I am not blaming the Minister for this, but the tendency is to let maith go leor be maith go leor if there is some temporary relief in the nature of prefabricated accommodation.  They had been so busy <Col N="1129" /> collecting for the school and other parochial purposes before that &mdash; I remember urging them to build a school a long time ago &mdash; and they feel that taking £10,000 out of the fund they have already for a permanent and proper school and putting it into prefabricated accommodation would be wrong.  I think the Minister and the House would agree with them on that.</P>
    <P>As I have said, it is easy to develop fears, legitimate and valid fears, but the psychology of the thing is important also. It is easy to develop an idea that somehow or other through being passive and through arguing their case in a peaceful and pacific way others who shout louder, make more noise or indulge in more violent antics, will get in ahead of them. That was one of the points raised at the meeting.  They were afraid they might lose their place on the list.</P>
    <P>I have here a copy of the letter which the secretary of the parents' association sent to the Department of Education which I quote: &ldquo;We the parents wish to inform the Depertment of Education that we intend to withdraw our children from St. Mary's national school, Drung, for three days per week unless the quantity surveyor's report is completed by Tuesday 4 November and tenders are out by Tuesday, 11 November.&rdquo;  No doubt the Minister will tell me and the House the time scale, but my appeal is to the Minister. He is of the profession and I know he is an understanding person who would insist on the highest professional behaviour from the staff and the highest possible standard of school building.  I am relying on him, that by his action he will see to it that the parents will get assurances that will be delivered on and that further drastic action will not be required from them.</P>
    <P>I reiterate my gratitude to you, a Cheann Comhairle, for giving me an opportunity of raising this in the House. Tá súil agam go mbheidh dea-scéal againn ón Aire.  Mar a dúirt mé cheana féin, is iar-mhúinteoir é agus tá a fhios aige chomh dian is atá sé ar na malraigh <Col N="1130" /> agus ar na múinteoirí bheith ag obair i scoil den tsórt sin.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Kenny) Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Kenny)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Kenny)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to be able to reply to Deputy Wilson who has raised this matter on the Adjournment. You, a Cheann Comhairle, have expressed an interest to me about Drung school.  I think I should set out some of the background for the record of the House.</P>
      <P>The formal application for the erection of the new three-teacher school building at Drung, County Cavan, was first made to my Department in May 1980.  In October of that year my Department conveyed to the chairman of the school approval in principle for the replacement of the existing prefabricated classrooms. The question arose, however, of the provision by the school authorities of a site for the new building.  The school authorities had indicated that a site was available and this was subsequently inspected by the Commissioners of Public Works who indicated that a plot of about three acres was on offer from the school authorities of which one and a half acres could be made available for school use. Towards the end of 1981 a specific one and a half acre portion of the three acre field was chosen as suitable for school building and the preparation of preliminary drawings was commenced by the commissioner's architectural staff.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile it was necessary for the Department to enter into correspondence with the school authorities to establish that the title to the site for the proposed new school was satisfactory. This correspondence was entered into early in 1982.  It transpired in July 1982 that the title furnished was not satisfactory and correspondence between the solicitors concerned ensued.  It was not until November 1982 that my Department received a certificate from the Chief State Solicitor, that the title question had been satisfactorily resolved, and this opened the way for the further stages of architectural planning under the rules for national schools to be put in train.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department then wrote to the <Col N="1131" /> school chairman indicating their approval for the sketch plans for the projected new school and furnishing cost estimates with a view to reaching agreement on a satisfactory level of the local contribution. Agreement on the local contribution issue was reached by December 1982 when the Department formally sanctioned a grant for the project.</P>
    <P>On my Department's instruction, the Commissioners of Public Works then commenced the planning of the project in detail.  During the course of 1983, however, the commissioners reported that difficulties had been encountered by the school authorities in relation to local authority planning permission and these difficulties came to a head in November 1984 when the commissioners reported to my Department that a fresh site would have to be chosen.  That, in turn, necessitated a fresh title investigation by the Chief State Solicitor.  My Department in October 1984 were advised by the Chief State Solicitor that he had received sufficient assurances as to the title to the new site.  This, again, opened the way for the architectural planning process on the main school project to be resumed.</P>
    <P>Meanwhile, my Department, in response to reports on the condition of the existing school building, &mdash; I share the Deputy's concern in the matter &mdash; indicated to the school authorities that they were prepared to sanction a substantial grant towards the replacement of some of the prefabricated classrooms pending the construction of the new school.  In the event, this offer was declined and the school indicated that it would prefer the make do with the improvement of the existing accommodation. My Department subsequently sanctioned a fresh grant for improvements and some work has been done in that regard.  It is, of course, accepted that the school agreed to this measure in the interests of saving what they considered to be unnecessary expenditure and of expediting the allocation of capital for the new school project.</P>
    <P>The new school project has now <Col N="1132" /> reached the stage where the preparation of contract documents is nearing completion. The working drawings have been completed and are in the hands of a quantity surveyor for preparation of the bill of quantities.  The latter document is expected to be completed before the end of this year and the question of inviting tenders for the project can then be considered.</P>
    <P>I want to say to Deputy Wilson that I share his concern and that of the Ceann Comhairle in this matter.  In my short period as Minister of State with responsibility for the primary school building programme, some very poor cases countrywide have been brought to my attention.  We are dealing in many cases with schools built as far back as 1827 and some of them are in a deplorable condition.  The section of the Department is inundated with requests from boards of management, managers of schools and parents, quite rightly in many cases, about the provision of decent facilities for the children.  We are dealing with over 5,000 primary schools and an allocation of £28 million this year.  At any one time 700 improvement works are being carried out on schools and today there would be approximately 115 major work schemes in operation.  I want to say to Deputy Wilson and to the Ceann Comhairle that I am very sympathetic to the plea of building the new national school at Drung as soon as is humanly possible.  The very poor accommodation there has been adequately documented and certainly gives rise to justified fears and concerns on the part of the parents.</P>
    <P>I share the Deputy's concern with regard to the passive way in which the parents have dealt with this matter to date.  I also share his concern with regard to their comments about holding children back as from 12 November.  The mechanics of the tender system are well known to the Deputy who is a former Minister himself.  The tenders must be advertised in the public press.  The normal waiting period of one month must elapse before examination of the tenders, and one cannot prejudice the tender system in that one never knows what contractors <Col N="1133" /> might apply for a particular job.  All of that is subject to the overall provision of finance being made available to place contracts.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Deputy that the completion of the contract documentation is proceeding with all haste.  Once that has been completed I will then be in a position to discuss the release for tender of the project and once the tender has been received, examined and approved, subject to cost limitations, the question of the placing of a contract arises.  If the Deputy wishes, I am quite prepared to reassure the parents and the board of management on that score and, at the Deputy's request, I will meet a deputation in due course.</P>
    <P>One other thing I might comment on is that there is no such thing as a specific list within the Department from which schools are chosen at random.  Rather is it one of categories where tenders or contracts can be placed.  Schools fall into <Col N="1134" /> categories with regard to the different stages in the planning process.  I am very concerned about this.  If the Deputy wishes, I will arrange to meet with representatives of the board of management and reassure them that this matter will be dealt with as soon as I can possibly do so within the constraints placed upon me by the Department.</P>

      <P>Primary responsibility for the improvement and maintenance of roads, including road bridges and culverts, and for carrying out any examinations of these structures in their administrative areas, rests with each local authority.  In 1986, grant commitments were notified to each county council to finance the cost of surveying bridges or national primary and national secondary routes.</P>
      <P>Following the recent severe floods, all the bridges and culverts affected by the flooding were examined by the local authorities. In view of the extent of the damage, the Government decided to provide £6.5 million to local authorities towards the cost of repairing damage to roads and bridges.  Grants in respect of flood damage have now been allocated to local authorities calculated on the basis of the full approved cost of the repair-improvement of bridges and on 75 per cent to 100 per cent of the approved cost of other road works.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 55 and 65 together.</P>
      <P>Such delays in inspections as have arisen are attributable primarily to the very high number of applications received &mdash; about 120,000 to date &mdash; for house improvement grants, both new house and house improvement grants.</P>
      <P>Since the introduction of the scheme various measures have been taken to increase the capacity to do inspections, including the engagement of about 80 additional temporary inspectors and the operation of a bonus scheme, which is in the nature of overtime for the permanent inspectorate staff.  Notwithstanding these arrangements, it has not been possible to avoid some delays beyond the normal in certain areas.  Staff have been redeployed to meet this situation.  I expect to see an improvement in the inspection period in the areas in question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Minister for Communications (Mr. J. Mitchell) Jim Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Communications (Mr. J. Mitchell)</NameTxt>
      <P>My policy in relation to Cork airport, in common with the other State airports at Dublin and Shannon, is to promote the development of traffic through the airport to the maximum extent possible.  For this purpose, the necessary moneys are provided on an annual basis to maintain and develop the infrastructural facilities at the airport.</P>
      <P>There is, however, as the Deputy will understand, a limit to the amount of Exchequer finance which can be provided for this purpose in any one year and investment proposals are considered in the light of air traffic needs, the overriding consideration of safety of operation, the competing demands for Exchequer resources and the criteria governing capital expenditure in the public sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the past three years, £750,000 of Exchequer funds have been spent on capital works at Cork airport.  During the present year Exchequer funds of the order of £1 million are being provided for a number of capital projects at the <Col N="1079" /> airport, the principal one being the provision of a new instrument landing system.  In addition, Aer Rianta have recently received approval for expenditure of the order of £250,000 for improvements to the terminal building. This work will be carried out in 1987.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy will also be aware, I have adopted a series of measures aimed at liberalising air transport generally and I have taken a number of initiatives on air fares including in recent times the refusal of an application by carriers operating to the UK from Cork airport for an increase in basic air fares.  I have also recently announced reductions in air fares to continental destinations for the winter.</P>
    <P>As regards new services from Cork, Ryanair have applied to me for approval to operate air services to Luton from Cork which is a route not included in the present bilateral air agreement.  A decision on the Ryanair application will be taken in the light of the outcome of discussions taking place between the Irish and UK authorities on a revision of the Ireland-UK Air Services Agreement.</P>

      <P>Design work on a drainage scheme for the Mulcair catchment was suspended in February 1983 at which time some 80 per cent for both major and minor tributaries had been completed.  Immediately following the Government decision in late August, 1986, the balance of the design process was put in hands and it is expected that a preliminary design will be ready in about two years.  It is not possible to state how far advanced the design work on the Mulcair might have been had the suspension of planning not occured, or to say when a scheme of drainage works might be undertaken.</P>

The Government decided that the new unit built in the grounds of the Central Mental Hospital should be handed over to the Department of Justice to enable facilities to be provided to treat <Col N="1087" /> offenders, primarily female offenders, with medical-related problems in modern and hygienic conditions.  The Minister for Justice, in reply to Question No. 416 of 22 October 1986, outlined in detail his proposals for the use of the unit.</P>

      <P>Following a request by the Government the Irish pound was devalued by 8 per cent within the European Monetary System with effect from 4 August last. As indicated by the Minister for Finance at the time the adjustment was necessary to avoid the significant loss of output and jobs which could have resulted had no <Col N="1095" /> action been taken following the sharp drop in the value of both the US dollar and sterling.  Because of the confidential nature of this kind of operation it is not possible to apply for adjustments of agricultural conversion rates in advance of approval of adjustments within the EMS. A request to devalue the Irish agricultural conversion rates was submitted to the Commission as soon as possible after the realignment of the currency.</P>
      <P>Under the Community's agri-monetary system negative Irish monetary compensatory amounts (MCAs) came into effect on 6 August.  The purpose of MCAs is to prevent the trade distortions and irregular movement of products which could result from currency fluctuations. In our case the MCAs offset, pending devaluation of the agricultural conversion rates, the competitive advantage which would have accrued to traders as a result of the devaluation of the Irish pound.  Following Council agreement to devalue these rates with effect from 22 September, MCAs were reduced to 1.2 per cent for animal products and 5.8 per cent for crop products.</P>
      <P>MCAs collected or paid in trade form part of the Community's system of funding and are credited or debited to the Commission.  In the case of MCAs collected the funds are not available to member states to use for domestic purposes. Similarly where MCAs operate as subsidies, the burden of this does not fall on the member state.</P>
      <P>In Ireland MCAs on exports are collected by the Revenue Commissioners and I have been informed that the average weekly amount collected since 6 August has been £857,000.</P>

      <P>An application for a capital grant in respect of Shannon Recreational and Community Centre Limited was received in March 1985.</P>
      <P>In view of the very considerable estimated cost of the initial phase of the development and considering the absence, in the proposals made, of evidence of a readily available substantial local financial contribution, my Department was not in a position to give favourable consideration to this application.  In May 1985 the project organisers were advised by my Department that under the terms and conditions of the relevant scheme it was not possible to assist their proposal.</P>
      <P>It is open to the project organisers in this instance to submit a revised application to my Department, if they so wish, for consideration in the context of whatever funds may be available to enable the extension of the scheme to further projects in the coming year.</P>

      <P>The social employment scheme is the most significant step in the Government's strategy to assist the long term unemployed to make a contribution to social and cultural development.  By mid 1986 the Government's target of 10,000 SES participants had been surpassed.</P>
      <P>I have been particularly heartened by the degree of social solidarity reflected in the work being undertaken.  The quality and range of many of the projects has also been impressive.  The scheme has been able to tap the pride and imagination of whole communities in the interests of providing employment for those out of work.</P>
      <P>One of the most satisfying aspects of the SES to date has been the high level of job satisfaction which most of the participants are reported to have experienced while employed on the scheme. I am confident that the rights of these participants are fully protected under the terms of the scheme.</P>
