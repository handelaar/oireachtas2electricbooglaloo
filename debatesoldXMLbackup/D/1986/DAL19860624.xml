      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare her policy regarding the display of information posters by voluntary groups or agencies concerned with social welfare recipients at employment exchanges and social welfare offices.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mrs. Hussey) Gemma Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mrs. Hussey):</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department have a wide range of information booklets, leaflets and posters giving detailed information about their services and these are available in employment exchanges and information centres.  Requests by voluntary groups or agencies to display posters would be carefully considered to ensure that the posters are accurate and of direct relevance to the members of the public visiting those offices.  There are also, of course, physical constraints on the number and size of posters that can be displayed in any office.</P>
      <P>Subject to these considerations, any request by a voluntary agency to display posters in my Department's offices is considered on its merits.</P>

      <P>Could the Minister indicate whether departmental officials in Dublin make the decision in relation to posters being erected in labour and employment exchanges or can the local manager make a decision in regard to these matters?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey:</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that a decision is made in the central office in Dublin.  Very few requests are received for such displays and I understand that over the last 12 months only three such requests were made.</P>

      <P>Could the Minister indicate what decision was made in relation to the three requests to which she referred?  I understand that the Galway Welfare Rights Group made such a request and, if they are not among the three she mentioned, could she indicate when a decision will be made in relation to their request?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey:</NameTxt>
      <P>My information is that one of the posters related to a request by Senator Brendan Ryan to print and display posters prepared by the Simon Community.  I understand this request was refused because the posters were inaccurate in some respects.  Apparently, a similar request to display the same posters was made to the employment exchange in Galway and was refused for the same reason.  The other request came from the Dublin Welfare Rights Group who were holding a welfare rights week last March.  They asked for permission to display their posters in offices in the Dublin area and permission was granted in this case as the poster simply contained information about events taking place during the welfare rights week.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if she will consider introducing a limited credit facility under the supplementary welfare scheme where people could get access to small loans to meet contingencies, in view of the very high level of recourse to unscrupulous <Col N="913" /> moneylenders for these purposes at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey:</NameTxt>
      <P>The scheme of supplementary welfare allowances is a flexible one and community welfare officers have a large degree of discretion which enables them to give assistance in cases of genuine hardship or exceptional need.  Assistance under the scheme can be given to persons involved with moneylenders but it would be of advantage to persons in this situation to seek advice from their community welfare officers in the first instance before having recourse to moneylenders.</P>
      <P>While the supplementary welfare allowance scheme is mainly a basic income maintenance scheme, it does, however, provide for once-off payments to meet special needs.  This, undoubtedly, is the area which gives rise to resort to moneylenders by some people and I would have grave doubts about revising the supplementary welfare allowance scheme to enable money lending facilities to be provided in addition.</P>
      <P>A more fundamental review would be necessary to see what might be the best approach in this matter and this will be done in the context of the overall review of the social welfare system which is being undertaken following the submission recently of the report of the Commission on Social Welfare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not the case at present that when people who might be caught by high rates demanded by unscrupulous moneylenders look for assistance under the supplementary welfare system, in effect, money from the taxpayers will end up indirectly in the hands of such moneylenders demanding usurious rates?  Is it not the case that there is a genuine need for moneylending to social welfare recipients?  There is no other source they can turn to at present as the banks and credit unions would require a savings record.  Would the Minister not see that there is a gap in the present social welfare code which needs <Col N="914" /> to be filled and perhaps rather than waiting for a global re-examination of the social welfare system, would she consider a pilot scheme in a particularly sensitive area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey:</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to reiterate what I said about the supplementary welfare allowance scheme being a flexible one.  Indeed, a considerable degree of discretion can be exercised by community welfare officers.  It might be putting the cart before the horse to try to change the social welfare system to deal with a system which the Deputy describes as imperfect.  The rights and wrongs of moneylending are not a question for me, but rather a question for the Minister for Justice.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle:</NameTxt>
      <P>It will certainly not be a suitable question for Question Time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not convinced that the social welfare system needs to be changed since it is flexible.  I repeat that people who find themselves dealing with contingencies should first consult with their community welfare officer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods:</NameTxt>
      <P>The question asked about contingencies.  Is the Minister aware that a very serious contingency has newly arisen with regard to a couple over 70 years of age on a non-contributory old age pension of £40 per week &mdash; £20 per week each &mdash; who are living on their bank savings of £270 per month?  Since the introduction of the DIRT tax, that amount has been reduced to £156 per month, a drop of £30 per week and they must wait until April to claim back this DIRT tax.  The period between now and April is a very serious one for people in that situation.  Could the Minister make some special arrangement to deal with such a contingency which is not created by moneylenders but by the Government in applying their DIRT tax to elderly people?  This is something with which we disagree.  Can the Minister suggest how these people could otherwise bridge that gap in the intervening period?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey:</NameTxt>
      <P>That question is very different from the one which was put down and I could not answer it.  A separate question would have to be put down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods:</NameTxt>
      <P>The question asked if the Minister would make special arrangements to meet a special contingency regarding loans from lending sharks.  This raises the question of meeting contingencies generally.  I want to draw the Minister's attention to this case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair feels that if all contingencies, which might run into hundreds, were brought up individually, it would be just out of the question to deal with them all here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods:</NameTxt>
      <P>I can supply the Minister with the details, but I wanted to draw to her attention that this is happening as a result of the Government's DIRT tax.  It requires action on the part of the Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamSkelly" hpid="Mr. Skelly Mr. Skelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly:</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister accept that people on welfare assistance are not in a position to save?  Would she consider supplying vouchers for people in these predicaments, to help them to pay their ESB, gas and other bills for essentials?  It can also be extended to communion and confirmation expenses, shoes and other items.  I share Deputy Bruton's concern over the effect of high moneylending rates on such people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey:</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy would like to put that suggestion to us, we shall look into it.  The supplementary welfare scheme is, as I said, a flexible one.  There is a provision for a once off payment to meet special needs such as the Deputy has mentioned.  We have already considered that kind of contingency.  If the Deputy has a specific suggestion to put to me, I shall be glad to consider it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMcCarthy" hpid="Dr. McCarthy Dr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy:</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister consider reviewing the guidelines for payment of supplementary welfare allowances?  The once off special payment made in exceptional circumstances for essentials such as furniture, building, cooking apparatus and such is a very rigid type of guideline.  Are there any plans in mind to make this kind of exceptional payment more flexible?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry that I cannot be more definite for the Deputy.  I seem to recall that a review has been or is about to be, started on guidelines but I could not speak <i>ex cathedra</i> in case I am proved to be wrong.  I shall look into the matter for the Deputy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister accept that if tougher law enforcement comes in in this area there will be even greater need for some loan source for social welfare recipients?  Where else does she suggest that these people can go to look for these loans?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">

    <Speaker pid="SeanMcCarthy" hpid="Dr. McCarthy Dr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if she is satisfied with the present means thresholds used for assessment of certain categories of social welfare payments; and if she has any plans to revise these thresholds upwards in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Commission on Social Welfare in their recent report <Col N="917" /> recommended that a means threshold should be retained but applied uniformly to all applicants for social assistance.  This matter will, of course, be considered in the context of the review of the social welfare system arising from the report of the commission, but it must be borne in mind that any upward revision of thresholds would involve additional expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMcCarthy" hpid="Dr. McCarthy Dr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy:</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that assessment of means is probably one of the most contentious areas in the social welfare system?  Is there any intention to alter the system, particularly having regard to cases where property is owned but not used?  In assessment of value that is specifically excluded from assessment and a notional system of assessment is made.  In relation to capital investment, would the Minister not agree that an old age pensioner's excluded sum of £200 is extremely small, particularly at present when it is put aside to cover funeral expenses?  Should that allowance not be increased?  Is there any intention to change the whole system in this respect? With regard to young people, and the benefit and privilege question, at present&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle:</NameTxt>
      <P>This would probably be more appropriate in a debate on the Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMcCarthy" hpid="Dr. McCarthy Dr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy:</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that my question is a little drawn out, but this is a very broad area, as the Minister would agree. This is of as much concern to her, I am sure, as it is to us on this side of the House.  In the case of a young person living at home, the reduction for board and lodgings, or benefit and privilege as it is officially described, means that very few get much social welfare assistance and many nothing at all.  Could not more equity be established in such assessments?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey:</NameTxt>
      <P>The whole area of benefit and privilege has not been raised in this question.  This refers only to the means threshold for certain categories.  We <Col N="918" /> discussed the question of benefit and privilege for young people in the House before and Deputies expressed concern about it.  The problem is that to make a general change in that area we are talking about massive additional resources.  To change the threshold system we are also talking about massive additional resources. People feel that both of these areas should be improved.  People feel that the benefit and privilege for young people should be improved.  This demands a great deal of extra resources.  As I already said, the Commission on Social Welfare addressed itself to the question of the thresholds.  I will be looking very carefully at what the commission has to say about it to see if changes can be made in that area.  I caution Deputies that there is a problem in regard to resources, as I am sure they are aware.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle:</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to be restrictive with the Deputy and I hope I am not.  Wide and all as the question is, it is governed by the fact that we cannot debate the whole question of social welfare at Question Time on a question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMcCarthy" hpid="Dr. McCarthy Dr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy:</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept your advice, a Cheann Comhairle.  I wish to ask the Minister, particularly in relation to elderly people, if she has any plan to alter the reserve of capital which is now £200 and which is excluded.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">

    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. D. Gallagher Mr. D. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if she will consider the possiblity of extending benefits now available to widows over 66 years of age to all widows.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey:</NameTxt>
      <P>Widows aged 66 or over and in receipt of a social welfare pension are entitled to free electricity allowance, <Col N="919" /> free television licence or free telephone rental provided they fulfil the living alone and other conditions particular to those schemes.  The free travel scheme applies to persons aged 66 or over whether they are living alone or not.  If it were proposed to extend these schemes to include widows under 66, the position of other long-term beneficiaries under 66 would also have to be considered.  This would alter fundamentally the nature of the schemes and would have significant cost implications.  There are no proposals in present financial circumstances for such an extension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. D. Gallagher Mr. D. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Gallagher:</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister accept that where a widow is under 66 years of age and prior to her husband's death the family were in receipt of all these benefits, it is particularly harsh? She loses her husband, the benefits that the family were getting and then loses her free electricity allowance and all the other allowances that were available to her at that stage.  Would the Minister further accept that in these circumstances there is no loss to the Government?  It is something that is already being paid out. I have put down this question to several Ministers and the Minister should take a very close look at it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey:</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that the Deputy has been pursuing this question for some time.  I appreciate his concern. I have looked into the question most carefully to see what, if anything, could be done in this area.  It is not strictly true to say that it would not have any cost elements.  It has cost elements because it would mean extending the allowance to persons who do not have the allowance at present.  It is putting it the other way to say that we would be taking them away from somebody who has them at present. It would mean that there would be a new category of person who would be getting these allowances.  I have asked about the costing of such an extension and I am told that it is difficult to say what the cost would be but it is considered to be significant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="920" /> Another problem arises from this matter and one which may have already been mentioned to the Deputy.  We would then have a position where one category of widow under 66 years of age who had been entitled to these benefits would be treated quite differently from another category of widow under 66 years of age who did not have these benefits. The situation could arise where, because of that being anomalous, we would then have more people who would say that in that case the broader issue of all long-term beneficiaries under 66 years of age should be dealt with and the question should be extended.  I know that that may sound very tortuous and may create difficulties.  Unfortunately, as the Deputy is well aware, one has to look at every implication of these suggestions.  Unfortunately, the implications seem to rule out the suggestion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. D. Gallagher Mr. D. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Gallagher:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister stated that no costing has been done.  May I ask her to examine the likely cost of providing a scheme such as this?  Would she accept, in the case of a widow under 66 years of age who had been in receipt of these benefits and who has a teenage family attending second level education, that losing these benefits after she loses her husband caused tremendous difficulties for a family?  For that reason would she look seriously at the possibility of reviewing that whole question?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey:</NameTxt>
      <P>I may be of a little help to the Deputy on the costing element.  I can give one kind of costing which may give some indication of the position.  The estimated cost of extending the free electricity, telephone, travel and television licence scheme in a full year to include widows in receipt of social welfare pension would amount to £6.5 million.  If we were to extend further, as pressure might force us to do, those schemes to all long-term social welfare recipients under 66 years of age, we would be talking about a sum of £64 million.  That is all the costings I have at present.  It would be worth while to see if we could get more detailed costing on this element that the <Col N="921" /> Deputy is pursuing.  I am worried about other implications of it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if she is aware that a person (details supplied) in County Dublin living with his common law wife and their three children cannot claim tax relief as they are not a married couple and that his common law wife is not allowed to claim entitlements that may be open to her under the social welfare code as they are both classed as a married couple; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey:</NameTxt>
      <P>The taxation aspect of this question is a matter for the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>In relation to social welfare, the woman in question is not being prevented in any way from claiming her entitlements under the social welfare code.  She was in receipt of the maximum rate of unmarried mother's allowance for herself and her two children until 27 June 1984. Payment ceased after the woman notified the Department that she was cohabiting with the father of the children who has been in receipt of unemployment payments since 19 July 1982.  Additional allowances were paid to him in respect of the woman and the two children with effect from 28 June 1984.</P>
      <P>In January 1986 separate payments were sought by those involved and this was put into effect from 15 January 1986 with weekly payments of £34.75 being paid to the man and £43.80 being paid to the woman.  These are the maximum rates of payment for a recipient of unemployment assistance with an adult dependant and two children.  The weekly payment being made to the woman was increased by £7.70 from 22 March 1986 following the birth of her third child.  It would be open to the woman in question to apply for unemployment assistance in her own right but she would then of course have to satisfy the statutory conditions of the scheme.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if she will allow retrospective payments to be made to married women whose rates of payments and duration of payments have been equalised as a result of the legislation introduced for the operation of the European Equality Directive; the amount these extra payments will cost; the reason this retrospection has not been allowed to operate from the date of passing of that legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 6, 9, 14 and 26 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Social Welfare (Amendment) Act, 1985, provided for the implementation of EEC Directive 79/7/EEC on equal treatment for men and women in matters <Col N="923" /> of social security.  That Act was passed by the Oireachtas in July 1985 and section 24 stated that the Act would come into operation on a date to be fixed by ministerial order.</P>
    <P>As is generally known, there was a delay in implementing the Act because of a dispute with one of the trade unions in the Department about staffing issues. In the event, agreement was reached to implement the first phase of the equality measures from 15 May 1986 and legal effect was given to this in the Social Welfare Act, 1986, and by order dated 14 May 1986.  Married women now get the same personal rates of benefits as men and single women and they are also entitled to unemployment benefit for the standard duration of 390 days.</P>
    <P>It is my intention to bring the remaining equal treatment provisions into effect at the earliest opportunity.  Married women will then be entitled to claim unemployment assistance in their own right, and will qualify for payment provided they satisfy the means test and fulfil the usual conditions of being available for and genuinely seeking work.  The position in relation to single women will not change because they are already entitled to claim unemployment assistance under current legislation.</P>
    <P>The second phase of equality will also mean that the same conditions will apply to both men and women in the matter of increases in social welfare payments for adult and child dependants.  The revised definition of adult dependency is based on the principle that one spouse will be regarded as dependent on the other only if he or she is being wholly or mainly maintained by that spouse.  Where neither spouse is dependent on the other, 50 per cent of the child dependant allowances will be paid to each claimant.</P>
    <P>However, where the spouse of the claimant is regarded as an adult dependant the full child dependant allowances will be paid to that claimant.  Special alleviating measures are being drawn up in recognition of the drop in household income which some families would suffer following implementation of the revised <Col N="924" /> definition of dependency.  It is proposed that a working spouse earning £50 a week or less will continue to be regarded as an adult dependant.  In the case of families where both spouses are at present independently entitled to benefit a special transitional payment of £10 a week will be made to mitigate the overall loss of income which the family would otherwise suffer.</P>
    <P>The equality measures in force since last May will cost an estimated £16.8 million in a full year.  The question of retrospection is a difficult one because as well as providing increases for some people the equality provisions also involve a reduction in entitlements.  Selective retrospection for some but not for others would be difficult to justify and for that reason there are no plans for retrospective application of the equality measures.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell:</NameTxt>
      <P>There are many women working and earning low levels of income whose husbands are unemployed and receiving a payment in lieu of their wives and children.  If the new regulation comes into force without any form of subsidy, the incentive will be for the woman to discontinue working because she could find herself working in tax deducted, PRSI deducted employment virtually for nothing.  Is it correct that, when the final regulations come into operation as stated, the woman can opt on a voluntary basis to allow her husband to continue to draw what would be effectively her benefit and the benefit of the children?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey:</NameTxt>
      <P>In answer to the first part of that question, the fact that we have made special alleviating measures goes some way towards meeting the problem. It is proposed that a working spouse earning £50 a week or less will continue to be regarded as an adult dependant so that there would not be a loss in the case of very low earnings.  That is as far as one can go on that aspect.  It has been designed to soften the impact of this necessary directive.  On the other part of the question the Deputy asked, I cannot give the answer straight away.  I will have that conveyed to the Deputy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa:</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied with a situation whereby married women will be discriminated against in that they are not entitled to receive any more than they would if they were treated as a dependent?  Does she agree that is discriminating against them on the basis of their marital status?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey:</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see where the discrimination arises because it applies to men, women and children all being equal now as a result of the directive which was designed to remove the discrimination which considered that a woman was always the dependent of a man and that the man could only be a dependent of a woman if he was sick, if he was on disability benefit or long term illness payments. The EC directive removes that element of discrimination in terms of prescribing women as dependents.  Under the assistance schemes and social welfare schemes people are means tested.  In fairness we must have some arrangements whereby one household is not receiving a whole lot more payments than they should, simply because we are trying to remove discrimination. The arrangements being brought in under this directive in compliance with the EC directive are fair to both spouses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMcCarthy" hpid="Dr. McCarthy Dr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy:</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to show a little more consideration than her predecessor did in regard to this equality directive, particularly in relation to the assessment of claims of married women for unemployment assistance allowances.  Unless the investigation and the questioning are carried out in a nondiscriminatory fashion, married women will continue to be excluded.  At the time of the introduction of this Bill we tried to have an amendment inserted to ensure that those questions which discriminated against married women on the basis of their sex would be excluded.  For example, nowadays the first question she is asked when being assessed for unemployment assistance is who is minding her children.  I do not think any officer asks a man who is minding his children.  This type of investigative procedure should <Col N="926" /> not be allowed.  I am confident that the Minister recognises the problem much better than her predecessor did and will ensure that this will be looked at further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy does not want me to go down the road of criticising my predecessor.  I think he dealt with this whole matter in a very skilful manner.  I would obviously be very concerned to think that, after we had implemented this directive for equal treatment with some difficulty and after some length of time, any discriminatory questioning would remain in the system. I would expect that the Department of Social Welfare personnel would be very aware of the requirement to be absolutely fair and even-handed in their treatment of applicants for unemployment assistance.</P>
      <P>There will not be many women who will qualify to receive unemployment assistance.  I do not think it will be anything to do with their status as married women, or who is going to look after their children.  It will be because the unemployment assistance schemes, like many other schemes, are means tested. That is the reason not very many women will qualify.  As regards the question on the care of children, the social welfare officers must exercise great care bearing in mind that it must be established that the applicants, men and women, are genuinely available for and seeking work.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMcCarthy" hpid="Dr. McCarthy Dr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy:</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I ask the Minister, in view of the great importance of this issue, if she will issue specific instructions to social welfare officers advising them that these types of discriminatory questions are not to be asked?  There was a problem with one union in her Department which delayed the retrospective payments.  Unfortunately, as I am sure the Minister is aware, this was not the fault of those who might benefit, particularly married women.  As they are <Col N="927" /> precluded as and from either 6 or 8 February from claiming additional payments and additional duration, will retrospection be introduced for them because it was not their fault that the Directive was not implemented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is probably aware that there is a case to be heard in the European Court of Justice on retrospection on 15 October which covers the matter he raises.  All I can do in answer to the Deputy's question is to once again remind him of the fact that as well as providing increases for certain persons the equality provisions, by their very nature, involved a reduction in entitlements which meant a great many people had been receiving more money than they were due under the equality provisions. The question of retrospection is not a simple one by any means.  The Deputy is talking about selective retrospection only for those who should get more now and who were getting less before, but not for those who got more before and who, strictly speaking under equality rules, were not entitled to it.  It is a very complex question and I would not like to make further comment because of the case that is going forward.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMcCarthy" hpid="Deputy McCarthy Deputy McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Deputy McCarthy:</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that some families will lose as a result.  Approximately 20,000 families will be affected by the implementation of the Directive.  Of that 20,000, some 8,000 are going to do extremely badly.  In view of the fact that we have had a considerable period of time to reflect on the damaging aspects of this to the family income would the Minister consider improving the alleviating factors which, when the Bill was passing through this House we on this side of the House regarded as grossly inadequate to cater for the loss?  Many families will lose £40 to £50 a week when the Directive is fully implemented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey:</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of people who will benefit from the equal treatment <Col N="928" /> provisions is enormous.  The cost already is £16.8 million.  There are 170,000 households affected, with only 20,000 suffering some drop.  We have designed alleviating measures which I detailed earlier on and which have gone reasonably far.  In view of the enormous cost, the fact we have taken alleviating measures and that the vast majority of people affected will be affected on the right side, the Government have gone as far as they can go.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa:</NameTxt>
      <P>To return for clarification on the point I raised earlier about discrimination on marital status, the Minister is aware that the adult dependants allowance on unemployment assistance is lower than the personal rate. The Bill which introduced equality legislation introduced discrimination against married women who cannot receive more than the dependants allowance on unemployment assistance.  Will the Minister move to eliminate that discrimination against married women?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey:</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have to look into that to see what I can do.  Does that not apply also to males who may also receive the adult dependants allowance? I will have that particular question looked at because I am not familiar with the ins and outs of that part of it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if she has any intention of increasing the staff in the social welfare office in Cork as there is a huge backlog of work associated with applications for the various allowances etc.  which is causing severe hardship; and, if so, when.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey:</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no major backlog of work at the employment exchange or at the social welfare offices in South Mall, Cork, in which officers from my Department's inspection branch are <Col N="929" /> based.  There has, however, been a substantial increase in recent years in the workload of the inspection branch and of my Department generally.  This has had an effect on their ability to provied services as quickly as they would like in all cases.  Every effort is being made to ensure that claims are decided as quickly as possible and that delays are kept to a minimum.</P>
      <P>Staffing levels in my Department are at present being reviewed in the context of staffing levels for the Civil Service as a whole being fixed.  I am hopeful that this review will result in additional staff being assigned to my Department.  I would like to point out that claimants who are awaiting decisions on their entitlement to social welfare benefit, assistance or allowances can have recourse to the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen:</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that the six months waiting period is an unreasonable period which in many cases has caused hardship, anxiety and uncertainty? Is the Minister aware that in many cases it has driven these people into the arms, as Deputy Bruton said earlier, of moneylenders?  Would the Minister agree today to review the situation in Cork?  I submit the Minister is misinformed about the position in Cork.  It is a black spot which needs to be looked at.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey:</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret very much that there are delays in entitlements being granted to people.  It is a great pity that there should be a backlog such as this. The trouble is, as I said to the Deputy earlier on, that there has been a substantial increase in the workload of the Department generally.  I am told that the position in Cork is, generally speaking, not different from elsewhere and that the problem is to deploy additional staff fairly and evenly where they can be obtained. We are looking at the staffing levels in the harder pressed areas to try to have the staff increased in those areas.  My Department are having discussions with the Department of the Public Service to see how we can achieve those increases. <Col N="930" /> I am pressing very hard in this area and I am hoping we will achieve additional staff in the coming months.</P>
      <P>I am told that in the employment exchange in Cork the work of the Department is up-to-date, being dealt with on a day-to-day basis as it is received.  Items on hand in the inspection branch amount to six to seven weeks work.  These are mainly investigations in the case of pensions, social assistance allowances and unemployment assistance. Whereas the Deputy, quite rightly, expressed some alarm at what he feels to be undue delays, all I can do is give the Deputy what I am told are the facts in this area.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare the present position relating to the recommendations made in the Ombudsman's Report and in particuilar the section relating to the amendments to the 1953 Social Welfare Regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey:</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the recommendations made by the Ombudsman was for a change in the contribution conditions for old age contributory pension to enable certain people who failed to qualify for pension because of gaps in their insurance record from 1953, when the unified system of social insurance came into operation, to qualify for pension.  An amendment of this kind would involve substantial additional costs.</P>
      <P>The other main issues raised by the Ombudsman concerned the entitlement to social welfare payments of persons involved in trade disputes, the question of interest payments where benefits are paid in arrears, the question of retrospective payments in case of late claims and problems arising because of different methods of assessing means under different social welfare schemes.</P>
      <P>All of these areas are being examined in the context of the Ombudsman's recommendations and also in the context of the review of the social welfare system in general that is being undertaken following the receipt recently of the report of the Commission on Social Welfare.  It must be borne in mind, however, that any relaxation of the regulations to give entitlements to persons who do not at present qualify will inevitably result in additional costs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Ombudsman stated in his 1984 and 1985 reports that the biggest anomaly he could find in Irish law was the way in which the averaging system works, based on the 1953 legislation. I appreciate that it would be very costly to amend it.  Has it been costed?  If so, what is the cost?  Would the Minister accept, at least in principle, that the system is unfair in that people who paid <Col N="936" /> stamps for several years prior to 1953 can end up with a smaller pension than people who paid stamps for a shorter period after 1953?  It is a clear injustice in the social welfare legislation.  There seem to be thousands of people who are very badly affected.  Will the Minister give an assurance or an undertaking that the recommendations contained in the Ombudsman's report will be implemented either as part of the social welfare review or in the next budget?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey:</NameTxt>
      <P>I know there will not be time, so I will not do that.  In the case of persons who lost entitlements because of broken insurance, the cost of providing full pensions at July 1986 rates up to the year 2017, which is a reasonable period in this case, is estimated at £50 million. The Commission on Social Welfare, on the other hand, have recommended <i>pro rata</i> pensions for the persons concerned for the same period.  This would be on a different basis and they tentatively estimate the cost at £24 million.  That suggestion has its own problems.  One is very concerned about the Ombudsman's report and the remarks he made but at the same time one is concerned about the enormous amount of money for a relatively small group of people.  I assure the Deputy the matter is being looked at seriously.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare her views on discriminatory practices in the payment of pensions between widows and widowers; her views on European Parliament Resolution C 117/173/174 (Ms. Maij-Weggen); the action she proposes to take in advance of an EC directive on the matter; and whether she will introduce a uniform system of payments to all widowed persons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey:</NameTxt>
      <P>The widows' pension schemes are designed to meet the financial needs, experienced as a result of the husband's death as he would, generally, have been the breadwinner in the family. Where a pension is paid to a widow under the widow's contributory pension scheme it is not affected by any other income or earnings which the widow may have.  The provision on the same basis of pensions for widowers would have wide-ranging financial and other implications.</P>
      <P>Widowers with dependent children who are in receipt of disability or unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance can receive a &ldquo;housekeeper&rdquo; allowance in the form of an increase for an adult dependant in respect of a woman who is looking after the children.  Assistance can also be provided under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme to any person who is in need.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Matters not covered by the EC directive on equal treatment which are the subject matter of the European Parliament Resolution C 117/173/174, are now about to be considered by the EC <Col N="938" /> Commission.

    <Speaker pid="SeanMcCarthy" hpid="Dr. McCarthy Dr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy:</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that under existing regulations widowed men are badly discriminated against?  I realise that the European Parliament is attempting to ensure that the term &ldquo;widowed persons&rdquo; should be used rather than &ldquo;widows&rdquo; or &ldquo;widowers&rdquo;. What are the Minister's views on this matter?  Does she not feel that men are badly discriminated against?  Would she not agree that men who lose their wives are very often placed in a particularly invidious position in the sense that many of them have to give up their jobs and the family end up in extremely poor financial circumstances as a result?  Have the Department any views on whether they would implement a directive immediately if it became the stated policy of the European Commission?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey:</NameTxt>
      <P>The widows and orphans pension scheme was introduced a long time ago, in 1935 and before our present Constitution.  The scheme was introduced at a time when very few women worked or were able to support themselves. The more I look into the social welfare system the more I see the great many schemes which seem to have that as a basis.  The kind of provisions made for widows were not made for widowers because it was considered very unlikely that a widower would be left without financial support due to the death of his spouse.  This question has implications not only for widowers but for other categories such as deserted husbands.  There are considerable implications across the board in dealing with the new situation of men and women.  Where a widower is in receipt of any payment from my Department &mdash; disability benefit, unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance &mdash; he gets a housekeeper allowance to assist him in having the children looked after.  The European Parliament Resolution 79/7 on equal treatment of men and women was adopted by the Council of Ministers on 19 December <Col N="939" /> 1978.  It provided for a great many schemes, many of which we are currently bringing into operation.  It does not cover survivors' benefits and we are awaiting an EC directive on this matter.  The Commission on Social Welfare recommended that there should be one overall social assistance scheme covering existing categories and other persons where an income need is established.  The whole question of the support of one parent families, irrespective of how that status arose, is a logical follow on from our examination of anomalies.  I have to repeat that there are massive implications arising from the Commission's report, from our own observations and from the possible EC directive.  I intend to wait to see what the decisions on this at EC level will be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMcCarthy" hpid="Dr. McCarthy Dr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy:</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously, the Minister recognises that equality is something we hear a lot about nowadays and that in this area the rules, which were introduced when women by and large did not engage in employment outside the home, are out of date.  Any type of sociological survey would show that many married women work outside the home and that the scene has changed.  This discrimination against men, particularly widowers, is blatant. I am glad the Minister mentioned men whose wives desert them and leave them to head a one-parent family.  They are being discriminated against because they do not get a deserted husband's benefit or allowance.  The Minister should look into that area.  Will the Minister explain how men who have been contributors to the social welfare fund for many years when they become widowers are not entitled, in justice alone, to a widower's benefit?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey:</NameTxt>
      <P>I have given the Deputy a fairly full reply to his question on this matter.  The implications of changes in this area are very big and they will affect many people.  If it was not a matter of concern the EC would not be taking it up.  Obviously, I will be playing an active part in the EC's consideration of this <Col N="940" /> matter.  I accept that anomalies exist in the widows and other schemes and that those anomalies need to be dealt with.</P>

      <P>The Stalker report to which the Deputy refers has been the subject of much speculation in the press in recent weeks.</P>
      <P>I have no information either about the substance of that report or about the circumstances surrounding the removal from the investigation of Deputy Chief Constable Stalker.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would recall the background: in November and December 1982 six men were shot dead by the police in County Armagh in circumstances which raised serious questions not only about the conduct of several police officers but also about the structure and operation of police units in Northern Ireland.  These incidents had a serious and detrimental <Col N="942" /> effect on confidence in the police, particularly among the Nationalist community.</P>
    <P>The Government consider that it is a matter of great importance that the whole matter should be brought out into the open, that any supplementary investigations necessary should be completed as soon as possible and that the report should be acted on without delay.</P>
    <P>As regards the description of the report, I would refer the Deputy to the statement made in the House of Commons last Thursday night in which it was indicated that the report was an interim report.

I should like to ask the Minister to elaborate on this crucial difference between an interim report and a final report.

I hope the Minister will agree with me that this matter is of fundamental importance to the work of the Conference.  Can I press the Minister again as to whether he has either suspicions or grounds for suspicion on the whole circumstances surrounding this matter, and in particular the peculiar circumstances in which Mr. Stalker was removed from the conduct of the report?

We should wait and see what comes out in the open.  It is important that all matters should come out in the open as quickly as possible.  In regard to the Anglo-Irish Agreement and the Conference set up under it, one of the objectives is to devise means whereby the confidence of the Nationalist community can be strengthened, and in so far as there are suspicion and mystery surrounding any members of the security forces or any branch of those forces, the more quickly it is removed the better in the interest of confidence.</P>

      <P>My Department at the request of the Nuclear Energy Board, arranged over the past few weeks for the collection and transmission to the board of samples of sheepmeat, including lamb, and other foodstuffs.  These samples were required by the board for the determination of radioactivity levels in food as part of their on-going programme of monitoring such levels.  Early last week the preliminary results of the tests on lamb and sheepmeat indicated that the radiocaesium levels were of the order of 100 to 500 becquerels per kilogram.  These levels were below the internationally agreed action levels of 1,000 becquerels per kilogram and the level of 600 becquerels per kilogram recently agreed within the European Community for the control of imports originating in third countries. One or two of the samples had levels above the 600 becquerels per kilogram.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to express on my own behalf and that of my party our deep sympathy on the death of Cathal Coughlan.  To all of us who have known him, his sudden death at such an early age has been a profound shock.  Like his brother Clement, whose sudden death three and a half years ago equally distressed the Dáil, he was a popular figure, bringing into this House the warmth of the Donegal spirit.  All of us feel deeply for his wife and children, for his father and for the widow and children of his brother Clement for whom Cathal's death must have brought back all the trauma of that earlier tragedy.  May he rest in peace.</P>

      <P>I join with the Taoiseach in his tribute to the late Deputy Cathal Coughlan, whose untimely and unexpected death has saddened all the Members of this House.  Ar dheis Dé go raibh sé.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the short time he had been a Member of Dáil Éireann, Cathal Coughlan <Col N="1048" /> endeared himself to all, winning respect and forming personal friendships with Deputies on all sides of the House. On behalf of my colleagues and myself, may I thank all the Deputies from other parties who attended the funeral in Donegal yesterday.</P>
    <P>Always courteous and good humoured, Cathal was the most kind and compassionate of men, concerned constantly about the welfare of others.  He was a completely selfless man, interested in a kindly and sympathetic way in all those around him.  He had a quiet sense of humour and an infectious smile and by his very presence he helped to make this House a congenial and friendly place for us all.  He was a reliable, trustworthy and dependable colleague.  His well informed contributions to our debates here on education, on Gaeltacht affairs and on regional development always commanded attention and respect.</P>
    <P>When the people of Donegal South-West elected Cathal Coughlan three years ago, following the tragic death of his brother Clement, they chose wisely and well.  They could not have had a more dedicated or more worthy representative in Dáil Éireann.  He never ceased to work in their best interest, because he understood better than most that the real purpose of politics is to serve the people. Their great regret, as it is ours, will be that he will not be there at their service to continue to work for the people and the county whom he loved and served so well.  But it is by his wife, Marian, and his young family that his loss will be felt most of all and whose sorrow and sense of loss we all share.  On my own behalf and on behalf of Fianna Fáil, who in a real sense feel they have lost a good friend, I extend to them our most heartfelt sympathy.</P>

The feeling of sadness we all have is accentuated greatly by our memory of the death of his brother Clement a few years ago, again after only a very short period in this House.

      <P>The Government last Friday made an important statement of legislative intent with regard to marriage, separation and divorce which involves <Col N="1052" /> legislation to give effect to major changes in adoption, civil liability, the courts, family law, nullity, pension rights and succession rights.  The Government promised to amend at least 18 Acts of the Oireachtas, legislation which, I think the Taoiseach will agree, is very complex.  I would like to ask the Taoiseach if the drafting of this legislation has commenced, and if he would agree that in normal circumstances a programme of comprehensive legislation of that kind would take anything from five to ten years to put through this House?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be the case if Fianna Fáil were in office but let me take the matters raised by the Deputy <i>seriatim</i>.  The Government made an expanded statement of their intentions last week which contained two new elements. Those new elements related to the action which will be taken legislatively in respect of pensions in connection with, in relation to and arising from divorce legislation and the action that will be taken with regard to social welfare arising directly from the initiation of divorce legislation.  The only two matters in the Government's statement not previously announced in earlier Government statements, although foreshadowed in individual speeches, were these two elements which cannot be introduced in this House unless the people vote in favour of what is proposed.  There are other elements in the earlier statement which fall into the same category, that is, the divorce legislation itself and everything connected with it, and there is also the doubt that unless we make this constitutional change it would be constitutionally impossible to transfer the property of the family home from a spouse to a dependent spouse unless we had the protection of the constitutional change now proposed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware &mdash; although not everything members of his party have said would indicate equal awareness &mdash; that there is no right of property in the <Col N="1053" /> family home at present unless the dependent spouse has paid for the purchase of the family home.  The proposal in the property orders being made involving a transfer of the family home will be authorised under the constitutional change we propose, but there is a doubt as to whether it could be effective without breach of private property rights unless people vote yes in the referendum, which I naturally hope they will do.  The Deputy, like anybody else, I presume would like to see these changes effected.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey:</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought I might induce that response.  I am not clear on the Deputy's references to constitutional protections which it is intended to bring in other than the referendum.  The only constitutional protection we can bring in is that which the people can bring in by saying yes in the referendum thereby making certain that the legislation proposed in respect of women's rights, and the family home deriving from her work as a wife and mother in the home can without doubt give her an entitlement to the family home, which at present she does not have.</P>
      <P>For the rest, the first statement issued by the Government related to matters a number of which are not dependent on the passing of the referendum and which involved changes in the law of marriage and separation, some of them unconnected with the question of divorce.  In the interests of the protection of marriage, the Government will pursue these matters regardless of the outcome of the referendum.  The Deputy's suggestion that it will take five to ten years to introduce this legislation I find astonishing. The clear statement made by the Government of their intentions goes some distance towards providing the shape of the heads of the appropriate Bill.  The necessary legislation if the referendum is passed, or if it is not, will be prepared by the Government and presented to this House in the next session.</P>
      <P>I hope, and it is the hope of the majority on this side of the House and of some Members on the other side of the House, that the people will say yes and enable us to extend the constitutional protection in the manner I have indicated and to deal with the problems which at present give rise to difficulties and anomalies in our legal system, including the criminal law system of bigamy which can only be overcome if the people say yes in the referendum.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly:</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the Minister's contribution on this Bill, I found it disappointing and extraordinary that he should spend 90 per cent of his speech on the exceptions to the Bill rather than the effects of the terms of the Bill and the general effect it will have in the community and on general business and small business.  He has followed the trend of previous speeches he has made in the last few weeks in not arguing properly the need for this Bill but merely assuming that it was going through the House by introducing it in the first paragraph, going on to talk about the exceptions and telling us it is here, it has arrived.  I would have thought that it would have been necessary in making such a major change in insurance law which affects malicious injuries to try to set out the case for it.  The case that he attempted to set out in the Courts Bill was alone the same lines.  It might indicate that it was coming from the same Department, the Department of Justice, and that he felt it was really unnecessary to prove it, that it was a <i>fait accompli,</i> something that the Government had intended to do and that it will be carried out.  The key to his argument is contained in the first paragraph in which he said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In August 1984 the Government announced as one of a number of measures aimed at reducing public expenditure the termination of the malicious injuries scheme contained in the Malicious Injuries Act, 1981.  The purpose of this Bill is to give effect to that decision by replacing the existing scheme with a new scheme under <Col N="1061" /> which compensation for malicious damage will be available in a limited number of circumstances only.</P>
    <P>He went on to talk about that limited number of circumstances and the machinery he is setting up in order to put them into effect.  Maybe it was unintentional, but more respect than that is due to the House and as thinking people we would like to see the arguments for bringing in this legislation and not simply to hear that the intention is to reduce public expenditure because this is what we generally want to do in any event and a very handy £20 million is there in the cost of claims relating to 1985 which we will be able to pick up in order to help the economy.</P>
    <P>After those two sentences the Minister went on to talk about the new scheme and the protection it will give in a very limited number of cases and these new arrangements that we have first of all from recoupment from the Exchequer of compensation awards by local authorities under this new scheme &mdash; I suppose that is the sweetner.  He said that under the new arrangements damage to property will be compensated in three circumstances: (1) where the damage is caused during a riot; (2) where it results from an act committed maliciously by an unlawful organisation; and (3) when it results from an act committed maliciously by an organisation outside the State.</P>
    <P>Under normal circumstances &mdash; if we take it for the moment that normal circumstances do not obtain in that there is an element of terrorism and there are unlawful and illegal organisations operating in the State and very much so in the northern part of the country &mdash; there would be very few instances which would give rise to a claim because we are depending on riots which are civil disorder, on unlawful organisations or an organisation from outside the State to cause this damage.  One could almost say in truth that in the normal course of events we will have no need to call on these exceptions.  However, the Minister goes on to talk about the exceptions for <Col N="1062" /> the remainder of his speech in total.  That is extraordinary.  What is worrying everybody is, of course, the removal of this protection from malicious injuries and that this £20 million would be passed on to a section of the community, in many cases, probably mostly, to the hard pressed businesses in the community, and in most cases to those people who are fortunate or unfortunate enough, depending on how you look at it, to be resident in or have a business in or around built up or city areas.</P>
    <P>The Minister pointed out that insurance companies may refuse to give cover for malicious damage in some individual cases but we get no consolation from this point that he makes because he merely points out that it is very likely that similar difficulties exist already in relation to other insurable risks and that if a problem arises in an individual case the Department of Industry and Commerce will be prepared to examine the matter to see what can be done.  Is that a promise? Is the Minister saying the Department of Industry and Commerce will do something about it or are we creating more bureaucracy?  Are we being unfair to the Department and their personnel who will be at the other end of the complaints line?  The Minister has not made any concrete proposals because he does not say what will happen in the event of insurance companies not providing cover in certain circumstances.  I can see abuse being meted out to those officials.</P>
    <P>Has the Minister consulted the Minister for the Public Service because the Department of the Public Service have been doing a public relations job to try to improve the relationship between the Civil Service and the public?  They have been successful in this regard because we do not hear about the 97 per cent of successful outcomes to complaints but only about those who are dissatisfied with the service.  This Department, like the Department of Social Welfare where, no matter what you do, you are likely to incur the wrath of someone, will cause a problem.  We do not know if the Department of Industry and Commerce are prepared to get into the area of risk. <Col N="1063" /> Perhaps this can be dealt with on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>During the last year or so this problem was also discussed in regard to banks who are not prepared to take up risks.  Other Members and I suggested that the Government should step into that area either by subsidising the banks or by stepping in themselves.  They did so by setting up the National Development Corporation. In this area, the Minister should also be more specific and decide whether the Department will become involved because it is obvious that there will be problems in cases where insurance companies refuse to pay.  This happens at present in the case of young drivers who are refused insurance expect at exorbitant rates which make it impossible for them to avail of it.  Whole areas of cities and towns will be a no man's land as far as insurance companies are concerned.</P>
    <P>It is very easy to point out those areas in Dublin.  There is a high crime rate and malicious damage is carried out at the drop of a hat.  As usual late on Saturday I left my home in Dublin west to buy the newspapers and I counted five bus shelters which had been smashed.  This was due to the actions of the crowds coming from the fireworks display.  I read that blocks were thrown through windows of business premises around the city and the corporation were blamed for not clearing away the building material before the weekend.  I am just pointing out the level of vandalism and malicious damage.  People passing by see a pile of bricks and throw them through a window. Not alone is the window smashed and its contents damaged but there may also be a loss of property because of a subsequent robbery.  There will be whole areas of Dublin which cannot be insured.</P>
    <P>The insurance companies are having a field day in Dáil Éireann because we are bending over backwards to change the law to suit them.  We are even abolishing juries in civil cases and, as a bonus, we are getting rid of compensation for malicious injuries which means that premiums will be much higher which, in turn, means more profits for the insurance companies. <Col N="1064" /> Insurance companies do not deserve any help from this or any Government to make more profits.  That is what it is all about and no matter who is involved, the unfortunate victim of a road traffic accident, a person injured at work as the result of an industrial accident, an inner city householder or business occupier, the insurance company will take their pound of flesh.</P>
    <P>Insurance companies must be one of the most despised industries in the world and they should examine their consciences to find out why people have so little praise for them.  It is not very difficult to find the answer because, as far as personal injuries are concerned, it is obvious that their massive resources are not used to educate the public as is the case in regard to other companies.  Insurance companies do not try to influence people in regard to abuses of the Road Traffic Act.  The same applies to malicious injuries.  They do not try to educate younger members of the public in regard to vandalism and juvenile delinquency. However, they commit a certain percentage of their resources towards marketing and advertising.  As I said on the Courts Bill, they should direct some of their resources towards educating the public in regard to black sports, defective cars and driving under the influence of alcohol. They could do a marvellous job in counteracting other companies who are trying to get everybody to drink their heads off.  The insurance companies should be in competition and should advocate drinking tea, taking part in quizzes and games and getting away from the pub mentality.</P>
    <P>Insurance companies should also do something to reduce insurance costs in industrial and road traffic accidents.  In regard to malicious injuries, they should direct their advertising and marketing people to convince young people that they should develop other interests.  They should also provide facilities for them.  It could be made widely known that a certain insurance company had set up this project for the youth in an area like, for example, Dolphin's Barn.  The insurance <Col N="1065" /> company would thereby be encouraging the youth to enjoy themselves in a harmless way and at the same time keep from becoming involved in causing malicious damage and so on.  That is only a suggestion which I am sure will not be acted upon.</P>
    <P>The Minister's arguments is even weaker than the one used to abolish juries in civil actions.  He says that in the final analysis no insurer can be compelled to underwrite a particular risk but that advice may be available from the insurance company to the person seeking a policy to reduce the risk to enable it to be covered.  That is the height of naivety. Acting on such advice might cost more money than whatever they are trying to insure is worth.  It might involve rebuilding a premises, calling in consultants, burglar alarm companies, adding new roofs and reinforced doors and all sorts of other things.  The insurance company do not give two tuppenny damns whether the person looking for insurance can afford to do that or not.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister not realise that a business, or even a householder, in the city area cannot afford to be without insurance, although there are lots of them without insurance at the moment?  I know places around the city of Dublin where companies really take a chance; they put up signs saying one does everything at one's own risk.  They say they are waiting for the first court case to hit them and when it does they may not be able to do anything about it but will just fight it and if they have not got the money to insure or to pay up they will close down and let go.  That is not positive thinking.</P>
    <P>I have not gone near the areas Deputy Woods touched on in his submission and I do not intend to repeat what he said. He took up the problem of schools.  If there was consistency in the various Departments one could excuse it.  I have asked many times for the education equipment grants, which are 80 per cent, to be extended to burglar alarm systems or security systems for schools and have been refused.  I am told that, unless it is part of the building plans and unless the alarm system is put in during the course <Col N="1066" /> of building, they do not qualify for these grants.  The cost to schools all over the city is so enormous that they have taken all the glass out and replaced it with perspex or some kind of thick plastic.  Equipment is locked in strongrooms and people come in and just knock blocks out of the walls to get into the strong rooms to remove VDUs and computers and all the other equipment or smash it up.</P>
    <P>Bills for schools are enormous.  The insurance companies are taking advantage of that just as they have taken advantage of the construction industry over the last number of years.  The reason they increased insurance for the construction industry above that for other businesses is that they say that they will not get accurate figures of the turnover and wages of the company and the premium is based on that.  They do not accept that they are getting accurate figures so they increase the rate to about six or seven times what it is in other businesses.  That is the method the insurance companies operate.</P>
    <P>The Minister is, in effect, handing us over to the wolves and we will be devoured. They have no motivation other than to make profits.  Insurance companies do not care what happens to the community or to individuals.  This is witnessed by the fact that they have not directed any of their funds towards community help, to reducing the risk.  They will only do this if they think it will pay them dividends. They have not done it in the case of motor insurance or personal injury insurance and they will not do it in the case of malicious damages.  God help anyone who has to rely on them.</P>
    <P>I am sure this is not the intention of the Minister but I am certain that this measure will reduce employment because most companies are under-capitalised. To get off the ground they usually operate out of cash flow and are usually short of capital.  As the Minister for Finance pointed out, that is the problem of most companies here.  Just as we have 20 per cent of the motorists driving around without insurance because of the high cost, businesses will have no insurance and they will not survive.  The responsible <Col N="1067" /> members of the community, therefore, will not be able to get involved and will be unable to pay the premiums.  There is now a monopoly for the insurance companies who take the best.</P>
    <P>It will not help the deprived areas of the cities or towns because companies will locate in different areas.  Insurance companies look at an area and decide that it is a bad risk from their point of view and will not even come out and assess a premises.  If they are persuaded to come out and assess the premises they want it practically rebuilt and it will cost a fortune.  If a company does all that and still manages to stay in business and has a claim against the insurance company the premium will rocket the following year.  This happens every year.  This is not guesswork.  I was involved in many businesses myself and often did not make claims simply because it was better to suffer the damage than have the insurance premium go up.  That becomes an overhead and the profits have to be reduced.  That is why I say this little sentence about advice from insurance companies is very naive.</P>
    <P>If this matter had been researched properly and if the Minister and his officals knew what the problem was, the sentence with which I am quarrelling would not have been inserted.  I do not mind people having red faces because we all make mistakes; it happened also in connection with the Courts Bill on the removal of civil juries.  The Minister was using 19th century Acts to attempt to prove that the public had got rid of civil juries in most cases and that juries were used only in the Circuit Court.  I pointed out to the Minister that the public had never been consulted during the 19th century, that Parliament was run from Westminister. This was not properly reported on the last occasion, but my argument was that it consisted in the main of landed gentry, aristocrats who were elected by means of rotten boroughs throughout Britain.  These were the people who removed civil juries from those cases, <Col N="1068" /> because they themselves were being affected.  The wealth of the country consisted of property and since they controlled that wealth they were powerful enough to remove civil juries.  The trading classes who owned the mills and factories became the moneyed classes and they kept that system.  The ordinary Joe Soap did not remove the civil juries.</P>
    <P>We are trying to promote an atmosphere of enterprise in the country and in the community but we cannot do so if we cripple those who are trying to get a business going.  It is very difficult to contemplate getting into business.  Any business which uses transport or which depends on insurance cover is impossible to get going.  The money is being handed over to usurers, unscrupulous people whose interest is not the promotion of business but the making of money.  The Minister tells us that he is terminating the malicious injuries scheme but does not give any argument for this decision.  This is a big topic but his speech went to only nine pages.  An attempt was made to stop Deputy Woods speaking.  He was told he was speaking for too long and monopolising the debate, but he had a very detailed, prepared speech and had all the facts and figures.</P>
    <P>I defy the Minister when replying to give us an argument for this decision.  The first part of his speech mentions that this Bill is being brought in to reduce public expenditure and the rest deals with the exceptions and ends in the <i>faux pas</i> of bringing our law into line with that in England and Northern Ireland.  Every piece of legislation brought in by us depends on England.  I thought we wanted to get out of line with that country. I advise the Minister to tell the House why he is bringing this legislation before it and we could then decide on that basis.</P>
    <P>It is very dangerous to continue along the path of taking this House for granted and not proving a case.  This matter did not come before a committee of the House, or, as in Canada, before a caucus of the Government party.  It is not considered important even that the Minister be here.  This legislation is intended to get though on the nod, as the numbers <Col N="1069" /> game will play a part.  While the intention is good, how many times would the Minister be prepared to remove a Bill from the Order Paper, or withdraw a Bill which was going through the House, or change one substantially?  Usually there are just cosmetic changes to save face.  That is the unfortunate situation.  I received no prior notice about this legislation, any more than I did for the Lotteries Bill which will come before the House tommorrow.  This has happened in other cases also.</P>
    <P>I am very saddened at the way the civil juries Bill was presented.  The insurance companies got their act together in about two weeks, which proves the enormous influence they have.  They are now doing the same with regard to the Malicious Injuries Bill.  I can tell the House with certainty that insurance premiums will go through the roof.  The insurance people will have a field day.  If we want to encourage business and maintain businesses around the city areas, we will have to become involved.  We will have to subsidise security watches on the main schools, subsidise insurance in particular areas and perhaps subsidise people in business to take out the necessary premiums. If that is the case, a substantial amount of the £20 million will be spent in such subsidisation.</P>
    <P>There is another area at which the Minister should look very carefully, which is taking steps to reduce the £20 million.  He could ask how the amount managed to go from £3½ million in 1979 up to £20 million in 1985.  What monitoring goes on in the Departments with regard to payouts?  I know there can be appeals to the courts, but who decides if a claim is serious enough?  On the last occasion I mentioned that people are wont to look for an opportunity to make malicious damages claims.  One individual ran a company from New York by telex on a daily basis.  Some corrugated sheets were blown down on the previous night and the managing director sent a telex describing this.  A telex was sent back asking if he could claim insurance damage.  The reply went back that he could not, that there was no damage done.  Several telexes were sent asking him to claim damages, <Col N="1070" /> so eventually damages were claimed. Claims under such circumstances could be reduced.  The spread would then be much more even across the board.  There are serious flaws.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the three exceptions which were, unlawful organisations, organisations outside the State and riots.  He concentrated on how good the effect of the Bill will be in those areas. If we had a normal, stable, steady society, there would be very few claims under those circumstances.  Who wants to be assured that damages will not be paid out unnecessarily in those areas?  What is omitted from this Bill and from the Minister's speech is more important than what is in it.  I will not go into those areas because it is a red herring.  It is very unfortunate.  I would like the Minister to tell us if he was given the speech.  I know the Minister is very thorough.</P>
    <P>I have passed the stage of frustration in this House.  From 3.30 p.m. I waited to try to raise a question on the Adjournment and I have just received notice to say that because it was not in until after 4 p.m. I could not raise it on the Adjournment. The tributes to the late Deputy Coughlan and the Order of Business did not finish until 4.15 p.m. Technically the Government got out of it.  I was the only person who raised a question for debate on the Adjournment and this is what we have to put up with in the House.  I cannot raise the Fr. Molloy case on the Adjournment. We have not been consulted about the legislation before us.  It is not properly argued and we are asked to vote on it.</P>
    <P>What kind of way is that to treat the House?  On a technical matter the establishment in this House and in the country are trying a massive cover up.  There was no possibility of asking to raise a question on the Adjournment before 4.15 p.m. because the Order of Business was not introduced until after 4 p.m.  The Government do not want democracy to prevail.  I cannot raise a legitimate matter like the death of Fr. Molloy in this House because the establishment and everybody else are playing cards together and want it covered up and smothered.  They are <Col N="1071" /> succeeding in doing so.  I will try to raise it again.  It is a disgrace.  As a Member of Parliament I am ashamed of this action. The circumstances under which this man died have been covered up.  To deny me the right to speak on this tonight&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Yes, right now.  If this is the way we operate in Dáil Éireann it is no wonder television and radio are not allowed in here.  We support the establishment in practically everything we do. We respond to the establishment in this measure.  It will be to the benefit of the insurance companies and the poor sucker, the member of the public, will have to pick up the tab.  We removed civil juries in the Courts Bill for the benefit of the insurance companies, also the establishment. We respond to the establishment when the Church decides to intervene.  We respond to the establishment in everything we do whether it is the professions, the legal establishment or whatever.  We now have a Bill lobbed into the House with no arguments to prove why we should pass it.  Nobody is shouting for arguments.  The same happened with the Courts Bill.  No argument was produced as to why we should remove civil juries.  Who will benefit from it? The establishment.  We want to keep the establishment going.  The poor old Joe has no chance.  The person who does not have any opportunity, educationally or career-wise, is the one who will suffer all the time when we introduce measures such as this and prevent other measures from being introduced.  The professions are closed to him.</P>
      <P>When a person manages to get through the net and comes in here to represent his constituents and tries to bring up matters of public and national importance, of social justice and of the administration of courts, he cannot do so because he is prevented by technicalities and by any means possible to stop him from speaking.

We have an independent DPP.  This office was set up recently.  That has brought a measure of honestly to the system.  The Garda are being pummelled and blamed for non-prosecution of cases.  It is not their responsibility.  It is the DPP's responsibility. The DPP has not carried out his responsibility in the case of Fr. Molloy.</P>

      <P>I am doing it at a great personal cost and because I was entrusted to do so by 120,000 people.  I hope they feel that I am at least trying to air in this House the issues that concern them.  I am trying to make this a better country and a better place to live with a fair system of laws and with a proper system of administration of justice so that everybody <Col N="1075" /> will get a fair and equal opportunity in education and careers.  The country and this Parliament should not be run for the benefit of the few.  We should all have a chance.  It is necessary to raise uncomfortable matters.  This country is very good at sweeping things under the carpet.  If we ignore it, it will go away.  It will not go away.  These things will crop up again.</P>
      <P>We should not be concerned about how we rate in the eyes of the world but how we rate when we look into the mirror each day.  When we examine our own consciences and the so-called Christian ethic which we keep reminding ourselves of, the island of saints and scholars and all that bunkum, we find it is nothing of the sort.  If there is anything worse than narrowmindedness, it is intolerance.  This country is full of it.  When a measure such as this comes up or when the Courts Bill or anything related to it comes up, people are entitled to be represented and have their voices heard.  If there is disquiet out in the land, it has to be silenced.  The only way it can be silenced is with justice. Justice must be done and must be seen to be done.  In any case where it is not seen to be done, we have a problem.  We should address that problem.  A person who has a sense of justice should speak out whenever a situation arises which to him is unfair and something is not clear, especially when the good name of one of our citizens is involved and he is getting unfair treatment.  One human being is worth fighting for to get the system right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to reconsider the effects of what he is doing in this legislation.  The long term effects are not spelt out but in the short term he is suggesting that we might save a few bob.  I am asking at what cost.  The Minister has not produced one good reason for its removal.  There are different ways of cutting high costs.  We are not going to benefit in the long term.  I do not give a tuppeny damn for Britain.  When it suits Members of this House they quote statistics from other countries no matter what we are talking about, be it the Criminal <Col N="1076" /> Justice Bill or divorce.  Our model is Britain. No matter what Britain does, we must follow.  This indicates that we have very little initiative of our own.  Maybe it is true that we have little initiative, but we have not to ape the British.</P>
    <P>I do not want to repeat much of the research work which Deputy Woods has raised.  According to Deputy Woods our community centres and sports halls have borne the brunt of malicious damage. When we get in the £40 million from the poor which we will get over the next year after the National Lottery Bill has been streamrolled through the House, where is it going to go? It will go into community centres, sports halls, recreational centres, and arts and culture which very few people know anything about.  This Chamber has a sorry record on arts and culture. It knows nothing about arts and culture. It has done nothing about them and now it is going to raise money for them.  When we do that, claims for malicious damages will come in from these magnificent centres, which will cost millions of pounds, and the insurance companies will stack them up.  How long term is that? The State has to get involved in the control of crime and in the promotion of good behaviour by the general population.  It has to direct and educate them and spend money so that they do not become vandals and there is no increase in the amount of malicious damage which takes place in the community.  To pass this Bill when crime and vandalism are at their highest will send a sky rocketing bill back into the community.  I do not see the good sense in that.</P>
    <P>Suppose, for example, there is a saving of £5 million to £10 million out of that £20 million, is it worth it? I do not think it is.  We should bring the insurance companies in and have a talk with them.  We should say to them that we know they are entirely ruthless and do not care tuppence about what happens to anything or anybody, that they are here to milk it for every penny that they can get out of it, that they abrogate their responsibilities at every hand's turn.  When the motor insurance payouts started getting too high they opted out and did not pool their <Col N="1077" /> resources and the money they were getting from property investments etc. and take the cost of motor insurance out of that pool.</P>
    <P>We should tell them they should give reasonable rates to the punter.  They invest the punter's money in properties and blue chip investments, and in other things from which they make enormous money.  Because they make that enormous money from the individual in the community they should, in fairness, give something back.  They have given nothing back.  I do not see why we should be helping them.  Their arguments in relation to the removal of civil juries are pathetic.  They are affecting the weakest members of our society, the badly injured, the sick and people with the most serious injuries imaginable.  We have gone on to their side and are legislating against the most unfortunate members of our community.  We should remember that.</P>
    <P>In fairness to Deputy Woods, as I happen to have an interest in the areas he has contributed to in the past, his contributions on the legislation he has approached have always been very thoroughly researched.  His arguments and many of the things he mentioned should have been in the Minister's speech but they were not.  When we talk about breakages, robberies, burglaries, house breaking and fire damage, we are talking about the densely populated parts of the city and the huge number of unemployed. In parading goods and chattels in front of the noses of those who have not got anything we are risking further damage and break-ins.  There is a need for this measure to stay on the Statute Books for at least a little longer or until it has been thoroughly investigated.  If we had this out for general discussion for a few months and people had their say, I could understand its introduction.  It could have been very skilfully drafted in the same way as the forthcoming amendment has been drafted with care and protection and with due regard for the citizens as a whole and the social good.  This has not been done in that manner and it warrants a rethink.  Somebody needs the courage <Col N="1078" /> to stand up here and say: &ldquo;We have not given this sufficient thought.  Let us take it back and think about it a little longer&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I do not believe we will ever see the hoped for reduction in car insurance premiums, first, because of the attitude of the insurance companies and, second, because of the provisions of this Bill.  A tremendous amount of malicious damage is done to motor vehicles, accounting for 50 per cent of the total compensation paid.  That is one area that could be tackled by the insurance companies and the Government.  There must be lots of ways in which that position could be alleviated. One must ask: what will happen the motorist? Immediately one could cut the bill in half and talk about a figure of £10 million.  But the only way the insurance companies will allow for that pay-out is to increase motor insurance cover costs. We should have no doubts about that.  I have said before that I believe this is an area in which the Government should become involved.  Indeed, in any area in which the private sector is not prepared to become involved &mdash; any area in which there is public need &mdash; the Government should become involved either directly or by way of subsidy.  They should say to them: &ldquo;If you want the cream only it is not on.  We will not allow you to have the cream.&rdquo; In the same way as the Chairman of the Bank of Ireland decided that they would add a 3 per cent premium on interest charges for small businesses seeking increases &mdash; while not being prepared to take risks in that area &mdash; the Government should step in and nudge them out of the way, or encourage them to do so by way of subsidy.  The same should apply here. We will suffer badly when these fellows are given their head.  They will heap a £10 million transfer from the £20 million on to motorists' backs.</P>
    <P>Many areas will suffer devastation as a result of the non-availability of insurance. People will move out of those parts of city areas with a high crime rate.  The only people who will remain will be those who can afford full time, private, roundthe-clock insurance cover.  The passage of this Bill will not help that situation. Rather will it encourage more crime in <Col N="1079" /> those areas because the criminals will know that malicious damage will not be wholly catered for by people seeking insurance cover.  This will mean that criminals will increase their activity in those areas, occasioning more problems for the Garda and everybody else concerned.</P>
    <P>It should be remembered that there are 1,300 arson attacks every year, which costs will have to be borne by the insurance companies.  Why is it that insurance companies increase premiums on premises so much once a claim has been lodged?  It appears to me that this point has not been taken into account by the Minister &mdash; at least it was not dealt with in his introductory remarks &mdash; or in the Bill itself.</P>
    <P>Has anybody in this House ever had the experience of having gone to bed on a Thursday night wondering how they would pay their employees the following day, or of waking up in the middle of that night knowing that they could not pay their employees the following day? The same applies with insurance costs in the case of somebody worrying about how they will meet a massive insurance bill, knowing that if there is a claim made with regard to their premises that will occasion a huge increase in premium.  Indeed, if one decides to insure the following year, those costs will wipe out one's profits, and one will end up with a loss.  That cannot be good for anybody.  That matter has not been given thought.</P>
    <P>There is another point that should be stressed.  Since I became a Member of this House I have been castigated for daring to criticise that idol amongst the plethora of semi-State bodies, the IDA, for having made the serious mistake of concentrating on attracting multi-nationals here to the detriment of small business. Having experienced the demise of Ferenka, Fieldcrest, Travenol, Mostek and a few others, with the loss of thousands of jobs, the haemorrhage that caused in the areas in which they were located, the IDA woke up, decided to do an about-turn and endeavour to attract small businesses.  When they ceased looking at the huge numbers, entertaining <Col N="1080" /> only the captains of the multi-nationals to dinner in the Berkeley Court Hotel and realised that the US economy was supported to the extent of 70 per cent or 80 per cent by small businesses, the penny began to drop.</P>

      <P>Even poor old Harold Wilson, the former British Prime Minister, was about ten years ahead of the IDA in concentrating on small business. Many small businesses in this country are located in low-income areas.  The only insurance available to them is that under the malicious injuries code.  They run their operations on a shoestring.  It appears there is such expertise around here on small businesses, but up to a year ago they did not even know they existed. Certainly they did not know how they operated.  Certainly one would not have found it very easy to make an appointment with the IDA if one were a small Irish businessman.  However, they have changed somewhat recently.  They had done a tremendous public relations job &mdash; I think that is what they spend most of their money on &mdash; telling everybody what a great organisation they are.  To that end they ran all of those advertisements on radio and television saying: &ldquo;I am John Murphy; I have just set up another business down here with the help of an IDA grant; is not that great?&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly:</NameTxt>
      <P>Fifty per cent of the claims come from motorists, the remaining 50 per cent being comprised of business people whose premises have been broken into or perhaps the odd private resident but mostly businesses.  Small shopkeepers and business people who own small businesses located in streets in Dublin, Cork, Galway, Limerick or Castlebar are the people who have their front windows smashed in some evening when a group of hooligans decide to drink too many pints.  That is where the costs come into play.  The owner of a small shop may find <Col N="1082" /> that the front window has been smashed on four successive days or perhaps four times in a period of a week or two.  It costs hundreds of pounds for plate glass. Those people do not earn £20,000 or £30,000 a year.  They work 12 or 16 hours a day, seven days a week and they are lucky if they make a wage from it.</P>
      <P>We are now telling those people that they can no longer claim for malicious injury but must go to a usurer, that is, an insurance company, and seek insurance. When the company discover that the plate glass window was broken 15 or 25 times in the previous year they will charge a figure of about £5,000 or £10,000 to insure.  That means in effect that the shopkeeper goes out of business.  Premises all over the place in industrial estates and small back lanes are constantly broken into.  The owners claim against their insurance and they also claim malicious injuries.  They will be unable to afford the premiums in those cases and a lot of people will be driven out of business.</P>
      <P>There are alternative suggestions but nothing can be done with this Bill, unless it is withdrawn and rewritten.  The exceptions do not really apply and are not relevant to the problem.  If a Bill has flaws or is not properly introduced to Members before it is brought into the House and an opportunity is not given to discuss it outside, Members have no alternative but to discuss it here.  They have to be very constructive about it and forget momentarily about what side they are on. We should all be on the side of the citizen. People come first.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government should consider getting into the area of providing insurance at more reasonable rates or they should entice the insurance companies to do so by subsidy.  In relation to the Second Stage of another Bill during the past week or so, I appealed to the Minister to answer certain questions and I said I would take particular note on Committee Stage.  Unfortunately they were totally ignored.  That is what gives the edge to one's contribution on Second Stage.  One realises that one is talking to the seagulls and that nothing will be done but the Bill <Col N="1083" /> will be passed because of the numbers of Deputies.</P>
    <P>I should like to draw the Minister's attention to the abuse of malicious claims.  Payouts are sometimes made without sufficient scrutiny.  There is room for improvement in that area and for a reduction in the cost to the State.  This problem must be addressed.  We must reform the method and streamline the payout.  What are the Government doing about that? I hope the questions I raised will be taken up.  I should like to know whether the Department of Industry and Commerce are going to step into the breach.  That might help.</P>
    <P>The Bill is seriously flawed and I cannot see that it would be acceptable.  Deputy Flynn is ready to speak and I will be interested to hear what he has to add. The contributions I have heard so far have not been in favour of this Bill and I am keen to see if we can get something worth while from it.  I strongly suggest to the Minister that he should not for the moment interfere with the malicious injuries claims system, except that he might improve the scrutinising and payout systems.  He should certainly leave the system <i>in situ.</i></P>

      <P>Deputy Skelly says in relation to this Bill that the Minister has a very weak argument or no argument at all.  He claims that the Minister is not in a position to state the special circumstances which would warrant the discontinuance of the malicious injuries code.  There is a fair element of truth in that and it would be interesting to know if Deputy Skelly's views on this legislation are shared by any sizeable number of his colleagues in the Government parties.  If so, it is very difficult to understand why the Minister and the Government should be pursuing this legislation through the House.</P>
      <P>I take it that normal procedures have applied within Deputy Skelly's party in considering this legislation, but Deputy Skelly would seem to indicate that no great consideration was given by the Government parties before the introduction of this legislation.  If that type of consultation in the party rooms has terminated, it raises very serious questions as to the way legislation is introduced and pursued in the House.  Deputy Skelly is a very outspoken man on many matters. He was no more outspoken today than on previous occasions.  He raises a lot of questions about the practice by the Coalition parties in the introduction of legislation.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister of State might like to reflect on that and if there is a difficulty as far as Deputy Skelly is concerned perhaps he might relieve his anxiety and give him a better understanding as to the Government's purpose in the introduction of this and related legislation. He seems to be at quite considerable variance with what is generally regarded as the unanimity of the Government parties.  Perhaps he is just the tip of the iceberg.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are being asked by the Minister to amend the system of compensation under the malicious injuries code as provided for in the 1981 Act.  The Minister is asking us to remove the compensation for malicious damage to property except in certain defined cases such as damage <Col N="1085" /> resulting from riots or activities of unlawful organisations.  The Minister devoted most of his speech to dealing with that aspect of the legislation.  It is accepted by all that insurance companies, because of the impact of this legislation, rather than local authorities and the State, will have to carry the major burden of the premium increase that will ensue following the implementation of the legislation.  Effectively that means that policy holders will have to pay the price later.</P>
    <P>This type of legislation is appropriate in a time of great stability in the area of law and order but in a period of escalating crime, vandalism, arson and malicious burglaries, like now, to seek to remove compensation protection from the innocent victims is grossly unfair.  This will lead to an extra burden being put on private property owners, school management boards and owners of business premises. The cost of insurance will increase dramatically.  The Government appear to be having a double think on this.  One week they introduce legislation in the hope that they will stabilise and, perhaps, reduce the cost of insurance but the following week they take a deliberate step that will mean a further increase in premium costs to all policy holders in the general insurance area.  The Minister's proposal does not take any account of the difficulties in regard to general insurance. It has been agreed by all commentators in the media, the insurance industry, the CII, the IDA and other relevant agencies involved in the business and economic life of the country, that there is a general insurance crisis here which is having a serious effect on business, job levels and related matters.  It appears that the Government are reluctant to bear that in mind when introducing legislation.</P>
    <P>General insurance costs have become a major headache for motorists, householders and owners of businesses.  The legislation before us will add to the misery.  The Government should be trying to reduce insurance costs rather than adding to them.  People have been led to believe that insurance costs will at least stabilise or at best that there will be no great increase in premiums as a result <Col N="1086" /> of the Bill passed last week to abolish juries in civil actions.  That has proved to be a false hope in that now many of the people directly involved in the insurance industry have said that the general public cannot expect any great change in insurance costs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle:</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Deputy agree that it is not reasonable to go back on a Bill that was disposed of last week?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Chair will agree that there is a distinct relationship between malicious injury compensation and the cost to be borne by insurance policy holders.  The level of crime and malicious damage is a challenge to the Government and the law enforcement agencies but, as far as I am concerned, it is not an insuperable problem.  If we are to overcome the problem we will require determined Government action, proper Garda funding, enlightened education programmes for teenagers in the cities and a reduction in the level of unemployment. If those matters were attended to I am satisfied that there would not be a need for the introduction of the legislation to abolish juries and malicious injury compensation.  Until we, as a people, overcome the continuing national debilitation of unemployment we cannot hope to reduce violence, vandalism and malicious damage to property.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Passing on the cost to the unfortunate insurance policy holder is taking the soft option and following the negative policy of &ldquo;out of sight, out of mind&rdquo;.  The Government have to accept a considerable amount of criticism in that they are not addressing the problems I have referred to.  They are continuing on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis, a day-to-day administration which is not effective in dealing with the problems that result in the huge malicious damage compensation claims.  There are too many iron grids, steel bars and shutters fronting our business premises in Dublin city and in the main business streets in many large urban districts. Those city centre districts resemble war time fortresses and give our tourists a sad impression of modern Ireland.  Our <Col N="1087" /> reputation as a friendly and law abiding society has suffered a severe dent in recent years.  The legislation before us will only add to the desolation and desertion of Dublin city after dark.</P>
    <P>The legislation must lead to shop closures, loss of employment and services to city centre dwellers.  It will be a pity if more shops have to close and if those providing services for city centre dwellers have to move out because of the lack of insurance protection which will automatically ensue following the implementation of the provisions of the Bill.  I thought all city representatives would have been as vocal as Deputy Skelly in opposing the legislation if only to maintain the commercial viability of the city centre and provide services there.  There is no doubt that there has been a curtailment of those services in recent years due to the level of lawlessness in the city.</P>
    <P>The hand of organised crime will be strengthened in the city and in the long run the State will have to pay more for crime prevention than the £20 million mentioned in the Minister's speech as the saving that will result from the terminating of malicious damage claims.  It is bad economics in the Government's interests to talk about saving some millions of pounds by the implementation of this legislation when the Government will have to take strenuous steps to provide the necessary level of protection before the population return to the city centre.</P>
    <P>Malicious injury compensation goes back to the Grand Jury Act, 1836.  The system was introduced to deal with 19th century agrarian disturbances which were common in a number of countries.  The system that evolved was a non-profit making one of communal insurance against malicious damage to property. The financing of that system has been the cause of a lot of criticism over the years. Up to 1963 the annual average rates charge was a half penny in the £ and it had advanced in 1969 to 8 pence in the £.  In 1974, under the new statutory arrangement, it was increased to 20p in <Col N="1088" /> the £ as far as local authorities were concerned. Over and above that, it could be reclaimed.</P>
    <P>The financial provisions in the Local Government Act, 1978, provided full relief from domestic rates, and local authorities began to be compensated by grants from the Exchequer.  I do not think it is intended that any Government will go back on the 1978 legislation.  Therefore, local authorities should be relieved of all responsibility for the payment of malicious injuries compensation.  That has been a concern expressed during the years by local authorities who were strapped for money and who found it very hard to pay compensation.  In one county council in the old days the figure was £78,000 in one year, a very sizeable impact at that time.  The Government would get widespread support from local authorities and the House if they relieved local authorities completely of the onus in this respect.</P>
    <P>There has been a general increase in criminality in our society and there is a suggestion that crime is out of control and that the Government are seen to have failed to protect the citizens and their property.  Undoubtedly, the level of crime is unacceptable and it would appear that the Minister, in introducing this legislation, was more concerned and interested in cutting Garda overtime than offering protection to the citizens.  People are genuinely terrified in their homes in many cities.</P>
    <P>It is to be regretted in such circumstances that the Government would contemplate going down this road, which will make things far more difficult for citizens. Garda overtime is an interesting case in point.  It has resulted in serious concern in many quarters.  It is admitted now by the Department that there have been cut-backs in Garda overtime.  Decisions on this have been taken in an arbitrary way. It is no good that the Minister for Justice says that £12 million was allocated for Garda overtime in 1986 and that there has not been a reduction this year as against 1985.  He was right when he said that but, unfortunately, while there has not been any reduction in cash terms, the <Col N="1089" /> Minister is not facing up to the fact that £8 million has been spent already and that half of the year remains, the most difficult time from the security point of view, with only one third of the money left.</P>
    <P>The Minister had a meeting recently with chief superintendents responsible for administering overtime and the immediate result was that some overtime was cancelled in May, but when the impact began to be felt at a time when a serious crime was committed, there was an announcement that whatever about overtime in relation to centre city duties, Border security would not be subjected to a cut-back.  It was made quite clear then that future overtime would have to be costed in advance and necessary approval got from headquarters before overtime would be paid.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn:</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn:</NameTxt>
      <P>And his own backbenchers said he had not dealt fully with the subject.  I had come to the point about cost effective policing and about letting the public know what is in store for them. I submit that we are providing inadequate policing, and the direct result is an increase in crime, much of it of a malicious nature.  Therefore, one can understand the Minister's claim that £20 million will be paid out in compensation this year.  This goes hand in hand with policing arrangements.  The Minister indicated that the compensation will be substantially increased next year.  It is patently wrong to allow the crime rate to escalate while withdrawing money from the Garda, and to provide Border patrols to police the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  It is <Col N="1090" /> also a matter of book balancing.</P>
      <P>The £20 million referred to by the Minister will be paid by somebody, but the Minister was not too clear about who would carry the load.  In his speech he said that when difficulties arise, when people try to get insurance cover elsewhere, it is very likely that difficulties will arise in relation to other insurance risks. The Minister missed the whole point.  It is not a matter of individuals being able to afford to get insurance.  If individuals get insurance cover it will be at a very increased cost and they cannot afford that overhead in their businesses.  The increased cost of insurance, therefore, will result in business closures and job losses.  It is no good for the Minister to say individuals who fail to get an underwriter to undertake liability would be helped by the Department of Industry and Commerce.  That is unconvincing double talk in regard to some kind of support system.  It does not stand up, and even if the Minister can persuade insurance companies to take up the further load, they will do it only by increasing premiums.</P>
      <P>That being the case, we can readily recognise that more and more people will carry the risk themselves. Inevitably that will lead to the point where individuals will not be covered and will end up, just as happened with regard to uninsured motorists, with the bureau carrying an enormous sum in respect of those who fail to do their duty.  The same thing will happen with regard to public liability and employers' liability and then we will know about the escalating costs.  However, it will be a matter between the business community and the insurance companies because the Government will have flown the nest.  They may save £20 million but at what cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A considerable number of malicious injury compensation claims are made in the area of car insurance.  An uninsured motorist today is costing each individual who pays his car insurance an extra £70 on his premium.  The number of stolen and vandalised cars is increasing, as is the number of joyriders in the city.  We were <Col N="1091" /> told by the Minister that they had tackled and somehow overcome that problem but it appears to be a continuing difficulty. There is a rampage of destruction going on in broad daylight so far as car vandalism is concerned.  It was brought to my attention that on a recent Sunday in this city while a sad funeral was taking place some 90 cars in a row were vandalised in the sight of a considerable number of people.  Of course claims will be placed against the insurance companies if the cars were insured and I take it if they were not insured someone will try to make a claim against the bureau.  One way or another it will end up in malicious damage claims against the local authority.</P>
    <P>Up to now local authorities had the benefit of the levy of 20p in the £ from the rates while the remainder of the cost was borne by the State.  Now because the insurance companies will not be able to get reimbursed for the malicious damage claims made on them, they will seek to recover that extra cost by increasing the car insurance premiums for all their policy holders.  To put it politely and mildly, so far as car insurance is concerned we are out of line with our competitors and our partners in the EC.  The direct result of the elimination of the malicious injuries compensation system will be that policy holders will have to pay increased premiums in the immediate future.</P>
    <P>A case has been made so far as schools, community centres and churches are concerned. So far as malicious damage to schools is concerned, it is a question of soaring statistics.  The number of claims costing £10,000 and more has increased many times.  There seems to be an element in this city determined on the general destruction of public property.  I do not know the possible reason for this destruction but I know that the Government of the day have some responsibility in trying to minimise it and to remove it entirely.  However, to date nothing substantial in the matter has been recommended or suggested by the Government or their law enforcement <Col N="1092" /> agencies.  The only response to date has been the curtailment of Garda overtime and the removal of gardaí from the beat because of the shortfall in the Exchequer returns.  I hardly think it is the best way to address the problem in the long term. It will be found that because of Government inactivity in the proper funding of law enforcement agencies there will be an increase in the number and size of malicious damage claims.  Of course the Government will be able to write into their statistics on crime and on malicious damage that all that problem has evaporated, that somebody somewhere else has taken up the cover.  Underwriters will be back in business so far as the increased loading of premiums is concerned.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the insurance industry do not want this business.  What industry would want to take on a guaranteed loss-maker from the first day?  If they are to compensate themselves by way of premium income, without having further recourse to their investment income, they will have to apportion in straight figures the £20 million estimated loss this year on malicious damage claims to the policy holders under certain specific classes.</P>
    <P>I will spell it out quite clearly.  Because of our geographical location and small population in the west of Ireland, we have a very small incidence of malicious damage claims.  Quite a different situation obtains there as compared with the major centres of population and we resent greatly that we will have to pay the same percentage increase on our policies as people in the cities.  There is a definite urban-rural difficulty developing in that connection.  It is a point that must be taken into account.  The loss will be placed across the board in order to get the £20 million and that means that every policy holder in the country will have to carry the load for the difficult situation the law enforcement agencies are not able to handle here.  The only reason they cannot handle it is that they have not got the cash for overtime, they have not the plant, equipment and the necessary manpower.</P>
    <P>To me it would be the most logical <Col N="1093" /> thing in the world for a Government to wish they could say they had the crime wave under control.  It is one area where a Government could come before the people and this House and say they had the crime wave and the level of vandalism under control but that it cost a lot of money.  Does anyone think this side of the House could be antagonistic towards that expenditure?  I doubt it greatly.  Not alone would it be in the best interests of this city but it would be in the best interest of every policy holder and of the tourist industry and it would mean a saving under many different headings.  Surely at the very least that must be attractive to the Government?  Yet, their only response has been that they gave £12 million for overtime in 1985 and that is the end of the road so far as funding is concerned.  If we take that to its final conclusion we see that the £4 million now left to cater for Garda overtime for the rest of this year means one thing: that there will be an escalation of crime in this and in other major cities and that can only lead to bigger claims for malicious injuries compensation.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that there has been an increase in the level of arson.  Arson is crime's big growth area.  It is generally recognised that a high proportion of industrial fires is caused by arson and that can be substantiated by reports written on the matter.  In many of the cases referred annually to the IIRS for investigation it has been found that about 90 per cent contain a fire accelerant, normally petrol.  These are published statistics.  The Minister is aware that arson, and the level of arson, is quite a problem and is on the increase.</P>
    <P>There are many fire tragedies, and we are all aware of the major ones, but the level of fire incidence has increased dramatically. It is important to get this in perspective and this can be done by this statistic: the material fire loss in 1966-67 was £2.5 million and the material fire loss in 1982 was £31.379 million.  That is quite an increase.  The number of deaths in those years has also increased dramatically &mdash; there were 20 deaths in 1966-67 and 47 in 1982.  That is an indication that <Col N="1094" /> fire is a serious matter and if 90 per cent of fires have an element of arson, then this must have a serious impact on the level of malicious damage claims.</P>
    <P>Loss adjusters are recognised as the professionals so far as determining arson is concerned.  They estimated that 40 per cent of all claims in excess of £100,000 involved allegations of malicious intent. There are only three ways a fire can develop&mdash;accidentally, because of negligence, or it can be malicious.  Until the 18th century a person who committed arson got the death penalty.  Admittedly that was 200 years ago but that shows how seriously the legislators at that time considered arson and because it is on the increase, I believe very serious consideration must be given to malicious damage claims.</P>
    <P>The innocent victims &mdash; the property owners &mdash; have no say in this.  They are not negligent.  The fire is not accidental; it is malicious.  I do not see why they should be penalised for something over which they have no control.  That is exactly what this legislation seeks to do. It seeks to transfer the responsibility for malicious injuries claims and compensation from the Exchequer to the individual and his insurer.</P>
    <P>Insurability is very important in the case of the agricultural sector, and in particular agricultural property.  Very little reference has been made to this. This has always been a difficult area.  It is not as prevalent now perhaps as in the past, but land agitation is not unknown in this country and must always be a consideration in a major agricultural economy.  This was not even referred to by the Minister despite the fact that over the years malicious injuries claims so far as agricultural property is concerned have been a very big contributor to the overall demand made on local authorities.  It would be foolish because there has been a diminishing demand to ignore the possibility of the recurrence of malicious damage to agricultural property.  Farmers are particularly vulnerable in this area.</P>
    <P>There is not a great tradition among farmers of covering themselves adequately by insurance.  In difficult <Col N="1095" /> times, after hard winters and hard springs, it would not be one of their priorities to be insured to the maximum necessary to give them proper cover. Overnight a farmer can face ruin with the malicious destruction of farm machinery, crops or stock.  It is virtually impossible to protect farm property against malicious attacks because a farmer who is known to be the object of malicious attacks finds it extremely difficult, if not impossible, to get any commercial insurance cover against the recurrence of such attacks. This is a vulnerable person so far as insurance cover is concerned.</P>
    <P>Compensation for malicious damage is not exclusive to Ireland, as seemed to be suggested in the last part of the Minister's contribution.  Various legislative instruments exist in other jurisdictions to provide compensation for malicious injuries in certain circumstances &mdash;&ldquo;certain circumstances&rdquo; being the operative phrase. It is not quite true to say that we are out of step with every other EC jurisdiction, and consequently that it would be just as well to throw overboard what we have, irrespective of whether it is useful.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn:</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps Deputy Taylor will give me the same support and say that I might have gone to some trouble to research this.  It will be very difficult, if not impossible, to cover the liability being created now exclusively by ordinary commercial general insurance.  Insurers will be slow to consider underwriting certain risks, particularly to property which has been established as the object of malicious attack.  This is one of the key, central issues.  There are objects of certain types of property &mdash; and even certain individuals so far as the farming community and the business community are concerned &mdash; which seem to attract malicious injury.  To say to those people suddenly that we are no longer providing for protection, security and compensation if attacks persist is grossly irresponsible and not giving fair play to the individuals involved.  The Government know full well that once they pull this cover away the insurance industry will not be anxious to take on loss makers that they can <Col N="1097" /> establish from their experience as guaranteed loss leaders.  Consequently, those individuals will be without insurance cover, and, if they are lucky enough to get underwriters to take liability at all, it will be at such enormous cost that it will result in further closures and job losses The owners of properties in high violence areas and high incidence burglary areas are already finding it difficult to get suitable insurance cover.  Now they will find it impossible due to the reluctance of insurers to quote or, if quoted, they will find that the premiums demanded are totally unacceptable.</P>
      <P>That has been confirmed by the leaders in the insurance industry.  They know full well that the demands they are making now in order to maintain their solvency margins and in order to keep their reserves in line with the certificate of licence issued by the Department promoting this legislation will mean they have to put more and more money by to meet the escalating claims.  The only way they can get that is from two sources, from premium income or their investment income.  Invariably now the premium income of the insurance industry has to be topped up from their investment income each year and the investment income is decreasing and diminishing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor:</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn:</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, they always claimed back but the local authority was involved for only 20p in the £ anyway against their rating, and of course they claimed back. Now they will not be claiming back.  They will be putting it onto the general insurance policy holders and not on a selective basis.  They will be putting it on the general body of policy holders, and that includes everybody no matter in what part of the country you live.  Even though the level of incidence of malicious damage may well be nil where the Minister <Col N="1098" /> of State comes from, his neighbours will have to pay the tax burden of increased punitive premiums because of this legislation.</P>
      <P>The only other area it can come from is investment income.  While that is being kept up at a reasonable level, it is being kept up there only by increased money being put on reserve.  What with decreasing interest rates it means that they are finding the reserving more difficult each year.  Certainly we want no more insolvencies in the insurance industry.  We have had two pieces of emergency legislation here that the good Deputy Mervyn Taylor was very eloquent on at the time, and I do not think that we will have to endure that again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn:</NameTxt>
      <P>He is being provocative, but I like it.  He can tell us all the good reasons that he thinks our two major insurers got into difficulty in the past few years.  He has told us anyway, but nobody believes him.  If people had believed him they would have taken up suggestions he made, but they have been at pains to tell the good Deputy Mervyn Taylor that he does not understand the niceties of the insurance industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We do not want insolvency in the insurance industry.  That industry are not going to take on the loss leaders.  They will be reluctant to take on this extra liability <Col N="1099" /> cover.  The underwriters will say: &ldquo;If the Government are washing their hands of the innocent victims of malicious injury compensation claims, then we will provide the cover at a price.&rdquo; Only one sector can take up that price and that is existing policy holders.  It is a little unfair of the Government, when they cannot put their own House in order in the enforcement of law and order with the level of crime and vandalism, to pass on glibly, for the sake of their book-keeping Exchequer exercise of getting the balance of £20 million extra into the funds, all that extra hardship and those extra job losses and business closures on the unfortunate commercial sector.</P>
    <P>The existing picture in some city centre areas is that commercial properties are being devalued as well as being uninsured. Jobs are being lost.  Recent interviews on the national TV network have established that normal living is being disrupted due to the unbridled vandalism and racketeering in some city areas at this time.  Nobody denies that that is the case, still the Government follow their policies relentlessly.  There are areas where the rule of law does not apply, and there is no point in hoping that law and order breakdown will go away.  Unfortunately, that has been the policy adopted by the Government recently.  The resources must be given to the Garda to restore normal living patterns in these areas. Only then will insurers regain confidence in covering liability in those areas.</P>
    <P>The insurance industry has no objection at all, no reluctance to taking on extra cover.  That is their business by way of getting increased premium income, but they can do that successfully and stabilise premiums only if they are guaranteed a reasonable level of law enforcement.  City centre traders are fearful for their future, safety and commercial viability.  Asking them to negotiate their own protection with a reluctant insurance industry is grossly irresponsible at this time.  It is also playing into the hands of the protection racketeers who see a ready made opportunity to practise <Col N="1100" /> their extortion rackets on the unprotected business sector.</P>
    <P>For years there has been agitation for the repeal of the criminal injuries code. Certain interdepartmental committees sat on it &mdash; some of them up to 20 years ago, and that was the last time they sat on it &mdash; but there have been many references to it since then.  Of course, they listed many of the reasons that it was necessary to maintain the criminal injuries code.  Many cases were made as to why it should be transferred to the insurance industry because it was felt by some that it was an insurance matter.  Perhaps it is, but not in the circumstances that exist at this time because of the hardship it will inflict on certain sectors who cannot bear the demand.</P>
    <P>Local authority members will confirm that most of the arguments have been in favour of shifting the responsibility from local authorities to the State.  That has been the thrust of the argument for many years and I support it.  It should also have been contemplated now because it would relieve many local authorities who have been beggared by cuts in Government funding and would have put the onus of responsibility on the Government to produce the circumstances and the climate where they would not have to pay the sum of £20 million.  The Government can save this sum any time they like when they get the crime rate figures down to the levels of 1976, reduce the figures for arson and malicious injuries claims.  The Government will not then have to meet the compensation from which they are now running away.</P>
    <P>There is general acceptance that the malicious injuries code should stay.  This has been expressed not just on this side of the House but from Government backbenchers. They berate Government legislation, but when it comes to voting they merrily support the Government.  I wish they would stay out of the House instead of contributing in that way because they are making a nonsense of Government responsibility.  The Government are supposed to bring legislation to the notice of their backbenchers before <Col N="1101" /> they proceed with it but that is a load of bunkum, &mdash; it never happens.</P>
    <P>Because of the nature of the offences arising from the destruction of property the State is the proper authority to discharge the liability and innocent ratepayers should not have to meet the cost of compensation.  Making it a national charge would spread the compensation more evenly and it would not end up as a punitive tax on certain sectors.  Spreading it evenly is the most equitable way of dealing with any national charge.  The Government are not responsible for anything in so far as the final load is concerned although they always had measures available to them to reduce it at will if they provided the necessary funding for law enforcement agencies instead of telling them that they would have to introduce a certain type of cost effective policing which is entirely inappropriate to our circumstances.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to statistics in regard to lawlessness.  In the crime report for 1984, figures show that there were 41,003 offences of burglary, aggravated burglary, robbery, arson and serious malicious damage to property.  The detection rate was 30 per cent.  In 1980, the figures was 24,878 and the number of offences detected was 10,246.  Of that total number, 21,841 offences, or 53.3 per cent of all the offences under burglary, aggravated burglary and the others to which I referred were committed in the Dublin metropolitan area.  In 1984 there were 2,655 cases of malicious damage of which 189 were cases of arson and only 49.5 per cent were detected.  In 1983 there were 172 cases of arson, the equivalent of an increase of 9.9 per cent on the previous year.  The problem is escalating, which means that the level of compensation claimed is also rising.  The vast number of these cases took place in the Dublin metropolitan area and it is responsible for 57.8 per cent of the total crime in the State.  Yet the Government are unable to cope with the level of crime in the whole country let alone on their own doorstep in Dublin where more than half of the crime is committed.  That is where the biggest clawback in the funding of overtime <Col N="1102" /> is concerned.  It makes no sense.  All these matters are under the direct control of the Government; and, if compensation of £20 million has been paid in malicious injuries claims, only one group are responsible, apart from those who commit the crimes, the Government, for not taking effective measures which have been preached <i>ad nauseam</i> on both sides of the House and also by Deputy Taylor on occasions.  He preaches but, alas, he does not vote against those who are contributing to the situation.</P>
    <P>The Government have a case to answer in so far as the present level of lawlessness is concerned.  It is nonsense to talk about the reduced rate of indictable crime when you consider the base on which statistics are formed.  Each year since 1978 there has been a dramatic yearly increase in indictable crime.  Until the downward trend reaches the figure for 1978 and reduces further, we cannot report improvement or remain complacent about the crime figures.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor:</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the figures did not rise during the Fianna Fáil years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy seeks to provoke me but his provocation is ill-timed because he is participating as a member of one of the Government parties that is overseeing the greatest levels of crime and lawlessness since the State was founded.</P>
      <P>We must remember that there were 99,727 indictable offences recorded in 1984, 12 per hour every day of the year. That is a frightening statistic because it means that in the hour I have been speaking 12 such offences have been committed, half of them in this city.  When you put that into perspective you get some idea of the level of lawlessness which exists.  Things could be improved if the proper plant, equipment and manpower were made available by a Government which understood or cared about the problem.  Fewer claims would be made for compensation which would get across the House support for the measures taken to bring that situation about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been a marked increase in <Col N="1103" /> the number of aggravated burglaries in which firearms were involved, 1,129, to be precise, in 1984.  Of that figure, 440 involved firearms.  Armed bank raids increased by 50 per cent last year.  These are staggering statistics for a small country with a scattered rural population with one-third of the population in this city, and simply means that the law enforcement agencies are unable to cope with crime much of which is centred on the capital city.  Let us take a look at the statistics in so far as stolen property is concerned and that which is recovered, because while it might not be substantial at least it should be referred to.  In 1984, the last year for which the crime statistics are available to us, so far as property taken with violence is concerned, there were 31,903 cases and the value of property involved was £21,693,624; the number of larcenies in that year was 49,141 and the value of the property involved was £12,780,628.  The grand total of cases is approximately 81,000 and the grand total value of property about £34.5 million.  The total recovered was just £2,572,524.  Seventy five per cent of the cases and the property involved go undetected or unrecovered.  It can certainly be said that crime does pay in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Transferring the liability costs of the whole code to the State would have many advantages.  As a levy on general taxation it would be a cheap form of insurance against certain risks, many of which are normally not covered by insurance anyway.  Many of the cases we will be talking about here henceforth, so far as the statistics in the Blue Book for insurance companies each year is concerned, will have a new column.  So we will see that this area of cases and classes that had not been covered in the past will now have to be taken on board by the insurance industry and would simply mean a tiny sum on the individual for what is a general crime against society anyway.  Any malicious injury is no more and no less than that.  It also relieves the anxiety of persons who cannot arrange or cannot afford the insurance premiums to <Col N="1104" /> provide the necessary cover.  It seems the fairest system possible that individuals are indemnified against damage in circumstances over which they have no control. What is now proposed is a money saving exercise for the Government. They are simply transferring the cost to the unfortunate taxpayer and insurance policy holder and doing it in a selective fashion, taking no cognisance of the taxpayer's ability to pay and seeking to convey Government lack of responsibility in the matter.</P>
    <P>This legislation is ill-timed.  Whatever case might have been made for it in a time of peace and security and stability on the streets, in the times we now live in it seems inappropriate.  The Minister's argument has been poorly made and it has not been convincing.  Anybody taking an objective view of what the Minister said in his very short statement, which will involve £20 million extra being placed as a burden on the backs of smallholders, car owners and business people, would say that a better ministerial or bureaucratic effort is warranted.  That is sadly lacking in this case.</P>
    <P>In simple political terms the Government do not deserve to get this legislation through.  Perhaps the Minister is keeping his best wine until last, for his summing up and the Committee Stage.  I think not, because most of his speech has been a Committee Stage response in that he has taken many of the sections individually and made his case.  I am somehow motivated to the opinion that this was hastily done and in the support of some commitment or political arrangement and was not really seen as in the best interests of the country at large.  In conclusion, I must support our spokesman, Deputy Woods. We will have to resist this legislation and put it to the test.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor:</NameTxt>
      <P>I just want to make a few brief statements about this Bill to abolish the malicious injuries scheme.  The purpose of it is to relieve taxpayers generally of this burden which has been a rather strange and anomalous charge upon them for quite a considerable number of years. It is interesting to look back at the origin <Col N="1105" /> of the malicious injuries scheme and how it came about that this peculiar form of imposition was levied in Ireland.  The origins of it are, of course, well known and it makes it all the more strange to see Fianna Fáil opposing this legislation.  It was a punitive imposition on the people of an area where Republican activists had been fighting and causing damage in the cause of their fight during the years prior to 1916.  The British authorities decided that, if the residents of Trim, County Meath, were causing damage, they could enjoy themselves there and they would put a rate for malicious injuries on the residents of Trim, County Meath, so that they themselves could pay for the damage done rather than having it paid for by the British Exchequer.  Therein lies the origin of the malicious injuries scheme which we are now considering.  That has continued, and it is because of those peculiar origins that this malicious injuries scheme is peculiar to Ireland.</P>

      <P>The good Deputy Flynn, sound Republican that he is, should know that the origins of the malicious injuries code were as a punitive measure on the Irish people to punish areas of Republican support by saying that, if the Republicans cause damage in an area then they, through their rates in the area where those people came from, will pay for it. <Col N="1106" /> This was a British institution and that is the origin of it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor:</NameTxt>
      <P>That is why we have had this system in Ireland and there is nothing comparable to it in the United Kingdom or anywhere else that I know of.  This system has grown to be a part of the landscape over very many years.  But it has always been a rather strange feature of the Irish legal and local authority legal system.  It has all been very strange and it is high time that it was re-examined and that is the reason for the measure.  Is there any particular reason the malicious injuries code of itself should be singled out for the attention and liability of the ratepayers of an area or the taxpayers? One might say that if property is stolen from one that too should be paid for by the ratepayers of an area or by taxpayers generally.  But nobody suggests that. Nobody suggests that we should have a compensation system of no fault if somebody sustains injuries and that ratepayers or taxpayers generally should provide for that.  So it is an anomalous situation that should not continue in a Republican country.  Its origins are suspect and it cannot be maintained in the present situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to say a brief word about the position of the insurance companies. They have insured people all along against malicious injury and have charged premiums for this.  The good Deputy Flynn, spokesman for his party on matters of insurance, has researched this topic very well, back to 1965.  He knows that his friends, the insurers, have charged substantial premiums, notwithstanding the fact that they have the benefit of the malicious injuries code behind them. They took in these premiums charged at an appreciable and increasing rate over the years.  When the malicious injury took place they compensated the person involved, but they then proceeded to recoup what they had paid out from the ratepayers of Dublin, Cork, Mayo, or whatever area was involved.  They had it both ways. I do not believe for one moment that <Col N="1107" /> the pitch of premiums that the insurers provided for in any way took cognisance of the fact that they would recoup from the ratepayers of the area in which the malicious damage and injury took place.</P>

      <P>When this Bill goes through in the fullness of time, which no doubt it will notwithstanding the contributions and the continuation of the debate on the Bill for perhaps another day, there will be a responsibility on the Government and on the Minister to watch carefully what becomes of insurance premiums in this field and to ensure that there is no undue escalation of premiums on account of the abolition of this scheme, because the premiums are already charged for.  I am not by any means satisfied that an adequate degree of supervision has been exercised over the years over the activities of the insurance companies.  There is, or is supposed to be, vested in the Minister a general supervisory function over those activities; but, certainly, our experiences in this field would indicate that it has not worked very well.  We have seen substantial losses accruing to the taxpayers generally through the activities of the ICI arising out of the failure of the Department to exercise that supervisory function in an adequate manner.  Perhaps that was not their fault; that I do not know.  Whether it was their fault or not, the fact remains that substantial losses have already accrued to taxpayers due to the failure of the ICI &mdash; I shall say nothing about the PMPA &mdash; and further losses will yet accure to the taxpayers from this source.  For some people the withdrawal of the facility of recouping malicious injury losses from the local authority will present a difficulty.  I concede that.</P>

      <P>Nonetheless, that does not affect the generality of the proposition that the need to continue with the scheme <Col N="1108" /> exists, or that the scheme is fair or is appropriate.  It behoves the Government to ensure, in consultation with the local authorities, that at least one category of people, namely, local authority tenants, are considered in a special way.  They for the most part are not aware of the risks they run in so far as insurance, or lack of it, is concerned.  I see no reason why the local authorities should not organise some mutual inter-insurance arrangement for local authority tenants and tenant purchasers, which would cover them in particular.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor:</NameTxt>
      <P>The final point I want to make on that matter is that it would have been a better idea to have phased it out, rather than abolishing the scheme in one fell swoop, having regard to the fact that it has existed for so many years.  That should have been done many years ago when the good Deputy Flynn's party were in office and even beyond that.</P>

      <P>It would have been better to have phased the scheme out perhaps over a number of years to give people an opportunity to attune to a new situation.  I agree that there has to be a new situation &mdash; it is fair that there should be &mdash; to relieve taxpayers of the burden of the £20 million, which is increasing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Foley:</NameTxt>
      <P>The malicious injuries scheme affects every local authority and costs approximately 20p in the £.  This charge should be removed from them. The local authorities are limited already by the fact that only approximately 20 per cent pay rates and this is a further burden.  The removal of this scheme, saving approximately £20 a year, will necessitate substantial extra insurance and business people can no longer afford insurance cover.  They have been faced with this problem over the last three to four years.  Car insurance costs are now escalating out of all proportion.  In the case of vandalised cars and the effects of joyriding, what will happen now?  One must consider that in the city and throughout the country schools are being vandalised and community organisations <Col N="1110" /> and churches attacked.  How will insurance cover be obtained in those cases? Up to the moment claims in these cases could be made under the malicious injuries scheme.  The local authorities cannot continue to cope with malicious injury claims.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann deplores the appallingly high level of unemployment among young people; condemns the Government for their failure to provide adequate employment opportunities for them and calls on the Government to undertake immediately a comprehensive programme of measures to deal effectively with this emergency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Never in the history of the State has the problem of youth unemployment been as great as it is at present.  According to the Minister's figures today there are 230,357 people unemployed.  Of those, 70,597 people are under 25 years of age.  In the lifetime of this Government at least 50,000 people have left this country in forced emigration because they have no choice due to the lack of employment opportunities at home.  We have had from this Government many pious platitudes. We have had from the parties in this Government many promises, one of which is stated in the document <i>Jobs for</i><Col N="1111" /><i>the Eighties</i>, a Fine Gael document outlining their policy in October 1982.  Probably the greatest indictment of all is the first paragraph of the Joint Programme for Government in which the incoming Government stated that a figure of 170,000 people unemployed at the time was a totally unacceptable figure and the the major priority of the new Coalition Government was to tackle that problem and to have that figure reduced.</P>
    <P>We now look back on that promise and on the way in which they attempted to solve that problem.  The answer is to be found in the statistics which I place before the House this evening.  There are 230,000 people out of work.  One could easily add another 50,000 people who left the shores of this country.  Add to that a further 45,000 people whom I do not consider to be employed.  They are participating in short-term employment schemes at a very high cost to the taxpayer. The PAYE taxpayer has made a very significant contribution towards solving the unemployment problem, significant in that the taxpayer has contributed £300 million since the inception of the 1 per cent employment levy.  This money was paid in good faith to a Government who, it was intended, would proceed with providing sustainable jobs.  This must be the greatest scandal of money wasting in the history of the State.  Can the Minister for Labour tell us what number of sustainable, economic jobs now exist as a result of the expenditure of that money?  What we found is that the Government, in order to try to decrease the level of people on the unemployment register, have literally put those young people into any kind of what I describe as a graveyard job in order to keep them off the unemployment register.  Consequently, over the last number of years we have had a major plank in the Government's job creation policy amounting simply to putting young people into short-term, six month employment schemes and giving them £35 or £40 per week.</P>
    <P>A survey, which I will refer to further in a moment, only out this week tells us <Col N="1112" /> that 57 per cent of long-term unemployed young people have received between £31 and £40 a week and 30 per cent have received less than £30 a week.  In other words, 87 per cent of the long-term unemployed have been in receipt of less than £40 per week.  They have gone from one scheme to another.  When the frustration sets in they have gone to the boat. It has to be the saddest mark that this Government have left on the country.  It is a mark that I believe is completely unacceptable when one considers the promises which were made at the outset.</P>
    <P>It is important to point out that it is possible to create worth-while sustainable jobs.  There is no reason why with the proper policies &mdash; I will outline Fianna Fáil's policy, to get employment moving again, towards the end of my speech &mdash; the difficulties that have been created cannot be overcome.  The problem with this Government is that they have created a hostile environment for economic expansion.  They have simultaneously increased taxation and reduced capital expenditure.  Through their borrowing policies they have kept interest rates artifically high.  They have contributed more than any other Government to the high cost of inputs such as electricity, transport, telecommunications and so on.</P>
    <P>On the other side of the scale they have been negligent in their efforts to try to encourage investment.  The figures which I will now give are a clear indication of that.  They are the estimated figures for the public capital programme for 1986. They show that the capital investment in agriculture decreased in value by 59 per cent since 1980.  Those are the Government's figures.  They show that the capital invested in industry has decreased in value by 39 per cent since 1980. They show that the capital invested in fisheries has decreased by a massive 60 per cent since 1980 and the capital investment in transport has decreased by 31 per cent since 1980.  That is the clearest set of figures which can be put forward to show the way in which the Government have totally neglected their portfolio for <Col N="1113" /> investment in the vital areas for job creation. There is no need for me to say anything further.  I ask the Minister to explain to this House why the Government found it necessary to cut back in the most vital area of the economy which I have just mentioned.</P>
    <P>It is interesting that the one or two good developments that this Government have brought about for capital investment have been sadly neglected. The venture capital scheme, which is basically a good idea but is much too restrictive, is the kind of scheme that can do much for investment in industry and, if it was further developed, in the other areas also.  A tax amnesty for tax evaders who are prepared to invest money in such areas as industry would be a very progressive step.  All politicians know that there are millions of pounds under the beds both inside and outside this country because it is simply not wise to invest it legally.  The black economy is rampant and this Government's policies have assisted in the black economy.</P>
    <P>There are numerous other areas which I do not have time to go into this evening. The most serious problem created by the lack of employment opportunity is emigration. It is nothing short of a scandal that so many young people have found it necessary to leave this country to find employment.  The figures are startling. Today I spoke on the telephone with Fr. Bobby Gilmore who is in charge of the Irish Centre in London.  What he had to say was nothing short of alarming.  He said that last Saturday 25 young people were turned away from the Irish Centre in Kilburn.  In the Irish Centre in Camden Town people were sitting on the steps because they could not get in.  The social workers had an emergency meeting last week because of the magnitude of the problem which is now facing them due to the numbers of young people in England who cannot find adequate accommodation or employment.  He said that they are overworked and cynical.  That is where the problem of Irish unemployment is being faced up to.  That is where the Government have washed their hands of the problems caused by their lack of <Col N="1114" /> initiative in creating employment.  The situation is not much different in respect of the United States.  The American Embassy gave a figure last year of 5,000 people going out on holiday visas and not returning.  Last Wednesday at 8.30 a.m. I went out to the American Embassy and counted 200 people in a queue waiting for visas.  I hope they were going on holidays. It was quite clear that many of them were going on a holiday which will last for a long time.</P>
    <P>The recent report commissioned by the Irish Youth Centre in London showed some startling statistics as to what is happening to our young people over there. Sixty-one per cent travelled to London alone; 34 per cent had less than £30 on arrival in Britain; 70 per cent had less than £100; 57 per cent had not made definite arrangements for accommodation; 27 per cent had spent some time sleeping rough in London since their arrival; 17 per cent spent their first night sleeping rough; 79 per cent had experienced unemployment since their arrival in London; and of those 81 per cent were currently unemployed compared with 18 per cent who managed to get employment. The Minister can say, as he has done already, that they should not go unprepared.  If they go with less than £30 in their pockets, it says something for their status in life before they left.</P>
    <P>I want to put it to the Minister in the strongest possible terms that the Government have much to answer for to our young people.  Let me say, particularly when our party leader is present, that there are ways of tackling unemployment. Rather than asking Ministers to consider initiatives, as I have done on numerous occasions in the past, tonight I will ask our party leader to consider a number of initiatives which I am quite confident will bring about employment and will be put into action by Fianna Fáil. Before doing so I want to quote from an article written by Seán Lemass in 1961. This is the kind of progressive thinking that is now required to get the country out of the morass it is in.  I quote:</P>
    <P>Some time ago I spoke of making <Col N="1115" /> every Department of the Government into a development corporation in the particular field of national activity entrusted to it.  I had then in mind the bringing about of a change of attitude and outlook amongst civil servants, a new psychological approach to the Government's development responsibilities, rather than matters of organisation, but all experience teaches that the right kind of organisation can help in developing the right attitudes.  Can we feel certain that the present structure of our civil service tends to encourage the right attitude?</P>
    <P>I think it is true to say that in some Government Departments there is still a tendency to wait for new ideas to walk in through the door ... At this time, the positive stimulating attitude of our Department of Finance is a very important factor in the building up of the widely deployed development effort which is now evident.</P>
    <P>There are numerous opportunities. There is the international service industry where prestigious jobs can be created. Yet, we charge firms in this sector 50 per cent corporation tax.  There is the food sector where we have 11 different agencies and four different Ministers making a hash of what are the finest natural resources in the country.  There is massive room for development in this area.  There are other ideas such as the payment of a tax rebate whereby we would give to a two parent family a £6,000 or £7,000 tax rebate over a five year period if one of them leaves employment.  There would be no compulsion on anybody.  It would be a free choice.  We could create an economic, sustainable job at much less cost than we are creating jobs at present.</P>
    <P>The Government are digging a hole for themselves daily.  My advice to them is to fall into that hole and let Fianna Fáil get on with the job of ruling this country.  I want to say in west of Ireland, lingo that the Government have proved to be the most disgraceful shower of &ldquo;Latchikoes&rdquo; who ever had the honour to sit on those benches.  I have to put it in those strong <Col N="1116" /> terms because it is necessary for me to get across to this House the frustration felt by so many thousands of young people at this time, particularly by the many thousands of young people who, unfortunately, are feeling their frustration on the streets of Britain, of New York, Chicago and other US cities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne:</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion so ably put by my colleague, Deputy Fahey. There is no doubt that the Government have failed miserably to respond to the needs of young people.  They have abandoned young people.  They have cast them aside saying: &ldquo;Look after yourselves; we have no interest in you.&rdquo;  The attitude of this inept Government is shameful.  The tragedy of youth unemployment is that we are not just talking about 17 year olds or 18 year olds; we are talking about the age group of 16 to 25 years.  Under this inept Government a generation of highly educated and talented young people have been consigned to the dole queues.  That is the greatest shame of all in a young, growing nation.  It is shameful that the Government should allow this to happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problems of young people have become a talking shop for politicians.  We hear politicians say daily that our young people are our greatest national asset but what are politicians and the Government doing about them?  We have much lip service but no positive action to deal with the real problems facing young people. If one looks at and assesses the election figures over the past three or four years, one will see that young people are not going out to vote.  They are cynical about politicians and political parties.  We must ask ourselves why.  The Government stand accused of creating such cynicism because of their failure to respond to the needs of young people, and particularly in tackling the high levels of unemployment. If one walks the streets and talks with young people about what they feel about Ireland today, one will find them frustrated and disillusioned.  They see politicians as sitting in an ivory tower unaware of the real world which they are facing.  They see us as being incapable of <Col N="1117" /> tackling the problems which are facing them.  The only thing some politicians in this House can talk about is an increase in TDs salaries.  That is not acceptable in this day and age when we have so many young people who have no job and no money in their pockets.  It is shameful that politicians should be talking that way at present.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fahey dealt with the question of emigration.  The number of young people leaving the country at present has been put at 50,000.  Last Easter I was in London with the local GAA club.  I saw for myself the serious situation which exists &mdash; young people without a job, without money in their pockets and nowhere to stay.  The Irish centres are at crisis point and are unable to cater for them.  We must tackle this problem.  It is deplorable that those young people cannot remain in this country and make a living and help to develop this country in the way they would like to see it going in the years ahead.  They are going to America in their thousands, most of them illegally on working holidays and not coming back.  Many GAA clubs and county boards could tell us that the number of players they have transferred in the last year is running into the hundreds mark.  That is proof of the high numbers who are emigrating.</P>
    <P>I have a document which lists 26 training schemes and ten addresses of agencies. That is a duplication of services, a source of confusion to our young people. Those agencies should be under the one umbrella spending moneys where they should be spent, on young people, rather than on the civil service which is full of bureaucracy and red tape and of no advantage to them.  Training schemes are all right in themselves but it is frustrating and disillusioning for young people to spend six months or a year on a training scheme and then have to revert to the dole queues.  What our young people are seeking are long term, sustainable jobs from which they can earn a decent living for themselves and their families.</P>
    <P>There is much talk at present about crime, vandalism and social unrest. There is no doubt that unemployment is <Col N="1118" /> partly responsible for that and for so much disillusionment among young people.  In some families there may be a husband unemployed, with three or four teenage sons or daughters who cannot find work either, which is not good for the home environment.  This Government must be seriously criticised for their inability to provide jobs for young people.  People may contend that it is not possible to provide long term jobs.  I do not subscribe to that viewpoint.</P>
    <P>This Government have failed miserably in the development of our natural resources such as forestry, fisheries, tourism, the building industry and agriculture, using our basic raw materials.  Long term sustainable jobs could be created in those areas for our young people.  The IDA have been involved in many projects over the years and have done a reasonably good job in attracting multinationals here.  Unfortunately, most of those industries are now remaining in their own countries because of job scarcity.  The large investment at present being made in the IDA should be directed at the development of our natural resources thereby creating jobs for our people.</P>
    <P>Agriculture is one sector that has me and, I think, the farming community confused, again because of the Government's refusal to develop that sector.  This means that farmers' sons and daughters are competing with others to obtain scarce jobs.  Agriculture should be the subject of major development, encouraging farmers' sons and daughters to remain on the land and earn a worth-while income.  More importantly, there should be emphasis laid on the development of value-added products, but this Government have shown no interest in that area either.</P>
    <P>There is tremendous potential for development also in the food, fruit and horticultural industries.  We should have an internal agency responsible for the promotion and development of the food processing industry and its value-added products.  The IDA attract industries here, Córas Tráchtála promote exports, but we need an internal agency for the development of agriculture and the food <Col N="1119" /> processing and horticultural sectors, where there is tremendous job potential.</P>
    <P>Because of the inability of this Government to tackle the unemployment problem our young people have three choices open to them &mdash; first, they can go on the dole; second, they can emigrate; or, third, participate in a training scheme. But their chances of securing long term, sustainable jobs are very slim and it appears that this Government have no interest in their creation.  We see young people today of 21 or 22 years, married with a family, who never had the dignity of a job.  That is an appalling environment in which to rear young children.  Certainly, it is not in the best interests of proper family development in the future. That is occasioned by the lack of initiative and policies on the part of this Government.</P>
    <P>One might have expected that the Labour section of this Government would have been interested in our young people, the people they always tell us, prior to general elections, they care about, the unemployed and poorer sections. During the lifetime of this Government the Labour Party element have shown no interest whatsoever in our young people or in the creation of jobs now or in the future.  Young people are disillusioned, being frustrated in every attempt they make to acquire a job.  With so many resources put into educating our people from the mid-sixties, now, when we should be reaping the rewards of such investment, it is unfortunate that our young, well educated people are forced to emigrate.  They want to remain and work here.  They want the dignity of a job.  Yet they must leave, go abroad to earn a decent living.  They will not return, bearing in mind our economy, taxation system and environment generally, because it would not reward them.  It is a shame that the people the taxpayers' money went into educating cannot remain and earn a decent living for themselves and their families.</P>
    <P>The Government tell us that they are doing their best with the various training schemes in operation.  There was the 1 <Col N="1120" /> per cent youth levy.  I believe that the PAYE workers &mdash; it was they who, in the main, paid the levy, because it was stopped from their income at source &mdash; have been conned.  They willingly donated 1 per cent of their salaries, thinking that it would create long-term jobs for young people.  Instead the moneys were expended to prop up different Departments that had been funded by the Exchequer heretofore.  That has been one of the greatest scandals under this Government &mdash; that money given so willingly was not used for the purpose intended, which was the creation of jobs. Rather it has gone into the Departments of the Environment, Education, Labour, has been lost on the way, and has not provided sustainable jobs.</P>
    <P>One could continue to criticise this Government, but I do not think they pay any attention to such criticism.  They do not have any interest in our young people.  They have adopted monetarist policies.  They do not care about people. They talk about balancing the books. One might have expected that they would have changed some of their policies midstream when they saw the frustration and disastrous consequences of the high unemployment rate among our young people.</P>
    <P>At the next general election I have no doubt but that our young people will show how this Taoiseach and Government have failed them.  They came into office full of promises and ideas <i>vis-á-vis</i> young people.  Somewhere along the road they lost their way, leaving those young people more frustrated and disillusioned than ever.  At the next general election those people will turn in their masses to the Fianna Fáil party to bring about a solution.  As Deputy F. Fahy has pointed out already, we have the policies, we have radical changes and ideas to advance which will afford those young people the dignity of a job, the right to remain at home and develop this nation along the lines we would all like to see in the next decade, if not into the next century.  It is not in the best interests of any country to turn its back on its young people.  That is what this Government have done.  I <Col N="1121" /> believe young people are becoming restless, they want to see the end of the disastrous Cabinet and Government, the Labour Party in particular standing indicated for what they have done to our young people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. Quinn):</NameTxt>
      <P>I was anxious to participate in this debate, even though it was brought forward by Deputy Fahey for the Fianna Fáil Party, presumably in his capacity as spokesman for youth.  I was anxious to hear what Deputy Fahey and Deputy Browne had to say.  I accept that it is part and parcel of the tradition of parliamentary democracy that Opposition Deputies oppose and criticise and make legitimate points through cut and thrust, where those points can be made.  I participated in that process and perhaps on occasions over-indulged myself.  Now that I am on this side of the House, I say that with a little more sorrow than sentiment.  I do not think I ever stood up on the other side of the House and criticised to such an extent without offering any kind of positive alternative. I say that more in sadness than in anger. I do not think I ever tried to make a debate that would not leave the issue somewhat further advanced at the end than it was at the commencement, as perceived by both sides.</P>
      <P>In effect what Deputy Fahey wanted was effectively to raise the issue of migration and particularly emigration.  It is a theme to which he has given a lot of attention, a matter on which he has spoken frequently.  I am delighted he is concerned about this matter but I am saddened that his party have not been as concerned in the past as he is now.  It was not until I became Minister for Labour that a little bit of honesty came into the reality of migration and emigration as it occurs in this country.  It was not in 1982 that people started to emigrate from Galway, nor was it 1972 nor 1952, It was before Deputy Fahey and I were born.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I found to my surprise that there was a body called COWESA &mdash; the Council for the Welfare of Emigrant Services Abroad &mdash; in the Department of Labour. <Col N="1122" /> It consists of about 21 members, most of them clerics and all, with the exception of one, living in Ireland.  They advise the Government of the day on how to spend the miserable £38,000 on welfare services for Irish emigrants abroad, effectively in England.  I read the file and looked into the history of it.  I found petition after petition, letter after letter from Irish people in Britain going back over the years to a time when even the present Fianna Fáil Leader was a backbench councillor in Dublin Corporation.  These were letters and petitions asking the Irish Government of the day to do something about welfare services.  People are born Irish first and take on their political allegiances second.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not interrupt Deputy Fahey.  I will come to that question and ask whether he really wants to stop people going abroad.  Deputy Fahey has collected facts and figures from Bobby Gilmore and others.  These people are now in a position to talk to him because they have resources and facilities which this Government unashamedly and without conditions gave to emigrant services abroad to provide services for those people who unwillingly or unpreparedly left this island.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I began my contribution by departing from the speech I had prepared because of the frequency with which Deputy Fahey returned to this theme.  Emigration is a dreadful problem that has afflicted this island for many years. Nobody denies that.  No political party has a vested interest in it and it is not in the interest of any political party to stir the pot in relation to that matter.  All of us are against emigration and trying to take measures to counteract it.  It behoves us in honesty to recognise that it has existed for a long time and the victims of emigration should not be ignored because we are against the phenomenon itself.  If Deputies opposite are not happy with what this Government have been doing in this respect I suggest that they talk to <Col N="1123" /> Fr. Billy Gilmore and the others, as well as the Council for Emigrant Services Abroad run by the Irish Hierarcy, and get their views on this matter.  In the past three years we have increased by about 300 per cent the amount of money available to help those people who have emigrated against the advice of people here.  In some cases they would have been better served if they remained here.</P>
    <P>I should like to stop the kind of emigration Deputy Fahey is talking about but if he had done his research properly he would have found that under the career break system which we have introduced since we came into office to provide the kind of flexibility he talks about &mdash; and not, incidentally, at the price of £6,000 per person &mdash; about 40 per cent of those who take a career break leave this country. Are they emigrants?</P>

      <P>I think there is a certain anxiety to perform in view of who is in the House.  Deputy Fahey was right to introduce the factors he did.  I do not disagree with any of the things he said.  I am simply saying we should start to look at those facts and separate the real problem from the gross numbers.  We have real problems and tragically they have not been addressed in the contributions from either Deputy Fahey or Deputy Browne.  It is in the interest of everybody, particularly those who are forced to emigrate, that we have an honest debate about the numbers.  I have attempted to engage in such a debate, not just in this House but elsewhere, and I am prepared to do so again and to make all the facts and figures available to the Opposition, so that we can begin to focus on the areas of real problems rather than on some areas which are not as problematic as they appear at first glance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an extraordinary performance by the Opposition.  Two Deputies opposite came into the House &mdash; it may be their immaturity as young Deputies &mdash; and lectured on impartial facts and put forward suggestions as to what should be done but when they were challenged they could not control themselves sufficiently to listen to the entire <Col N="1126" /> argument, even if they reject that argument.</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil in their motion call on the House to deplore the appallingly high level of unemployment among young people; to condemn the Government for their failure to provide adequate employment opportunities for them and to call on the Government to undertake immediately a comprehensive programme of measures to deal effectively with this emergency.  I know that argument by comparison is not very attractive to Deputies opposite but, without attempting to say that our level of youth unemployment is acceptable in any shape or form, I must point out that it is not by accident that, while this State has had the highest level of unemployment among people over the age of 25 in the EC, we are the fourth lowest in terms of youth unemployment, for those under 25, in the EC.  On previous occasions we were the lowest but the advent of Spain and Portugal has altered those statistics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the figures are appallingly high &mdash; I accept the criticism of Fianna Fáil in regard to them &mdash; they should be set in context relative to other European countries that have had a longer period of economic independence and greater resources available to them.  If Deputies opposite wish to make a judgment about what can be done they should look at the figures in the context of other countries. I accept that the figures are appallingly high; but, relative to other countries, the amount of time various Governments have had to deal with the problem, and the level of resources available to us, they are not as bad as some people argue. They are lower than could reasonably be expected.  If we have the highest level of unemployment for those over 25 one could reasonably assume that we would be at the same end of the league table for under 25s, but the reverse is the position. That has not come about by accident.  We can claim some of the credit, but nobody can claim all the credit for the improvement. The rate of increase in unemployment has been declining during our term in office.  It is a type of negative argument that one does not wish to boast about but <Col N="1127" /> it is a fact and it makes our job a little easier.  We are probably responsible for some of the factors that brought about that reduction but Deputy Haughey, as a former Minister for Finance, will recognise&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;from one year to another was 15.6 per cent, reduced to 8.4 per cent in 1984 and to 6.4 per cent in 1985.  Between May 1985 and May 1986 the gross increase in the total number unemployed was only 3 per cent.  Those figures have to be set against an increase of 27,000 in the labour force between April 1982 and April 1985.  What is disappointing is that we still await the it improvement in young people's employment position which were anticipated last year. The OECD and the ESRI forecast growth rates in the GNP this year of approximately 3 per cent and 4 per cent in 1987.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problem, which was of enormous proportions in terms of the growth of unemployment in the entire labour force, has begun to subside and the figures I have given can be tested by any Member of the Opposition.  Two independent bodies, the ERSI and the international body, the OECD, are suggesting growth rates of the level of 3 per cent and 4 per cent, not sufficient in either 1986 or 1987 to get the levels of employment that we require in a mixed economy - mostly coming from the private sector but, <Col N="1128" /> nevertheless, more positive than we have had in the past.  It is for that reason that the Government have introduced an enormous number of programmes and interventions in the labour market to help young people.  In the past we were criticised for introducing so many programmes. In the course of a debate in the House we were accused of having too many confusing programmes.  We were told that people did not know what to do.</P>

      <P>Earlier Deputy Browne indicated that they were full of bureaucracy, that they were more for civil servants to occupy their time.  He said we needed direct action and not more of those programmes; but then he proceeded to call for the establishment of another agency in relation to agriculture. I am not sure if the Deputy would regard agricultural bureaucrats to be more or less productive than those involved in employment agencies.  The contradiction in Deputy Browne's contribution underpins the fact that Fianna Fáil, tragically for the nation, have not any great ideas other than, as Deputy Fahey couched as a personal view, have a buy-out available for married women to leave the labour market.  He suggested that they should be paid £6,000 over a number of years. Deputy Fahey's option to create more jobs was to buy-out married women.  He suggested one or other of the partners should be bought out; and, as it is the male who earns more than the female in most families, therefore it is reasonable to presume that he is suggesting that the female should be bought out of the labour market at a price of £6,000.</P>

      <P>The suggestion put forward by Deputy Fahey was a personal one.  For many years we have had problems in regard to unemployment of a locational and structural nature.  Youth unemployment reached astronomical proportions in the late seventies and early eighties.  Deputies opposite will recall that they ran a very successful campaign in 1977, complete with pop tunes and teeshirts, on that issue.  At that stage it was emerging that it was a major problem because of the way our population, fortunately for the first time in about 100 years, had at last started to grow in this part of this island.  We established the Youth Employment Agency, a move which was supported by all sides of the House.  Deputy Fahey was correct when he said that the YEA had spent £350 million from the youth employment levy, all of it well spent.</P>

We did not let the so-called staid and stolid civil servants get their hands on it.  We invited people who might have a fresh view.  The Deputy quoted a very illustrious father-in-law, the late Deputy Lemass, in regard to harnessing new insights and energy.  As far back as 1961 he indicated his is disgust of those staid and stolid civil servants.  We avoided those.

For both sides of the House, facts are often hard to accept; but some of us have the courtesy to listen to them and the ability to swallow them.  During a five year period the YEA people made recommendations as to where the money would be spent. Deputy Liam Fitzgerald is an inner city school teacher and knows better than many others where the money should be spent.</P>
      <P>As a consequence of the YEA programmes, we have the lowest level of youth unemployment in Europe relative to our youth population.  It is still not an acceptable performance.  Youth unemployment is still too high, but the programmes that those young people participate in are excellent ones, and I challenge Deputy Fahey to go to any of the young people in those programmes and say: &ldquo;You are not really employed. You are wasting your time.  Come on off that programme.  Why do you not honestly be what you are, unemployed, and go on the register?&rdquo;  I challenge the Deputy to go to Louvain and to talk to young people out in the market places of Europe selling Irish produce on a market of 300 million people and say to them: &ldquo;Listen, you are not real persons, you are not actually getting a training, you are a kind of fudged statistic, you should be at home signing on once a week and declaring that you are unemployed.&rdquo;  This is the logic of what Deputy Browne has been saying.</P>

They sought my advice on it and I said that every Member of the House is a parliamentarian and entitled to the fullest information available.  As Deputy Haughey knows, in other circumstances when AnCO were required for a particular purpose and when advice was sought, I readily gave it so that Deputies on all sides, as members of political parties, would have full access to full advice and information.</P>

      <P>For that reason we have made extra resources available.  We have developed more programmes.  We have made more interventions into youth unemployment. I could give the entire list but I assume Deputies have got it.  I did not expect Deputies opposite to compare our performance with that of their party when in Government.  There is no complacency on this side of the House.  I have never sought to make this issue a political football and I do not propose to begin now. Again, I invite Deputies opposite to make full use of all of the resources of the State available to them as parliamentarians and to inform themselves on the real nature of the debate.  The issue is bigger than all of us.  It began before any of us came into the House and, tragically for the victims, it does not look as if it will be resolved between now and the next election.</P>

      <P>Táimid faoi láthair i dtréimhse cinniúna maidir le óige na tíre.  Tá líon an óige anois ar an bpointe is airde mar chéatadán de iomlán an daonra ná mar bhí sé in am ar bith i stair na tíre.  Ach in ainneoin sin tá díomá agus <Col N="1133" /> easpa dóchais i mease an óige mar nach bhfuil fostaíocht le fáil acu.  Tá méadú fíochmhar ar imirce, ar choirpeachas, ar fhoréigean agus ar mhí-úsáid druganna.</P>
      <P>Seo toradh an díomhaointis agus an éadóchais atá fómharaithe ag polasaí an Rialtais.  Má táimid le dóchas a spreagadh iontu, caithfimid ar dtús athrú a dhéanamh ar an Rialtas agus na polasaithe náireacha atá á gcur i bhfeidhm le blianta beaga anuas.</P>
      <P>The motion before the House depicts very accurately the very serious emergency through the country in relation to youth unemployment and its regrettable corollary in the form of mass youth emigration. When I ponder the question of youth emigration, one of my most abiding memories is the recollection of the number of friends and relatives who found it necessary to take the emigrant boat during those bleak years of the fifties.  The reasons that forced them to leave were many and varied and indeed are not all that dissimilar to the reasons which are forcing increasing thousands of our present young generation to try to seek a living abroad over the last few years.</P>
      <P>It is not just a coincidence that both these periods have been dominated by Coalition Governments.  Then, like now, it was the misfortune of this country to have a Government completely bankrupt of ideas to stimulate an economy crying out for investment.  Then we had a Government incapable of opening factories. Now we have one whose Ministers are tripping over each other to close them down.</P>
      <P>I believe it was D. H. Lawrence who said: &ldquo;The only real tragedy is loss of heart&rdquo;.  It is unpardonable of any Government who, having lost faith in themselves, proceed to destroy the hopes, dreams and legitimate aspirations of the young people.  A Government who do not understand the mistakes of their past are doomed to repeat them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the past four years, this country has sadly witnessed unemployment climbing to almost 250,000, and this graph is still rising.  Penal taxation is stifling investment <Col N="1134" /> and enterprise.  It is forcing many into the black economy and is making emigration the only option for thousands of others.</P>
    <P>Just as Coalitions of the fifties saw emigration as the solution to the unemployment problem, this Government see nothing amoral in foisting the young jobless thousands to the same foreign shores, in many cases young people who are illequipped, unprepared and who are cast as vulnerable fodder for the ruthless commercial interests they inevitably encounter. Every Irish citizen is entitled to claim the right to work in his own homeland and every Irish Government are charged with the responsibility of managing the resources of the country towards that end.  This Government's inept handling of our affairs has rendered this fundamental objective totally unattainable. Surely it represents a crime against the youth of Ireland.</P>
    <P>At present there are at least 60,000 of our young people on the live register.  All of them have actively sought for some sign of hope, some sign of commitment to the provision of jobs in the past few years; but they have been left with their aspirations frustrated and their dreams shattered.  Not taken account of in those figures are the many thousands of our young people who at any one time are involved in training programmes.  At present there are about 45,000 young people involved in training schemes.  We must add to this sad picture the 25,000 to 27,000 of our young people who have been emigrating annually for the past few years.  The total picture represents a serious indictment of this Government and, as has been said earlier, reflects an attitude on the part of the Government of indifference and cynicism towards the needs of young people.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach, in response to Dáil questions from Deputy O'Kennedy and Deputy Frank Fahey on 19 February 1985, refused to accept that there had been any alarming increase in emigration. Yet, the Minister opposite on 3 April 1986 acknowledged total emigration to be 25,000 per year.  Of course, these figures are based only on official <Col N="1135" /> records.  They do not take account of the invisible permanent haemorrhage of unofficial emigration.  It is only fair to say that the Central Statistics Office must have a reliable estimate of the extent of youth emigration and total emigration. Surely it would be a test of the sincerity of this Government if they published the figures in that connection, but they have failed to do this.  The reason is that were they to do so they would bring down on their heads the wrath of the public and the youth of Ireland.</P>
    <P>If the Taoiseach is so smug as to take comfort and consolation, as he has been wont to do recently, in what he describes as a reduction in the rate of increase in unemployment &mdash; if I heard correctly, the Minister opposite also seemed to be taking comfort and consolation from that particular aspect &mdash; he and Ministers should be reminded that their smugness will be at the expense of the 25,000 plus of our young people who will be forced out of Ireland this year in search of jobs.</P>
    <P>Just as the solution to the unemployment problem proved beyond the capability of previous Coalitions, so too has it baffled the present administration.  Now young people are left without hope or opportunity and they have to suffer an increasing uncertainty due to the crisis management of the country.  On this side of the House, we have never believed in or accepted the politics of despair. Consistently we have asserted the potential of our highly educated and flexible workforce not only to come to terms with the microchip revolution but to harness its power and influence its direction. Surely what is required of any Government worth their salt is to charter a course for the national economy towards achieving that objective.  The industrial base throughout the world is ever-changing, with new markets being created.  We must ensure we get our fair share of those markets.</P>
    <P>As everyone knows, this Government are constantly reminding us that taxation levels must remain high in order to pay off our crippling foreign debt, which, by the way, they have succeeded in doubling <Col N="1136" /> since coming into office.  Of course, they will tell us that this tunnel vision approach to solving our problems is working and will work.  Perhaps they fail to recognise that what they see at the end of the tunnel is not the light but an oncoming train.</P>
    <P>Anyone involved in the PAYE system will be all too painfully aware of the difference between gross and take-home pay.  In the past three years we have come to the ludicrous point where a worker can find himself in the highest tax band with an income of just over £10,000 per year. Despite oil prices falling through the floor since last Christmas, we are still in the position here of having the dearest petrol in the EC.  There is no way any economy or any country can continue to sustain such a ridiculously high level of taxation. The burden being carried by the Irish people, both in direct and indirect taxes, is having a devastating and demoralising effect on the country.  It is frightening away huge investment from abroad, it is putting a dreadful damper on the investment potential of our own people and impoverished families are being pushed deeper into the poverty trap.  Last year almost 1,000 businesses went to the wall and the burden of taxation has led to the creation of a hitherto unknown group, namely, the poor middle-class.  We have a rampant black economy.  This Government have succeeded in hammering the building industry.</P>
    <P>What we need urgently is a properly worked out and balanced programme of tax reform, of investment in the building industry and infrastructure and the development of the potential of many or our native industries.  For example, tourism is one of the fastest growing industries worldwide.  Yet, our industry here has been static and in regression in relation to other countries.  Surely nobody has to ask the reason?  We have become an unattractive destination for tourists, who have to pay over £2.80 for a gallon of petrol here and £1.77 in Northern Ireland. The cost factor with reference to indirect taxes is the most important and fundamental factor.  As everyone must know, we have the potential to develop <Col N="1137" /> this industry and the cost factor is a key element.</P>
    <P>Another area that should be developed is that of science and technology.  At present there is an unco-ordinated framework of Government Departments and State agencies who in many important respects are working in conflict with each other.  We need proper co-ordination and a clearly worked out strategy to enable research and development to translate into real jobs.</P>
    <P>Let us be clear what we are talking about.  We are not talking about voluntary emigration; we are talking about forced emigration.  The failure of the Government to create meaningful jobs is causing a massive haemorrhage and that situation will continue.  We talk about training schemes &mdash; they have some limited value but they do not address the fundamental problems.  This Government stand indicted before the people because of their abject failure to provide leadership and meaningful government. They seem to have lost hope not only in the country but in themselves.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Labour (Mr. Kenny) Enda Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Labour (Mr. Kenny):</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, accept the first part of this motion: that Dáil Éireann deplores the appalling high level of unemployment among young people.  I listened to some of the contributions made by my colleagues across the House about young people, employment, unemployment, emigration trends and so on.  I gathered that Fianna Fáil seem to be against all training schemes.  It is an accepted fact that no Government ever managed to create the number of jobs we all would like.  For years we exported brawn and built every city in the United States and the United Kingdom.  In those days we had a different type of emigration.  I am not saying that emigration should be accepted, but it is a fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Eighty five per cent of our education system is as good as one would find anywhere. I accept that there must be a very close link between the Departments of Education and Labour in the context of developing the attitude many Deputies <Col N="1138" /> have mentioned &mdash; increasing personal motivation, increasing personal and national pride, increasing productivity and raising the competitive level of Irish workers as against their European and international counterparts.  Responsibility for developing this proper attitude lies with parents, teachers and different organisations.  It has been my view for the past number of years that it is only when Irish people are exposed to the competitive instinct in Britain, on the Continent and in the United States that their inherent ability comes to the fore.  We have made it to the top in every walk of life outside Ireland, but we have not managed to do that here.  Perhaps our insularity is a disadvantage.  I accept that our attitude towards work, motivation, the development of the country and pride in our nation is not what it should be.  For that reason developments are taking place in the Department of Education.</P>
    <P>Tourism is one of the fastest growing industries in the world.  CERT have a 100 per cent placement of those who have completed their in-service or new training courses.  I was interested in Deputy Fahey's contribution.  In December 1974, in the Industry and Commerce magazine he said that full employment could become a reality but only if this country were managed as Ireland Incorporated. He then mentioned the concept under which he could see the Government operating. He said reform would involve decentralisation of the service, greater co-ordination between Departments to avoid duplication, the introduction of modern management techniques, giving responsibility and accountability and the examination of work practices to the applications of work study and industrial psychology and so on.  These are all very important matters, but training schemes, whether they be run by AnCO, CERT or the Youth Employment Agency, are attempts by the Government to meet a demand.  This demand will lessen in the younger age group because in the next few years the emphasis will be on the 25 to 44 age group.  In the next ten years there will be 80,000 fewer pupils attending <Col N="1139" /> primary education.  That will create difficulties in terms of pupil-teacher ratio, perhaps for the better, but there are also implications for the building programme and the schools.</P>
    <P>As Minister of State at the Department of Education I agree that there must be a link between that Department and the training agencies to develop a proper attitude and motivation which can only produce greater productivity, greater competitiveness and a greater awareness that we live not in a small island but in a bigger and more competitive world.  If we develop this attitude we will come out on top.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen:</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been listening to the Minister telling us to take our medicine but if he waits a few minutes he might be able to take some medicine himself.  He came here quoting statistics but I will quote some of my own.  First, while acknowledging that unemployment is a global problem, a European problem and a developing country problem, the Irish unemployment problem &mdash; an area for which he has responsibility &mdash; is particularly severe relative to other EC countries.  In 1982 the Irish unemployment rate was 12.8 per cent compared with an average of 9. per cent in EC countries and 9.5 per cent in the United States.  The EC rate has since stabilised, while the United States rate has started to decline, but in Ireland unemployment has continued to rise.  End of story.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second point is that last week a report was issued entitled &ldquo;The Young Long-term Unemployed&rdquo;.  The Labour Party continually talk about helping the socially disadvantaged and about their commitment to the poor.  This report, based on a survey carried out in April/May 1985, was issued by the YEA. It says that in the under 25 age group the number registered for more than one year on unemployment has increased fourfold. From April 1980 to April 1985 &mdash; and the Minister was in office for most of that time &mdash; it has risen from 3,800 to 16,300.  A quarter of the long term unemployed left education before they were <Col N="1140" /> 15, half of them left between the ages of 15 and 16, half have no educational qualifications whatsoever, one-third have done their intermediate or group certificates, 11 per cent have their leaving certificate and 0.5 per cent have third level education.  This is the Minister's area of responsibility: we are talking about Labour Party politics.  What do we do for these people?  We put them on the dole and they are paid £29.75 a week on average. Note they do not get the full £31.75; £5 is stopped because their parents feed them while they live at home.  Of those people, 90 per cent are on unemployment assistance.  These are the working class, the people the Minister is supposed to be looking after.</P>
    <P>Third, when the Youth Employment Agency was set up in March 1981 the number of youth unemployed was 36,800, but in May 1986 the number of youth unemployed was 70,597, a difference of 33,800, a 92 per cent increase.</P>
    <P>Fourth, I am prepared to accept that the Minister does not have total control over the manpower policy because it comes within the macro economics sphere, about which I know nothing.  For that reason I am referring to the NESC report on manpower policy.  In 1965 a man called Sean Lemass produced a four page document which could be read in two minutes but which got more people to work than the Minister will get in a generation.  Now we have this glossy report by the NESC.  I have not been in this Dáil for very long but I have an interest in this area because I am the youngest person in the House.  For the last two and a half years the Minister has been promising a manpower policy but we have not seen it yet.  What we have is an NESC report on manpower policy. What does that tell us?  It tells us that the primary deficiency in the manpower policy, an area for which the Minister has responsibility, is the weakness of the Department of Labour, the need to take an active role, a total lack of co-ordination in the Department.  The Minister says he is doing his best but that is not good enough.  The report goes on to say that there is a need to set up a State <Col N="1141" /> manpower agency by merging the activities of existing bodies.  What have we? An extra Youth Employment Agency.</P>
    <P>A young girl came to see me in my clinic and asked me where she would go to get a job.  I told her to go to 50 different places because that would take her a week and would employ her for a week. That is what is happening on the ground. We want one national manpower agency. This is Fianna Fáil policy.  The Minister has had this report on his table for the last four months.  He is monitoring it and listening to the very informed debate in the Dáil.  I understand all that, but will he tell me if this Government are committed to establishing one national manpower agency?  That is all I want to know but we have not heard from him yet.  That was in an Ógra Fhianna Fáil document in 1984.  This proves that young people know something.  The NESC consultants happened to agree with Ógra Fhianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>Secondly, it says that the priorities should be determined by the needs of the target groups rather than the sources of funding.  A little target group in the Minister's political constituency are the long term unemployed.  Since the Government came into office their numbers have increased fourfold.  I refer to people on unemployment assistance.  That is politics, reality.  That is what the Minister has to listen to because that is what the people on the street are saying, and they are sick of it, and young people are sick of it. They would like a little mandate and a little opportunity to give the Government their opinion of how much they are sick of it and we will see how many Labour Party Deputies will be in this House in the next Dáil.  Therefore, let us get away from OECD reports based on 1985 figures.  On the ground there is no growth in this economy this year, and there will not be.  Most people, especially young people, are unemployed.</P>
    <P>We hear that the existing training schemes are adequate and we should not criticise them.  Let me put it to the Minister that Fianna Fáil have brought out a document on science and the new era in technology and the need to create <Col N="1142" /> employment for our young, most computer literate society in the developed world.  What do we do?  We have little or no organised funding for that area.  We are going to bring in a policy to ensure that it is doubled, that we will bring in the third level institutions to help us in research and development, because we realise that over 50 per cent of the people in Japan who are employed have third level education.  A good many of the long term unemployed here will never get third level education.  That is the Minister's constitutency looked after.  He will not have too long more to do it.</P>
    <P>The point I am making is in relation to existing programmes.  I can mention the much vaunted 1984 Youth Employment Agency.  What does my research tell me? It tells me that £25.55 million was spent on secretarial courses.  The 1 per cent youth employment levy, or at least some of it, is going on secretarial courses.  I should not say that because a fair amount of it is going into AnCO.  What did the NESC report about manpower policy say about AnCO?  It said that they regarded with some hesitation the fact that the balance seemed to be in favour of social type skills as distinct from skill oriented training and that a big review in this matter was needed.  In other words, many of the courses they are doing should really be in the Department of Education, in a reformed curriculum system, the extra year in the leaving certificate and so forth.  In other words, the AnCOs of this world are trying to justify their existence.</P>
    <P>State-sponsored bodies and semi-State bodies were set up for one purpose &mdash; to serve the interests of the people, not for their own interests.  Little bureaucracies arise and mini-republics develop.  The Department of Labour, this weak section of manpower policy, do not seem to &ldquo;cop on&rdquo; and so we have a major problem. The Department of Labour, which the Minister is head and for whom he is responsible, have no major policy role.</P>
    <P>Let us come to the programmes we are talking about.  The social employment programme is very good.  People employed by Offaly County Council, one of the counties I represent, will tell you <Col N="1143" /> that 53 per cent of that programme for materials, supervision and equipment is totally inadequate and not worth getting. Things cannot be done properly.  By the way, the voluntary organisations get only 15 per cent under that heading.  We talk about community involvement, participation, self-reliance, get people up off their backsides to help themselves.  The tidy towns committee seek a grant and are told that they will get 15 per cent and to go to the county council, where there is no shortage of engineers but a great shortage of manual workers, and they will get 53 per cent.  The Minister is supposed to be in favour of the old public service.  The number of people on manual work in Offaly County Council dropped by 10 per cent in the last few years.</P>
    <P>We have a social employment scheme and under that scheme people do the work of the people we have made redundant, the permanent workers on Offaly County Council.  A little circular argument goes around and around, and what does the county manager say?  &ldquo;Give me the funds and I will do the work&rdquo;.  That is the old, simple way of doing things. Give the local authorities the funds, trust your local democracy and your local representatives who might know a little more than someone in Mespil Road about what ditch should be cut and what corner should be taken out, and you might get a little value for money.  However, he is told that he cannot do that, he must go to the social employment scheme because there are a few people up there whom we have to keep operating pushing a few pens.</P>
    <P>That is what the people on the street are saying.  It makes no sense.  We have had reviews and papers on manpower policy and the NESC report.  I did not bring them all in because I would need a lorry for that.  The ordinary people in the street, whom I know the Minister wishes sincerely to represent, are not interested. They want action and to see commonsense.</P>
    <P>One of the arguments in this report about young unemployed people is that four-fifths of their parents happen to be <Col N="1144" /> unemployed as well.  Therefore, not only are they in a poverty trap; they are in an unemployment trap and cannot get out of it.  This Government are doing nothing for them, and the Minister comes in and quotes statistics until he is blue in the face to the effect that the rate of increase in unemployment is decreasing.  I know where he got that one.  It came from Deputy Garret FitzGerald who said that the rate of increase of public indebtedness is decreasing, and we end up with £12 billion in 1982 and £22 billion now. That sort of logic bamboozles people, but it does not confuse them.  They are not stupid.  The ordinary man knows that a fellow who does painting or some menial job gets £75 for that and does nothing for the other two and a half days.  Another fellow, who works five days a week and knows the job because he has been there for 40 years and knows where the problems are, will get £100 for those five days.</P>
    <P>People are beginning to wonder what is going on.  To the ordinary man in the street and to me it does not add up. Thanks be to God, I was blessed with a little education, but it does not add up to me.  It is difficult to figure it out.  Many people in local authorities who want to help out their local communities find that it does not add up for them and they are becoming cynical and sarcastic.  When they come up here on deputations seeking money they are regarded as the local idiots.  What would they know about it? We are running the country.  We have the 250,000 unemployed and we are looking after them, and what is all the fuss about? People just do not understand this.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State here and I had a conversation a couple of parliamentary question sessions ago about the much vaunted Teamwork scheme.  I had information that only £500,000 was available for new schemes that were applied for this year.  It was £8.5 million last year cut back to £5 million and I heard that the Minister gave them an extra £2 million. These schemes involve the community. They are the schemes that the YEA and so on talk about, but the money is not available.</P>
    <P>What other schemes have we?  The <Col N="1145" /> employment incentive scheme limits the number of people we can employ.  If you are an employer you would like to employ a few lads on a bit of real work with real experience, but you are limited to five on that one.  You cannot take on ten or 20 because that would be cheap labour. They will not be able to do anything on the roads because certain trade unions and local authority areas will not let you do that, but they can cut the grass and next week they can cut it again and get good money for it.  That happens in County Offaly and every other county.  I am a politician and I am asked to justify it.  I am glad I am not the Minister because I would hate to have to face these people. The youth employment levy takes in £140 million per year, and yet there is a fourfold increase in socially disadvantaged areas.</P>
    <P>I can see the point made by the Minister regarding the increased labour force and I realise that it is very difficult to create 23,000 new jobs every year.  However, what we are doing is not making <Col N="1146" /> sense and we could do an awful lot more Let us not mess around any longer.  It would be better to get Joe Walsh to organise a package tour for young people and subsidise it to the extent of £200 per head.  It would be better for them to go to America instead of doing nothing at home.</P>

There is no need to take my word for it: Brian Patterson, Director General of the IMI, said that those who say that the spirit of enterprise is dead are wrong. Our young people are full of it, the black economy is driven by it and the enterprise allowance scheme has been swamped by it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is costing us £20 million a year in malicious damages, £13 million of this in Dublin alone.  What effect will this legislation have on churches, schools, community centres and motor insurance?  All of these will be affected.  The average increase in insurance <Col N="1149" /> on schools will be about 40 per cent. The increase in car insurance across the board will, in my opinion, be about 10 per cent &mdash; and that estimate is on the low side.  Insurance for fire and theft will probably cost even more.  Why is malicious damage costing so much?</P>
      <P>In many parts of the country because of the cut-backs in Garda pay the Garda Síochána are not in a position to man the areas as they had previously done.  In my constituency of Laois-Offaly on many weekends the Garda stations in the smaller villages are closed.  In some of our major towns the gardaí who used to man them have been drafted into duty in Portlaoise Prison.  The Government and the Minister are trying to claim that there have been no cut-backs in Garda overtime and that all the areas are manned as before.  I can speak for my own constituency and I say that is not so.</P>
      <P>In my area a church in the course of erection was completely burned down. This will cost the community of Tullamore over £2 million.  If this Bill had been in operation at the time of the burning the community and the parish would not have been able to claim for malicious damages.  The position would have depended solely on the insurers and on the already hard-pressed community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposal would have a very serious effect on schools, especially primary schools.  The school represents both the community and authority and consequently it is the target of vandals.  Generally speaking, these attacks happen during school holidays.  Boards of management of schools have spent countless thousands of pounds on fencing and other security measures, but they are totally frustrated by recurring vandalism. Demands for extra policing and extra security have fallen on deaf ears, as the Government have restricted Garda availability and overtime, even in high crime areas.  In Edenderry town from 2 a.m. to 9 p.m. there is no garda on duty.  That is the system under which we are living. Being close to Dublin and the high crime rate areas, not a weekend goes by without four or five robberies taking place in that <Col N="1150" /> town.  I cannot let this occasion pass without thanking the Garda Síochána for the work they have been doing on behalf of the community.  Many of the vandals who have come there to commit serious crime and affect the industrial life of the area have been apprehended and brought before the courts.</P>
    <P>I have very good knowledge of the insurance industry, having spent my younger days in it and I understand how it operates.  Nobody can deny that at present the industry is going through a difficult period.  Let me explain, to anybody who might not understand the term general branch business as distinct from life business, that general branch business is liability insurance which today is non-profit making.  Company actuaries must be alert to the risks they undertake and let out to underwriters.  In this field the Minister's proposals will have a severe effect.  Regretfully I must say that a greater number of claims will be made and an increase in unemployment will result.  This, in turn, will lead to more robberies.  Many will not be able to get insurance cover for certain types of risk, some of which I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>Car insurance is essential today and is compulsory under law.  These proposals will increase most motor premiums by about 10 per cent on average.  Extensive damage caused to stolen cars by thieves and joyriders is one of the principal features of crime, especially in our urban areas.  Some say that if this Bill is enacted in its present form insurance premiums will go much higher than I have given as my opinion.  If that happens this Bill will have a very serious effect on employment. Property in the hands of the community will prove too great a burden for them to continue to support.  The management boards of schools and community halls and the trustees who look after such buildings and are responsible for fund raising will find that the resources available will be under extreme demand. Windows in schools are now a declined risk.  I checked into that and found that many insurance companies are excluding them.  In the greater urban areas the <Col N="1151" /> increases which I have stated could be as high on average as 45 per cent.  Nobody has denied that.  The insurance industry suggest that that may be the case.</P>
    <P>Fire insurance is also very important. In some urban areas underwriters are not prepared to provide fire insurance because the risks of arson are considered to be too high.  Therefore the suggestion that individuals or businesses cover these risks through increased insurance premiums is false and misleading.  The Crime Prevention Council tell us that on average there are 1,300 arson attacks every year. Since the early sixties there has been a 13-fold increase in suspected arson attacks on industrial and commercial premises. Some people estimate that the number of fires for which claims are made which are suspected to be malicious has risen from 35 per cent in 1982 for claims involving £100,000 to 63 per cent in 1983. This rising trend in arson claims has ensured that underwriters have now declared certain parts of Dublin and the country as undesirable risks.  I know insurance companies in many urban areas who will not insure contents.  They will only insure buildings and that will depend on the location and the area.  They will then decide on the premium.</P>
    <P>What effect will this have on industry? People are hard pressed to keep their heads over water.  I do not think anybody will deny that.  There is no doubt that if this Bill goes through in the form in which it is proposed it will have an adverse effect on industry and employment.  Premiums will rise.  Some risks in industry are being reduced.  More are being shared out among a number of underwriters. Very exorbitant premiums are being charged.  I know a small company in my own constituency which employs 40 people.  The premium for liability insurance is £35,000 a year.  One is then expected to keep his head over water and to keep people employed.  That was before there was any proposal before us in this regard.</P>
    <P>We may be penny pinching in some areas and pounds foolish.  Do not tell us that there is no decline in Garda work <Col N="1152" /> rates per hour.  The Irish people are intelligent. Our young people are intelligent. They know what is going on.  They are not going to be fobbed off with soft talk and twisting things around to make them look good.  I and all reasonable people in this House must realise that that is the position.  We will not cod the Irish people by telling them that there are no cut-backs and there are gardaí on the beat when it is not true.  Nobody will get away with that.  If we try to do that the credibility of the politicians will be open to question.  We in this House will be blamed for putting it open to question. Some people try to doctor situations in order to make them look good and pretend that they have answers for everything. The people will judge that.</P>
    <P>This will have a dramatic effect on household insurance.  Household insurance is linked with mortgages.  A person taking out a mortgage should insure his home at its present value.  He should also have a mortage protection policy.  All these are inter-linked.  By doing that if anything happens the breadwinner at least the family will have the home.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is moving away from the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am dealing with the expenditure that will be involved under this heading.  I am sorry if the Chair thinks I have gone off course.  It is all inter-linked. Business premises and others will be and have been the victims.  There will be an additional burden in taxation in the long run.  It is interesting to note that the Dublin City Centre Business Association are alarmed at the very real prospect of being unable to obtain fire and malicious damage cover for all their members. They say a number of their members have recently gone out of business because of problems with insurance.  Shopping centres, neighbourhood shops and pubs have been forced to close due to burglaries and vandalism.  The critical situation will worsen if this Bill is approved in its present form.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I have been critical one must also be positive.  There is an alternative <Col N="1153" /> to the Government's approach, which is to provide alternative educational programmes for young dropouts, adequate policing, protection and security for schools, community centres, shopping centres, homes and businesses which are under risk.  These are easily identified. The problems of crime, vandalism and malicious damage can be overcome but there is a price to pay and it must be paid. Negative policies such as the present one fall heaviest on the poor, the more congested and less privileged areas in our society.  The Minister's proposals will deal a crushing blow to people in these areas.  Members of the Oireachtas have a duty to speak out against these clearly oppressive and right wing proposals.</P>
    <P>In many of these areas we must look at the security operation.  I fully realise it is not always easy to look after every place.  It is not possible for the Garda Síochána to cover all areas and responsibility must come down on the owners of projects in the areas I have mentioned who must provide a certain amount of security to ensure that their premises are properly locked and windows protected to the best of their ability.  They must not all the time expect the Garda Síochána to protect haphazard arrangements.  I have to be fair.  There are some haphazard arrangements.  I would like to say to those who make them to get their houses in order and not to blame us all the time.</P>
    <P>This Bill will increase the cost of insurance premiums to cover the risk of damage to property by crime and vandalism. While there will be some relief for the Exchequer there will be no saving for the general public.  Having a good knowledge of commercial business, I realise it will mean at the beginning of the year the commercial company having to make additional financial arrangements to meet liabilities and increasing costs.  I may decide that I will not be able to maintain the employment level I have. I might have been in a position to take on an additional employee but owing to the cost which is now being placed on me I will have to consider it in a different context.  The explanatory memorandum with the Bill does not explain why the <Col N="1154" /> right to compensation is retained in certain circumstances.  The circumstances set out would appear to be risks against which the insurance industry would not usually offer cover.  However, there is no evidence that the Government have conducted an analysis of the risks to property caused by criminal acts against which it is difficult or impossible to insure.</P>
    <P>Has the Minister for Finance asked the insurance industry for a list of such risks or for an indication of the circumstances in which the cost of such cover is prohibitive? An analysis of these risks would give a rational basis for maintaining the right to compensation in certain circumstances. A person who cannot afford to insure his property against criminal acts will lose a right to compensation.  This has serious implications for traders and other owners of property in those parts of the State affected by serious crime.  In particular, traders will be obliged to pay prohibitive premiums or run the risk of losing their means of livelihood.  It should be remembered that there is a clause inserted in insurance contracts today which means that if one does not insure one's property at market value one is not indemnified.  Insurance companies introduced that clause in 1968, what is known as the under-insurance clause on property.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle:</NameTxt>
      <P>This may be a very interesting lecture on the insurance industry and its workings but I do not think it is all relevant to the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly:</NameTxt>
      <P>But it is relevant when it comes to the payment of premiums which revolves around this matter because the provisions of this Bill will occasion such increases.  However, I do not want to differ from you, a Cheann Comhairle, so I shall not continue.  It is agreed on all sides that the malicious injuries code has outlived its original purpose of levying on ratepayers of a given local authority compensation for malicious damage to property.  It is regrettable that the Government did not avail of this opportunity to put into statutory form a scheme for the compensation of <Col N="1155" /> personal injuries occasioned by acts of criminal violence.  Indeed, the Government have already displayed their lack of compassion for the victims of crime by the abolition of compensation for pain and suffering in such cases.</P>
      <P>The provisions of this Bill will create an additional category of victims of crime who cannot obtain compensation.  These will be persons who cannot afford to insure their property against malicious damage.  Nobody, least of all the insurance companies, has denied that there will be substantial increases in premiums across the board affecting schools, churches, community centres, businesses of all descriptions.  It is difficult enough for community centres at present to meet their overheads and many commitments. Many are now running weekly lotteries in an endeavour to pay the premiums being sought by insurance companies. The Minister of State present, representing a rural constituency like mine, will understand fully that that is occasioning an even greater demand on the public.</P>
      <P>An improvement in present insurance arrangements can be brought about in a number of ways, first, by property owners ensuring that their premises are as secure as possible from potential robbery or other damage.  I am aware also that many premises, schools and others, will not be given insurance cover unless first inspected by a fire inspector of an insurance company to ascertain what safety precautions have been taken.  For example, one cannot have gammy locks on doors and expect to get away with it. Second, an educational programme should be devised in order to ensure that people render their premises safer, complying with the necessary statutory regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I could not agree with this provision being removed because £30 million worth of malicious damage is caused in the Dublin area, which I suppose is understandable bearing in mind its population, the rest being spread throughout the remainder of the country.  My fear would be that, with the substantial increases in premiums that will take place &mdash; with <Col N="1156" /> the risk element declining &mdash; companies giving good employment will be placed in jeopardy or perhaps even faced with closure.  One must ask the question: what happens when a company closes?  It would be my desire that everything possible be done to ensure that as many companies as possible remain stable and viable.  But if this Bill is passed in its present form it will have an effect on the industrial life of the country.  Then we must ask ourselves: will we be robbing Peter to pay Paul?  Will the other State agencies be called to undertake some rescue work, when redundancies take place, with our hard-pressed Department of Social Welfare being asked to carry the can?  If that is to be the case it is not good logic or something with which I could agree.  Neither is it something the people would be prepared to accept.  I must also point out that many people are not aware of the serious implications of this Bill.  I warn every company owner, director, trader, shopkeeper, publican, and school management board that they will have to pay for this measure and will be bled again.  The money will be coming from a pocket which has been fairly well rattled already.</P>
    <P>I am worried about the effects this Bill may have on employment.  Certainly there will be far-reaching effects.  If the figure for malicious damage is £20 million &mdash; and it is rising every year &mdash; who will pick up the tab?  The ordinary businessman, the taxpayer and the community in general must bear the cost.  Community centres in some isolated areas may be in decline and may become uninsurable against heavy risk.  A company can be closed down indirectly by prohibitive insurance premiums.  Many companies are finding it very difficult to get insurance premiums.  Many companies are finding it very difficult to get insurance against certain types of risk.  Those who are getting insurance cover are paying substantially more for it now than they were paying some years ago.  Some companies have been asked to pay 100 per cent or 150 per cent more than they paid last year.  I got in touch with one company. They were nice to me but they told <Col N="1157" /> me to try to get someone else to take the risk.  I pointed out that the client had been with them for many years and that they should not look for an easy way out by putting him out of business.</P>
    <P>Nobody has denied that there will be substantial increases across the board. Churches, schools and community centres will be more expensive to insure. Similarly it will be difficult to get insurance cover for cars, lorries, tractors, combine harvesters, <i>et cetera</i>.  It will certainly affect the agricultural community as well as industrial enterprises.  Although admittedly £20 million per year in malicious damage is extremely high, it was borne across the board.  Now the Government are shirking that responsibility and putting it on small companies and those who are responsible for the concerns I have mentioned.  Above all it will affect household insurance.  In many urban and county areas comprehensive risk insurance is no longer available.  We seem to be on course for throwing all the burden to business people and ordinary workers and telling them to do their best.  It is hard luck if they have to close down.</P>
    <P>We have pointed out some of the things that should be done.  Many of the views I have mentioned are held by other people. The <i>Garda Review</i> issued today contains a statement from the Garda Representative Body in the midlands which points out the serious effect of cutbacks on policing work.  Many areas in the midlands do not have any garda on duty. Nobody has denied this.  The Minister can talk plausibly but people in the midlands do not believe him.  I hope serious consideration will be given on Committee Stage to the amendments we will put down in the interests of the people, the workers and managers who are trying to keep the wheels of industry moving.  They deserve a better deal.  They already bear a heavy burden and it should not be increased.  We are told by Government that things are improving.  I do not see it, nor do thousands of others.  There has been an increase in the number of bankruptcies and receiverships since the beginning of the year.  This Bill will accelerate <Col N="1158" /> that trend.  I am asking the Government to think of the overall effects on our economy before they go any further. We will have a lot more to say about the Bill on Committee Stage which I presume will not be for some time.  I hope that during the summer recess a breath of fresh air, which is badly needed in St. Stephen's Green, blows through the House and will result in the provisions being altered.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon:</NameTxt>
      <P>Like my colleagues I am opposed to the Bill.  Malicious injury compensation awards in future will be confined to damage caused during riots or by unlawful organisations but there is a glaring omission in regard to local authority property, irrespective of how the damage is caused.  If it is caused by an unlawful organisation or during a riot the local authority will not be able to claim the compensation they are entitled to.  There is at least one serious case that needs to be dealt with.  During the &ldquo;H Block&rdquo; riots in 1981 Monaghan courthouse was seriously damaged and the repair bill, which had to be paid by the county council, amounted to £1½ million. The Government, and in particular the Minister for Justice, are aware of that case and I thought that when this opportunity was presented to them they would have rectified this anomaly in the 1981 Act.</P>
      <P>Local authorities, through no fault of their own, will be burdened with the heavy expense of malicious damage.  The legislation discriminates against them. Monaghan courthouse is situated in the centre of Monaghan town which is under the control of Monaghan Urban District Council.  Had the urban council been the owners of the courthouse there would not have been any problem.  The UDC could have taken the claim against the county council and the council could have been recouped by the Central Fund to the extent of anything in excess of 20p in the £.  Under the Bill before us the UDC will be recouped in full.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regret that the Government did not avail of this opportunity to correct that anomaly.  It is a pity that a Government <Col N="1159" /> Minister is not present to convey this point to the Cabinet.  I appreciate that Minister of State Donnellan, who is present, is aware of the implications for any local authority.  As a member of Galway County Council I am sure he realises that local authorities in future will have to carry a heavy burden if their property is damaged maliciously.</P>
    <P>According to section 6 the Minister for the Environment will refund to the local authority the full amount of any compensation awarded under the new provisions together with any legal costs incurred by the authority in respect of compensation.  Two questions arise out of that provision.  Why is it not possible to ensure that local authorities are paid their just compensation in the event of their own property being damaged maliciously? Why is the charge, following such damage, not awarded against the central authority rather than against the local authority?  Why is the responsibility imposed on the local authority when the local authority will not be responsible for paying the damages?  That money will be paid by the central authority through the local authority.</P>
    <P>I must point out that the Department of Justice made a contribution towards the cost of the repair of the Monaghan courthouse but had the council offices been damaged the local authority would have had to carry the huge burden alone. If a similar incident occurred in another county and £2 million had to be found to repair council property the consequences for that county would be very serious. All local authorities are short of funds and I do not think they will be able to raise the necessary funds.  Will a local authority be permitted to use money allocated for housing or roads?  Had there been a Minister for a Border constituency in the Cabinet the anomaly that exists would have been corrected before the Bill was circulated.  However, the Government have an opportunity between now and Committee Stage to ensure that there will not be discrimination against local authorities in this fashion.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1160" /> The Bill will create serious problems for many people.  Insurance premiums will rise considerably because insurance companies will be asked to carry the extra cover for damage arising out of malicious injury claims.  The time was opportune for the Government to bring in legislation to regularise motor insurance.  It is my belief that the legislation will aggravate the problems in regard to motor insurance. One of the serious side effects of the annual increase in the cost of motor insurance is that some people do not take out insurance cover.  That will have serious consequences for those who pay their premiums and those who are unfortunate enough to be involved in an accident.</P>
    <P>There is a limited form of insurance for personal injuries but not, for instance, for damage to a car.  I met a person last night who bought a car recently and owed £4,000 to a HP company.  Somebody drove into it and wrecked it and it went to the scrapyard &mdash; fortunately, the person was not injured but the car was a total write-off.  Because the other motorist was not insured that man will have to pay back the £4,000, although he has not a car to drive.  There is something seriously wrong in that.</P>
    <P>One of the effects of the increasing insurance premiums &mdash; they have increased at an astronomical rate in recent years &mdash; is that more and more people are not insuring their cars and they are getting away with it.  This legislation should not have been brought before us without a thorough study of that situation. This Bill will have serious consequences for young people which have not been highlighted sufficiently here.  Many young people who live long distances from their work have to use cars.  Indeed, they are fortunate enough these days to have work, without paying premiums as high as £1,000, £1,200 and even £1,400 to insure their cars.  This is a serious problem for young people because the effect of the Bill will be to increase premiums still further.  I do not know how big the increases will be and I do not know if the Minister discussed the effects of the Bill <Col N="1161" /> on premiums with the insurance companies. All this should have been examined before the Bill was even circulated.</P>
    <P>Householders will have their insurance cover increased as a result of this legislation. Schools, community centres and Church authorities have had their premiums increased already.  Primary schools always have been vulnerable to vandalism and malicious damage.  Will the management boards of these schools be responsible for the payment of increased premiums, will the Department of Education accept responsibility or contribute, or will the responsibility be transferred from Department to Department? School management boards are already hard pressed for ordinary maintenance of schools.  In respect of primary schools in Dublin, it is estimated that premiums will be increased by 40 per cent and that insurance cover for post-primary schools will be increased by 30 per cent.  Of course, this will apply more to poorer areas of the inner cities.  If school management boards are to be obliged to insure against vandalism the suffering will be greatest in the poorer areas.  Central Dublin is particularly vulnerable and has been for years.</P>
    <P>A week ago the Minister for the Environment announced that he would spend £10 million to improve Dublin city centre, yet today we are passing legislation which will drive people out of it because they will not be able to stay there.  Business people cannot obtain insurance cover at present, but when this Bill becomes the law of the land they will be asked to carry the extra cost of criminal damage and malicious injuries. Of course, the obvious answer is to cut down the crime level.  This will take a certain amount of time and education and support for people involved in crime. There have been cut-backs on expenditure on the Garda and they have got to have an effect.  The Government have a responsibility to the victims of crime, and it is unfortunate that the cost of malicious injuries has more than trebled, from £5.6 million to £18.7 million in recent years. Therefore, the amount will be much <Col N="1162" /> greater after this Bill becomes law.</P>
    <P>Fire insurance will be increased and this will cause grave hardship.  Small industries will suffer in this respect and indeed larger industries may find it difficult to continue in this time of recession.  As a result of this Bill there will be major increases in fire insurance for such businesses. When there is arson by vandals businesses employing 30 or 40 people could be burned, throwing those people out of work without any hope of getting their jobs back because the owners would not have the money to put the staff together again.</P>
    <P>The Government should have looked at all those things, those implications, before introducing the Bill. I wonder if the Government had any consultations whatever with the insurance companies.  Will the Government in future help firms, schools, community centres, who may not be able to get insurance cover?  What will happen to people who are told by their insurance company that because they live in an area of high risk, where there has been much vandalism and where the record is bad, they are not prepared to insure them?  Will people be driven from the centre of the city at a time when the Government have a commitment to improve it?  If small businesses are unfortunate enough to be the target of vandals, will they be destroyed and not receive compensation from anyone?  What plans have the Government made to deal with such matters? What consultations have they had with the insurance companies to ascertain that cover will be available for everyone?  Are the Government going to make any effort to ensure that those struggling to keep their businesses in operation will be able to pay the increased premiums?  These are serious questions at a time when crime and vandalism are rampant, at a time of recession when everyone, whether in business or not, is struggling to make ends meet.</P>
    <P>The answer lies in reducing the crime rate.  For example, the abuse of drugs is a major contributory factor to crime, particularly in this city.  While I appreciate <Col N="1163" /> that the Government amended the Misuse of Drugs Act, are they satisfied enough has been done?  Heroin is responsible for some of the most violent crimes committed in cities throughout the world. It costs up to £200 per day to provide an addict with heroin and that person will often commit the most heinous of crimes to obtain that money.  There is no reason why heroin should find its way into this country.  It cannot be produced here; it has to be imported.  What efforts are we making at the docks to keep it out?  Why did we not involve customs and excise officers to a greater extent?  Why have we not given them special training to deal with that problem?</P>
    <P>There are many other areas where Government action could be taken to cut down the level of crime.  Unrest caused by massive unemployment leads to vandalism. It is important that people should have the opportunity to indulge in creative activity.  People should have the opportunity to work and the Government have a prime responsibility to create the proper economic environment in which industry can flourish, thus providing work for the people.  The Government should seriously consider their economic policies. In the past month they have spent their time campaigning for people to vote in favour of divorce.  If they put the same energy into their economic policies, to create a climate in which industry would thrive and where jobs would be available for our people, that would help to cut down the level of vandalism.  Equally, they should provide more opportunities for leisure and sport, particularly for young people.  This time last year we were told a National Lottery Bill would be introduced here to provide funds for proper leisure facilities.  However, when the Bill was circulated we found that the objective was to provide funds for the central Exchequer.  This Bill is to give £20 million to the Exchequer, the amount the Government will save as a result of not paying the victims of vandalism and crime.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of the deployment of the Garda Síochána in <Col N="1164" /> combating crime.  A large number of gardaí and the Army guard the Border. I hope they are not guarding it just to please the British Government.  That would be entirely unacceptable.  The Government must look at the balance between the number of gardaí and the Army personnel along the Border and the problems in areas far removed from the Border where there appears to be a totally insufficient number of Garda Síochána, for example, on the streets of Dublin.  I ask the Government to consider this aspect.</P>
    <P>The question of overtime for the gardaí has been raised.  About four or five weeks ago there was a headline in <i>The Irish Press</i> to the effect that gardaí were to be withdrawn from the Border.  The following day there was a headline in the same paper saying that statement was denied by the Government.  Nevertheless, the gardaí on temporary duty on the Border had given up their accommodation and were on their way home &mdash; some were actually at home &mdash; when they were called back.  There seems to be a problem in relation to the deployment of the gardaí in combating crime, particularly with regard to malicious injury cases.</P>
    <P>These are all areas where the Government could have acted to cut down the amount of damages the State would have to pay.  However, pending a better economic climate, they should not have introduced this Bill.  It will create unnecessary hardship for many people, particularly for the motorist who is already hard-pressed enough, and it will lead to the serious problems I have mentioned, namely, where people will have no insurance cover.  It will create serious problems for householders, for boards of management of schools, for those responsible for churches and for owners of small businesses.</P>
    <P>The Bill was not well thought out and its timing is wrong.  I ask the Government to consider the consequences, particularly with regard to the increase in insurance premiums, the consequences for those who are unable to obtain insurance and those who cannot afford the increased premiums.  I come back to the <Col N="1165" /> point I started with, namely, the glaring omission in the Bill of a provision for local authorities.  If this legislation is passed they will find, as they did after the 1981 Act, that they will have to carry the responsibility and they will be discriminated against as compared with anyone else where damage is caused by riot or by an unlawful organisation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary:</NameTxt>
      <P>Over the last number of years we have heard Government spokesmen proclaiming that one of their priorities is the necessity to create a suitable environment for business.  The extent of this commitment is evident from the legislation before us.  This Bill will worsen the environment for business. This is more discriminatory legislation against the business community and will contribute to the rising toll of unemployment.</P>
      <P>The business community in cities and towns are already finding it difficult to get insurance cover and this legislation will make this even more difficult, and in many cases impossible.  It will be the straw that broke the camel's back.  Many business men who were lucky enough to get insurance &mdash; and I speak from experience &mdash; find that this legislation has been anticipated by the insurance companies.  Most insurance policies to cover small businesses say that the insurance cover will be valid until this legislation is passed.  That begs the question of how much consulation there was between the Government and the insurance companies and why the insurance companies saw fit to introduce that codicil in the policies which have been issued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How can the Government justify brining legislation before the House which will worsen the depression facing the business community and the country as a whole?  Contrary to stated Government policy this Bill, like many other Bills, reinforces the general view that the Government have lost their way, that they are going around in circles like a dog chasing his tail, and that they are no wiser now than when they set out on their journey.  One finds it puzzling that on the one hand the Minister for the Environment <Col N="1166" /> should make much ado about giving £10 million to O'Connell Street, money saved from the rates support grant which he is giving back five months later with a great trumpet of publicity, while on the other hand introducing legislation which will affect the city centre, especially the Dublin city centre.  This legislation will affect all town and city centres.  If this legislation is passed &mdash; and unless the Government change their minds drastically it will pass &mdash; it will worsen the problems in all city centres.</P>
    <P>It is sad that this legislation was not introduced to improve the environment for business but simply to save the Government a few pounds.  This legislation was introduced to further advance the myth that this Government care about handling finances, and that they are interested in financial rectitude and management. The reality is that any savings the Government might make will be spent on unemployment assistance and unemployment benefit for people who, as a result of this legislation, will find themselves out of work.</P>
    <P>Experience shows that the insurance companies are being more selective in the type of business they are taking and where the business are located.  Many Deputies have had representations about the difficulties experienced by small businesses in obtaining insurance.  With that in mind I question the Government's action in bringing in this legislation.  I honestly believe they have not thought out fully the implications of this Bill.  To save a few pounds they have thrown people like school managers, small factory owners, and small businesses, on the mercy of the insurance companies.  Will the Government help fund the premiums which the insurance companies will ask school management baords to pay, particularly many national schools close to the city centre where the population has moved out and the schools are much bigger than are needed?  What would happen if the management board were unable to pay the premium and no insurance were taken out on a school which was destroyed or badly damaged maliciously? <Col N="1167" /> The reality is that the management board will have no money and will have to come back to the Government.  This is another example of how the Government will save a few pounds under this legislation which will have to be spent by them in other ways.  That is why I believe the Government have not thought through fully the implications of this legislation.  I do not know what agreement the Government and the insurance companies have reached, but I cannot see any logic in the Government introducing this legislation at this time.</P>
    <P>I would like to mention something which the Government do not like us to talk about because of the way they have handled it, and that is the construction industry.  I am speaking now in particular of County Mayo which I know.  Many small contractors in County Mayo are unable to pay the premiums they have been asked for employers' liability and public liability.  I know a number of very small contractors who had tendered for and got houses from Mayo County Council but had to give them up because of a lack of employers' liability and public liability.  A number of these people were asked to pay three times last year's premium, and that was before this Bill was introduced.  Many people in Mayo will be out of work as a result of this legislation. A number of larger contractors will be the only people who will be able to tender for houses, isolated cottages or small schemes from Mayo County Council because of the increased insurance premiums. This legislation can only worsen that situation.</P>
    <P>In other times there might be some justification for this legislation but the Government have picked an extraordinarily bad time to introduce it, a time when crime is rife and on the increase particularly in city areas, when vandalism is on the increase, when there is a general disregard for law and order.  In spite of all this, very many areas all throughout the country are experiencing cutbacks in Garda activity.  When one puts these facts <Col N="1168" /> together one can only ask what has happened to the Government when they introduce this legislation at this time.</P>
    <P>VECs will be extremely badly hit by this legislation.  In my town we have had a series of attacks and vandalism on the local vocational school.  There are four or five malicious injury claims in already. Once this legislation is passed Mayo VEC will find it extremely difficult, in view of the history of attacks in certain areas, to get insurance cover and I or somebody else will be coming back to the Minister for Education seeking money &mdash; as we are doing already and I might add that money has been refused &mdash; to do major repairs to that school arising out of malicious injury claims while we are awaiting the decisions of various court cases.</P>
    <P>I have had the sad experience of this problem of my car being stolen, but fortunately I was covered by insurance.  I came out of the flat I reside in in Dublin some time ago to discover that the car I had parked carefully the night before was no longer there and I have not seen sight nor sign of it since then.  I was lucky enough because I had comprehensive cover.  If I had not I wonder what the situation would have been, particularly when that type of crime is on the increase, despite what may or may not be indicated by statistics.  I went to the Garda station at 9.10 a.m. and I was the fourth person reporting a car stolen to that station. Therefore, I wonder what the situation is in relation to problems like this.</P>
    <P>As I said, I do not intend to keep the House long.  I would like to add my voice again to the voices of those who would question the justification for this legislation. I ask the Minister of State to urge the Government to hasten slowly here because of the implications for business particularly, but not only, in city centres because vandalism is now not confined &mdash; whatever the Minister of State may think &mdash; to the city of Dublin.  It is spread all through the country, and the Government are aiding this by their decision to cut back on Garda overtime by their demand that gardaí account for every moment of their time despite the fact that a garda does not pick the time of the <Col N="1169" /> crime and has not the opportunity of just stopping at 5 p.m. The criminal will not stop.  We have the ludicrous situation of a young man who apprehended a criminal after a young woman made a complaint being criticised next morning for working on after the time he was supposed to be on duty.  That can be proved.  If the Minister of State would like the details I will give them to him.</P>
    <P>This legislation is not timely.  Its implications have been badly thought out.  The Government for some reason best known to themselves have introduced legislation that will in the long run affect employment, particularly in city centres, will put many small businesses out of business, and in particular will mean that many small factories will have to close.  I am speaking to you now, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle as a practising TD who is meeting these things.  You will have met them as I have.  You will have met people who have difficulty with their insurance company.  You will have met small shopkeepers as I have met them, and you will have seen insurance policies with mention of this Bill in them without any suggestion of what the premium will be once this legislation is passed.</P>
    <P>Again, I urge the Government to proceed very slowly and after Second Stage to go back to the drawing board, think of the consequences to business if this legislation is passed and to rethink before they put on the Statute Book legislation which will only add more and more unemployment, will make life much more difficult for very many small businesses and will put very many family businesses out of business.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen:</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to add my reservations about the Bill to those of other speakers on this side of the House and as a member of the legal profesion who is involved in processing malicious injury applications.  A new Act was brought in by the Government not so long ago, I think in 1981.  This proposal is, unfortuantely, another instance of short term planning such as we have seen from this Government.  This measure is synonymous <Col N="1170" /> with crisis management, born of frustration and really is senseless in that it will impose a further burden on sections of the community who have already taken enough from this Government in many areas of activity.  I would have thought when I spoke here last week on the Juries Bill, when I was asked to accept the argument of the Minister for Justice for the abolition of juries for the purpose of reducing the cost of insurance and of the level of compensation awarded in the High Court, that one would not expect to see a Bill brought into the House simultaneously which has the very opposite effect of increasing insurance premiums and in many instances rendering more people unable to insure their cars, vehicles, houses and schools.  In relation to cars, for example, what savings one might think one was making would involve one in increased claims with the Motor Insurers' Bureau later.</P>
      <P>In opposing the motion I am trying to discern some kind of logic behind the workings of a Government that do not seem to know where they are going in relation to many issues.  Unfortunately, they have continuously seriously miscalculated public opinion and are out of touch with the priorities of ordinary people trying to make a living or to exist on social welfare payments.  This from a Government supposedly talented, consisting of bright sparks who stand for fair play.  However, it is very difficult to see where they are trying to lead us.  This is a botched effort to deflect us from the real issues and that has been their hallmark for some considerable time. This Bill has been introduced because malicious injury claims have trebled under this Government, from £5.6 million to £18.7 million.  The reason for this is that far more malicious attacks have taken place under the Government because there is far more crime and lawlessness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government are not attacking the causes of crime generally but this small aspect of it would merely involve having a few more gardaí on the streets and increasing the neighbourhood watch scheme and patrols.  One would have <Col N="1171" /> thought that the community would be involved to a greater extent in trying to prevent malicious injuries.  We should also try to monitor crime to a greater extent and to apprehend the perpetrators. Malicious injuries claims apply only to damage done by person or persons unknown.  Obviously many unknown persons are walking around because these claims are increasing.  If my home or car were damaged and I found out who did it I could not make a claim.  You must be able to prove that you do not know who did the damage.  There are far too many undetected crimes in relation to burning schools, damaging cars and breaking windows. That raises the question of law enforcement and the ability of the Government to ensure that we have a peaceful existence.</P>
    <P>This Bill has been introduced because the Government are not prepared to commit the funds where they are required.  The Garda have explained that they cannot do their job properly because of lack of overtime.  Crime has unquestionably increased, there is less detection and more malicious injuries so a Bill is introduced to do away with claims of this nature.  Individual property is not being protected although it is a constitutional right.  Everybody, thankfully, has property of some description and is entitled to protection.  One would expect the fundamental role of Government to encompass this but all they can do is to introduce this Bill.  It is important for people in the Dáil and elsewhere to explain the reasons to the public for the abolition of malicious injuries claims.  They should tell them that the Government are not prepared to pay the cost of prevention of the incidence of malicious injuries.  That, in a nutshell, is the <i>raison d'etre</i> of this legislation.</P>
    <P>The cause of greatest concern in relation to the Bill is that schools and public buildings will no longer be able to claim for malicious injuries from local authorities. I know that local authorities provide only 20p in the £ and that the first £100 is not refundable in order to eliminate small claims, with which I agree, but <Col N="1172" /> people require a Government to step in when buildings have been maliciously damaged by a person or persons unknown.  The alternative now proposed by the Government is that boards of management should go to an insurance company and pay a higher premium than heretofore.  How will they do that when they cannot in many instances pay existing levels of insurance?  A week ago we were asked to abolish juries in civil cases for the purpose of reducing insurance premiums and now we are asked to support a measure which will increase them. These are two contradictory Bills.  Was this is mental abberation?  It is another example of the inconsistency of the Government who do not seem to have any coherent plan or policy.  They do not seem to know that Departments are bringing Bills forward without reference to their effect on other Departments or how they might affect a Government argument in relation to another Bill.  Are mini-republics running the country?  Perhaps that overstates the case but taxpayers should ask questions when they see obvious inconsistencies on the part of Government.</P>
    <P>The Minister claimed that the level of crime has been reduced and that the argument put forward by Fianna Fáil is spurious.  The increase in malicious injuries from £5.6 million to £18.7 million under this Government, the Government of law and order, the party of law and order, suggests that crime is increasing certainly in relation to malicious injuries. It has increased immeasurably just in relation to malicious injuries, and if it has increased in relation to malicious injuries, would it be safe to suggest that it has increased in other areas of detected crime, or are we being asked to say that whilst it has increased in the area of malicious injuries, it has decreased to such an extent elsewhere as to offset the increase in malicious injuries?  Malicious injury is really only a very small area of the activities of law enforcement officers.  We are dealing with serious crime in this city and this country.  Major crimes are becoming more prevalent, with the recent kidnapping case, armed robberies <Col N="1173" /> and so on.  We are all aware of it and there is no need to go through it line by line.  If we read the newspapers we can detect a greater reportage of crime &mdash; and the journalists are serious journalists and are not thinking it up in their heads.</P>
    <P>There has been an increase in crime. How does the Minister refute that argument? By referring to the statistics on the detection of crime.  If one goes to another book by a man called Professor Rothman of the ESRI one finds that, when he is asked to make a study of crime and the level of detection of crime and the incidence of crime, his first concrete observation is that the statistics he has are incomplete and it is difficult to come to any final conclusions on crime although the Garda yearly reports have become more sophisticated and more detailed in the various categories.  Here is a professional statistician who cannot come to any clear conclusions.  His main recommendation is that we should kindly collate the information in such a way that he can make something out of it.  That is what he is saying in ordinary language. When a Minister makes a major assertion which goes against the layman's view of Ireland today in relation to the level of crime, when a Minister of a Government who are supposed to be protecting the citizen and his property says that the level of crime is less than it was three years ago, what citizen in this city could agree with him?</P>
    <P>I am not taking away from the intelligence of any Minister.  Far be it from me to do that.  But I would say he is relying on information which is not reliable.  He is coming to a conclusion on the basis of assumptions which cannot be made on the information available.  A professional man in this area has stated quite clearly that he cannot make anything of the information.  I quoted that report a few weeks ago on a Private Members' motion on crime and I did not hear it refuted by any Member of the Government afterwards and they had many opportunities to do so because it is there in black and white.  Therefore, the assertion that crime is reducing is refuted professionally and by the person who matters, the private <Col N="1174" /> citizen who, as Deputy Calleary said just before me, is staying somewhere overnight and has his car stolen, and on reporting it to the Garda station finds that he is the fourth person reporting a stolen car at the same Garda station.  So that argument falls by the wayside.</P>
    <P>How then do the Government come to the conclusion that this is good legislation? By offering a sop to local authorities and saying that they need not pay 20p in the £ for malicious injuries anymore.  But by doing that they are also doing away with the 80p per £ commitment they were paying and handing it over to the insurance companies who can take it from Joe Soap down the road, lash it on to the private individual again because he is well able to pay it.  It does not matter that his rate of personal taxation has increased under this Government; it does not matter that his standard of living has fallen under this Government; it does not matter that more of his ilk are out of work under this Government.  He has money and he will pay it.  The Government do not look at the real information in this report, the numbers of uninsured drivers, the numbers of business people who cannot take out employers' liability insurance, the numbers of people who cannot get public liability insurance.</P>
    <P>One begins to wonder who is codding whom.  This is a local saying in the part of the country that I come from; it is said with a broad accent and it is very funny when one hears it &mdash;&ldquo;who is codding who?&rdquo;  This Government are not fooling the ordinary guy in the street because he cannot pay.  When he is asked to take this extra burden he will not pay it either. More who can pay will not pay because they will not be allowed to pay 90 per cent of their car insurance and the remaining 10 per cent the following week when they have it.  He might just about have the premium this year but if it increases next year he will not be able to pay it at all.  Fifty per cent of the increase from £5.6 million to £8.7 million in malicious injuries under this Government is made up of malicious damage to motor vehicles.  If this is to be passed on to the private insurance industry, what we are <Col N="1175" /> really talking about is transferring another £10 million to the motorist, assuming that everyone sticks to this new law which puts the ordinary motorist in a position where he cannot pay his insurance, which means more will break the law.  We are bringing in legislation to ensure that more people will break the law.  The Government seem to think this is very good legislation, an excellent idea. Because of the economic climate that we have built up around us in the past three years, many are breaking the law as it is. It seems that the Government think it is no harm to add to that minority and make it something sizeable.  We seem to be very interested in minorities in this Parliament in recent times.</P>
    <P>In relation to car insurance the Government seem to be saying that motorists will tolerate anything and that anyone who is paying £600 a year for car insurance will be foolish enough to pay £650.  That is the logic we are dealing with here.  We are only the Opposition; we are not the Government of talents; we have not the bright backbenchers; we are just here trying to represent Joe Soap.  The point is that Joe Soap cannot take it; he has not got the money.  If he has not got it, he will not take much notice of this legislation.  He will do as a man I know at home does.  This man is on an invalidity pension.  He got a disabled person's grant and built a little prefabricated building for himself.  He was waiting a long time to build it and was living in a caravan for ten years.  He went off to see his brother in Dublin for the week-end.  He came back&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We in our profession always bow to senior colleagues.  We respect our elders.  Under the present legislation, with £250 damage done to the windows, that man loses the first £100 but is repaid £150.  Under the new proposals he would receive nothing.  We cannot expect people on invalidity pension to insure the windows of their prefabs.  One might expect them to insure a county council house, but not a prefab.  No one insures prefabs.  The Electricity Supply Board will not put electricity into such buildings.  Under this legislation that man would have no remedy.  He has an allowance of only £40 a week.  He might be asked to put galvanized sheeting into the prefab, but he would be better off in a caravan.  That is a typical example from County, Offaly.  I am trying to show the irrelevance of these proposals and to bring logic into the debate.  I am trying to find the reason for the bringing in of this legislation.  Even in their wildest dreams the Government would not wish galvanized sheeting to be put into prefabs but what will happen in such a case? Luckily the vandals came in time and the man had submitted his claim within the 14 days, so he will get his £150, but the next man will be in trouble.</P>
      <P>When it comes down to brass tacks, why not leave the malicious injuries scheme as it is?  It is costing £18.7 million &mdash; an extra £13 million during the years of fiscal rectitude, under the law and order Government, a responsible Government which would ensure that the individual is protected at all times, that a man's house is his castle, that in no circumstances will lawlessness be rampant in our society. However, we cannot protect even the man in the prefab.</P>

The Government are not prepared to put law enforcement officers on the streets to protect the people.  That is the plain and simple fact.  If we had those officers on the street, the people going around wrecking places would be caught. Then we could say that the detection rate was up.  What could have been done there would have been to employ the extra people that were to be put into the Central Statistics Office.

      <P>I am most obliged to the Deputy.  I can assure her that I took no offence.  I am a man of the world.  The Deputy is a little behind the times with regard to malicious injuries claims, because the level of fees is much lower under the most recent Act dealing with malicious injuries than it was heretofore and properly so.  I would regard what we in the profession now receive as proper remuneration in processing private citizens' claims, to ensure that the Government meet their responsibilities in the malicious injuries area.  We ensure payment to people where damage has been done <i>mala fides</i> by the culprit.  The cities will be much more seriously affected than the country.  There are many areas of our cities where lawlessness is present to a much greater degree than in the quaint little town in the midlands from which I come, although we have some hard men there as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There will be a great responsibility on the Government, when bringing in this legislation, to listen to the representations which have been made by the Dublin City Centre Businesses Association in this matter.  That association are trying to ensure that Minister Boland's greatest plans announced last week of making O'Connell Street one of the main shopping thoroughfares in Europe succeed.  Those people should be listened to.  They say that it will be very difficult to conduct certain classes of insurance as a result of the introduction of this Bill. According to the Minister for the Environment we will invest £10 million in this plan for O'Connell Street, which will come from a reduction in the rates of court awards.  In the end, the sums add up.  It is just that the money goes to different places and it is difficult to trace <Col N="1180" /> it.  That is the problem with this Government. There are new headings of expenditure every day of the week.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen:</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not mentioned the problems concerning industrial and commercial premises.  Since the sixties arson attacks, I understand, have increased thirteenfold on such premises.  We are aware of the serious level of the premiums which these people are being asked to pay to try to keep others in employment.</P>
      <P>That is another major reservation that Government should have about this Bill. They should consider that even though they are doing their best in trying to create employment in whatever sphere of activity they operate, there are people in the open market sector subject to the competitive constraints of this economy who are trying to show and illustrate their enterprise and their entrepreneurship. They are trying to win orders for the economy on the export market.  Many of them in rural constituencies are involved in skills, in particular engineering.  They are having very serious difficulties at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle:</NameTxt>
      <P>We are waiting patiently to see how this is related to the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen:</NameTxt>
      <P>How this is related to the Bill is that the Bill is increasing premiums. A person finds it difficult to get employer's liability insurance if his factory or premises is situated in a crimeridden area where there are malicious attacks on property daily and nightly.  We are thankful that it does not happen very much in your constituency, a Cheann Comhairle, or in my constituency.  There are areas where it is very serious.  People are attacking business premises.  Businessmen are in the position where if the people who commit the crime are not detected and the crime is proven to be malicious they will be compensated.  If <Col N="1181" /> the person is not in a position to pay his premiums when that loading is not there how will he be in a position to pay them in the future?  That will have an effect on employment because people will be let go in order to reduce the loadings on employers liability and public liability.  It is a fact of life.  We are aware of that from the many representations which we receive as Members of Dáil Éireann.</P>
      <P>Those premiums have been increasing alarmingly in recent years because there are greater incidents of crime in these areas.  We have to take on board whether or not a man who runs a business from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. is being asked to sleep on the premises or to be there 24 hours a day in order to police it when there are law enforcement officers for that purpose. Cognisance should be taken of that. It is an important aspect which has been highlighted during this debate and will be continually highlighted on this side of the House.  We respect the contribution that these people have made and will continue to make.  In a very short time they will make a greater contribution when they are given the opportunity in a better climate and under a different Government to show that entrepreneurship and to create employment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure many urban Deputies have mentioned during this debate that the absence of protection for what one might call anonymous crime will mean that we could be creating a breeding ground for protection rackets in this city and in other cities.  If the gardaí under the present policy will not be remunerated or given the equipment and the political direction to get out and about in sufficient numbers to protect private property in the city that is what will happen.  Employers, as a result of the damage that might ensue because of the absence of the gardaí, will be subject to <Col N="1182" /> increased insurance premiums.  What are they to do?  People will come to them and say: if you give me money your building will not go on fire tonight.  What is to stop that happening?  We have seen and we know from the Garda and from others that there is a great problem of professional crime gangs in this city and elsewhere who make it their business to exploit these opportunities.  They can see far ahead.  We are here as law abiding citizens wondering what difficulties there might be.  There are people who would look at it in a different way to see what opportunities there are for people who want to cash in on this exposure.  The business community will be exposed to these influences.</P>
      <P>The Government would have us believe that we are in some way eliminating a legal anachronism from, I think, 1861 &mdash; I stand to be corrected &mdash; whereby the then ruling authorities imposed this on local tenants to keep them at bay and to deter them from causing any damage to the exalted buildings which they occupied. They want us to believe that this is the whole idea of this legislation.  The Minister said that it is a legal anachronism. It is not a legal anachronism that malicious injury claims have increased threefold under this Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a good factual point. They have increased not because there are charitable organisations going around doing damage for the sake of it but because there are more criminals and more wayward young people with nothing to do.  If the amount of malicious injury claims was still at £5.6 million we would not have a Malicious Injuries Bill. The reason we have a Malicious Injuries Bill is that the Government are not prepared to pay £18.7 million for malicious injuries.  They did it at one time but they will not do it any more.  The reason they will not pay it is that they have not the money.  The people should realise that. The Government are not prepared to pay for crime prevention.  That is the nub of <Col N="1183" /> the issue.  That is why we are diccussing this Bill and why we oppose it so strenuously.</P>

That is the nub of our opposition to this Bill. I ask the Government to take serious cognisance of what has been said right throughout this debate.  Hopefully, this Bill will be buried on Second Stage or alternatively substantially amended so that a real reason for bringing it forward might be gleaned not only by the Opposition but by many Government Deputies who will not even know what they are voting on tonight.</P>

      <P>I would like to thank the Deputies for their contributions on Second Stage.  As mentioned in the Minister's introductory statement this measure is one of a number decided on by the Government for the purpose of reducing current public expenditure.  The savings at current costs will be about £20 million annually including savings of about £4 million to local authorities.  The Government could not support any amendments which would have the effect of reducing the size of those savings.

      <P>Great play was made by the Opposition with the fact that more than half of the compensation paid out under the malicious injuries scheme relates to the Dublin area and a high proportion to Cork and Limerick.  They then argued that its abolition will have a bad effect on &ldquo;the most densely populated and poorest areas&rdquo;.  The reality of the situation is that the existing scheme is a form of subsidy to property owners paid for in the main by the general taxpaying public including the less well off citizens of Dublin, Cork and Limerick.  Such a situation is manifestly unjust.  Deputies on the other side cannot have it both ways.  On the other hand, they call for a reduction in the level of taxation but when the Government take steps in that direction there is an outcry from them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of Deputies, including Deputy Woods, spoke about the general level of crime.  The Minister for Justice has already spoken in the House on this issue on a number of occasions in the recent past.  I will not go over the same <Col N="1185" /> ground once again.  This Bill has a specific purpose, that is, to reduce the circumstances in which payment of compensation may be made for malicious damage to property.  In my reply to the debate I will confine myself to those matters which are pertinent to that question.  However, I will say this.  There is no doubt that the overall downward trend in crime which commenced two years ago is continuing. More important, for the purposes of this legislation this drop in crime is reflected, according to the incoming president of the Insurance Institute of Ireland, in the lower number of insurance claims arising from specific criminal operations.  This must inevitably lead to a beneficial effect on the general level of insurance premiums and the availability of insurance.</P>
    <P>I was saddened to see both Deputy Woods and Deputy Briscoe engaging in the course of their contributions in scaremongering by suggesting that this Bill will result in the establishment on a wide scale of protection rackets.  Deputy Flynn also referred to this.  Allegations in regard to the operation of protection rackets have been made before but, when investigated by the Garda Síochána, no evidance was adduced to substantiate the, allegations.</P>

      <P>Before I leave the general area of crime in so far as it relates to <Col N="1188" /> this Bill I want to refer to one remark made by Deputy Woods.  He contended that there is an essential contradiction in the position of the Minister for Justice when he says, on the one hand, that the level of crime is falling and, on the other, that the level of malicious injuries compensation is going up.  I would point out to Deputies that there is a three year limitation period in which the proceedings for compensation for malicious damage must be commenced.  There can, therefore, be a delay of up to three years in processing claims and, as a result, there would always be a timelag between a fall off in crime and a reduction in the claims for compensation.</P>
      <P>I now turn to the question of insurance. The only public pronouncement which has been made by the insurance industry in relation to this Bill of which I am aware is the statement reported in <i>The Irish Press</i> of 30 January 1986 by a spokesman for one of the insurance companies who said that, while the measure would have an effect on premiums, he did not expect a dramatic increase.  For Deputies to suggest that there will be a dramatic and widespread increase in insurance premiums solely as a result of this Bill is wild exaggeration.  Owners of certain properties, particularly in urban areas, will obviously be affected to some degree. However, the cost of insurance for the average citizen is unlikely to be greatly affected whether it is in respect of his house or motor car, by this Bill.  Deputy Woods alleged, and I quote&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Deputy had his time.  I quote:</P>
      <P>...the Minister's proposals will directly cause motor and motor cycle insurance premiums to rocket upwards....</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have to point out that it is in limited circumstances only &mdash; for example, where a car is stolen and then recovered damaged &mdash; that substantial claims arise <Col N="1189" /> in respect of motor vehicles.  The number and cost of claims of this nature is small compared with the number and cost of motor insurance claims in respect of accidental damage and personal injury.  Any increase in car insurance premiums as a result of this Bill should therefore be negligible.</P>
    <P>I have another reason for saying this. The present position whereby compensation is payable under the malicious injuries scheme without the need to prove malicious intent, where a car is taken and recovered crashed, is a result of a Supreme Court decision handed down in June 1984 on the interpretation of the 1981 Malicious Injuries Act.  Commenting on that decision a spokesman for the Irish Insurance Association was reported in <i>The Irish Press</i> of 8 June 1984 to have said that he would be slow to say that costs would actually go down for motorists as a result of the decision because such cases were not major items in terms of overall motor insurance costs but that it should certainly serve to help contain the costs at least.  Now that the position as affects such claims is, in effect, being reversed I would expect that insurance companies would be equally slow to consider raising premiums on account of what, in relation to the more costly claims affecting cars under the malicious injuries scheme, is a return to the pre-1981 position.</P>
    <P>Both Deputies Woods and Hyland claimed that about 50 per cent of the amount of compensation paid out under the malicious injuries scheme relates to damage to cars and motorcycles.  There is no statistical evidence to back up that claim.  In fact there is no evidence that the cost of malicious damage claims in relation to cars and motorcycles constitutes a major element in the overall cost of malicious damage compensation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell:</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Woods referred to figures contained in a survey carried <Col N="1190" /> out by Dublin Corporation.  I understand that in 1985 Dublin Corporation prepared an estimated breakdown of malicious injuries claims for their area.  That suggested that 48 per cent of the number of claims in 1984 was for damage to cars and motorcycles.  I should have reservations even in quoting that figure as its statistical base could be called into question.  But there is no basis whatsoever for suggesting that because 48 per cent of the number of claims related to motorcars and cycles that 48 per cent of the amount of compensation paid out was in respect of these vehicles.  Dublin Corporation do not keep statistics of the cost of claims broken down so as to give the cost in relation to motor cars.  But a statistical exercise carried out in Sligo revealed that in 1983, while 39 per cent of the number of claims related to motor vehicles, they account for 5 per cent only of the total amount of compensation claimed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell:</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of Deputies on both sides of the House said that as a result of this legislation businesses may have problems in obtaining malicious damage cover in particular areas and suggested that specific provision be made for such cases.  This problem already exists in relation to other forms of insurance cover &mdash; for example, theft and fire insurance <Col N="1194" />&mdash; and the enactment of this Bill will not dramatically alter the situation.  I understand that in some instances the reluctance of insurers to provide cover may relate to the fact that one is dealing with old buildings which may be fire hazards due to the material used in construction, lack of sprinkler systems, faulty electrical wiring and such like.  This is not to deny that a real problem may exist. We have listened to the Deputies on this point and recognise their concern.  It is, however, primarily an insurance matter. The Minister for Justice is taking it up with his colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, to see if anything can be done to deal with any possible vacuum that might result from the passing of this Bill.</P>
      <P>Deputy Woods has been very liberal in his use of quotations from sources in the insurance industry to provide precise figures for increases in insurance rates arising from this Bill.  The prime motive behind any private sector firm, including those in the insurance sector, is to make a profit.  They are of course, perfectly entitled to put forward their views on any legislation that might affect them. However, because the insurance industry have a particular interest in the matter they cannot be regarded as being entirely neutral.  As a result any views they put forward on the likely increase in insurance premiums as a result of this Bill have to be viewed in that light.  The Deputy quoted pending increases of 45 per cent in primary school insurance premiums and 30 per cent in the case of post primary schools.  I am not going to comment on those figures.  However, I would point out that insurance premiums charged to schools cover many other risks apart from malicious damage &mdash; for example, public liability, the pupils, staff, indemnity of staff and board members and school buildings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that the existing level of primiums is likely to be increased, partly because of anticipated increased costs for insurers arising from this Bill, but also because extended cover is to be provided in the area of public liability and indemnity. <Col N="1195" /> These increases will, of course, be subject to the normal consultation process between the insurance industry and the Department of Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <P>As to the particular matter of damage caused to school buildings through vandalism the Ministers for Education and Justice are fully conscious of the problems facing schools in this area.  The question was the subject of discussions between officials of the Department of Justice and officials of the Department of Education.  As Deputy Woods and other Deputies rightly pointed out, schools in certain areas face particular problems.  I understand that the Department of Education are working closely with those schools in order to improve security by such measures as the installation of unbreakable glass and better fencing.</P>
    <P>Deputy Leonard and Deputy O'Hanlon raised the question of certain damage caused maliciously to local authority property which does not come within the scope of the Malicious Injuries Scheme. The Minister for Justice is having consultations about this matter with the Minister for the Environment.  What is essentially at issue here is the way in which the cost of repairing such damage should be met.  This may well be a matter that might be more appropriately considered in the context of the general funding of local authorities but, as I have said, the Minister for Justice is in consultation with the Minister for the Environment on the question.</P>
    <P>Deputy Leonard also asked about providing some kind of appeal mechanism if a certificate is refused by a chief superintendent. The example he quoted relates to a non-statutory scheme under which the Government reimburse local authorities the full cost of compensation awarded agains them for damage caused by the use of explosives and relating to the disturbances in Northern Ireland.  As, under the new scheme, the full cost of all awards will be met by the Exchequer, that particular scheme will terminate once the Bill comes into effect.  There will then be a statutory scheme in its place <Col N="1196" /> and the question whether an organisation of the type mentioned in section 2 of the Bill was involved will, in the event of a dispute on the issue, be decided upon by the courts.  Provision of a certificate by a chief superintendent is intended to help the applicant prove that such an organisation was involved.  If the chief superintendent refuses to give a certificate it will be open to the applicant to use other evidence to prove to the court that such an organisation was involved.  In the light of that there does not seem to be a need for any further appeal mechanism.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kelly's point in relation to section 8 of the Bill will be considered before Committee Stage but it may be said at this juncture that section 8 is continuing the same basic provision that exists in section 22 of the 1981 Act which as far as I am aware has not given rise to any particular difficulties.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flynn also mentioned that no special provision was being made in relation to agricultural property.  There is no particular problem in obtaining insurance cover for agricultural property.  Many companies provide insurance in this area, including the Farmers' Business Development Insurance Company established by the Irish Farmers' Association in 1970. In addition, disputes which might involve malicious damage are no longer a common feature.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flynn referred to the fact that in England there was compensation available for malicious damage in certain circumstances.  In fact, in England compensation for malicious damage is available only when the damage results from disorder caused by riot.  No compensation is available from public funds in respect of damage caused in any other circumstances.  This has been the position in England since the last century.</P>
    <P>Deputy Skelly spoke about abuse in relation to claims for malicious damage under the existing schemes.  He said that if this problem were dealt with the level of claims would be reduced.  The fact is that in the final analysis it is a matter for the courts to decide whether a claim is well founded or not.  The claimant must prove his case to the satisfaction of the <Col N="1197" /> court.  Of course, the matter might not go to court if the local authority is in no doubt that the damage was caused maliciously.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cowen claimed that it is not possible to claim compensation for malicious damage unless those who caused the damage are unknown.  This is not correct.  It may be that in many cases the actual perpetrators will be unknown but this is not a condition for claiming compensation.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would again make the point that what the Government are doing here is transferring an existing charge on the public purse &mdash; in other words the general taxpayer &mdash; to where it essentially belongs.  The Government see no reason why the ordinary taxpayer in Ireland should any longer be subject to a greater burden in this respect than his counterpart in other countries.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 15 and 16 together.</P>
      <P>The Report of the Commission on Social Welfare was laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas on 11 June 1986 providing Deputies and Senators with the opportunity of examining the contents of the report before publication.</P>
      <P>The report is currently being printed and I expect that copies will be available for circulation to all members of the Oireachtas by mid-July.  At the same time, the report will be made available to the public generally.</P>
      <P>The level of additional social welfare expenditure to finance all of the commission's proposals, over £560 million in 1985 terms, prevents full immediate implementation of the recommendations. Nonetheless, the Government will be examining ways in which improvements to the system can be made within the overall financial constraints which exist.  The question of a debate by the House on the report has yet to be decided but I would envisage that such a debate will take place.</P>

      <P>My Department is at present implementing a major programme of computerisation aimed at improved levels of service to the public while at the same time developing additional safeguards and fraud control features.  Part of this programme involves increasing the number of visual display units &mdash; VDU's &mdash; from 600 to 800 during 1986.  While many of these will be used in the headquarters buildings in Dublin, some will be installed in employment exchanges and information offices around the country to provide quick access to claim information for claimants.</P>
      <P>In view of the critical nature of the Department's systems and the expansion of the country-wide network, other factors, in addition to cost and origin of the VDU's, had to be carefully considered. Products of proven reliability capable of being maintained on a countrywide basis were required.  The Department is satisfied that the products chosen best met the various criteria.</P>
      <P>The normal tendering procedures were followed.  All the companies invited to tender have bases in Ireland and in fact both successful companies are substantial employers in this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mrs. Hussey):</NameTxt>
      <P>As announced in the National Plan <i>Building on Reality 1985-1987</i> the Government have decided to rationalise the existing child support system through the introduction of a new child benefit scheme which would unify in a single payment State support towards the cost of rearing children.  The new payment would be paid directly to the mother and would be treated as part of taxable income for the taxpayer in the family.</P>
      <P>As a first step, the Government decided to introduce, with effect from April 1986, a non-taxable child benefit scheme.  Under this scheme a monthly child benefit of £15.05 is paid for each of the first five children and a monthly payment of £21.75 is paid for the sixth and subsequent child.</P>
      <P>It is intended to introduce the fully taxable child benefit scheme as soon as it is possible to do so.  There are still a number of administrative and technical problems associated with this part of the proposal and these are at present under consideration by my Department.</P>
      <P>The Commission on Social Welfare have made a number of recommendations on family income support and I will be taking these into account in future developments in this area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mrs. Hussey):</NameTxt>
      <P>In accordance with Government policy as set out in the White Paper <i>Serving the Country Better</i> the management systems of my Department are being reviewed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A first significant step in this direction was taken late last year when my Department was reorganised along the lines set out in the White Paper.  The reorganisation of the Department involves the structuring of the Department <Col N="951" /> into two separate areas.  One area headed by the secretary is responsible for advising the Minister on policy matters.  The other, known as the social welfare services office, deals with purely executive work and is responsible for the day-to-day running of the schemes and services of my Department.  The main objective of this new approach is to enable those concerned with the operation of the various schemes to concentrate more fully on effective management and the provision of an efficient and speedy delivery of services.</P>
    <P>This restructuring is a major step in the programme of modernisation of my Department's services which has been underway for some time and which has been largely based on the extension of the latest computer technology into practically all areas of the Department's business. The various other measures proposed in the Government's White Paper will be implemented as soon as possible.  In addition to the foregoing the Department is at present in the process of engaging expert consultant assistance to undertake a review of systems with particular reference to the unemployment payments area in view of the publicity given in recent months to incidences of fraud.</P>

      <P>The computerisation of the Department's pension payments systems has been largely completed and it is possible to consider giving pensioners the most modern payment facilities which computerisation can make available. Among these facilities is the possibility of providing pensioners with the option of having their pensons paid directly into Post Office or bank accounts.  This matter has, in fact been under consideration by my Department for some time and we <Col N="952" /> are currently at the stage where a questionnaire is about to be issued to a sample of retirement pensioners in order to ascertain the level of interest in such a system.</P>
      <P>It will also be necessary to have discussions with staff interests on the revised arrangements.  If everything goes according to plan it is hoped to have a pilot scheme in operation for retirement pensions early next year.</P>

However, on the basis of sample returns, it is estimated that the amount paid to such persons by the Southern Health Board in the period from April 1984 to March 1985 was in the region of £1.85 million.  There are, however, arrangements whereby amounts paid by health boards in the circumstances mentioned are reimbursed on request out of social welfare payments when the latter payments become due to the persons concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mrs. Hussey):</NameTxt>
      <P>The widow's non-contributory pension was discontinued in September 1985, because the means of the person in question, derived from a farm holding <Col N="953" /> and small amount of capital, were assessed at £65.79 a week.  This exceeds the limit of £46 a week applicable to a widow under 66 years of age with no qualified children.</P>
      <P>She appealed against this decision but the appeal was disallowed by an appeals officer on 17 January 1986.  I have arranged for a social welfare officer to pay another visit to the person concerned to furnish an up-to-date report on her circumstances. The position will be reviewed in the light of the officer's report.</P>

In recent years new offices have been opened in the Navan Road, Thomas Street, Tallaght, Tara Street and Ballymun. It is proposed to open further exchanges in Clondalkin, Rathfarnham, Coolock, Finglas, Blanchardstown and Ballyfermot.  Bringing services to areas <Col N="954" /> where they are needed in considered to be the most satisfactory way of dealing with this matter.  A system of vouchers as envisaged by the Deputy would be costly in itself and would also be costly as well as difficult to administer.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, arising from his replies to Parliamentary Questions Nos. 6 and 14 of 12 March 1986, whether a decision has now been received at British Home Office level on whether there are sufficient grounds to warrant referring the cases of the Birmingham Six to the Court of Appeal there; and whether he will make a statement on the up-to-date situation in the light of progress or otherwise at that level.</P>

      <P>I am advised that the review of the case of the six men who were convicted in 1975 for offences in connection with the bombing of two public houses in Birmingham is still under consideration by the British Home Secretary, Mr. Douglas Hurd.</P>
      <P>I recently received a reply from Mr. Hurd to the representations I had made in which he stated that he was carefully considering the points which were raised in the &ldquo;World in Action&rdquo; television programme on 28 October 1985, and that consideration of that aspect of the case was almost complete.  However the Home Office had recently been presented with further material, which is to be the subject of a book to be published shortly, and the Home Secretary is anxious to take account of this information before reaching a final decision on the question of referral to the Court of Appeal.</P>
      <P>I hope that the Home Secretary will decide in favour of referring these cases to the Court of Appeal and I will be keeping myself informed of developments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> Total trade between Ireland and South Africa has grown from £22.726 million in 1980 to £49.956 million in 1985.  Exports in 1985 amounted to £29.551 million ranking South Africa as our 27th export market in that year.  Imports from South Africa in 1985 amounted to £20.405 million giving Ireland therefore a trade surplus of £9.145 million</P>
      <P>Our principle exports by classification in 1985 to South Africa were organic chemicals, office machines and ADP equipment, medicinal and pharmaceutical products, industrial machinery and miscellaneous edible products.</P>
      <P>Our main imports by classification from South Africa in 1985 were fruit and vegetables, coal, coke and briquettes, fertilisers, textiles and iron and steel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Government decided on 20 March 1986 to introduce a system of licensing for the importation, from 1 October 1986, of South African fruit and vegetables.  The Department of Agriculture will be the licensing agency.  The principal products involved are fruit, nuts or vegetables whether fresh, dried, frozen, tinned or in other processed or preserved form including extracts and juices produced or manufactured in South Africa.  It is not possible to quantify the exact effects which these restrictions will have but given past consumption it is obvious that <Col N="959" /> similar products must be sought elsewhere.</P>
    <P>The South Africans have already made demarches to countries including Ireland which have taken sanctions against them. It is, therefore not unlikely that there will be exchanges under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).</P>

In addition I have arranged for special patrols by the Navy.  Unfortunately many of the people engaged in such illegal activities when challenged violently resist the efforts of fishery officers in carrying out their duties.  I must stress that the various protection regulations on salmon fishing are designed to conserve salmon stocks and to provide an equitable share of the salmon catch for the different categories of fishermen involved.  I cannot condone breaches of the law or the violent behaviour of some offenders which places staff engaged on fishery protection work at serious risk. My aim is to enforce the necessary conservation measures in as fair and equitable a manner as possible in the interests of the future of the fishery.</P>

      <P>I have no firm <Col N="983" /> evidence that serious damage has been caused to salmon stocks on the River Slaney up-stream of Clohamon Weir. However, in deference to representations made to me by various angling interests I have arranged that scentists from my Department will carry out a survey of the area shortly with a view to establishing if fish are being held up at the weir and, if so, the reasons therefore and what remedial action needs to be taken.</P>
      <P>The fish pass in the weir was constructed by the Eastern Regional Fisheries Board in 1984 and designed by my Department.  A counter was installed in the pass in January 1985 and it recorded 2,600 salmon moving up-stream through the fish pass in that year.  It appears that the counter and pass were working satisfactorily at that time.</P>

      <P>I have recently received a submission from Limerick Chamber of Commerce in regard to the provision in section 17 of the Harbours Bill, 1986, as it affects them.  I will consider the points made but I must emphasise that the proposed Shannon Ports Authority will have responsibility for the administration and development of the entire Shannon Estuary, with the exception of the harbour within the jurisdiction of Foynes Harbour Trustees initially, and I believe that the provision in section 17 is necessary to reflect the changed circumstances.</P>

      <P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that, in addition to his retirement pension, the taxpayer is now in receipt of a social welfare pension. Both sources of income are chargeable to income tax.  In accordance with standard practice the aggregate tax free allowances under PAYE specified in the taxpayer's certificate of tax free allowances for 1986-87 are reduced to take account of the social welfare pension which is paid gross, the tax attributable to it being recovered <Col N="987" /> under PAYE from the other income by means of the restricted tax free allowances.</P>
      <P>On the basis of the information which has recently become available to the inspector of taxes, the restriction in respect of the social welfare pension for the current year, 1986-87, is overstated and the taxpayer has also been granted certain tax free allowances to which he is no longer entitled.  An amended certificate of tax free allowances for 1986-87 showing the correct restriction and incorporating all the allowances and reliefs to which he has proved title will be issued to the taxpayer as soon as possible.  Any tax overdeducted from the taxpayer's retirement pension since 6 April 1986 will be refunded to him by the payer of that pension when the amended certificate is put into operation.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 123 and 124 together.  The temporary preservation order made on 24 December 1985 remained in force for six months and has now expired.  As the circumstances of danger to a national monument which must exist before a preservation order can be made are deemed not to exist now, it is not possible to make a fresh preservation order.  Instead, Rathfarnham Castle has been afforded the protection of listing under section 8 of <Col N="994" /> the National Monuments (Amendment) Act, 1954, following the publication of a list of monuments in the <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> of 20 June 1986.</P>
      <P>As I explained in my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 95 of 17 June 1986 Dublin County Council passed a resolution on 13 January 1986 instructing the county manager to negotiate for the acquisition of the property.

      <P>I am aware of the Midland Health Board's proposal to close two wards for elderly or psycho-geriatric patients, at St. Fintan's Hospital, Portlaoise this year. This will be facilitated by the board's <Col N="995" /> success in being able to discharge some patients to more suitable accommodation in the community and to transfer others to more appropriate geriatric institutional care in the area.  The relocation of patients to facilities, especially community based facilities, which more appropriately meet their particular needs is clearly in line with the recommendations of the report <i>Psychiatric Services &mdash; Planning for the Future</i> published last year.  It is also in line with the Midland Health Board's own plans to decentralise services currently provided in their psychiatric hospitals, including St. Fintan's to locally based psychiatric teams.</P>
      <P>The development of the kind of community orientated psychiatric service recommended in <i>Psychiatric Services &mdash; Planning for the Future</i>, and now widely accepted as the best way of treating most mental illness, will inevitably mean a continuation of the already well established trend towards a diminishing role for the psychiatric hospital, and its centralised institutional style of providing care.</P>

      <P>Guidelines on the development of a community psychiatric service are set out in detail in the report <i>Psychiatric Services &mdash; Planning for the Future</i> published last year.  The overall objective of such a service is to ensure that as many people as possible receive treatment in their normal social environment, thus avoiding the need for admission to hospital.  The achievement of this objective will necessitate the development at local level of a range of facilities including day hospitals, day centres, hostels, sheltered accommodation and work shops, retraining centres etc.  The report recommends that these services should be organised around multidisciplinary psychiatric <Col N="997" /> teams, each serving specifically defined geographic areas.</P>
      <P>This process of implementing this policy has already begun with the preparation by each health board of a detailed plan as to how they envisage this type of service being developed in each of their respective areas.  These plans are currently being examined in my Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond):</NameTxt>
      <P>The main principle underlying the provision of mental handicap services is to ensure that people with a mental handicap, both adults and children, should enjoy life that is as normal as possible in close association with their families and friends.  The services which are provided for adults and which are being further developed are aimed at supporting this principle.  These services include: Continuing Assessment Services; Day Care Units; Vocational and Long-term Training Centres; Residential Services.</P>

Support is also provided at the many branches of Alcoholics Anonymous throughout the country, often in association with Alanon and Alateen centres for the families of persons with alcohol related problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recent years there has been a definite movement away from institutional care for persons with alcohol-related problems, and a growing tendency to treat alcoholism on an out-patient basis.  The report <i>Psychiatric Services &mdash; Planning <Col N="999" /> for the Future</i> published last year, which sets guidelines for the development of the psychiatric services, recommends that in future, the approach to alcohol-related problems should be based more on prevention than on treatment and that the service should be community based with major emphasis on out-patient treatment.</P>
    <P>Health boards are now drawing up their plans for comprehensive psychiatric services and it is intended that local alcoholism services, in accordance with the guidelines set down in the report will be included as part of this service.</P>

      <P>In the development of institutional services for the elderly more emphasis is being placed on proper assessment so that the needs of the patient are indentified at an early stage and steps taken to meet these needs.  The general approach to providing an assessment service is to have a geriatric assessment unit as a specialised department in a general hospital with a physician in geriatric medicine as the consultant in charge of the unit.  The planning of all new general hospitals contains provision for geriatric assessment units.  In a number of hospitals geriatric assessment services are under the direction of a general physician or a general practitioner with a special interest in the elderly.

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond) Barry Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond):</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very concerned at statements which have been made recently in the media and elsewhere suggesting that foster parents could find themselves having to pay compensation to natural parents in the event of injuries occurring to foster children in their care.</P>
      <P>These statements have alarmed many foster parents and caused much anxiety to social workers and others in health boards who are striving to develop foster care as an alternative to residential care for children.  Apart from any other consideration, fears of this nature are not conductive to foster parents treating foster children as integral members of their families.</P>
      <P>I am advised that no claim by a natural parent against a foster parent in respect of injuries to a foster child would succeed unless the foster parent was either directly responsible for the injury or had contributed to it by being negligent in not looking after the child properly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me, therefore, that the overwhelming majority of foster parents who are doing their best to look after foster children as they would care for children of their own have absolutely no reason to fear.  The only situation where a foster parent would have reason to fear <Col N="1003" /> is where he or she had caused or contributed to a child's injury.  I am sure the Deputy will agree that it would neither be proper nor desirable for a health board to shield such persons by providing some form of indemnity to foster parents, irrespective of responsibility for the injury.</P>

      <P>Additional anaesthetists are appointed by employing authorities in line with the statutory provisions and other procedures required prior to the making of such appointments.  These processes include a requirement that my Department will give its observations on the financial implications before an application is made to Comhairle na nOspidéal for approval to a consultant post.  Comhairle na nOspidéal is the statutory body set up under the Health Act, 1970 to regulate the number and type of appointments of consultant medical staff.</P>
      <P>At present the following proposals for additional appointments in the North-Eastern Health Board are being processed:&mdash;</P>
      <P>One post in Louth County Hospital in respect of which observations on the financial implications of approving the additional post have recently been issued by my Department.  Approval for this post is now a matter for Comhairle na nOspidéal.</P>
      <P>A proposal to create a post at Cavan General Hospital was recently submitted by the North-Eastern Health Board.  This is currently being processed and the observations on the financial implications of approving the post will be issued in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A proposal in respect of an additional post at Monaghan General Hospital was received from the health board some time <Col N="1004" /> ago.  About £¼ million would be required to fund this post and this is being examined at present.</P>

The measures which have been approved by the board towards the realisation of the targetted reductions include reductions in payroll costs including reductions in locum costs and payroll extras, and in travelling expenses and energy costs.  It is understood that further measures to achieve cost reductions are being considered.</P>

      <P>Entitlement to unemployment assistance is dependent on the condition that the claimant must be available for and genuinely seeking work.  Following a review, the unemployment assistance claim of the person concerned was disallowed from 8 October 1985 on the grounds that he was not genuinely seeking work.  He appealed against the disallowance and in February 1986 the appeals officer allowed his claim with effect from 9 December 1985.  He was, accordingly, entitled to payment at the maximum long term rate appropriate in his case of £92.35.  However due to a clerical error he was incorrectly paid at the short term rate of £86.75.</P>
      <P>Arrears of unemployment assistance due to the person concerned for the period 9 December 1985 to 4 February 1986 of £722.92 were paid to the health board in lieu of supplementary welfare allowance paid to him pending the outcome of his appeal.  Additional arrears of £90.25 now due as a result of the clerical error will be paid to him this week.  Further weekly payments of £92.35 will continue to be made as they become due.</P>

      <P>The person concerned was in receipt of unemployment benefit up to 20 December 1985 when he had drawn his maximum entitlement of 390 days benefit.  In order to requalify for payment of benefit, he would be required to have a further 13 contributions paid in respect of insurable employment.  Contributions paid after drawing 156 days benefit on a claim are counted for this purpose.  He did not satisfy this condition for entitlement to benefit from 21 December 1985.  He was, however, paid unemployment assistance from 21 December 1985 to 11 March 1986 after which date he ceased to sign the unemployed register.</P>
      <P>He claimed unemployment benefit from 12 May 1986.  Inquiries had to be made to ascertain if he had the necessary number of contributions to requalify for benefit.  When he furnished the relevant documentary evidence it was established that he had the necessary 13 contributions paid since drawing 156 days benefit in order to requalify for payment of benefit. In addition to being employed for the period from 10 March 1986 to 9 May 1986, he had also been employed for periods during August and September 1985.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Accordingly, his claim was allowed at <Col N="1007" /> £93.70 weekly, being the maximum rate appropriate to a married man with three child dependants.  All arrears due were issued to him last week.  As he has insufficient earnings in the relevant income tax year, he is not entitled to pay-related benefit.  Weekly payments of £93.70 will continue to be made as they become due.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mrs. Hussey):</NameTxt>
      <P>Pay-related benefit, which is payable in addition to flat rate unemployment benefit, is calculated on the basis of reckonable earnings in the income tax year which governs the claim, that is, the last complete income tax year before the benefit year in which the claim for unemployment benefit commenced.  The person concerned claimed unemployment benefit from 24 March 1986 and his claim was allowed at the weekly flat rate of £65.10 being the maximum rate appropriate to a married man with an adult dependant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>His entitlement to pay-related benefit is based on his earnings in the income tax year from 6 April 1984 to 5 April 1985. <Col N="1008" /> His earnings in that period were £7,277 and accordingly, he is entitled to payment of pay-related benefit at the weekly rate of £24.13 with effect from 14 April 1986. His combined weekly payment of flat rate unemployment benefit and pay-related benefit, therefore, amounts to £89.23. Further payments at this rate will continue as they become due.</P>

The delay which occurred in reviewing the unemployment assistance claim of the person concerned is regretted.</P>

He appealed against the disallowance and an appeals officer on 11 June 1986 assessed him with means of £14.40 weekly.</P>
      <P>He is, accordingly, in receipt of unemployment assistance of £17.35 weekly being the appropriate maximum rate payable in his case of £31.75 less means of £14.40.

      <P>The payment of higher rates of unemployment assistance in certain urban areas than in other areas has always been a feature of the unemployment assistance scheme.  It can be argued that in principle the same rates of assistance should apply in all areas.  However the establishment of a unified rate of assistance would have financial implications and would be a matter for consideration in a budgetary context.</P>
      <P>The existence of separate fuel schemes in certain urban areas with different conditions of entitlement from those which apply under the national fuel scheme administered by the health boards is not a satisfactory situation.  The possibility of effecting a rationalisation of the fuel schemes is being examined.</P>

These inquiries were recently completed and her claim was allowed at the weekly flat rate of unemployment benefit of £57.85, being the appropriate rate payable in her case.

      <P>The person concerned claimed disability benefit from 29 April 1985. Payment was disallowed from 12 June 1985 following his examination by a medical referee who expressed the opinion that he was capable of work.  He was notified accordingly and advised to contact his local employment office to claim unemployment benefit if he was available for work.  He appealed against the disallowance of his disability benefit claim and was examined by a different medical referee on 14 August 1985 who also considered him to be capable of work.  He was notified of the result of this examination and was supplied with a form on which to set out the grounds for an appeal if he wished his case to be referred to an appeals officer for determination.  A reminder was issued on 27 November 1985 and when no reply was received his appeal was withdrawn.</P>
      <P>He claimed unemployment benefit from 20 August 1985 on which date he requested permission to sign the unemployed register retrospectively for the period from 12 June 1985 to 19 August 1985.  His case was considered by a deciding officer who was of the opinion that he did not show good cause for the delay in claiming unemployment benefit and, accordingly, permission to sign retrospectively was refused.</P>
      <P>Payment of unemployment benefit continued from 20 August 1985 to 15 October 1985 when he had drawn his maximum entitlement of 390 days. During this period he was paid at the special reduced rate of benefit payable to a claimant who does not satisfy the condition of having 280 contributions paid in the seven year period prior to the claim.  According to the Department's records the person concerned was last employed in 1980.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He claimed unemployment assistance from 16 October 1985 and was paid on the <Col N="1028" /> basis of a qualification certificate showing weekly means of £41.30.  Following an appeal against the means assessment an appeals officer reduced the weekly means assessment to £40 with effect from 7 May 1986.  He was, accordingly, in receipt of unemployment assistance of £52.35 weekly, being the appropriate maximum rate payable in his case of £92.35 less means of £40.</P>
    <P>The person concerned submitted a further claim to disability benefit from 26 May 1986 and payment has been issued to 17 June 1986, the date of the latest medical certificate received, less supplementary welfare allowance of £149.35 advanced by the Western Health Board.</P>

      <P>In 1982, the main College of Marketing and Design building at 18/19 Parnell Square was considered to be inadequate for the number of students and unsuitable for major development.  A site at Bishop Street was purchased and it is proposed to have it reconstructed in order to accommodate both the College of Marketing and Design and the College of Commerce, Rathmines.</P>
      <P>The buildings at 18/19 Parnell Square, part of which were about 200 years old, had however to be vacated in 1983 in the interests of the safety of the users.  The college has been accommodated in rented premises since then, pending the carrying out of the works at Bishop Street.</P>
