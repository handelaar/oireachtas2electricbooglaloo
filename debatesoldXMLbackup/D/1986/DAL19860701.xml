      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That a sum not exceeding £245,847,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1986, for the <Col N="1542" /> salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, including certain services administered by that Office, and for payment of certain loans, subsidies, grants and grants-in-aid.</P>
    <P>The Estimate before us, provides, as indicated, for gross expenditure of just under £246 million in 1986, as compared with an outturn of some £255 million in 1985, an overall decrease of £9 million. Of this £9 million, £6.3 million relates to expenditure on the bread subsidy scheme, which is administered by my Department and reflects the reduction made in the standard rate of subsidy on 6 April 1986 as a result of the Government's decision to reduce food subsidies.</P>
    <P>The Estimate contains the major share of the public expenditure allocations for the development of industry.</P>
    <P>Again this year, allocations for the various State agencies reflect the policy, as set out in the White Paper on Industrial Policy, of laying a greater emphasis on technology acquisition and the promotion of an improved approach to marketing. There will continue to be close co-operation between the State agencies so that the assistance which can be provided to industry can be maximised.</P>
    <P>In 1985, industrial output increased by 2.7 per cent and industrial exports rose by 7 per cent.  This was a particularly heartening performance given the fact that world trade increased more slowly than had originally been expected.  Continued output growth was recorded in the chemical sector (3.8 per cent) while in the food sector, one of our more traditional areas, there was an increase of 5.1 per cent.  The electronics sector grew by a slower rate than in recent years, reflecting sluggish market conditions for that sector.</P>
    <P>In the course of 1985 some 11,000 jobs were actually created in IDA supported industries, while SFADCo created a total of 1,000 jobs in the Shannon Free Zone and in small indigenous industry in the mid-west region.</P>
    <P>However, despite these encouraging trends, there was a net reduction in <Col N="1543" /> manufacturing employment of 2.9 per cent but the rate of reduction has been decreasing since 1983.</P>
    <P>In terms of new investment £400 million was negotiated by IDA in over 1,000 projects, both indigenous and overseas. In particular the pace of investment in small industry continued to grow with an increase of 25 per cent on the 1984 level. First time entrepreneurs were evident in the new start-ups.  In 1985 the regionalisation of service to small industry was completed, with 138 of the IDA's staff now assigned specifically to working with small firms.</P>
    <P>In 1986, industrial output and exports are expected to grow by 5 per cent for the year as a whole.  Investment by industry supported by the IDA is expected to continue at a high level resulting in the creation of 12,000 new jobs while in the case of SFADCo, 1,200 new jobs are targeted. This development will be encouraged by the continuing fall in inflation, reduction in oil prices and favourable currency exchange movements.</P>
    <P>The recently published ESRI &ldquo;Medium-term Outlook&rdquo;, 1986-1990 predicts that total employment in the economy is expected to stabilise in 1986.  The industrial sector will contribute to this improved situation by its increased expenditure within Ireland in wages/salaries and through the purchase of indigenous raw materials, components and services.</P>
    <P>The Industrial Development Act, 1986, was enacted on 7 May 1986.  This represents a further important stage in the progressive implementation of the White Paper on Industrial Policy published in 1984.  Moreover the new Act brings together, for the first time, in one comprehensive code, the existing body of legislation relating to industrial development and the Industrial Development Authority.</P>
    <P>The Act gives effect to the new policy directives and incentives for industry in the White Paper and provides for:</P>
    <P>(a)  new selectivity criteria for grant assistance to industry;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1544" /> (b) the provision of technology acquisition grants for industry;</P>
    <P>(c) the provision of employment grants to small industry;</P>
    <P>(d) three-yearly reviews of industrial performance; and</P>
    <P>(e) the pre-payment of up to one-third of R &amp; D grants to small industry.</P>
    <P>The new selectivity criteria will focus on the need to develop and increase linkages between overseas and indigenous industry and in particular the development of import substitution projects and export markets.  Employment creation and maintenance, in addition to the new emphasis on output growth and generation of value added within the economy, will continue to be the main focus of State assistance to industry.  The new criteria will result in a shift in resources from fixed assets to technology acquisition and marketing.</P>
    <P>Grant assistance will in future be directed to remedying perceived weaknesses in Irish industry in the areas of marketing, management, research and development and innovation.  Companies approved for grant assistance will, therefore, have to demonstrate that they will comply with the new criteria, have suitable company development plans and also that the equity base-financial structure of the company is adequate.  The new employment grants will allow promoters of new small industry projects, at their discretion, to avail of employment grants as an alternative to grants towards the cost of machinery and buildings.  The result will be to encourage more small industry start-ups.  A promoter will now have the option of using employment grants to acquire modern second-hand equipment which would not qualify for capital grants.  This will be of particular benefit to industries such as clothing and engineering where there is excellent second-hand equipment available at present.</P>
    <P>The IDA will be in a position to offer grants not exceeding 50 per cent towards the costs of acquiring new product or process technology, including patents, designs, trade marks, copy-rights and <Col N="1545" /> proprietary and non-proprietary knowhow. The prepayment of up to one-third of R &amp; D grants will greatly assist small companies to undertake accelerated product and process development and greatly ease their cash flow requirements for these programmes.</P>
    <P>To ensure that industrial policy evolves in an orderly and planned manner, and that Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas are made aware of the costs and benefits of industrial policy at regular intervals, the Act includes a new provision for a review of national industrial performance every three years.  These triennial reviews and the conclusions arising from such reviews will be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.  This is an important provision as I believe that Government policy in an ever-changing sector such as industry needs to be dynamic and constantly fine-tuned to maximising new opportunities and technical developments.</P>
    <P>In fact, a policy review of developments since publication of the White Paper is already under way within my Department.  The review group is addressing a number of important issues such as how direct employment can be maximised from the industrial sector and what further steps can be taken to develop indigenous industry.  The results of the review will be available before the end of 1986.</P>
    <P>The national linkage programme got under way in July 1985.  The objective of the programme is to develop a successful subsupply industrial base in Ireland for larger industry.  From its initial focus on the electronics sector, it is now being extended to healthcare, consumer products and engineering.  In 1985 a national linkage team of experienced engineers and management and financial accountants was assembled from a number of the major State agencies.  The target for 1986 is to place £40 million worth of business contracts with Irish suppliers.</P>
    <P>The company development programme involves the IDA, the IIRS and Córas Tráchtála working closely with selected companies to help them to identify <Col N="1546" /> and implement strategic development initiatives.  The programme is designed primarily to encourage indigenous companies to develop to a point where they are capable of developing their own R &amp; D programmes and achieving a strong international marketing position. Already many of the strategic initiatives identified by companies under the programme are being implemented.  The operating target for 1986 is that 50 companies will be covered under the company development programme.</P>
    <P>A further major step in the development of industry was taken this year when the legislation setting up the National Development Corporation was enacted in March.  The necessary administrative measures to bring the corporation into existence have been completed and the corporation became fully operational on 11 June 1986.  The portfolio of investments built up by the National Enterprise Agency, NEA, which as the House is aware has been replaced by the NDC, has been taken on board by the corporation.  The level of funding allocated to the NEA/NDC for 1986 reflects the interim position of one and the coming into being of the other.</P>
    <P>The National Development Corporation is a major element in the Government's industrial and job creation strategy.  The corporation, with its equity investment powers, will be a potent force in the establishment of job creating enterprises with good profit potential, either on its own initiative or in partnership with other investors.</P>
    <P>In the past many new employment creating projects have failed to get off the ground because the level of capital funding required, the length of the payback period or the element of risk were all greater than the private sector on its own was willing to bear.  By demonstrating a willingness to share the risk associated with such projects, the NDC can also be the catalyst in generating greater private sector investment in industry.  As this sharing of risk will be on a commercial basis the NDC will also share in any profits.</P>
    <P>At this point I should like to refer to <Col N="1547" /> the provision made for further assistance in relation to Clondalkin Paper Mills. Deputies will be pleased to hear that the State's role in respect of the resumption of paper-making at Clondalkin Paper Mills is nearing completion.</P>
    <P>Under various legal agreements involving myself, the IDA and FMI International Ltd., to whom the mills assets have been transferred, I am having a programme of refurbishment carried-out at the mills to prepare the assets for paper-manufacturing.  The refurbishment programme encompasses all relevant aspects of paper-mill operation, including, for example, plant and equipment, services, effluent control and disposal, and factory cleanliness.  The programme has been substantially completed and I am very pleased to say that the company is at this moment producing and selling paper.</P>
    <P>I want to take this opportunity to wish the company well in its endeavours, and to congratulate all the parties involved in bringing about what I hope and expect will be the successful revival of paper-manufacturing in the location where it has traditionally dominated the industrial landscape.</P>
    <P>I have referred to the perceived weaknesses which exist in Irish industry in the areas of research and development and innovation.  I would like to develop this point in the context of the contribution which can be made by science and technology to industrial development by way of the introduction of new products, the improvement of existing products and the improvement of processes and, above all, in the aggregation of these various elements, by increasing the competitiveness of our industry.  There are three elements in our approach to research &mdash; the universities, the research institutions and industry itself.  The efforts of all must be adequate and must be integrated into a highly efficient total national effort. Coupled with the research side is the need to promote technology acquisition, a point I have referred to earlier.  The Government have various measures in train to optimise the national effort in <Col N="1548" /> science and technology in all these respects.</P>
    <P>On a wider plane there is a need for Europe itself to narrow the competitive gap <i>vis-à-vis</i> the United States and Japan. It is important for us, therefore, to tackle this matter at two levels, the closing of the leeway between Ireland and the more developed countries of Europe, who are, of course, at this level, our competitors but also, in turn, to make our maximum contribution to Europe's effort to close the gap with its competitors.  In this regard we are attempting to optimise our participation in various multinational programmes under the European Economic Community, the European Space Agency, the new EUREKA programme and bilaterally.  All these efforts are directed towards raising the technological level of Irish industry, not just by way of the development of new high technology industry but also by improving the technological base of industry generally.  This is essential to competitiveness.  We can get all the other elements right but still fail, if technologically, we cannot compete with the leaders in the areas which we have chosen as priorities.</P>
    <P>The appreciation by other countries and by Europe generally, of this need is evident from the exhortations of the Prime Ministers at the European Councils extending back several years past but, more particularly, in that it appears now to be central to the approach by our EC partners generally to the Community Second Framework Programme for Science and Technology which is to cover the years 1987 to 1991'</P>
    <P>The inclusion of industrial research in the programmes of the community is a comparatively recent innovation and, one has to say, is due in no small measure to the efforts of smaller countries like Ireland who have pressed continuously for a major effort in this area, looking particularly towards the needs of small and medium sized enterprises.</P>
    <P>The success of this effort is evident in the fact that the major element in the second framework programme is to be various programmes directed towards the <Col N="1549" /> importance of the competitiveness of industry and services.  These programmes will cover a wide range, running from the more obvious information technologies and telecommunications technologies to generic technologies for manufacturing industry, to biotechnology, materials science and technology, but also covering, more particularly, two new initiatives of special interest to this country &mdash; in marine science and technology and agro-industrial technology.  It is our intention to fight for the maximum appropriations for this very welcome expansion of Community activity in these key areas and also to ensure maximum participation and benefit for Ireland.</P>
    <P>I would like now to advise Deputies of some developments with regard to the comprehensive report on the food industry completed by the Ministers of State Food Group in July, 1985.  This report was submitted to the Ministers for Industry and Commerce, Agriculture, and Tourism, Fisheries and Forestry.  The Ministers of State, in compiling their report, had regard to a substantial number of written and oral submissions from a number of agencies and organisations closely involved in the food industry.  In the light of the report's conclusions and recommendations, the Taoiseach, when announcing details of the Cabinet reshuffle, included the appointment of Minister of State Hegarty, as a Minister of State at the Departments of Agriculture and Industry and Commerce, with special responsibility for food.  The Minister of State for Food is the Chairman of a permanent Food Committee, instituted following his appointment, comprising representatives of the relevant Departments and State agencies.</P>
    <P>The appointment of Minister of State Hegarty, and the establishment of this committee, is an indication of the strategic importance which the Government attach to the food industry.  A start has already been made to try and maximise efficiencies in the food sector, in terms of the mobilisation of State resources, and an orderly development of the industry to the benefit of all.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1550" /> My Department are currently examining proposals, prepared by SFADCo at my request, for an intensification of the food processing development role which was assigned to the company under the Government's White Paper on Industrial Policy.  As I stated, during my Second Stage speech in the Dáil on the recent SFADCo amendment Bill, the Government have assigned to SFADCo the very important role of conducting a pilot project on the development of the food processing sector.  The priority areas for action by the company include:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;Increasing the number of highcalibre entrepreneurs operating well structured firms in the food processing industry.</P>
    <P>&mdash;Stimulating the development of quality new products.</P>
    <P>&mdash;Developing and testing initiatives and programmes which, if successful, will be applied on a national basis.</P>
    <P>The food processing and agri-business sector is one of the country's largest employers with approximately 20 per cent of the total workforce.  The industry is well diversified in processing techniques and products.  Additionally it is well dispersed throughout the country giving it economic and social importance of national dimension.  However, compared to other food processing countries our efforts are mainly concentrated in commodity opportunities.  I strongly believe that to advance we need to produce high value added process products for specific market niches.  To achieve this we need a major expansion of the population of creative food firms producing quality products for carefully researched markets both at home and abroad, but particularly abroad.  The task given to SFADCo is to find the ways to achieve this goal.</P>
    <P>The current Multifibre Arrangement, MFA III, which regulates world trade in textiles, expires at the end of July 1986. The EC have adopted a negotiating mandate which supports the renewal of the <Col N="1551" /> MFA with more flexibility in its application.  I am satisfied that Ireland's particular concerns are adequately taken account of in the Community's mandate. Discussions under the GATT auspices, on the future of the MFA are now entering an intensive phase.  I must point out that it is clear from the stance being adopted by the developing countries, whose agreement is essential for the renewal of the MFA that negotiations will prove to be difficult.</P>
    <P>The Irish Goods Council are particularly active in assisting Irish firms to meet competition from abroad, through such measures as the promotion of trade shows, provision of marketing advice and assistance and, the development of the industrial sub-supply sector.  I should like to comment on two of the schemes currently promoted by the council.  The council's marketing initiative &ldquo;Marketplace&rdquo; continues to operate successfully and the Council hope to expand it in 1986. Under this scheme, young graduates in sales/marketing are placed for a minimum period of one year with a small firm who could not ordinarily employ such a person.  The scheme is funded by the YEA, who pay up to 60 per cent of the placee's salary in the first year, and operated by the IGC.  Already over 100 graduates have been placed under this scheme.</P>
    <P>I am also pleased to report a further innovative programme launched by the IGC at the end of 1985.  Entitled Salesforce it is intended to provide groups of 4-6 companies in a related product sector with the full time services of a sales executive. The programme is operational on a pilot basis with four Irish clothing firms and preliminary results are encouraging.</P>
    <P>As a small open economy, Ireland has a crucial dependence on export trade which sustains two out of every three jobs in industry.  As the House is aware, we were for many years dependent on the UK as an export market.  Today, however, less than 30 per cent of our exports go to the UK and trade with our European partners has grown to the extent <Col N="1552" /> that the European Community as a whole accounts for 70 per cent of our export trade.  While the rest of our exports are destined mainly to the other developed countries, such as United States, Canada, Japan, Australia and New Zealand, Ireland has also established valuable footholds in the markets of the newly industrialised countries and those of the less developed countries.</P>
    <P>Consequently, the health of the world trading system is of vital importance to Irish economic growth and job creation. The General Agreement on Tarriffs and Trade &mdash; GATT &mdash; is the multilateral treaty which lays down rules for the conduct of international trade and since its establishment in 1948 has succeeded in maintaining a high degree of stability in the world trading system.  Since acceding to the GATT, Ireland's trade has grown steadily down the years and I am happy to point out that 1985 was an historic year as we recorded a trade surplus of over £300 million &mdash; the first since joining GATT.</P>
    <P>Strong pressure from protectionist policies arising from the slowdown in growth of world trade in the seventiesearly eighties has pushed nations worldwide to press for a new round of multilateral trade negotiations, which it is expected will be launched in September of this year.  Ireland has been to the forefront in supporting this move.  I believe that a new round of negotiations is essential for the further expansion and strengthening of the world trading system.  I am confident that a new round will provide increased trading opportunities for Irish exporters and encourage investment in export oriented industries. Preparatory work is already underway for the launch of negotiations and Ireland is working within the Community to ensure that our interests and objectives are included in the Community's negotiation mandates.</P>
    <P>I had the opportunity in April of this year to engage in discussions on the new round with other trade Ministers at the OECD annual meeting.  I can assure you that Ireland will play a full part in the <Col N="1553" /> forthcoming negotiations.  I will personally lead the negotiating team at the launch of the new round in September and I intend to see to it that the maximum benefit is obtained for Ireland.</P>
    <P>My hope is that a new round of negotiations will help combat protectionism and aid the resolution of disputes between contracting parties.  I have in mind particularly the strained trade relations between the Community and the United States.  As Deputies will be aware, the US has experienced unprecendented trade deficits in 1984 and 1985 and this has brought forth calls from both industry and Congress for protectionist measures to cushion sensitive industries such as agriculture and steel from imports of foreign goods.  This trend towards protectionism has given rise to a number of disputes between the Community and the US.  The latest dispute concerns the accession of Spain and Portugal to the European Community.  I am glad to say that both parties are engaged in negotiations in GATT to resolve this.</P>
    <P>I have referred to our trade surplus in 1985.  This was achieved at a time when export growth slowed somewhat in 1985 and weaker than ancticipated growth in world trade and a slow-down in the performance of exports from new manufacturing industry sectors meant initial forecasts, made earlier in the year, proved to be over optimistic.  The growth of 9.5 per cent in value and 5.4 per cent in volume terms represents a solid and significant performance.  Merchandise exports were valued at £9,744 million in 1985 compared with £8,897 million in 1984.</P>
    <P>On the broader international scene, the volume of world trade is expected to grow by about 5 per cent this year compared with 3 per cent last year.  In the OECD countries, which account for about 90 per cent of Irish trade, economic growth this year should be about 3.2 per cent.  An upturn in world trade is being forecast by most international commentators, with the expectation that this will occur in the latter part of 1986.</P>
    <P>In 1986 I expect that exports will top the £10 million mark for the first time ever, fuelled by a strong performance in <Col N="1554" /> the second half of the year.  I expect that the volume growth of exports this year will be over 6 per cent with a value increase of between 3 per cent and 4 per cent.</P>
    <P>For the first five months of 1986 we have recorded a trade surplus of £178 million compared with a deficit of £130 million for the same period last year. Import and export figures are slightly lower in value terms than for the same period last year.  This is due to a number of factors, including the strength of the Irish pound against sterling and the dollar, the low rate of inflation in Ireland and the drop in oil prices.  In the past 20 years or more the value of exports has risen faster than the volume.  This year, however, the volume of exports is expected to grow faster than the value. The unit price index of exports is expected to decline by 2 per cent to 3 per cent in 1986.  Exports currently represent over 50 per cent of gross national product compared with a western European average of 25 per cent.</P>
    <P>In recognition of the critical role of exports in our economy the Government have allocated £25.336 million to CTT to enable them to carry out their activities in 1986.  Of this, £24.536 million is being allocated to CTT's ordinary and White Paper related schemes and £0.8 million, to the market entry and development scheme.  The overall allocation for 1986 represents an increase of over 214 per cent compared with the 1980 allocation of £8.06 million.  It is an increase of almost 8 per cent over the 1985 allocation of £23.464 million which is quite a substantial increase given the level of resources available for distribution among the various State agencies.  Over £5 million of CTT's allocation is being used to expand the schemes launched following publication of the Government's White Paper on Industrial Policy.  These schemes address weaknesses in the area of product development and marketing skills and techniques.  All the schemes are being continued and expanded in 1986.</P>
    <P>While a final evaluation of the schemes cannot be realistically made for a number of years, I am satisfied that all schemes <Col N="1555" /> are well underway and are proving to be successful in developing a strategic marketing approach among Irish exporters and redressing the more fundamental lack of an international marketing orientation among firms.  Marketing in its full sense must, of course, embrace a wide range of activities including the definition of customer requirements, the development of products and services to meet those requirements and the pricing, promotion, sales and distribution of products and services.  For a business to be successful, this strategic marketing dimension must be at the centre of the firms' overall development plans.  Schemes have been introduced in the areas of market entry and development, market research, group marketing for small exporters and building marketing strengths in firms.</P>
    <P>Apart from their new strategic developmental work, CTT continue to assist firms at the operational level.  They help companies to maintain and expand their present export business and to maximise the potential of their product range.  CTT offer assistance to firms in relation to travel and participation in trade fairs and also assist with advertising and preparation of sales literature.  They also assist exporters through their general trade missions, buyer airlifts, group marketing projects and handling of trade information queries.</P>
    <P>There are other areas in which direct assistance is provided to exporters. Under the export credit insurance scheme the Government provide Irish exporters with the facility to insure against non-payment for exports due to political or commercial risks in the buying countries.  This scheme is a valuable weapon in enabling exporters to break into new market, particularly the more difficult world markets, and to compete in existing markets.  The scheme is required to break even, taking one year with another.</P>
    <P>Under the medium term finance scheme, exporters of capital goods can obtain finance at concessionary interest rates on the security of an export credit insurance policy.  In turn, the exporter is <Col N="1556" /> able to offer credit at low interest to foreign buyers.  The interest rates are agreed internationally under an arrangement known as the &ldquo;Consensus&rdquo; administered by the OECD, and the scheme is of assistance to Irish exporters in maintaining competitiveness against foreign suppliers.  The Government pay an interest subsidy to the banks to cover the cost of providing the concessionary interest rates as against the actual cost of funds. The subsidy may not apply to intra-EC trade as the Treaty of Rome prohibits State subvention of this trade.</P>
    <P>The short term finance scheme caters for non-capital goods.  Again, funds are made available at preferential interest rates on security of export credit insurance policies.  The scheme is of considerable help to exporters in meeting their working capital needs.  There is no State subsidy involved.</P>
    <P>I would like to report now to Deputies on certain plans and developments in the competition and company law areas. Legislation is to be introduced shortly to revise and strengthen the existing arrangements relating to competition and consumer protection.</P>
    <P>The new Fair Trade Commission will have greater powers to inquire into anticompetitive and unfair trading practices. The powers of the Director of Consumer Affairs will be widened to include fair trade.  Competition legislation will be extended to new sectors, including banks, electricity and transport.  Because of the significant reduction in inflation which has been achieved as part of the greater emphasis on promoting competition through the economy, detailed price controls have been allowed to lapse.  However, the powers to impose price controls will be retained and they can be used if that proves to be necessary</P>
    <P>The Companies (Amendment) Bill, 1985, which deals with the preparation and publication of accounts of public and private limited companies, is currently before the Seanad.  A further Bill, containing detailed proposals for the reform of company law in order to deal with the abuse of limited liability status, is now being finalised.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1557" /> This further Bill, which now contains around 190 sections, will represent the most comprehensive updating of company law since 1963.  The work involved in preparing the legislation, both by my Department and by the Parliamentary Draftsman, has necessarily been both thorough and time consuming.  I am confident that, as a result of this work, the proposals contained in the Bill will significantly improve the conduct of company affairs.  This improvement will inspire a greater degree of confidence by investors and customers of such companies without, at the same time, stifling genuine entrepreneurial activity.  The income from fees paid to the Companies Registration Office in 1985 was approximately £1.191 million, an increase of 10 per cent on 1984.</P>
    <P>I have more to say but I presume I will get a chance to say it when I am winding up the debate and I can also reply to the points made by Fianna Fáil Deputies if they cover the areas I did not have time to reach.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>I will try to make the best possible use of my 30 minutes.  I intend to oppose this Estimate on the grounds of failure by this Minister, his predecessor and the Government to address themselves to the needs of industry and I will elaborate on my reasons for taking the position.</P>
      <P>During the 1985 debate on the Estimates for the Department of Industry Trade, Commerce and Tourism, the Minister, Deputy Bruton said: the way was clear in this country for steady and enduring progress in the growth of industry and the creation of jobs that would be real and that would last.  He said that this country had shaken off the lethargy of depression and taken the first strides towards a better future.  He went on to say that the economic climate, thanks to the work of this Government and thanks to their nerve and courage in confronting unpalatable realities, was healthier now than it had been for many years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite the Minister's optimism industrial <Col N="1558" /> output grew very sluggishly in 1985. In fact, the best estimate that can be put on it by the CII is that we had a growth in industrial output of less than 3 per cent.  The predictions for 1986 recently quoted by the director general of CII is that there will be a fall in output between now and October.  This contrasted sharply with the encouraging growth rates of 13 per cent recorded in 1984. The 1985 figures underlined yet again our precarious vulnerability to the fluctuating fortunes of the advanced technological sectors.  To the disappointment of all of us they gave lie to the Minister's happy prediction last year that 1984 represented a turn around for industrial growth in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The year 1985 proved to be a very bleak year for jobs in the manufacturing sector.  The announcement at the start of the year of the loss of over 700 jobs at the Travenol pharmaceutical plant heralded the depressing downward spiral in 1985. Government industrial policy has significantly failed to create a framework to foster and strengthen the native industrial sector.  In 1984 between 6,000 and 7,000 jobs were lost in manufacturing.  In 1985 the IDA estimate that some 8,000 jobs in industry were lost.  Between 1980 and 1985 we have lost 43,100 jobs in industry alone.  Total unemployment has jumped in that period from 91,000 to 240,000.  The loss of some 15,000 jobs in the manufacturing sector in 1984-85 signalled a further erosion of the productive sector and therefore of our national capacity to produce wealth.</P>
    <P>Despite the projections of the White Paper on Industrial Policy, which envisaged an increase of between 3,000 and 6,000 a year in manufacturing employment over a ten year period, despite the projections in <i>Building on Reality</i> of an increase in net employment of the order of 12,000 to 14,000 by 1987 in manufacturing industry, jobs in the productive sector remain elusive.  This is because the productive sector is weakening and wilting in a hostile commercial climate of high taxation and high industrial costs.  In <i>Building on Reality,</i> commenting on the projection of an extra 12,000 to 14,000 <Col N="1559" /> jobs by 1987 in manufacturing industry, the Government stated that these targets were attainable.  It is obvious to everybody that they have failed to fulfil these targets.</P>
    <P>In relation to employment the IDA's end of year report of last December made gloomy reading.  It is estimated that Irish firms made no contribution to the overall growth in the economy in 1985.  The IDA estimated that two-thirds of industrial job losses in 1985 had been due to existing companies reducing their work force. Jobs lost in manufacturing industry wiped out the 11,000 new jobs created by IDA backed projects with the result that manufacturing employment fell again in 1985.  I want to emphasise that point because the Minister referred to 11,000 new jobs which were created and I want to point out what happened to those 11,000 new jobs.</P>
    <P>The IDA have identified the central weakness of Irish industry as the failure of managements in the larger Irish owned firms to produce development proposals requiring job expansion in Ireland and aiming at markets in the EC.  The Government's failure to create a climate which would channel the necessary investment funds to industry must be held responsible as well in large part for the poor job creating record of Irish industry. The IDA's 1985 report could not with any confidence predict any growth in overall employment in the economy in 1986.  This reflects the failure over the past four years by the Government to devise an effective strategy to achieve the employment target set in the White Paper and in <i>Building on Reality.</i></P>
    <P>Growth in industrial output has been hampered over the last four years by the Government's insistence on cutting back each year on the public capital programme.  This year a further £25 million was chopped off the capital programme despite the Government's acknowledgement that State investment plays a pivotal role in the achievement of the objectives of long term growth and employment creation.  That was clearly stated in the 1986 capital programme <Col N="1560" /> booklet.  Despite the importance of the public capital programme in generating investment and economic activity over the past year, it has been reduced by one third in real terms, a decline from 15 per cent of GNP in 1982 to 10 per cent of GNP this year.</P>
    <P>It is a simple rule of economics that a higher level of investment in productive projects is essential to create more jobs and to improve living standards.  The cutbacks in the public capital programme mean that viable capital projects are being postponed especially in the area of providing essential infrastructure.  It is very shortsighted of the Government to reduce the allocation for new road construction. <i>Building on Reality 1985-1987</i> projected that £140 million would go to road construction in 1986, yet this has been cut now by £10 million to £130 million.  This is deplorable in view of the fact that 50,000 people are jobless in the construction industry.  In view of the need to improve our infrastructure and the fact that there would be little or no import content in relation to new road construction, does the mind not boggle at the policies being pursued and the attitudes adopted by this Government?</P>
    <P>The PCP will fall by 5.5 per cent in real terms in 1986.  The value of public capital programme spending in 1986 is almost 27 per cent below the level of 1982.  Capital spending in 1986 will surely fall by at least 4 per cent, all this despite the need for productive investment in the economy.  I suggest that if we are to make any progress in creating jobs and raising living standards we must double our manufacturing output over the next five years. Economists tell us that this will be achieved only if we can manage to invest £1,000 million annually.  At present only half of that amount is being invested. Because of shortage of time I simply pose the question &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; and leave it at that for the Minister and his Government to sort out.</P>
    <P>Our potential for increasing industrial output is enormous, as at present we produce only 1 per cent of European industrial output.  This being the case, the Government's action in effectively <Col N="1561" /> reducing the industrial incentive package this year is stupid and shortsighted.  It cuts across their stated conviction in the White Paper on Industrial Policy, paragraph 12.1, that there is a key role for direct State involvement in industrial development.  The Government have penalised industry by the changes in the rules for capital allowances.  The special 12 per cent duty on section 84 loan interest, the reduction in the funds available to the IDA and CTT, changes in relation to leasing and the fact that advance corporation tax is now fully operational will place a great burden on a small number of indigenous Irish companies who invested significantly in the past.  As the CII have pointed out, these companies are now subjected to a retrospective tax which they could not possibly have foreseen when preparing their cash flow projections for investment.  Reducing the effectiveness of the industrial incentive package when it is crucial to expand the productive base of the economy is tantamount to criminal stupidity and economic madness.</P>
    <P>The failure of this Government's industrial policy is illustrated vividly by the number of factory closures, liquidations and receiverships in the past three years. In 1983, 369 factories were closed, 522 companies went into liquidation and 136 companies were placed in receivership; in 1984, 372 factories were closed, 584 companies were in liquidation and 112 companies were placed in receivership; in 1985 there were 410 factory closures, 632 companies in liquidation and 165 companies put into receivership.  The figures for liquidation and receivership in 1985 will probably be greater than those I have indicated as the full figures are not known and that is merely a &ldquo;guesstimate&rdquo; of the closures, liquidations and receiverships in that year.  In 1985 individuals and institutions invested 20 times more in risk-free Government stocks than in new risk capital in manufacturing industry.  It has been clear for some time that the bias against personal investment in manufacturing should be removed.  The Minister and his colleagues have ignored this need blatantly despite our promptings <Col N="1562" /> over recent years.  People who invest in productive enterprises will continue to be taxed much more than those who invest in Government gilts.</P>
    <P>This Government have also presided over the flight of Irish capital out of the country to contribute to industrial development abroad.  It is clear that one of the main barriers to growth is private investment in manufacturing industry, and that has fallen dramatically over the past three years.  In 1985 it had reached stagnation point.  In particular this is extremely worrying from the point of view of developing the native manufacturing sector which requires access to financial resources if it is to achieve the necessary restructuring needed to allow it to compete on foreign markets.  Native industry needs investment in manufacturing plant, in new products development and in marketing and export capacity, yet Government policy penalises investment in native enterprises.  This is in sharp contrast to the investment boom in Europe where economic commentators have noted that the output from the heavy capital goods industry is now even greater than during the sixties.</P>
    <P>At the same time, private investors are discouraged from investing in industry as the yields from lending to the Government in particular and the various tax advantages given to other forms of institutional savings far outstrip those of industry.  It is crazy that we penalise productive investment and facilitate non-productive investment to the extent that we do at this time.  It is sad to recall that this trend of penalising investment has not been reversed in the 1986 budget or in the Estimates presented here by the Minister today.  The infamous or otherwise known DIRT, the change in calculating capital allowances and the use of levies are further retrograde steps which will slow down the flow of funds to productive enterprise.  This policy of discouraging the private sector cuts right across the advice given by the former Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism when he commissioned an OECD report on the Irish economy last year which pointed out that the key to <Col N="1563" /> future industrial growth in Ireland lies in private capital rather than State grants. It pointed out that this will come about only if there are more incentives and an overhaul of the Stock Exchange to boost venture capital in Ireland.  To achieve this the report recommends long term loans conditional on equity investment by existing or new shareholders and an equity investment reinsurance scheme.  The Minister might consider seriously asking &mdash; indeed, almost demanding &mdash; that the Government adopt the OECD suggestion of a complete exemption from capital gains tax or at least a reduction to 20 to 25 per cent to make venture capital at least as attractive as investment in houses, flats, Government financial instruments, etc.</P>
    <P>For the past four years it has been distressingly clear that large Irish construction and manufacturing companies are winding down their domestic operations and expanding their operations in the US, the Middle East and elsewhere. We will not achieve increased industrial excellence until we pay more attention to the calibre of our thinking.  In Ireland some 80-90 per cent of State support is channelled into investment in fixed assets.  Only 10 to 20 per cent goes to investment in our thinking capacity.  Last autumn the OECD found that proportionately Ireland had just one-third the number of engineers of other industrialised countries.  It is clear that our educational resources must be geared to meet the future needs of industry and that the industry must be created here to meet the needs of those who are educationally qualified to take part in industry.</P>
    <P>Exporting Irish firms find themselves beleaguered by the 10 per cent exchange rate advantage that sterling now has over the IR£ and the Government's refusal to lower electricity, transport and communications costs in line with the reductions to the UK competitors.  The result, as noted recently by the small firms association, is that not only are Irish exporters at a disadvantage in their main export market but they are losing their market <Col N="1564" /> share here at home as British firms can sell their goods here 10 per cent cheaper.</P>
    <P>In relation to the future direction of Irish industrial policy, I welcome the Minister's endorsement in the Dáil on 10 June of the long-established national policy that Shannon continue to be developed as the country's transatlantic airport and that SFADCo continue to take responsibility for implementing that policy.  This was an appropriate acknowledgement of the fundamental role of Shannon Development in our industrialisation policy, past and present, at regional and local level.  Their contribution to the mid west and the country as a whole has been very positive.</P>
    <P>The Minister also dealt at length with the company's success &mdash; I also wish to acknowledge their success &mdash; in that today they employ 242 people, they have an annual budget of about £21 million and investments worth about £108 million. Their strategy for the future is intimately bound up with industrial development and I am confident that the innovation and enterprise which their management have brought to so many spheres of commercial activity will be to the fore as they meet the challenge of devising new food products and facilitating the development of our small industry sector.  Developing the technological, marketing and management capacity of native small industry is vital if we are to expand our production of high quality products for export.  The pilot projects which will be undertaken in SFADCo's recently operating food processing unit are central to the challenge of achieving the full potential of the agri-food sector.</P>
    <P>Their efforts are equally important in the area of generating internationally competitive small industry: 80 per cent of Irish manufacturing industry is comprised of small enterprises employing fewer than 50 people.  The establishment of the innovation centre and the national micro-electronic application centre signalled the company's development approach to strengthening the capacity of small industry.</P>
    <P>The National Development Corporation had a prolonged and difficult <Col N="1565" /> arrival.  The Minister seems to think that the NDC are the be all and end all in regard to solving our problems of unemployment. It is amazing, therefore, that it has taken almost three years for the Government to introduce the corporation. The NDC were finally launched by the Minister on 11 June following years of political wrangling and internal disagreement between Fine Gael and Labour over the financing and mandate of that body.  Indeed, one could pause to reflect with profound regret and sadness on the damage inflicted on the nation by the Coalition's policy cleavages on so many issues over the past few years, which is inevitable in the unhappy alliance between right and left.  From the earliest days of their term in office the Government proclaimed their support for the NDC as a vehicle for State equity investment in industry.  In July 1984 the Government, in the White Paper on industrial Policy, devoted an entire chapter to the National Development Corporation and their intention that the NDC should have a central role in overall industrial policy.  In May 1985 the then Minister announced the operating details of the NDC.  The former Minister, in introducing the long-awaited Government Bill to establish the NDC last summer, announced that the National Enterprise Board would come under the umbrella of the NDC on 1 January.  That date has come and gone but nothing has happened.  It is further bungling by the Government and creates uncertainty in our industrial base.  It clearly reflected the confusion and the lack of unity of purpose regarding the NDC within the Cabinet.  I commented during the debate on this Estimate last year, 28 June 1985, that the establishment of the NDC was motivated ideologically rather than by pragmatic considerations of how best to get the economy moving and to get more people into jobs.</P>
    <P>The Government vacillation on this issue continued into 1986.  Moreover, questions have been raised as to the corporation's freedom from bureaucratic control.  It has emerged, in the review of their operations which the National <Col N="1566" /> Enterprise Agency conducted recently prior to the changeover, that some of the provisions governing the NDC are too restrictive to permit some of the investment already made by the National Enterprise Agency, which can be checked by a report in one of the Sunday newspapers of 2 March 1986.  It said that two software investments announced in February this year might not have been concluded in their present form under the terms of the Bill.</P>
    <P>It is clear that the NDC must have sufficient flexibility of manoeuvre if they are to operate effectively as a venture capital vehicle.  There seems to be a question mark over their freedom in this regard.  If they are to react positively to people with sound business development ideas, they will need to have sufficient flexibility in the way they conduct their affairs and allocate their investment capital. If this is not achieved we may say goodbye to whatever chance the NDC have of evolving a new approach to State investment in economic activity for they will become just another State body stranded by bureaucratic restrictions, the product of a failure of the Coalition partners to compromise on a pragmatic and effective approach to industrial policy.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to address some of the matters which I raised, especially the recent takeover of Sunbeam Wolsey by the John Crowther group.  I understand that Sunbeam Wolsey shareholders will be forced to sell their John Crowther shares within three months; therefore in effect, it means that Sunbeam and their subsidiaries will pass into foreign control due to exchange control regulations.  That has very serious implications and complications, and the Minister should examine the stock control regulations and see that necessary adjustments are made to prevent this kind of thing happening.  Promises and guarantees are not worth the paper on which they are written.  Not alone is Sunbeam Wolsey in Cork affected; they also have factories in Midleton, Mountmellick, Dublin, Tralee, Bandon and Bray &mdash; seven constituencies <Col N="1567" /> are affected.  Farmers who hope to grow flax in east Cork to make linen are also affected.  The Minister must examine the options to see what arrangements can be made to ensure that Irish directors, shareholders and workers are working for Ireland's economy instead of the economies of others.  I am reminded of the experience of British or other foreign companies taking up the shareholdings of Irish companies in the recent past.  It also happened in relation to Dunlop, Ideal Weatherproofs and Dwyers, who are now wholly-owned British companies who do not provide employment in Cork.</P>
    <P>The Minister should address himself to that matter.  The Minister must have got one message from the result of last week's referendum which came strongly from young people &mdash; they want jobs and not divorce.  The Government have failed on employment, on agriculture, on health, on education and on industry.  They removed the food subsidies, the child tax allowance, taxed children's savings, threw their fathers out of work and closed down and liquidated at an unprecedented rate.</P>
    <P>I hope when the Minister goes to discuss the Multifibre Agreement that he will not say what the Minister for Agriculture said &mdash; that negotiations will be difficult &mdash; and come back with a similar agreement.  I hope the Minister will not give in to the difficulties and fail the people when he sits down to discuss the Multifibre Agreement with his partners in the EC.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make a brief contribution to this debate.  First, it is a very difficult time to be Minister for Industry and Commerce, no matter which Minister occupies the position. Since this is the first opportunity I have had to speak in the House since the Minister was appointed, I wish him well in his Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Rather than spending so much time saying how wonderful one side is compared to the other I would like to see us spending more time trying to get all-party agreement on what needs to be done for <Col N="1568" /> industry here.  This relates not alone to the Minister's Department but to the Department of Labour, the Department of Finance, the Manpower area and the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>The policy of the Revenue Commissioners on the collection of outstanding taxes is to put pressure on companies to meet criteria which might not necessarily be in the public interest.  They tend to react to situations rather than considering what is in the public interest.  There are many instances of companies who are normally good at sending in their tax returns and meeting their obligations falling into arrears of tax and, although intending to admit and pay off their liability, submit accounts and so on, being put to the wall because the Revenue Commissioners employ a policy that all must be paid within a specified time; whereas sometimes it may be in the public interest to give such companies a bit of breathing space so that they can continue to meet their obligations, give employment and at a future date pay the arrears of tax.  I do not agree with the practice of meeting a formula for the sake of meeting a formula. We should look to the public interest, and that is to keep the maximum number of people at work.  Every other policy or formula should be subject to that.  The maximum number of people should be kept at work.  I do not believe that among all the various bodies, the Manpower services, the Revenue Commissioners, the Department of Industry and Commerce and all the various Departments involved, there is a policy that maximum employment is of supreme importance.  But it should be so.  It is not good enough to have people who are in permanent pensionable secure employment, who can go nowhere but up in the public service, setting down standards for people in the private sector which they simply cannot meet and which will result in further unemployment.  Unfortunately, that is often the case for instance, in the Revenue Commissioners.  Somebody within the Department of Industry and Commerce should have overriding powers over all the other Departments with regard to maximising employment <Col N="1569" /> opportunities.  That should be the main objective.</P>
    <P>There is a difficulty with regard to some of the employment schemes in that some are run by the Department of Labour and not the Department of Industry and Commerce at all.  In Dublin Corporation, for instance, there is a huge amount of work to be done which would improve the commercial environment in this city which is simply not being done. There is work to be done which would be beneficial to industry, to the environment and the community generally which is simply not being done because the trade unions and Dublin Corporation, unlike those in any other body, will not agree to the implementation of a social employment scheme.</P>
    <P>It is outrageous that with almost 240,000 people unemployed trade unions can continue to operate outmoded and old fashioned practices which take no account of the need to maximise employment as the first and absolute priority. When everybody has work then we can rank the other priorities.  The trade unions represent the people who are at work and do not take account of any but those who are at work.  There is nobody representing the 240,000 people who are out of work.  We have a public service of about 300,000 people, if one takes into account all the semi-State bodies.  But we have a further public service of over 230,000 people who are unemployed but who come under the public service pay bill.  The result is that there is a policy of some kind of apartheid being operated. The unemployed have no rights, no pension, nothing to look forward to.  They get their money every week and it finishes at that.  But people who are employed have all the rights and some of those rights deprive many of the unemployed of the right to work.</P>
    <P>It is necessary to publish a White Paper on the whole question of industrial practice. I would like to see the Minister for Industry and Commerce and his colleague in the other Departments, Labour, the Public Service and Finance, getting together to put forward a united front on the question of the rights of the <Col N="1570" /> 230,000 people who are unemployed.  It is not good enough to insist on rights, privileges and entitlements in regard to people who are at work when they interfere with the rights of people out of work. They have no rights as things stand.  It would be beneficial to get all-party agreement on this.  The right to work should take precedence.  Yet we have given people, many of them trade union committees, the right to veto schemes which would allow unemployed people to work while many people who are at work continue to enjoy the rights that they have. I do not want to interfere with those rights.  However, when those rights interfere with those people who are out of work, who are at the bottom of the scale, then we must call a halt.  Everything we do should be subject to the primary objective of getting the maximum number of people to work.  That should be our primary objective and everything should take second place to that.</P>
    <P>In the past we have put too much emphasis on grants for machinery and not enough on grants for employing more people.  The problem is worsened from the point of view of employers by some of the social legislation which passed through this House in the last decade.</P>
    <P>The reality is that many employers would be made to take on people to work when they can get instead a machine which does not go sick, which does not have maternity leave, which does not go on strike, which does not create problems with regard to hours of work.  This is the situation we have brought about.  We are totally geared towards minimising the numbers of people at work and maximising the number of machines.  A newspaper can be printed now with only a handful of people and machines.  A car can be assembled with robots.  If one drives into a garage one serves oneself and a man or a woman sits in behind the counter and presses buttons.  Everything we have done has been to encourage more automation, more machinery and less employment of people.</P>
    <P>This has happened not just in the interests of being competitive &mdash; it is an absolute requirement to be competitive <Col N="1571" /> with other European countries &mdash; but, even where manpower would be preferable, some of our legislative processes have put obstacles in the way.  Because of the extra burden of some of the social legislation employers simply will not employ people but will use machines.  It has got to a stage where somebody caught with their hand in the till in a supermarket cannot be sacked because the employer will be brought to court as some sort of villain.  That is the situation we have allowed to develop.  How can we knock down all those obstacles and maximise the opportunities for employment so that all of those young people who are coming out of school and onto the employment register will have the opportunity to go to work?</P>
    <P>It simply is not good enough to continue with the practices we have been used to.  We need an all-party review of the social legislation, which is to some degree anti-social because it discriminates against the weakest people in our society.  We must also review the whole question of grants given to industries, some of which will pull out of this country at the drop of a hat.  Let us face the fact that despite having arguments across the floor of the House, there is no huge disagreement between the Opposition and the Government as to what needs to be done.  But because of the way society is organised we allow ourselves to be played off, one against the other, and the people and the cause we were elected to serve &mdash; the public interest &mdash; suffer.</P>
    <P>Those in the community who are weakest, who are not in trade unions, who do not have a cogent group to speak up for them suffer the most.  We do not get a united agreement on the sort of situation <i>vis-à-vis</i> grants for employment rather than for machines and the maximum favourable legislation to encourage people to take on work not just in the area of industry and commerce but also in the Department of Labour and the Revenue Commissioners.  I would like to see all-party agreement and if possible a White Paper cutting across all of those Departments, and if necessary to consult <Col N="1572" /> with the Opposition before it is printed, to try to bring to this House for the autumn session a reform of legislation which could benefit employment opportunities. It is too serious a matter to turn our backs on.</P>
    <P>I spent about three-quarters of an hour talking to a constituent last night.  He pleaded with me to do everything I could to get across the need to knock down all these obstacles, pettinesses and clear disincentives to employment and to maximise every opportunity we can to give rise to the best possible atmosphere for employment.  We could divert grants from machinery and give rise to the best possible atmosphere for employment. We could divert grants from machinery and give a bias towards grants for people. We need to grasp the nettle of anti social legislation which is passed through this House.  It discriminates against the weakest people in the community.  If we reform it we will have done a great service to the 230,000 people who are unemployed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>We would all like to share the Minister's optimism in so far as the level of exports is concerned.  We sincerely hope that they will reach the £10 billion mark that he referred to in his contribution.  I am interested to hear the conciliatory tones of Deputy Gay Mitchell in so far as he thinks that there might not be a great difference between the Government side of the House and the Opposition regarding job creation and industrial development policy.  There is a very great fundamental difference. He knows that and that is the reason he is somewhat critical of the Government's performance in this area.  He referred on more than one occasion to the need for reviews and further legislation to develop a better industrial environment for the country.  We support the principle but his Government have not taken on board any measures which would have generated the means necessary to create the jobs and to reduce unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to deal with the export side of the Minister's brief.  Perhaps it has the <Col N="1573" /> greatest potential as regards our development process and certainly must have the greatest potential as regards job creation. This must continue to be our major political priority in so far as the economic development of the country is concerned. The Minister gives the impression of a certain amount of smugness in his attitude towards exports and the development of exports in the recent past.  It is time that some markers were put down as to the way matters have developed over the past six months which might lead the Minister to review his position on this matter.  The bald truth about the matter is that we are not benefiting from the increased European demand that has been evident over the past 12 months. The output from our manufacturing sector has been lagging.  We have not seen the expected rise in employment levels.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to some of the motivators in the field of exports.  He referred to the inflation rate, the strength of the pound as against sterling and the dollar and to the fall in the price of oil. These matters must be addressed.  The inflation rate that the Minister referred to has been falling worldwide.  It has not been falling at the same pace here as it has in our competing countries.  The falling inflation rate should have been of considerable benefit to industrialists and the manufacturing sector in the area of lower interest rates and better cost control. I suggest to the Minister that perhaps there is something to be addressed there also.  The strength of the pound as against sterling and the dollar is a two-edged sword.  We have to face the fact that the British currency has weakened by 9 per cent against the pound and the dollar has weakened by 30 per cent against the pound.  We must bear in mind that all these things must be managed carefully if we are not to have attendant problems created, particularly for indigenous manufacturers.  These problems are now beginning to surface.</P>
    <P>The Minister is quite right in saying that there has been a dramatic fall in the price of oil which bottomed out at about 12 dollars a barrel.  In so far as crude oil <Col N="1574" /> prices are concerned we have not been able to pass on those price reductions to oil-based products.  In so far as exchange rate movements are concerned that has always inevitably led to export and import price movements.  They have had a critical imbalance in so far as manufacturing industry here is concerned.</P>
    <P>In 1985 the exchange rate strengthened. Exports and import prices tumbled. This is now having a very penetrating effect on small and labourbased industries.  The problems have to be identified.  It appears that the Minister is not paying sufficient attention to them. If we look at the inflation rates that apply in our main markets we see that in the UK inflation is at 2.8 per cent, in France 2.6 per cent, and in Belgium 1.1 per cent; last year in Germany it was .03 per cent and in the US 1.6 per cent.  We are considerably our of line in so far as the rate of inflation is concerned.  Even though it might be in the best interests politically for the Minister to plead that inflation has been tumbling &mdash; I accept that it has been falling &mdash; it has certainly not been falling at the same pace as for our competitors.</P>
    <P>Producers are facing markets with falling prices.  The result of that is that the profit margins of our manufacturing exporters are being squeezed to maintain their competitiveness.  We had some stability in that area for the past few years.</P>
    <P>We are now facing the worst situation in competitiveness in the past 20 years.  That has been established by recent studies in the OECD and the EC.  In the new price environment that we now face in so far as fuel costs and industrial costs are concerned reductions must apply to the manufacturing sector.  All these cost reductions will have to be passed on to manufacturers if they are to maintain their price competitiveness.  Manufacturers and exporters are saying quite clearly that these costs have not been significantly reduced despite the fact that the Minister pleads that fuel prices and other prices have weakened internationally.</P>
    <P>The companies most acutely affected will be the companies that are competing with the United Kingdom producers.  The <Col N="1575" /> UK producer has a lower inflation rate than ours and because of our price competition and the weakness of the punt against sterling companies are facing reductions in sales into that UK market of up to 5 per cent.  With our domestic cost increases averaging out at 4 per cent in 1985 and perhaps a little more this year, our manufacturing exporters are at a disadvantage of in excess of 9 per cent as against their competitors.</P>
    <P>That damage is being inflicted on our producers is very evident from the depleted order books which is the accepted position in our export manufacturing sector.  This has been conveyed to the Minister.  In the first couple of months of this year there was buoyancy with regard to the order books but that trend has now been dramatically reversed.  That can only lead to a stagnation in industrial output because the companies cannot physically carry the extra stocks for stock piling or their costs.  Once industrial output is weakened it must lead to an unemployment trend.  I estimate that some 5,000 manufacturing jobs would now be at some risk, most of these being in the very sensitive areas based on natural resources, the dairy sector in particular. This is something on which the Minister must take action.</P>
    <P>Most of the manufacturers under threat are Irish owners of labour intensive industries.  Companies particularly under threat are subsidiaries of United Kingdom companies.  The parent groups can manufacture the same product much more cheaply and export it to us, rather than competing with their own Irish subsidiaries. This will be a very significant element of the whole export manufacturing sector for the rest of this year.  The real reason is that the price of our essential services has not been addressed.  We are not getting the best advantage in this area.  Many of these costs are impacted on by the Government.  The seriousness of industrial costs has not been highlighted. There are very great cost impositions in many areas.  I will list five in particular which need the immediate <Col N="1576" /> attention of the Minister.  They are interest rates, transport costs, electricity and energy costs, telecommunication costs and insurance costs.  It is worth paying some attention to these aspects.  We must get in line with our main trading partners if we are to remain competitive for the rest of this year and maintain the existing job levels, not to mention the possibility of creating new jobs.</P>
    <P>It must be recognised that interest rates are falling but they are still very high compared with those of our competitors. They are about 5 per cent higher than those in Germany, which now makes up a very strong element of our total export drive.  It has been estimated that a 1 per cent difference is equivalent to about £16 million in extra interest costs to manufacturers. If we were to get our interest costs on a par with the average in the European sense, reduced by about 5 per cent, that would be the equivalent of a reduction of £80 million in interest charges to the manufacturing sector.  I would regard that as the equivalent of thousands of jobs.  This is a matter about which the Minister and the Government can do something.</P>
    <P>We are also out of line on transport costs.  These have been estimated as costing manufacturing industry about £100 million extra.  The question of the high cost of road diesel and tax impositions appears to be disregarded.  If transport costs could be significantly reduced, that would have a very big bearing on the reduction of essential costs to the manufacturing industry and would lead to increased job opportunities in the manufacturing sector.</P>
    <P>Our energy costs are still out of line, and though the Minister for Energy announced some cost reductions for the commercial sector to take effect from next autumn, even with those reductions our industrial tariffs are still 20 per cent higher than the EC average.  We can adjust this ourselves because, for instance, the price of natural gas has a severe effect and the Minister and the Government have a direct controlling influence.  When we talk about being 20 per cent higher than the EC average we <Col N="1577" /> must remember we are not competing with the average: we must take on what the highest difference in cost is, and in regard to our industry that would be considerably more than 20 per cent.</P>
    <P>Our telecommunications charges are also out of line, about 40 per cent higher than our competitors' average.  If we demand a response from manufacturers we must allow them to compete on equal terms.  We debated employers' liability insurance at length on the Courts Bill and the Malicious Injuries Bill.  The general insurance premiums being charged now are at a staggering level and they are impinging greatly on the viability of the manufacturing sector and their ability to survive.  We have heard talk about a claims conscious society and the difficulties the insurance industry has.  I accept there are difficulties but I do not want the Minister to continue to plead that it is all one way.  I suggest that the Government, the manufacturing industry and the community at large have parts to play. This has been outlined in a recent report by the Oireachtas committee which dealt with insurance in relation to small businesses. Industry has a major part to play in regard to safety at work, but taking all these things as a package, the Irish manufacturing export sector is seriously disadvantaged <i>vis-à-vis</i> our average competitors.</P>
    <P>We will not get the full benefits from our true economic exporting ability until some of these matters in which the Government have a direct influence have been put in order.  The Minister in particular must give the full benefit of lower fuel prices to manufacturers.  Depleted order books are the first indication of our loss of competitiveness.  Consequently, we must have a loss of investment which means in turn that our output will be less than the average growth in the EC.  That is the 1986 trend and, though I should like to join with the Minister in hoping for an improved rate of growth in our total exports, I cannot be as complacent as he.  Our production costs will increase much faster this year than the average of our 19 main trading partners.  It has been estimated that our costs on average will <Col N="1578" /> increase by 7 per cent which must make our competitive position very vulnerable.</P>
    <P>Our unemployment problem has not been addressed and we have the highest in Europe.  It is very depressing for the thousands of young people who are out of work.  Things are not well for industrial exporters and it is not right for the Minister to seek to convey that the reverse is the case.  The strengthening of the Irish punt had a very debilitating effect on our traditional exporters.  Something will have to be done to redress this and it can be done only if the Minister takes the initiative in reducing energy costs which are directly under his control.  I press the Minister strongly to pay attention to that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East) Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I thank the Deputies who contributed and I am sorry we did not have more time.  The views expressed by Deputy Lyons, Flynn and G. Mitchell contained a number of points worthy of further discussion.  I will deal first with the point made by Deputy Flynn in regard to liability insurance.  We are all well aware of the cost of liability insurance and the difficulty of getting cover. The Government are taking action on a number of fronts to tackle the problem. I refer to the abolition of juries in civil injury cases which should help to stabilise costs.  The Minister for Labour has established a new board in regard to occupational safety and prevention of accidents at work.  My Department have an arrangement with the Irish Insurance Federation to handle cases where there is no insurance cover.  I hope these will improve the position in the next 12 months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are not alone in our difficulties in regard to liability insurance: whenever we pick up a newspaper we see stories from the other side of the Atlantic and from Europe.  Companies who are paying high premiums should be more willing to take on people who claim compensation &mdash; firms should not always be settling out of court.  It is time that we had more claims tried in court so that we would have a yardstick by which future settlebase <Col N="1579" /> ments could be measured, but there seems to be a reluctance to take cases to court, and this does not improve the overall position.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lyons made a number of debating points and a few political points. He spoke about the concern in his constituency in regard to the takeover of Sumbeam Wolsey.  He spoke of the holding of shares in the UK company under exchange control regulations.  That is primarily the concern of the Minister for Finance.  He spoke of the interests of the employees and shareholders and the maintenance of production here.  They can be considered through notification of the proposed takeover under the Mergers, Takeovers and Monopolies (Control) Act, 1978.  No notification in regard to the Sunbeam Wolsey case has been received in the Department.  We expect to receive one and then it will be considered and the views of the parties involved will be taken into account.</P>
    <P>I was glad to hear Deputy Lyons complimenting SFADCo.  That company have done very good work in the past. They have maintained responsibility for the encouragement of traffic through Shannon Airport.  As I said earlier, they have been given certain responsibility for development of the food processing industry and I hope to be able to expand further on that point soon.  SFADCo are a key company not only in the development of the mid-west but Irish industrial policy as a whole.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lyons spoke about road building and the public capital programme and the relationship between capital investment and employment.  It was very clear that once we entered the EC we would have to change our industrial policy.  We did that in a big way.  In the seventies we would have been happy in any county or town to have attracted a plant from any multinational, European or US, regardless of the nature of the work they would perform.  What happened quite frequently was that there was a boost and a demand for a certain product.  A plant was set up in this country to provide the volume and fulfil the demand.  Basically <Col N="1580" /> the work involved was assembly work, usually light assembly work.  As demand dropped off, the plant was at risk as the company did not need to produce that cohort of goods and they closed the plant down.</P>
    <P>In the past three or four years we have tried to attract into Ireland more strategic units of companies, especially of multinational companies.  We have tried to get those here already to add on more strategic units.  I am talking about bringing the marketing units for Europe here, about establishing data processing for the company here and, in particular, about the development of research and development here.  In the past three or four years most of the major electronics companies have put in here strategic units of their corporations.  They are especially strong in research and development.  That is true also of the pharmaceutical side. That is the first point to remember.  In this situation the firms we have will be maintained and they will be involved in wealth creation.  They will have strategic units of their international corporations here and, ultimately, there will be stand alone companies here.  Significant progress has been made in that direction and continues to be made.  There is a change of focus in industrial policy.</P>
    <P>The second point is the development of small industry.  This connects with what the Deputy has said about unemployment. I do not think we can conceive of all those young people coming out of schools and colleges as employees or that any policy which one puts up will provide work for them as employees.  We must get away from the employees mentality where everybody, no matter how bright, talented or gifted conceives of themselves as working for somebody else.  That is not the way they think in the United States where they have solved their unemployment problems to a large degree.  The encouragement of small industry, whether by SFADCo or the IDA, must be one of the areas on which we have to focus.  If there are strategic units of American companies in this country and if we have very bright graduates getting the necessary experience for four or five <Col N="1581" /> years, we must actively encourage them to set up on their own and think in terms of employing themselves and three or four of their friends.  I am talking of four or five people.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The point was well as made by Deputy Mitchell. That is the second thing we have to do. We can move in that direction.  There has been great progress in the development of small industries.  If we had small industries in every town and village, we would be in a position, with confidence in the economy, where one extra employee would be taken on by each company.  In terms of more than 20,000 companies one can see the lift that would take place.  We must move in that direction and we are doing so.</P>
      <P>The third thing we must do &mdash; this is absolutely vital and there is agreement on it &mdash; is to ensure that our indigenous companies who have been traditionally supplying the UK market and the EC have better management and marketing. Especially in the marketing area many of our indigenous companies are failing.  We have sales executives but many of the companies do not have marketing executives and units.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I will come back to the point the Deputy made in regard to the 10 per cent but I want to put it into the general context first.  If we take Deputy Lyons' point about building bridges, roads and houses and putting money into the building industry, no matter what kind of boost we would get at any particular point we could quantify the length of time we would keep people employed.  If we build another bridge across the Liffey, we can do the sums and say the project would mean employment for 200 people for 18 months but that would not be a lasting job.  An enormous amount of borrowed money would have to be repaid.  We must examine the capital programme project by project to see whether we are getting a return on the infrastructure which is contributing to the cost effectiveness of the economy overall. Of course, public capital expenditure has come down in the past number of years. First of all, because we are watching and evaluating all the projects and secondly, because telecommunication projects are now finished.  The huge capital investment in telecommunications is no longer within the package.  Therefore, one would notice the drop anyway.</P>
      <P>Deputy Flynn made the point that it all depends on how we trade abroad.  Of course, it does.  The home market of 3.5 million people is too small.  There are 320 million people in Europe.  That is the market we are aiming at.  The process has to be able to trade and export abroad and, therefore, creating wealth at home. When we create wealth at home, the way to distribute it is to provide real jobs. There is a strategy and it is working.  It is continuing to work because there are more real jobs in the economy now than there has been.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to refer to Deputy Flynn's point on costs.  He went through a whole range of costs.  He seemed to fight shy of exchange rates.  The Deputy talked in terms of the weakening sterling and dollar against the IR£.  We are not attached to sterling.  That decision was <Col N="1583" /> taken a long time ago.  We are in a basket of currencies in the EMS.  We are linked to those.  Sterling has been going up and down like a yo-yo since the start of the year.  What are we going to do?  Are we going to break with the EMS and attach to sterling?  I accept that a floating exchange rate causes difficulties for those selling into the UK market.  I accept that they can carry the level but the speed of the change can affect them.  It has gone from 78 pence to 90 pence over about 12 months.  That causes difficulty but it is not true to say that the benefits of lower inflation are not being passed on.  All the benefits are monitored.  The reductions in the cost of energy and oil prices are monitored.  When it comes to diesel, petrol, heating or fuel oil, all the benefits have been passed on.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The price of electricity has been reduced. That has been passed on.  I hope more can be done.  As inflation rates are coming down, interest rates are coming down. They are coming down slower than we would like but they are coming down significantly.  There are now reductions month after month.  We are getting the cost structures right.  The ESB could do more.  I would like them to do more but there are also inhibitions on our energy policy.  There are countries in Europe which can produce electricity cheaper than we can but many of them do so on the basis of generating by nuclear fuel. That is not an option for this country.  If we examine the structures in Europe, we will find that where they have large nuclear generating stations they are producing electricity cheaper.  That is not a road we want to go down.  Therefore, the costs are coming right.  Exports are very strong and buoyant at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Flynn made the point that order books are dropping off.  I know of order books which cannot be fulfilled at present.  I know of factories that week after week are playing extra overtime and <Col N="1584" /> taking on extra people on a temporary basis to fulfil order books.  I know there are people who are worried about exchange rates but I do not know of a fall-off in orders.</P>

When the exchange rates are hard and the inflation rates drop rapidly and when, as Deputy Flynn rightly said, we in many cases are selling into a market where prices are falling rather than rising, there is difficulty but it is not going to be the hand of the Government moving in and lifting people up.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond) Barry Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £1,153,476,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1986, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Health (including Oifig an Ard-Chláraitheora), and certain services administered by that Office, including grants to Health Boards, miscellaneous grants, and a grant-in-aid.</P>
      <P>Allowing for appropriations-in-aid at £100 million, the net non-capital grant provision is £1,095.316 million, an increase of £81.5 million on the budget allocation for 1985.</P>
      <P>The capital provision included in the Estimate amounts to £58.160 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The gross estimated expenditure of <Col N="1586" /> £1,274 million represents an increase of £79 million on the corresponding figure for 1985.  It comprises £793 million in respect of pay, £416 million in respect of non-pay, excluding cash allowances, and £65 million in respect of cash allowances. About 86 per cent of the gross expenditure will be met from Exchequer funds.</P>
    <P>I have, on many occasions, referred to the spectacular growth in expenditure on health services over the last decade or so. In 1973-1974 net expenditure was about £143 million representing about 5.2 per cent of GNP.  In 1982 the figure had increased to £952 million representing almost 8 per cent of GNP.  The expenditure level in 1986, which can be supported by the Estimates provision, will reach almost £1,200 million in net expenditure terms.  When direct income from patients receipts etc. accruing to health agencies is reckoned the amount available for expenditure on health services in 1986 will reach a total of £1,274 million.  This compares with an overall gross total of about £1,195 million at estimates stage last year and is an increase of £79 million.</P>
    <P>There have been major improvements in the scope and the range of the services in recent years.  For example, our acute hospital services are as good as any in Western Europe, providing emergency and casualty services on a 24-hour basis and access to high quality diagnostic and treatment services to the entire population. Acute medicine continues to develop and our services have managed to embrace recent advances, offering, for example, techniques like organ transplants, open heart surgery, haemodialysis and intensive care &mdash; particularly neonatal intensive care where there have been major developments in the last ten years or so.</P>
    <P>Our psychiatric services are also steadily improving.  In the wake of the recent planning report there is now a new drive to develop a more community oriented system with the objectives of better and more human patient care.  A particular feature of these services has been the value in terms of improvement in the standard of accommodation in most psychiatric <Col N="1587" /> hospitals by the expenditure by this Government of £6 million on schemes of refurbishment.</P>
    <P>We can also point to a comprehensive range of services for the mentally handicapped, being progressively developed with a particular emphasis on community services.</P>
    <P>Our general medical services provide general practitioner service to almost 40 per cent of the population, currently totalling some 1,322,000 persons.  Over £100 million will be spent on the general medical services in 1986.  Apart from general practitioner services the community health services programme provides a range of other services including home nursing, family planning, dental ophthalmic and aural services as well as domiciliary welfare and the refund of drugs schemes.</P>
    <P>Additionally, the Irish health services provide a range of personal special services, normally not embraced by a health care system, but absolutely vital to maintaining the independence and dignity of many of the disadvantaged groups in society.</P>
    <P>Services under this heading, to meantion but a few, include, disabled persons allowances; domiciliary care allowances for handicapped children; home help services; meals on wheels; capitation payments for children boarded out; adoption services and welfare homes for the elderly.</P>
    <P>In summary, we have succeeded in bringing our health services and health indicators broadly into line with the developed countries, many of which are wealthier and therefore in a better position to devote resources to health care.</P>
    <P>In general, health boards and hospitals have faced up realistically to deciding what has to be done to keep expenditure within allocation limits in 1986.  Some of the decisions taken were difficult and will undoubtedly impact on services and personnel. I do not accept the view that large scale disruption of services is likely to arise.  The funds available, if properly used, will be sufficient to maintain essential services.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1588" /> The capital allocation which I have received for 1986 is £58.16 million.  This is an increase of over £1 million on the capital funds available to me in 1985.  This allocation will permit me to continue with the programme of improvements already in progress and to undertake a limited number of additional projects.</P>
    <P>The major general hospital schemes in progress at St. James's, the Mater, Cavan and Mullingar will continue to be developed. In addition, work has already commenced on a major scheme at Castlebar General Hospital which will provide additional ward accommodation, X-ray, theatre, OPD and kitchen.  Tenders have been invited for the provision of a new OPD and theatre suite at St. Colmcille's Hospital, Loughlinstown, and the provision of a replacement maternity unit at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda, should shortly go to tender. The urgent improvement works which I have approved for Ardkeen Hospital in advance of the overall development of that hospital are scheduled to be completed during this year.</P>
    <P>The planning of proposed developments at Tallaght, Kilkenny, Wexford, Sligo and Naas will be continued and, in addition, smaller improvement works involving, for example, improvements of out-patient facilities and day hospitals, will be undertaken at other hospitals.</P>
    <P>The programme of improving standards in the major psychiatric hospitals and the provision of new day hospitals and day care centres for psychiatric care will be continued.  Tenders are currently being processed for the development of small psycho-geriatric units to improve standards at St. Brendan's Hospital, Dublin.</P>
    <P>In the case of the mental handicap services, the intake of patients into Cheeverstown Hospital, Templeogue, has already commenced and further facilities at the centre will be commissioned throughout the year.  When fully operational, the centre will provide 130 residential places and 150 day care places.  It is expected that a day care centre for adults at St. Michael's House, Belcamp, will open shortly.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1589" /> Work on the provision of additional accommodation for the physically handicapped should shortly commence at St. Laurence's Cheshire Home, Cork, while work is nearing completion on a major development scheme at Barrett Cheshire Home in Dublin.  Construction work is well advanced on the provision of new residential accommodation at St. Joseph's School for the Deaf, Cabra and a major development scheme has commenced at St. Mary's School for the Deaf, Cabra.  Planning is proceeding on a development at St. Mary's School for the blind.  It is expected that building work on this project will commerce later this year.</P>
    <P>The provision of facilities for the care of the elderly will continue to be a priority.  Construction of the new geriatric unit at St. Oliver Plunkett Hospital, Dundalk, is expected to be completed at the end of the year and building is in progress on the provision of a new 100 bed replacement geriatric unit at Sacred Heart Home, Carlow.  Funds are being provided for a scheme to upgrade accommodation at Leopardstown Park Hospital and planning will continue in respect of other major projects, at Dungarvan and elsewhere, for the care of the elderly.</P>
    <P>We will continue to push ahead with a major programme of systems development. This will yield many benefits: in improved patient care, in more accountable management, and in the rapid provision of information relevant to research and policy formulation.</P>
    <P>In the health area I published last April a report on the health services for the period 1983-86, copies of which were circulated to Members of the Oireachtas. This report set out in some detail the structure and financing of the health services, the rationale for the state of progress of the legislative programme, significant developments in each of the health care programmes and more general information on eligibility for services and other matters.  This publication was significant and long overdue.</P>
    <P>Given the labour intensive nature of <Col N="1590" /> health care, we have examined in great detail the manpower strategy.</P>
    <P>Since the health boards were established in 1970 there followed effectively a decade of exceptional employment creation in the health service until almost 66,500 persons were employed in July 1981.  At present there are approximately 62,500 people employed directly in the health services implying a reduction of some 6 per cent in overall numbers since 1981.  The impact of this on the ground is a challenge to health services personnel to increase productivity by maintaining the overall quality of service while reducing the number of man hours worked.  I will deal with this matter in detail if there are any inquiries.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that there are over 500 different grades in the health services and many of these, such as nurses, doctors, dentists and the various paramedical grades are unique to the services. Large numbers of staff in other employments also play a significant role in the efficient running of the various health care programmers, such as catering, maintenance, clerical and administrative staffs.</P>
    <P>At 31 December 1985, 36.69 per cent of the population were covered by medical cards as compared with 36.75 on 31 December 1984.  The income ceiling for hospital service cards was increased to £14,500 on 1 June 1986.  This revised figure applies to income earned in the year ending 5 April 1986.</P>
    <P>In accordance with the medical card guidelines a married man aged 66 years or over can have up to £105.50 per week, or £111.50 per week if over 80 years, and be entitled to a medical card.  The limit will be higher if he has dependants or outgoings in excess of £10.50 per week in respect of his house.</P>
    <P>I have increased the income ceiling for health contribution purposes to £14,000 with effect from 6 April, 1986.  The effect of the increased ceiling is to increase the maximum contribution payable from £130 to £140.  With the introduction of the land tax the existing method of collecting health contributions from farmers needs <Col N="1591" /> to be reviewed.  This is under active consideration at present.</P>
    <P>The present structuring of VHI insurance coverage provides for full recoupment of hospital in-patient expenses but only limited cover for general practitioner and other out-patient expenses. The out-patient cover applies only after a threshold of £105 for a single person and of £170 for a family has been reached. The current thrust of health policy in Ireland, as in many developed countries, is to reduce costly in-patient services and as far as possible encourage the provision of services on a community or out-patient basis.</P>
    <P>In line with this policy I have been anxious to encourage the development of VHIs primary care coverage so as to influence patients to make greater use in appropriate circumstances of primary care rather than hospital treatment. Accordingly, I have recently commissioned consultants to examine existing models for voluntary insurance in other countries which might be suitable for adaptation to meet our policy requirements. I have also asked the consultants to provide an analysis of how suitable models would operate under Irish conditions. The VHI are co-operating fully in this exercise.  I hope that all this will lead to the early introduction by the VHI of a comprehensive general practitioner and out-patient scheme.  I think that such a scheme would be warmly welcomed and subscribed to by the general population.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will be aware, the Children (Care and Protection) Bill, which I introduced early last year completed its Second Stage some weeks ago. I hope to see a major advancement on the Bill in the near future.</P>
    <P>I am pleased and gratified that the Bill has stimulated so much discussion.  I have also been heartened by the generally favourable reception that it has received. Many suggestions have, nevertheless, been made for changes in the Bill, and I am reviewing the provisions of the Bill generally prior to Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The new Dentists Act was passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas in 1985 <Col N="1592" /> and has led to the appointment of the new 19 member Dental Council with wider powers particularly in the disciplinary area.</P>
    <P>The passage of the Nurses Bill through the Oireachtas in November 1985 marked a watershed for the nursing profession. The new legislation allows the composition of An Bord Altranais to truly reflect the profession as it has developed in recent years.  The members elected to the profession's own self regulating statutory body are drawn from all the major disciplines of nursing and represent the practical, teaching and administrative areas.  I have every confidence that the new 29 board members will successfully combine their many skills and talents and will work together along the lines mapped out for them in what has been described as a visionary piece of legislation, the Nurses Act, 1985.  It is expected that the new board will meet in the first week in September and in the next five years will make a distinctive contribution.</P>
    <P>I intend to introduce the new Tobacco (Health Protection) Bill shortly.  The provisions in the Bill will help to establish non-smoking as the normal social behaviour and should help to deter young people from taking up smoking.  Of particular importance is the banning or restriction of smoking in certain public places.</P>
    <P>New Tobacco Products Regulations on smoking have been made and will also be operative this year and will include stronger health warnings on cigarette packages and media advertisements, a rotational system of health warnings, increased controls on point of sale advertising, the elimination of outdoor advertising at point of sale and tighter controls on sponsorship of events by tobacco companies.  They have been widely welcomed.</P>
    <P>The Health (Amendment) Bill, 1985 &mdash; to amend the Health Acts, 1947 to 1970 to enable health boards to charge for services provided for certain victims of road traffic accidents &mdash; has recently been passed.  Accordingly health boards and hospitals may now offset the loss of revenue, estimated at £4 million in a year, <Col N="1593" /> which they suffered as a consequence to the Supreme Court decision on Article 6 of the Health Services Regulations 1971.</P>
    <P>Since the passage in early 1985 of the Health (Family Planning) (Amendment) Act, which came into operation on 1 October last, my Department has been in regular contact with the health boards. Boards have submitted to the Department their assessment of the current availability of the various types of family planning services within their own functional area.  These assessments have been accompanied by an outline statement of the proposals of the appropriate health board with regard to future local developments which are anticipated in the area of family planning services generally.  They are being discussed with the Department of Health.</P>
    <P>The text of a Bill to provide for a statutory scheme of control of clinical trials has been circulated to all Dáil Deputies and Senators.  The Bill has been initiated in the Seanad.  The principle of a statutory scheme of this kind has been widely welcomed despite some incredibly mis-informed comment about it.  There has already been in existence a voluntary scheme operated by the National Drugs Advisory Board whereby proposals for such trials have been notified to the National Drugs Advisory Board in the first instance.  However, for the sake of the reputation of the pharmaceutical industry itself as well as to provide public assurance that satisfactory standard controls operate in relation to these trials, it is important that there should be a statutory basis for these arrangements.</P>
    <P>The Bill has, as I have said, been initiated in the Seanad and I will, as is usual with me, entertain all reasonable suggestions for its improvement, provided that its integral design is not fundamentally interfered with.</P>
    <P>The 1986 allocation to the Health Education Bureau has been increased to £2 million, which compares with, £1.75 million for 1985.  The additional allocation is necessary for the bureau to widen its health education campaigns in a number of areas including the development <Col N="1594" /> of an educational campaign with regard to AIDS.  The bureau also intends to intensify anti-smoking publicity to complement the new legislation to strengthen controls on the promotional activities of the tobacco companies to which I have already referred.  In addition, funds are necessary to broaden and develop the lifestyles education programme in schools, including sex education and anti-drug abuse attitudes.</P>
    <P>We are making progress in the area of drug abuse and shortly I hope to be able to announce progress on the provision of a walk-in out-patient facility in the inner city area of Dublin.  A planning brief for this badly needed unit has been agreed and negotiations are in progress concerning the purchase of a suitable premises for this new facility.</P>
    <P>The take up on the measles immunisation programme has been outstanding.  In six months a national up-take of 90 per cent was achieved and I should like to thank those involved in making that programme a success.</P>
    <P>Negotiations on the general medical services are proceeding.  We have been gravely concerned about the increasing costs of the GMS in recent years and it is vital that we have agreement with the medical profession on this question.  I am actively pursuing the prospect of bringing the negotiations to a conclusion.  It will not be for lack of efforts on my part and I trust the profession will co-operate.</P>
    <P>The FICI Agreement was signed recently.  This will result as from 1 August in a 10 per cent reduction in the price of drugs at present on the market.  The agreement also entails an increase in the rebate paid by manufacturers to the State in respect of GMS sales from 4 per cent to 5 per cent.  I am very pleased about this agreement.  It is a critical one dealing with a major industry and it shows what can be done where there is co-operation on both sides in negotiations.</P>
    <P>More than 30 small health centres were completed during 1985-86 at a cost of £500,000 per annum.  Many of the health centres were in very bad condition and work was urgently needed to help in this area.  New major health centres were <Col N="1595" /> opened in Blanchardstown, Loughlinstown and Blessington in the Eastern Health Board area.  A further seven centres are being planned at present for Dublin.  I have also approved the development of major new health centres and community care officers in Athlone and Portlaoise.  Planning for a centre in Carlow is practically completed and a major new and innovative project is being planned for Waterford.  In addition, other centres are being planned for areas throughout the country.  With regard to the review of services for the elderly, we are undertaking another major review. There will be no delay in bringing forward our policy guidelines.  As Deputies are aware, I promised this in my Estimate speech last year.</P>
    <P>With regard to the psychiatric services, I do not propose to go back over the major debates that have taken place here.  I have been in touch with the Western, Eastern and South Eastern Health Boards on the matter.  We have reached substantial agreement regarding the provision of hostel, day hospital, acute and longer stay units in the various counties. I have stressed my anxiety to provide the necessary capital funds to facilitate the immediate provision of these facilities. We have reached agreement on the designation of specific areas for mentally handicapped and the psycho-geriatric patients in those hospitals.  I hope in the near future I will get the agreement of the health boards concerned regarding the siting of the acute psychiatric units in Carlow and Roscommon.  Meanwhile, I shall continue the funding of these facilities on a month-to-month basis.  I have had ongoing discussions with the trade unions on the matter.</P>
    <P>I am extremely concerned with regard to the problem of alcoholism.  As we know, alcohol abuse and alcoholic psychosis accounted for 7,100 admissions to our psychiatric hospitals in 1983, or almost 25 per cent of total admissions. This is a very grave problem and one we in Ireland are reluctant to tackle.  It will require major action in the health services.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1596" /> With regard to services for the mentally handicapped, this year we have had an overall expenditure of £107 million, compared with a sum of £100 million at Estimate stage in 1985, which indicates an increase in line with inflation.  Where any of the agencies have individual problems I shall be quite willing to meet them to discuss such matters.  However, the majority of the services for the mentally handicapped are ongoing.  There have been major improvements on the capital and current sides, apart from one major policy change, namely, the interruption of the planning process for Loughlinstown and Enniscorthy.  This was for valid reasons, particularly to dilute the intensely institutionalised character of the proposals. With regard to new developments, I refer to the provision of the 70-place adult special care unit at Belcamp in north Dublin.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Green Paper on Services for Disabled People, we had a major conference on 21 May 1986 on the training and employment aspects of that paper.  I should like to thank the many organisations who assisted us in that regard.  Their response was very productive and was of benefit to us in considering what developments might be carried out.</P>
    <P>With regard to residential care for the physically handicapped, I am pleased we made available a total of £1.45 million in capital grants, including a sum of £750,000 for the development of a new Cheshire Home at Monkstown, County Dublin.  The new home will provide accommodation for 26 severely physically disabled people.  This is vital in the greater Dublin area.  The emphasis will be on independent domestic self-help accommodation for each resident.  In addition, we have made moneys available to the Barrett Cheshire Home in Dublin. A grant of £200,000 was made available towards that project.  A further sum of £500,000 is being made available towards the provision of 28-single bed accommodation units in the Cheshire Home in Cork. These are major developments.  I am very pleased the Cheshire Home Foundation <Col N="1597" /> have co-operated so magnificently with the Department of Health in this matter.</P>
    <P>Major work is on going in respect of general hospitals.  In the mid-west area the new theatre suite at Croom Orthopaedic Hospital is nearing completion. Major renovation works are under way at St. John's Hospital in Limerick, and work is in progress on new theatres and structural works for the orthopaedic unit at Tullamore.  We are going ahead with major development schemes at Limerick Regional Hospital and at Nenagh, Kilkenny and Navan hospitals.</P>
    <P>In the Eastern Health Board area we have made major progress.  On the north side of Dublin the first phase of the development of the new Mater Hospital is almost complete and is expected to be commissioned on a phased basis in 1986 and 1987.  I intend to proceed as quickly as possible with the commissioning of Beaumont Hospital which has been referred to on many occasions in this House.  This is a much needed facility which will replace inadequate accommodation at both Jervis Street and St. Laurence's Hospitals.  I am concentrating particularly on opening the acute psychiatric facility at the hospital as part of the sectoral psychiatric service provided by the Eastern Health Board.  The planning brief for James Connolly Memorial Hospital has been prepared and I am giving consideration as to how this development can be slotted into the programme.</P>
    <P>On the south side, a major phase of the development of St. James' Hospital is currently under construction and is expected to be completed in 1989.  Planning is proceeding on the development of the new Tallaght Hospital which will incorporate the services currently provided by the Meath, Adelaide, Harcourt Street and the orthopaedic service at Dr. Steeven's Hospital.  A planning brief for the development of St. Vincent's Hospital is nearing completion.</P>
    <P>Apart from the six major Dublin hospitals, major improvement or development schemes have been completed or approved at St. Michael's Hospital, Dún Laoghaire, the Rotunda Hospital, Cappagh <Col N="1598" /> Hospital, Harcourt Street Children's Hospital and the Meath Hospital while planning is proceeding on developments at Naas Hospital, Temple Street Hospital, St. Michael's Hospital, Dún Laoghaire and St. Columcille's Hospital, Loughlinstown.</P>
    <P>The rationalisation plans for the south side of Dublin provide for the transfer of services at Sir Patrick Dun's Hospital, Baggot Street Hospital and services other than orthopaedics at Dr. Steeven's Hospital to St. James' Hospital Services which had been provided at Mercers Hospital have already transferred to St. James' Hospital.</P>
    <P>Sir Patrick Dun's Hospital was originally scheduled for closure in 1989.  With the co-operation of the parties concerned, I am confident we will succeed in having an orderly closure and transfer of patients.  Already we have completed the closure of St. Patrick's Infants Hospital, Blackrock, with ongoing care being provided for the children concerned.  In the Southern Health Board area progress is evident.  We have had excellent co-operation with the South Infirmary and Victoria Hospital which have been amalgamated.  The services now provided by the Eye, Ear and Throat Hospital will be transferred to other hospitals in the region with the ophthalmic services going to the Cork Regional Hospital and the ear, nose and throat service going to the South Infirmary/Victoria Hospital.</P>
    <P>I am particularly pleased with what happened in the Midland Health Board area as regards Portlaoise, Tullamore and Mullingar.  The paediatric service in Portlaoise is well under way and we are providing a service for the entire region pending the completion of the new development at Mullingar.  This means that for the first time ever the people of the Midlands have a fully fledged paediatric and orthopaedic service.  Many Deputies challenged me as to the provision of that service but the proof of the pudding is in the eating and I am pleased to record that the unit now has two full time consultants. I want to commend the officers of my Department who have worked long and hard to bring about the rationalisari <Col N="1599" /> tion of the services in the Midlands.  I am very happy this has been so successful because it means no more comments for narrow vested interests of a political nature will be made in the future.</P>
    <P>The Mid-Western Health Board agreed with my proposal that the old geriatric hospital at Edenvale be closed and the resources used to open the new maternity unit at Cahercalla and the renal dialysis unit at Limerick Regional Hospital.  This has now been done and for the first time the mothers of County Clare have a top class modern maternity facility while patients with renal failure no longer have to travel long distances to Dublin, Cork or Galway for dialysis.  New renal dialysis units have been opened in Sligo and Letterkenny.  This service has been long over due.</P>
    <P>The North-Eastern Health Board recently submitted a proposal to close the County Infirmary in Navan for inpatient use and to use the resources to open the new children's unit in the orthopaedic unit in Navan, to initiate a geriatric assessment service at the geriatric hospital in Trim and to establish a psychiatric day hospital at the County Infirmary in Navan.  The proposal looks sensible and will have my support.</P>
    <P>The new maternity unit at the Galway Regional Hospital has been opened.  I hope to visit it shortly to see it in operation. In the South-Eastern Health Board area I am making additional funds available for the establishment of a consultant staffed paediatric service at Wexford General Hospital.  This will be in operation very shortly and will provide a much needed and valuable service for the area.  I am satisfied that the funding from the Exchequer of two bodies responsible for health research is by no means the most efficient means of disbursement of such funds.  The amalgamation of the two bodies under a single statutory authority would be very successful.</P>
    <P>I thank the Chair and Deputy O'Hanlon for their tolerance while I read a very lengthy script, but I thought I had longer <Col N="1600" /> than 30 minutes to make my contribution. I hope to deal in my reply with the reorganisation of the health services which is referred to in the final page of my script.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the Minister's problems in relation to timing and I appreciate that he was under pressure to finish reading his script.  However, he has given us a bird's eye view of the situations as he sees it but one of the major areas to which he did not refer was the morale of the people working in the health services. This is at an all time low mainly I believe because the Minister has not recognised that these people are working harder with reduced allocations.  I do not intend to spend my time this morning going into the health cuts because we have been over that ground a number of times.</P>
      <P>It is important that the Minister recognises that health board staff &mdash; management, medical, nursing, paramedical, maintenance, wardsmaids and so on &mdash; are making a very valuable effort with a reduced allocation.  On a number of occasions the Minister said there was plenty of money for anything that needed to be done, but that is far from the reality. The Minister told us what was happening in the different health boards, but he read four lines dealing with the new maternity unit in the Western Health Board area. There are much more fundamental reorganisation plans in Merlin Park Hospital. We would like to have heard something about this from the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of the Department instructing health boards, as has been done on a number of times, brings into focus the relationship between the Minister and his Department and the health boards.  This has been the subject of comment in this House often.  On 30 January the Minister expressed his concern at the way the management of health boards behave in relation to their boards as against their relationship with his Department.  This is another area the Minister should look at.  It appears that he sees the personnel in the health services as his staff rather than as 58,000 <Col N="1601" /> people working for other health agencies. It is in this area that a lot of morale problems arise.</P>
    <P>The Alma Mater Declaration, to which we all subscribe &mdash; to try to provide health services for all by the year 2,000 &mdash; is an ideal which it is unlikely will be achieved. That does not mean we should not work towards that goal.  The major topics raised at that conference were the promotion of good health and the prevention of illness.  Over the years there has not been a significant increase in the allocation from the Health Estimate to community protection programmes.  This year there is an increase of £500,000 but there are many areas which need to be looked at by the Minister.</P>
    <P>There should be more emphasis on personal responsibility for health.  Coronary artery disease, one of the great killers of our time, can be prevented by a better life style.  This is something the Government should be promoting.  In the United States they were able to reduce the number of coronary artery disease attacks in the male adult population by a comprehensive education policy on a healthy lifestyle.</P>
    <P>On the question of diet, food plays a major role in two directions.  In the Third World the lack of food causes serious morbidity and mortality while in the western world over-eating causes the problems.  The Minister and the Department of Health should look at this area.</P>
    <P>We have a good record on immunisation and in the past I have complimented and supported the Minister in his measles immunisation programme.  The prevention of illness is of great importance and health agencies should be involved more actively here.  In the next 25 years the same attention should be given to the prevention of illness as was given to the treatment of illness in the last 25 years, particularly in the areas of science and education.</P>
    <P>It is topical to say a brief word about one or two areas.  One is the whole question of radioactivity and the role of health departments throughout the world and of Ministers of Health in this.  Our Government <Col N="1602" /> here have not been sufficiently vocal on the question of nuclear fallout and radioactivity from nuclear stations generating electricity or places such as Sellafield.  Ministers for Health around the world must interest themselves much more in influencing their governments to consider the dangers associated with radioactivity.  Something which must be a matter of concern to us all is the definition of a tolerable level of radioactivity. There has never been a revised figure upwards.  The figure for the level of radioactivity has often been revised of downwards on the basis that some new complication was discovered.  We have never seen the physicists coming along to say that there is a much safer level of tolerance.  The moral is that there is no such thing as a tolerable level of radioactivity. It would be a tragedy for mankind if we were to spend our time fighting against the proliferation of nuclear weapons because of the danger of massive radioactivity in the world as a result of a nuclear war and at the same time neglect to deal with the very serious problem of increasing radioactivity from nuclear stations.  We had the example of Chernobyl and there is no doubt that that type of incident can be repeated nearer to us here.  Therefore, I appeal to the Minister to use his influence not alone on his own Government but on other Ministers for Health around the world so that the whole question of nuclear activity will be taken more seriously.</P>
    <P>Another serious problems in our country and in many others is the abuse of alcohol.  While the Minister referred to the problems associated with the abuse of alcohol it is interesting that when he spoke about substance abuse and the allocation to the Health Education Bureau, he made no comment on what plans there are to deal with education in relation to this substance abuse.  The figures the Minister gave are quite startling.</P>
    <P>In 1970, 3,073 persons were admitted to hospital for the treatment of alcohol abuse and in 1983 there were 7,100, a very significant increase.  Earlier in the year the Minister told us in reply to a <Col N="1603" /> question of mine that six person under 15 years of age, 19 persons between 15 and 20 years of age and a total of almost 300 under 25 years of age were admitted to psychiatric hospitals.  These figures must create concern for Health Ministers and Health Departments, particularly now when new legislation is about to be introduced to this House in regard to the licensing laws.</P>
    <P>I hope that the Minister will make a positive contribution at Government level regarding the seriousness of alcohol abuse and if anything special needs to be done that will be done in the legislation. I would like to see the Health Education Bureau financed sufficiently so that they might introduce the same sort of aggressive programme as was introduced in relation to smoking.  It is significant that the Minister in replying to a question here said that £400,000 was spent on combating the abuse of smoking, £400,000 was spent on combating abuse of drugs and just £70,000 was spent on combating the abuse of alcohol which creates far and away the most serious problems of substance abuse in this country.</P>
    <P>We get good value for money in the GMS which caters for almost 37 per cent of the population at a cost of £100 million, providing a very comprehensive general practitioner service for seven days a week 365 days a year.  Obviously, areas in that service must be looked at.  It is to be hoped that the present negotiations will be brought to a successful conclusion in the not too distant future and I appeal to the Minister not to delay them in any way.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to look at the matter of ensuring that doctors who prescribe generic drugs will be aware of the drug that is to be dispensed.  At present if a doctor writes the basic name of a product it is a matter for the pharmacist to dispense any manufacturer's product and we are all satisfied that one would not necessarily get the same product.  I know that we have a licensing system, but this area needs to be examined to ensure that doctors can confidently use more and more generic products as we would like <Col N="1604" /> to see them do.  There is no reason why a more expensive drug should be used if an equivalent which costs less is available.</P>
    <P>The money allocated for the home nursing service is being increased by £0.5 million.  This brings into question the whole thrust and support of the Government for a shift to community care.  It appears that over the years there has been no significant shift in resources to community care.  There has been a reduction in some health board areas in the travelling allowance of nurses by 10 per cent as a cost saving device.  If we are to build up community care sufficiently to cut down the use of our acute hospitals and hospitals for elderly people we must have an efficient nursing service which we must not curtail in any way.  The Minister told us that 2,100 new nurses were appointed over the last five years.  Since the Minister came to office 452 nurses have been appointed to health boards. The Minister may not have the information, but I would like to know where the 2,100 nurses were appointed.  When I asked a question in the House as to where they were appointed in detail generally the Minister was unable to provide the answer.</P>
    <P>The question of travelling expenses for personnel working in the area of community care is also interesting.  I raised the question of the deterioration of the level of dental service and the Minister listed the amounts of money which the health boards are paying for travelling expenses as being one area where they could perhaps make a saving in order to be able to improve the dental service. There is an obligation on the Government to provide an adequate and proper dental service.  Such is not available at present.  It is intolerable that people on the lowest income are obliged to go to a private dentist and pay for treatment.</P>
    <P>We do not have time in this limited debate to go into great detail on the question of personal social services but I hope that an opportunity will be provided later in the House to have a discussion on the report of the Commission on Social Welfare because many aspects of the <Col N="1605" /> report impinge on the area of administration of the health service.  For example, the disabled persons' maintenance allowance does not really fit into the scheme of unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance.  There is also a social welfare scheme of disability benefit but there is none in relation to disability assistance administered by the Department of Social Welfare as that scheme rests with the health boards.  The fact that it is not funded directly from central funds may mean that it is not as widely available because of cutbacks as it should be.  One health board reduced the allowance for the rehabilitation maintenance allowance by £10 per week which is unacceptable.</P>
    <P>Voluntary agencies have suffered over the years and they must be supported because it is obvious that elderly people suffering from acute illness should, if possible, be maintained and supported in their own homes if not by their community. If the community are maintaining them much of the support will be and has been traditionally given by voluntary agencies.  We must ensure that nothing will diminish the quality of their work.</P>
    <P>The psychiatric services have been debated here at length on a number of occasions and the Minister said on 30 January that St. Patrick's, Castlerea and St. Dympna's, Carlow, would be closing this year.  There is now a reorganisation and I understand that they will be maintained as geriatric hospitals although psychiatric patients are still being admitted to them.  There seems to be a certain amount of confusion in that regard.  We fully support the recommendations of the report on the psychiatric services entitled &ldquo;Planning for the Future&rdquo; in which is recommended a phased development over ten or 15 years.  It should be seen in that context.  It would be a tragedy if we moved too quickly and ended up with the results which can be seen in Italy or indeed in the United States where persons were put out of psychiatric hospitals. This was unacceptable to the public and the whole idea of community psychiatry developed a bad name.  However, the fact that these mistakes were made <Col N="1606" /> does not mean that the concept is wrong but it would be a pity to make the mistakes made in those countries.</P>
    <P>Concern has been expressed by voluntary organisations, including religious orders, in regard to the mentally handicapped as their allocation for this year has been reduced in real terms.  They would like to develop a community service but they will be obliged to maintain more and more mentally handicapped people in institutions.  This is something we should be trying to get away from. Nevertheless, having said that, it is important that places would be available for persons who need residential care.  I was perturbed to hear the Minister say that children are not a priority in this regard.  I accept that there may be a larger number of adults waiting for admission to homes for the mentally handicapped and that probably a small number of children is involved but for individual families who are unable to cope with a severely handicapped or autistic child who is in their care for 24 hours of every day, it is not very comforting to be told that there is only a small number on the waiting list.</P>
    <P>I wish also to refer to the impact of the National Lottery Bill on the services for the handicapped generally.  I wonder if the Minister is aware of the consequences of that legislation for many of the voluntary organisations involved in the care of the handicapped.  Have the Government taken advice as to what the impact may be on many organisations who depend on lotteries for support and maintenance?</P>
    <P>We have discussed the question of the closure of wards in acute hospitals.  I should like the Minister to look particularly at the impact of the closure of specialist units for longer terms than usual during the summer for maintenance, painting, etc.  There will be an effect on the waiting list for admission to hospitals and also in terms of outpatients' departments.  Perhaps the Minister will ensure that the situation will not deteriorate in the next 12 months to the same extent as it did over the past 12 months, where in some specialist departments <Col N="1607" /> consultants are unable to cope with the numbers on the waiting list.</P>
    <P>Has there been agreement between the staff, unions and the health board on the sudden closure of Sir Patrick Dun's Hospital which is due to take place on 29 August although it was not supposed to close until the end of 1988 when patients would be transferred to St. James's?</P>
    <P>The care of the elderly will be the biggest challenge to health care between now and the end of the century because there will be more people over 65 years of age.  That figure will increase by 10 per cent and the number over 75 will increase by 20 per cent in the next six or seven years.  There will be a need for accommodation for these people and perhaps more physicians should be specifically trained in geriatric care in homes for the elderly around the country.  There should also be more support for these people in the community and co-operation with other departments in ensuring that good support facilities will be available, for example by the Department of the Environment and local authorities.  We should also reconsider the question of extending the scope of the disabled persons' reconstruction grant to families who are prepared to take in aged parents and look after them.  That would be the ideal solution.</P>
    <P>It is a matter for concern that the amount of cannabis coming into the country is increasing.  I asked a question recently of the Minister for Justice regarding the amounts of heroin, cocaine and cannabis which had been confiscated by the Garda during the last three years. I was told that the amount of cannabis confiscated went up from 97.31 grammes in 1983 to 293.17 grammes in 1985.  While the amount of heroin confiscated seems to have levelled out, nevertheless it is an indication of the activity of people involved in substance abuse.</P>

      <P>On the question of the Green Paper promised by the Minister <Col N="1608" /> on a number of occasions, I fail to understand the U-turn taken on this because it appears that a comprehensive debate on the health services generally would have helped the Minister in making his proposals to Government.  Instead of that, having promised us a Green Paper over a number of years, we are told now that he has made the proposals without any Green Paper and without any major discussion with all the various agencies and people who would have wished to contribute.</P>
      <P>Let us take the example of the Children (Care and Protection) Bill.  The Minister told us here today that a number of changes would have to be made in it. I would not like to see the same thing happening to the whole reorganisation of the health services, to see the Government bring forward proposals that are totally unacceptable without a proper debate.  We hear of a possible reduction in the number of health boards to three and that is moving away from the thrust of other Departments such as the Departments of Education and the Environment who are going for devolved administration. The Department of the Environment published a booklet in advance of the local elections last year, giving all the various duties that would devolve on the local authorities.  In regard to health services, more and more power has been taken into the Department since the Minister came into Government.  It would be unfortunate if proposals unacceptable to the public generally were brought into this House.  It is unfortunate that the Minister did not bring his Green Paper to the House as he did in regard to the Green Paper on the Disabled and the report on the psychiatric services.  It would have been a valuable exercise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not sure that his Green Paper would be on the basis of what has been presented to the House in the past three years &mdash; the problems with Beaumont and the question of whether it would be opened, the whole question of the nurses' home on which work was commenced in 1984 and the reversal of that decision, the whole question of using part of the hospital for psychiatric services which I <Col N="1609" /> think is a mistake because I believe it should be opened as one major general teaching hospital for the north city, the problem with Monaghan hospital which was supposed to close and the reversal of the decision to do so, the question of more authority for State bodies involved in health on hospital management boards and the question of bringing the Medical Research Council and the Medico-Social Research Board under the aegis of the Department which I am not sure would serve the public interest in the long term because it might interfere with the independence of these two bodies who have been doing very good work.</P>
    <P>Regarding the Control of Clinical Trials Bill I was glad to hear that the Minister will accept amendments that do not interfere with the general thrust of the Bill and I hope he will take account of the concerns of many bona fide groups who are concerned about that legislation.</P>
    <P>I did not go into the whole area of cutbacks because we have been through that area before.  That does not mean that we are not still concerned about it.  I would ask the Minister, particularly during this year, to see if there is any way he can raise the morale of all the staff who are working in the various health agencies and ensure that adequate services are provided, particularly in areas where the services have deteriorated rapidly, for example, the dental service area?</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to put on the record the fact that the health services we have here are among the best in the world.  We should not lose sight of that fact which is a tribute to this Government, to previous Governments, to this House, to the Department of Health and to the doctors and nurses and the various attendants and public servants in the health services.  It is not just our job to put the Department under scrutiny and complain.  We should also give encouragement and recognition where it is due.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to refer to the question of cancer in our society at the outset lest I run out of time later.  I did not hear it referred to so far.  In reply to a Parliamentary <Col N="1610" /> Question in my name some weeks ago the Minister gave some startling figures on the death rate from cancer and on the variety of cancers in the community.  I am aware of the Minister's concern about smoking and alcohol abuse which was mentioned also by the Opposition spokesman along with the question of drug abuse but cancer is one of the biggest killers of younger people and it is totally indiscriminate.</P>
    <P>Three members of my own family have passed away, one in a tragic accident and two from cancer.  Increasingly, it is the young &mdash; children, teenagers and those in their twenties and thirties &mdash; who are affected by this indiscriminate disease.  It appears to be becoming more prevalent among those who would have been expected to have long and healthy lives ahead of them.  I regret that there is no procedure for Parliament to become involved in the area of examining health hazards to the community connected with cancer.  Parliament, in collaboration with the health boards, the Department of Health and the various medical experts, should be entitled to look into the whole question of this frightening disease and to discuss resources to fight it.  This is not a party issue.  In the US Senate such an examination has been carried out.  Parliament must develop its committee system along the lines of other Parliaments and the model we are pursuing is probably nearer to the German one, but we have not gone very far along that road.  New Zealand, of comparable size to us, has a structure which would entitle that Parliament to examine this question and we should, too.  There should be a committee dealing in general with health affairs, but specifically with dreaded cancer.</P>
    <P>Can we be satisfied with the growing nuclear hazard of Sellafield and the Holyhead area and others?  Are we scientifically satisfied that problems there are not a contributing factor to the increased incidence of cancer among our young people?  What are the other contributing factors?  In any other era a disease which stood out so clearly as this would have been the subject of attention by the Parliament <Col N="1611" /> of the day.  I ask the Minister to become the catalyst in getting together a committee of this House or a joint committee of both Houses to find out what gives rise to cancer, what can be done to cure it or minimise its effects, or to remove the hazards which give rise to it.  Smoking is not the sole cause.  Other matters need to be tackled.</P>
    <P>For seven months when we were in Opposition on the last occasion I was junior spokesman for Health, with specific responsibility for health board reform, but I did not make very much progress before the Government were changed.  No other issue prompted as much interest around the country as that of health reform.  At the time of the dissolution of Parliament I had been invited to speak in about eight different counties, where people had very strong views on what should be done.  We should not be establishing three health boards.  We should be reducing the number, and should not be making health boards larger.  The Eastern Health Board cover Dublin and part of the surrounding counties of Kildare and Wicklow.  This is far too cumbersome and far too remote from the people.  Above all, it is far too lacking in accountability.  The Minister is not answerable for the day to day running of the health boards, nor are the local authorities, so these boards are in a particularly smug limbo, accountable neither to Parliament nor to local authority.  They should be accountable to elected public representatives because of the problems which arise from time to time.</P>
    <P>Dublin Corporation spend something in the region of £250 million a year, which is a great deal.  The expenditure is made to work because the corporation, leaving aside the county council and the Dún Laoghaire Borough Council, have officials who work very closely with the elected councillors in the administration of the city.  There should be some similar procedure for the health boards.  I am aware that there was previously a Dublin Health Authority but I am not necessarily suggesting a return to that.  However, there <Col N="1612" /> should be a greater involvement of councillors or of this House in making health boards more accountable.  It is all too easy for the boards to blame cutbacks for all situations.  An explanation such as that would not be tolerated by Dublin Corporation for any of the other services.  That is happening because there is nobody to call in the official concerned to ask specifically what has happened in a case. I am urging on the Minister to involve councillors in holding the health boards responsible.</P>
    <P>In the Dublin area the Dublin Corporation, county council and borough council &mdash; the three county councils as they will be in time &mdash; should be able to call in an official who would be answerable to an elected authority.  This would bring the health boards nearer to the people and would cut out unnecessary bureaucracy and the blaming of all shortcomings on Department of Health cutbacks.  The Department of Health are, after all, the second biggest spending Department in the State.  This would be good for democracy and would serve the people, as it is our duty to do.  I know one case of an elderly person who had a fall in the middle of the night and was brought into hospital by ambulance for X-ray and sent home at 4 a.m. in a taxi in a disorientated state.  Nobody was held to account for that.  I cannot put down a Parliamentary Question referring to such a case, even if one of my constituents were to die.  The Minister would say it is a matter for the health boards.  I cannot get a councillor to raise the matter at Dublin Corporation level because the City Manager has no responsibility for such a case.  It is by making sure that cases such as that do not happen that we will get the system to work for the people.  I earnestly ask the Minister to scrap the health boards and return the health services to some forum of directly elected people, such as local authorities, to bring back accountability.</P>
    <P>The central purchasing of drugs was recommended by a report, with the use of prescriptions using generic terms rather than branded names, with a saving to the State, in mid-seventies terms, of somewhere in the region of £10 million.  That <Col N="1613" /> recommendation was never followed up. The State may well have lost in the region of £20 million to £25 million because of that, although there is no way of measuring the amount.  There should be a central purchasing of drugs for use by the health boards, with the requirement that drugs prescribed on a generic basis should be dispensed on a generic rather than a brand name basis.  If somebody needs paracetemal, a branded produce should not be necessary.  I understand from evidence recently given before the Committee of Public Accounts that in the region of 30 per cent extra cost is involved because of this.  That is totally unnecessary. The attention of the House and of the Department of Health has been drawn to this in an expert report and ten years later nothing has been done. Perhaps the Minister will allude to this subject and put the House right if what I have said is incorrect.  I should like to be able to read his reply in the Official Report so that the Committee of Public Accounts can pursue the matter.  There is wasteful expenditure on a grand scale in that area.</P>
    <P>There are three remaining aspects to which I wish to refer.  The first is the Children's Hospital in Crumlin, in which I should declare an interest as I am a member of the board of management.  I want to express my appreciation to the Minister and the secretary of the Department of Health for their assistance to that hospital to date, particularly in the recent past.  I ask the Minister to ensure that the design stage for the development of the out-patient department of the hospital goes ahead urgently.  It is the biggest children's hospital in Europe and probably one of the biggest in the world. It is an excellent hospital.  It does not serve Dublin alone because children are brought there from all over the country. Parents travel long distances to see their children and this gives rise to parking problems in the area.  If a proper out-patient department could be developed some children might not have to stay overnight in the hospital.  That gives rise to stress for young children.  I want to <Col N="1614" /> express my appreciation for the assitance which we have got to date.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the dental service for married women, particularly women whose husbands are working and paying stamps but who are not working themselves. I urge the Minister to ensure equality of treatment in this regard.  If it is not possible to extend the full treatment to married women then at least married women and their husbands should arrange to take turns when applying for the service.  It is outrageous that the husband can qualify and the wife cannot.  In many cases women are more in need of dental services because of the dental problems which sometimes arise on a post-natal basis.  I ask the Minister to consider urgently the need for the extention of equality of treatment for dental services for married women whose husbands are full stamp contributors.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to consider involving his Department in the training of judges in the area of drug abuse and misuse. Many of our judges still do not understand the serious difference between heroin and cannabis or similar drugs.  In the past a person with a quantity of cannabis got a jail sentence but a person with a quantity of heroin got a suspended sentence.  There should be some training in the area of drug abuse, drug identification and the difference between drugs. Members of the Judiciary should be assisted in dealing with the administration of the misuse of drugs legislation. Many judges are at sea.  They have not been provided with professional courses to develop their knowledge in this area. All gardaí get initial training in regard to drugs.  Some gardaí of higher ranks take refresher courses in the area of drug abuse.  I presume our customs service are constantly getting advice on the variety of illegal drugs available.  If not, they should be.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to initiate steps to ensure that, through his Department, or the health education authority, whichever he considers to be the appropriate body, a course will be developed for members of the Judiciary so that they will be easily able to identify the variety and <Col N="1615" /> the seriousness of drugs.  This would help them in the administration of the Misuse of Drugs Act.  I ask the Minister to place on the record of the House the current state of play with regard to drug abuse in the community, if the situation is under control, if the trend is downwards and if he has figures or information to show the position on drug abuse in the community.</P>

      <P>I hope I will be excused if I concentrate mainly on my own constituency and concerns in my constituency regarding the future of hospital services in County Roscommon and part of east Galway.  Yesterday was D-day for the closure of St. Patrick's hospital in Castlerea.  Fortunately, D-day has passed and the hospital did not close.  I am delighted.  I take this opportunity to appeal to the Minister to allow the retention of St. Patrick's Psychiatric Hospital in Castlerea and to withdraw his deadline for closure which I understand is now the end of August 1986.  In case the Minister would accuse Deputies and Senators in the constituency of lacking in progress and being parochially minded, I make no apologies to the Minister, his secretary or his Department officials for my wholehearted support for the continuation of acute psychiatric services in St. Patrick's hospital in Castlerea and the development of full services in the county hospital in Roscommon.  The county hospital in Roscommon has provided an excellent service over the years to the people in that county and in surrounding areas.  At <Col N="1616" /> present, as a result of Fianna Fáil policy, we have an eminent physician, Dr. Pat McHugh, an eminent surgeon, Dr. Michael Relihan, and a full back up service to support them in their work.</P>
      <P>In 1985 for a 12 month period there were over 2,106 admissions to the medical department of the county hospital in Roscommon.  That makes it one of the busiest medical departments in any county hospital in the country.  I request the Minister to approve the application by the Western Health Board to appoint a second physician to the medical department of the county hospital in Roscommon.  The number of admissions whihc are documented, of which the Minister is quite well aware, would justify the appointment of a second physician to the medical unit of that hospital.  In the coronary care unit of the hospital there were 422 patients over a 12 month period. As a constituency Deputy I visit the hospital on a regular basis.  I can testify to the number of patients who have been treated successfully in the coronary care unit, the medical unit and the surgical unit of the county hospital.</P>
      <P>The proposal by the Minister which was announced in the Dáil to close the acute psychiatric unit in St. Patrick's hospital in Castlerea and to transfer it to the county hospital in Roscommon was not welcomed in my constituency or in County Roscommon.  It has been resisted by the elected members of the Western Health Board, and as chairman of the Roscommon health committee I can say that the committee fully voiced their objections to the proposal.</P>
      <P>The transfer of the psychiatric patients from Castlerea would deprive the county hospital of 30 beds which are badly needed there because of overcrowding. Besides, it is undesirable to transfer an acute psychiatric unit to that hospital.  I should like to know if the report of the specialists is available.  I hope the report is not subject to duress on the part of the Department.  I inspected the unit in the county hospital in Roscommon and found it totally unsuitable for use as an acute psychiatric unit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1617" /> The people of Roscommon are quite prepared to accept any fully equipped psychiatric unit in, say, the grounds of the Roscommon County Hospital.  That is a reasonable request and it should be supported by the Minister.  The Castlerea hospital is one of the newest such hospitals in the country and has been providing an excellent service.  It is in very spacious grounds, suitable for the recuperation of psychiatric patients.  I do not see any justification for the proposal to transfer those patients to a ward in the county hospital which cannot possibly be properly adjusted or adapted for such a service.</P>
    <P>There is nothing but amazement at the Minister's proposal to retain the Castlerea hospital as a psycho-geriatric unit.  The hospital should be retained in its present capacity until a new psychiatric unit has been built adjoining the Roscommon County Hospital.  The staffs of both hospitals have agreed with this suggestion.  Therefore, the Minister should postpone the closure of the Castlerea unit pending the erection and the completion &mdash; it would take five years &mdash; of the new unit in the grounds of the Roscommon County Hospital.</P>
    <P>I regret that that decision was made. The Minister of Health is a Labour Party member of the Cabinet and the Cabinet are responsible for this objectionable decision.  The Taoiseach disowned the decision of the Minister when addressing Fine Gael constituency meetings in Roscommon.  This shows the total lack of cohesion in the Coalition.  The Minister must be aware of the Taoiseachs decision to remove him from the Department of Health in order to be amenable to pressure from Fine Gael backbenchers from Carlow-Kilkenny and elsewhere in regard to the Minister's decision.  The Taoiseach does not want the Minister for Health in this important Department, and the Minister knows the lack of loyalty and cohesion in the Cabinet in regard to Coalition policy.</P>
    <P>Basically, the Minister is on his own in relation to these decisions affecting my <Col N="1618" /> constituency.  Seemingly, he is in a position to prevent his removal by the Taoiseach and this indicates that the Taoiseach has no real ability to manage the Cabinet.  Indeed that was amply illustrated last Thursday.  I hope we will be able to fight a general election soon and in my constituency we will be fighting to provide proper health services which the people want and are not getting.  The damage being done there by the Minister is untold.  Those candidates put up by the Government in the general election will dissociate themselves from the Minister's decisions.  I suggest that the Deputy representing Fine Gael in that constituency is not here today because he would prefer to refer to this matter behind closed doors locally and indicate his total objection to the Minister's policy in the constituency.</P>
    <P>The proposal of the Minister is to transfer the maternity unit in the Roscommon County Hospital to St. Anne's maternity ward.  Comhairle na nOspidéal agree that an obstetrician-gynaecologist and a paeditrician should be appointed to the unit in the County Hospital.  The Minister promised me a few weeks ago during Question Time that he would make available the file of correspondence between Mr. Basil Chubb and the former Minister for Health.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister made sure there would not be a specialist there.  I appeal again to the Minister.  He has some motivation in relation to our hospital in Roscommon.  It is quite obvious he is based against it.  His trip there was of no use to the development of the hospital. I wish to say to the Minister that, since he became Minister for Health, he has not contributed one iota to the development of the health services in my constituency. In the Minister's speech today he allocated four lines to the Western Health Board.  That is the only mention he made to development in that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to place on record my ambition that the Minister will be prevented from transferring the acute unit to the county hospital in Roscommon, that we will be in a position to provide services in the county hospital in Roscommon and that the Department will appoint a second physician and a second surgeon to both areas in the county hospital where the demand exists and where we have provided excellent services for the people of that area and surrounding districts.  I appeal to the Minister at this stage to withdraw his deadline for the closure at the end of August of the psychiatric unit in Castlerea and not to transfer it or open an acute unit in the county hospital in <Col N="1620" /> Roscommon which is totally unsuitable. The Minister should set about the planning and development of an acute psychiatric unit in the grounds of the county hospital in Roscommon.  That is a reasonable compromise to the proposals the Minister is making.  They would have the full support of the Western Health Board and all medical and professional staff in both the county hospital in Roscommon and the psychiatric unit in Castlerea.</P>
    <P>In relation to other areas of development, we have found since the change of Government four years ago that many people have been deprived of medical services through the withdrawal of medical cards.  There has been a very high percentage of withdrawals.  Enormous pressure has been put on welfare officers to come down against applicants.  Even though we have had the hardest and most difficult of times in the farming community over the past 12 months, there have been enormous withdrawals of medical cards in counties Roscommon, Galway and Mayo.  The Minister has deprived very needy cases of medical services. There has been a total collapse in relation to both ophthalmic and dental services in the Western Health Board area.  There is an enormous waiting list for children seeking dental treatment.  It is now an impossible situation.  Nothing is being done by the Department to provide the services and specialists in the Western Health Board area.  There is no solution to the problem.  The families of young people being treated for dental problems are not in a position to provide the necessary finance to obtain private dental services. The Minister can investigate this development in the Western Health Board area.</P>
    <P>Finally, the Health (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill seems to have died and will not re-emerge in this House.  We oppose this Bill because the Minister is taking power to close hospitals.  We will seek full support on all sides of the House to vote it down.  If it causes a general election, so be it.  It is one area which will not arise again.  Maybe the price of the Minister staying in the Cabinet as Minister for Health was that the Health <Col N="1621" /> (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill would not resurface. On the list of legislation to come before the House before Friday it is not even mentioned for consideration.  Furthermore, in relation to any closures or changes of status the Minister has to hold local inquiries before he can close the acute unit in Castlerea or close St. Anne's maternity unit in the county hospital in Roscommon.  Those public inquiries must be held according to the Health Acts.  I appeal to the Minister to set that in train so that at least we will have an opportunity to put our case to the Department's officials.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond) Barry Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank deputies on both sides of the House for their contributions to this attenuated debate.  I would like to reply to a number of points raised.  There are some additional points which need to be made.  Deputy O'Hanlon referred to the situation in Merlin Park.  I stress that Comhairle na nOispidéal, an independent professional body, made recommendations about the future use of Merlin Park in a recent report which they sent to the Western Health Board.  The Western Health Board are studying the report.  I stress that that report was not commissioned by me.  It is aseparate matter.  It was not a direct or indirect initiative on the part of the Department of Health.  At all times, I welcome the various reports of the comhairle.  I respect their objectivity in dealing with those matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Likewise, the comhairle have been reviewing the delivery of surgery services in the Western Health Board area.  Unanimously they made observations and recommendations in a report relating to the surgery situation in Roscommon general hospital.  Again, that arose in the normal course of events.  The report is of considerable interest and concern to the Department and to the members of the medical profession in the Western Health Board area and in the delivery of surgical services for the Western Health Board area.  Here, questionably I separate Deputy O'Hanlon professionally and as <Col N="1622" /> Opposition spokesperson, but it would be too much to expect that other politicians would desist from their massive intrusions of expertise into those areas.  What matters in the long run is not where surgery is situated, not even where maternity is situated, but if you had to undergo surgery or if your wife had to deliver a child, where would you want to have the surgery done.  That is a fundamental personal question.  It is a matter of personal decision.  Secondly, in what facility would your wife wish, as is her right, to deliver her baby?</P>
    <P>They are basic questions.  I am amazed at the capacity of middle aged, middle income and well married politicians to pronounce with such incredible certitude that maternity must be here, surgery must be there, and to milk it incessantly week in and week out as a local political issue with such endemic parochialism that one wonders how the health services have been able to develop at all.  It is part of what we are.  It is a very distasteful part of what we are.  It shows how introverted our perceptions are as to what constitutes health care.  What matters is that a mother should have antenatal services, delivery services and post natal services in the safest and best situation for herself and her child.  That is what matters, not whether the child is delivered in Roscommon, Castlebar, Sligo, Portiuncula, Galway or elsewhere.</P>
    <P>We are concerned with the reality of what happens to that woman and her personal health and with the paediatric back-up service for the child in a fully staffed consultant obstetric and paediatric unit.  When Deputies come to me with incessant demands about certain hospitals.  I ask them whether they would ask their wives to undergo surgery in the hospitals concerned, or to deliver her baby there.  In many instances there is dead silence because what is sauce for the constituency goose is not sauce for the personal gander.  I make these comments because it is essential that we keep before us at all times the purpose of the delivery service.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to the numbers employed and gave some data which I <Col N="1623" /> now wish briefly to supplement.  I indicated that in the seventies there was major growth in employment in the health services.  In 1981 there were 66,500 persons employed in the health services, while today the figure is 62,500.  These figures must be put in context.  In 1974 42,000 people were employed in the health services.  There was rational growth between 1974 and 1977 and several thousand were added.  Then all hell broke loose at the end of 1977 when letters went out from Fianna Fáil Ministers demanding that the health boards employ more people.  They were berated because they did not take people on. When it was claimed there was no room in the hospitals to employ any more people, they were still told to take them on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I have never hesitated to agree to the appointment of additional staff where they were needed within the system but the indiscriminate situation which devoloped in the 1979 to 1981 period will go into the history books on medical development in western European countries.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Hanlon suggested that we should have particular regard to the necessity for accurate descriptions of generic drugs.  I share his view in this regard.  I have noted his point with particular care and he may be assured that we will take note of that constructive comment in relation to the GMS and escalating costs.  Deputy O'Hanlon said I made no reference to alcohol abuse in the context of the activities of the Health Education Bureau.  The bureau's programmes give wide coverage to the question of substance abuse generally.  In the case of alcohol, the board have produced a major second level schools programme on alcohol.  They have produced fact sheets on alcohol and have co-operated with the Irish National Council on Alcoholism. Nevertheless I share Deputy O'Hanlon's view that a great deal more work must be done in this area.</P>
      <P>Regarding the references by Deputy O'Hanlon to the situation in Italy and England in regard to mental health services, I think he would agree that our services are in many respects very superior to what can be seen in those countries.  I recommend that Deputy Leyden have a look at Saint Davnet's Hospital in Monaghan and see how a model of progress can be made in the organisation and development of community psychiatric services.  That is not in any way to detract from the very considerable competence of the psychiatric consultant staff in his own area, but there is the inevitable inertia from which we are trying to get away.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding the voluntary agencies, I agree largely with the views expressed by Deputy O'Hanlon. Despite financial difficulties I have arranged for an increase in the rates of subvention payable by health boards in respect of persons in private long-stay homes. The increase is about 4 per cent, payable from today.</P>
      <P>I thank Deputy Gay Mitchell for his constructive comments in relation to the cancer services.  I have noted what he has said about cancer and I will consider his comments carefully.  There is an increasing concentration in the acute medical area on oncology and cancer treatment services.  I appreciate the concern of Deputies.  I also noted what Deputy Mitchell said about the out patients' department at Our Lady's Hospital in Crumlin.  As soon as resources permit I will approve of that scheme going to design stage.</P>
      <P>Regarding Deputy Leyden's comments on Roscommon Hospital, I have dealt with the surgery end of it and that will be under review by the Western Health Board.</P>
      <P>I will make a final comment on psychiatric services.  I believe that any acute psychiatric unit should be integrated into the hospital, not operating on a separate, free standing basis in relation to a hospital. When developments of this nature are proposed everybody goes for the ultimate in terms of development rather than what can be achieved in the immediate future.  Whatever is developed in Roscommon General Hospital, will be integrated into the general framework of the hospital.  I am appalled at the attitude I have seen from some Deputies opposite, but not from Deputy O'Hanlon, that acute psychiatric services should be separate and should not in any way contaminate the general hospital services.</P>

      <P>Before dealing with the questions to the Minister for Justice I should like, for the guidance of Deputies, to point out that members of the Judiciary are independent by virtue of the Constitution and they may neither be criticised or have their rulings referred to in the House unless on a substantive motion.  Therefore, I should like to remark that Members may neither make a charge against or discuss the conduct or actions of judges or justices.  The conduct of judges can be dealt with in the House only on a substantive motion.  The Minister for Justice is not responsible for the manner in which courts conduct their business. Decisions or judgments of a duly constituted court cannot be subjected to review or discussion in the House as the House is not a judicial body or a court of appeal. I want to make it clear, as quietly and firmly as I can, that I will be enforcing that ruling during these questions.</P>

      <P>I have addressed myself specifically to the question and said that the law provides in cases like this for a public sworn inquiry, otherwise known as a coroner's inquest.  I do not think it would be right for me, or the House, to anticipate in any way either the conduct of the inquest or verdict or conclusion that might be reached by that inquest.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister find it unusual that the inquest will be taking place 12 months after the tragic death of Fr. Niall Molloy and after the court case has been held and a verdict handed down?  Will the Minister tell the House who has ordered the inquest?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not find it at all unusual that the inquest is taking place following the court case to which the Deputy has referred, because an inquest cannot be held when criminal proceedings are pending.  There is no significance whatever to be attached to the timing in this case.  The holding of the inquest is required by Statute and the coroner in the case has a statutory duty <Col N="1630" /> to make the arrangements for the inquest which, as I have reported to the House, he has done in this case.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy knows, and as the Chair has pointed out to the House, I have no function in relation to the Director of Public Prosecutions.  Therefore, the timing and the laying of charges or the pursuit of a case is entirely a matter for the DPP and not for me.  Subject to correction, I would have to say I do not think it would be proper for an inquest to be held while criminal proceedings were pending.  I am glad to have this opportunity of making the point to the House, which I made in my original reply, that the law provides for a public sworn inquiry into cases of this kind, that is, a coroner's inquest.  Any information and all information that may be relevant to the case can be brought before that inquiry and any questions and all questions that may appear to be relevant to the case can properly be brought before that inquiry and can be examined.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Courthouses (Provision and Maintenance) Act, 1935, obliges local authorities to provide and maintain in their functional areas such courthouse accommodation as the Minister for Justice shall direct.</P>
      <P>To remove that responsibility from local authorities would require legislation. As has been indicated to the House on a number of occasions in the past I could not, in the context of parliamentary questions, say whether or not I have proposals for legislative changes in particular areas.  Such proposals are announced, in the ordinary way, only after Government approval.</P>
      <P>I can, however, draw attention to the fact that there is no provision in the national plan, <i>Building on Reality,</i> for the assumption by the State of financial responsibility for the provision and maintenance of courthouses.</P>

Will the Minister bring this matter to the attention of the Government so that some arrangements can be made for the future either by providing money directly to local authorities or by making some central arrangements as the Deputy has suggested?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to remind Deputy Woods that the question tabled by Deputy McEllistrim is not dealing with a specific case &mdash; it is a general question. As I have said, the provision and maintenance of courthouses is by law a function of local authorities.  Therefore, it is a matter for them to provide whatever resources may be necessary for courthouse accommodation.  I am aware that throughout the country there are courthouses in a most unsatisfactory state but the attention of the local authorities, has to be drawn to that in the first place.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision under which the Office of Public Works carry out works on courthouses is brought into effect only when &mdash; and I am speaking freely at the moment &mdash; patience has been lost with the local authority in question. It is only when it is considered that the accommodation has reached such a point of disrepair that work has to be undertaken, that the matter is taken out of the hands of the local authority and carried out by the Office of Public Works. There is provision for the cost of that work to be reimbursed from the local authority and even in that case the cost of the work becomes a charge on the local authority.</P>

      <P>These questions have been put down in the immediate aftermath of a particular court case and are, in effect, an invitation to me to comment by implication on the decision in that case.

It is in the long-term public interest that I should adhere strictly to that tradition, the reasons for which were explained at some length in a statement which was made in this House by my predecessor on 10 March 1983, Official Report, columns 2437-2440.</P>

      <P>The Minister is avoiding the question.  Would he indicate whether he considers there is a need for legislation to be amended to avoid the kind of public unease about court decisions which has developed not just following the recent case but in other cases? <Col N="1638" /> Are the Government even considering this in order to allay public unease?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I still take the view that the Deputy is inviting me by implication to comment on a particular decision which I do not intend to do.  May I remind the House that on 10 March 1983 there was a discussion here of a particular matter related to sentencing policy. While Deputies have referred to public unease and some comments have been made about that, I am bound to take the view that a certain amount of unease is being cultivated by references which do not take account of the fact that in the case in question not all the legal procedures have been gone through.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is wrong in assuming that this question relates to a particular case.  In view of some very inconsistent and weird decisions made in recent months, will the Minister consider setting up a body to explain to the public the rationable behind decisions made in court?  This body, perhaps of lawyers, might monitor the performance of judges in the execution of their duties.  This is very relevant.  Public unease is not confined to one case.  There was considerable public disquiet expressed when a man in my constituency got a month in jail for urinating in the street, but a man can be killed and nobody is brought to justice.  Surely there is a reason for disquiet when this happens.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept the conclusion Deputy Allen draws from that.  In most cases where the law provides for penalties, it provides typically for a maximum penalty.  It provides on occasion for both a minimum and a maximum penalty, and in the majority of cases where penalties are provided for, a margin of discretion is left to the judiciary on the basis of statutes passed by the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister accept that there has been a problem for many members of the public about seeing justice being done in a number of cases in the past few years, but that is not to say that justice has not been done?  The rationale behind the decisions and the procedures which have been used are not evident in many cases and, in the eyes of the public, that is doing some disservice to the principles we all hold dear.  Does the Minister see himself as having a function of perhaps making some review or reassessment of the procedures that exist in that respect?  In 1964 the present Leader of the Opposition, Deputy Haughey, Minister of Justice at the time, <Col N="1641" /> accepted that the Superior Courts Rules Committee would take on from then some powers previously exercised by the Minister, and the procedures of the courts are of legitimate interest to the Minister.  We are talking about legitimate questions not necessarily being answered clearly in the public's mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I would accept as an individual and as a Member of this House a certain duty on the lines of what Deputy Keating has outlined.  That would be a duty in some cases to inform myself as to what happened in the court and as to what the law provides in cases like that, and in the event that I found that the matter was being presented in a way that did not take account of what was presented to the court or what the law provided, I would find it my duty not to go along with misleading impressions that were being given but to do my best to illuminate rather than to obscure the issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept what the Minister says in relation to his assessments of evidence and procedures, but in terms of communicating the decision and the rationale behind the decision in a court case or a number of court cases, does he feel that the public interest is best served by the maximum degree of access to the knowledge and information relevant to the case?  That need not necessarily reflect one way or the other on the case. That is not being done at present.  In one or two recent cases it is obvious that there is a great degree of confusion in the public mind about it, to put it charitably.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>There may well be, but save in a fairly limited number of cases and areas the decisions of our courts are matters of public record.  They are accessible to the public and in particular to all of the media.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am bound to say that if Deputies feel there is insufficient clarity <Col N="1642" /> in the public presentation of some of these things then I would have to conclude that they take the view &mdash; as I do from time to time &mdash; that the presentation in the media is insufficient and that probably the effort on the part of those who are in a position better to inform themselves to do so and get it across to the public is inadequate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not blaming the media.  The Minister has a responsibility here, too.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that if in any case the DPP is dissatisfied with the content of the case it is open to the DPP to appeal the matter to the Supreme Court?  Would the Minister be very clear and explicit about that?  There is a certain amount of confusion in the House and there is a danger that clarity will not come from these questions here. Secondly, is the Minister aware that the Attorney General has a responsibility to ensure that justice is fair and equitable and that on behalf of the Government the Attorney General oversees in a general way the conduct of justice and can consequently confer with the DPP to ensure that this is so and to advise the Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Both of the questions the Deputy has raised are matters of fact.  He has referred, although not in detail, to procedures which exist either in practice or in law.  In any case which is instigated by the DPP, if the DPP feels dissatisfied with the way the case has been dealt with, certain avenues are open to him by which he can proceed further with the case.  It is in the first instance a matter for the DPP to decide in any given case whether to pursue any one of those avenues.</P>
      <P>On the second point raised by the Deputy, again he has referred to a matter of fact which, however, he will be aware is a procedure which is very rarely used.</P>

      <P>I think I can answer directly by saying to the Deputy that one of the matters I will be considering in the <Col N="1644" /> context of bringing forward this legislation is the report of the Law Reform Commission on nullity of marriage and the references to that subject, that is civil nullity, in the report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown. In various places throughout the country over the last eight or nine weeks, including this Chamber, I have given the opinion that there are certain areas where it would be impossible to align the civil law of nullity with the provisions of Canon Law for a number of different reasons that I do not think I should go into.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos, 9, 11, 18, 19, 244 and 245 together.</P>
      <P>First of all I would like to refer to the comprehensive answer given by my immediate predecessor as Minister for Justice to a number of questions on moneylending on 29 January last.  I should like Deputies to have regard to the general remarks about the background&mdash; legal and social &mdash; to the problem of moneylending contained in that answer. In the course of it, it was indicated that, while in the majority of cases gardaí investigations had not, up to then, uncovered evidence to substantiate allegations made in the media late last year, these investigations were still in progress.</P>
      <P>I have recently been informed by the Garda authorities that the results of their investigations into the activities of moneylenders are not yet known.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, it is too early to decide yet whether any changes in the law should be contemplated on the basis of the outcome of those investigations or what other steps, including those canvassed in Question No. 11 might be taken.</P>
      <P>On the same occasion my predecessor urged, as he had done on previous occasions, that Deputies should bring any cases that they had in mind to the notice of the local gardaí.  I can only repeat that. He also said that he would welcome the views of interested groups and asked for written submissions.</P>
      <P>There is no record in my Department of any submissions made by interested groups arising from that invitation. Accordingly, I repeat the suggestion. Any views received will be considered along with the outcome of the investigations by the gardaí.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As indicated previously, the gardaí pursue actively all alleged breaches of the law in relation to moneylenders.  The question of what resources to devote to this task in particular is a matter for the Garda authorities and I am informed by the Garda authorities that no useful purpose would be served by assigning a senior officer in the way suggested in Question No. 19.

      <P>Does the Minister agree that his predecessor signposted the need to reform the Moneylenders Act when he said it was not a criminal offence to overcharge or lend without a contract? Does he also agree that the fact that there have been only two successful prosecutions by the Garda under the Act in the past six years indicates that the ongoing Garda inquiries are unlikely to produce the results for which he feels he should wait?</P>

      <P>I cannot anticipate the results of the Garda inquiries.  I repeat that the difficulty the Garda experience in pursuing these inquiries is the reluctance by people involved to give information to the Garda.  Deputy Bruton rightly pointed out that they are not criminal offences here and I would not be prepared to say on the basis of a discussion that has taken place so far that it would be appropriate to amend the legislation to make them criminal offences.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if, in view of the reduction in the Government's provision for Garda overtime from an average of nearly £2 million per month for the first four months of 1986 to approximately £½ million for each of the remaining months, he will state whether reported reductions in the availability of both personnel and material resources, especially at weekends and holiday periods and particularly, that the emergencies over Whit weekend, are a direct result of a lack of resources for Garda overtime; if he will take immediate action to give the Garda the resources they need to combat crime; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated in reply to Question No. 27 on 22 May 1986, there has been no reduction in the provision of <Col N="1649" /> £21 million for Garda overtime in 1986 and there is no specific provision for any one month.  However, because expenditure on Garda overtime in the first four months of the year was running at a very high level, the Garda authorities undertook a detailed review of such expenditure so as to ensure that the best possible return is being got from it.  As might be expected, this review, together with a general re-appraisal of Garda deployment, has led to some changes in the use of resources but the situation is being closely monitored by the Garda authorities in order to ensure that resources are being deployed in such a way as to maintain effective policing in all areas at all times.</P>
      <P>On the question of the availability of Garda resources at weekends and over the June bank holiday weekend in particular, any inference or suggestion that emergencies over that weekend were due in some way to lack of resources for Garda overtime is totally without foundation. The Garda authorities have informed me that adequate Garda personnel and other resources have been available at all times to deal with crime generally and also with the emergencies that occur from time to time.</P>
      <P>I dealt with the general question of the provision of resources for the Garda Síochána in detail in the course of my contribution to the debate on the subject in this House on 13 May 1986 and I want to state here once again the Government's total commitment to providing the Garda Síochána with all the resources they require to carry out, efficiently and effectively, the vital duties we entrust to them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister say how much has been spent on Garda overtime for the first six months of the year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The cumulative expenditure on Garda overtime up to 29 June 1986 was £9.1 million.  However, I caution the House and the Deputy in particular against focusing specifically on that question because, of course, expenditure <Col N="1650" /> on overtime is only one small part of the total expenditure on the provision of the services of the Garda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that there is considerable if not widespread unease in Dublin, Cork and Limerick where there are high crime levels, about the availability of the Garda on a flexible basis which normally means overtime for the remainder of the year because of the fact that the sum of £9.1 million has already been spent?  How does the Minister intend to provide for flexibility in overtime for the remaining six months of the year with only £2.9 million available for overtime payments?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggested to the Deputy that he should not over-emphasise the importance of overtime in this context.  I know he has a very close acquaintanceship with the operations of the Garda and he should know that it is not necessary to use overtime in all cases to provide either for flexibility or for round the clock cover by the Garda.  I am sure the Deputy is familiar with the various roster and relief arrangements operated by the Garda Síochána and, therefore, it would be wrong to suggest &mdash; as has been suggested &mdash; that a flexible response always requires expenditure on overtime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that Garda stations are unable to provide the manpower on the beat especially in areas where there are serious problems of crime and vandalism?  When Garda superintendents are asked why they cannot provide cover they say openly and publicly that they are not allowed to spend money on overtime.  Could the Minister clear up this matter because it is very serious and important?  The Minister indicated that there will not be overtime unless extra money is provided.  Is it the Minister's intention to provide extra resources in this area for the balance of the year?  I appreciate that other things can be done, such as re-rostering.  But the picture looks very bad as it is spelled <Col N="1651" /> out here now, especially for those crimeridden areas that are calling out for extra gardaí at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that the situation is as the Deputy has attempted to suggest in the first part of his question. The Deputy has today and on previous occasions put down questions to me about the level of Garda manning in various stations, including two districts that he referred to earlier today.  An examination of those figures would show that, as part of the increase in the Garda strength which we have maintained ever since coming into office at the end of 1982, there has been a substantial strengthening of the total Garda force over that period and that is shown both in the level of policing and in the crime statistics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister realise that he is saying that there is £5 million per month left for the remainder of the year and that there has been expenditure of close to £2 million per month for the first four months or so?  Does the Minister accept that there is great dissatisfaction with the lack of availability of manpower in areas with high levels of crime and vandalism?  Will the Minister go back to the drawing board and make provision to ensure that the resources are provided to deal with this situation?  He does not give us the kind of reassurance here that people are looking for.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) Act, 1978, effectively prevented the creation of new ground rents on dwelling houses and this was followed by a second Act in the same year (the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (No. 2) Act) which had the declared purpose of providing a low cost purchase scheme which would lead to the termination of existing ground rents.  The No. 2 Act, which had a life of five years to 31 July 1983, was extended, subject to increased fees, for a further year in 1983. In 1984 the then Minister for Justice promoted legislation which was enacted by the Oireachtas and which extended the life of the special purchase scheme for a further three years up to 31 July 1987, again with increased fees.  As was stated in reply to a question in this House on 13 December 1984, the enactment of that recent legislation represents the policy of the Government in this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>Have the Government <Col N="1654" /> seriously considered the constitutional aspects of ground rents?  I understand the Government's position has been that it would be unconstitutional to terminate or abolish ground rents. Have the Government examined this question?  Since they do not allow future ground rents they obviously find something wrong with the whole ground rents system.  Can they come up with a suitable amendment to the Constitution to make the abolition of ground rents constitutional?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>That matter has been considered by the Government and has been discussed in the House on a number of occasions.  My predecessor made it clear &mdash; and I share his view &mdash; that existing ground rents can be terminated in one of two ways, and there are only two ways. One is by purchase and the other is by confiscation of the ground landlord's property.  My colleague again made it clear, and I agree entirely with his view, that confiscation would be wrong in principle and I refer the Deputies to the Second Stage debate on the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (Amendments) Bill, 1983, on that point.</P>

People just see ground rents as a fuedal rent with no justice in them and are refusing to pay and coming before the courts.  Will the Minister tell us if he is seriously considering the matter?  It is not a question of confiscation but simply stating that as and from, say, 1988 ground rents will cease to be.  Can the Minister say how that would be unconstitutional?  If it is, why could he not put an amendment to the Constitution before the people that would allow the termination of ground rents?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">

As I have said, a claim for compensation has been lodged on behalf of the family with the Criminal Injuries Tribunal. That tribunal are an independent body who are not obliged to take any direction, or even advice, from me or anybody else.  There is a statute on the basis of which the tribunal work and they must examine each case put before them on the basis of that statute.</P>
      <P>In the case of the advice given by the jury in the matter to which the Deputy has referred, I note the rider that was added to the verdict.

      <P>The Garda authorities have informed me that they are satisfied that these measures are proving effective in that there is a marked decrease in the number of vehicles taken by these so-called &ldquo;joy riders&rdquo;.  The number of unauthorised takings of motor vehicles in the Dublin metropolitan area has decreased by almost 18 per cent in the first four months of this year, compared with the corresponding period last year.

      <P>Could the Minister say why they are not being used?  Is he aware that according to a recent report in the Garda Review of May 1986 the Royal Canadian Mounted Police have been doing studies over the past few years which led to the use of the hallow spiked belt, which is considered to be the safest and most efficient tool for stopping a fleeing motor vehicle?  The authorities purchased 14 such belts in 1982 and in 1983 they equipped all their units with them.  They also undertook a training programme.  It is claimed that these provide a very effective means of dealing with this problem. Is the Minister aware of this study and can he say why these spikes, which were being investigated here, have not been used here?  Has he any intention of using them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I remember particularly well the last occasion on which the matter was discussed in the House.  I refer the Deputy to the Official Report of 22 April of this year.  I remember it particularly because it was my birthday and my wedding anniversary and I was in the House talking about spiked belts.  During the course of the debate, at columns 1255 and 1256, I indicated that very restrictive guidelines had been issued on the use of these spiked chains, I pointed out as follows:</P>
      <P>They are restrictive because, as I said, the use of these chains can constitute a danger to other road users.  The effect of these chains is to take away effectively the control of a vehicle which may be travelling at a very high speed.  Therefore the circumstances in which they can be used without creating unwarranted danger to other road users are very restricted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the second part of the Deputut <Col N="1659" /> ty's question, I am aware of the studies to which he has referred and hope to have the opportunity in the near future to make some further inquiries with the Canadian police authorities about that and some other matters.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware of the real danger, particularly to the lives of young children, from cars careering around communities?  While I appreciate that there is a reduction in the number of such cases, there is still a serious problem. It constitutes a real danger, particularly to the lives of elderly people and children. I have seen this in practice on several occasions recently and have had representations from school teachers whose young pupils happened to be coming out of school at the time when one of these cars was passing.  In those circumstances would the Minister not weigh the lives of those young children against the difficulties which may be involved in applying spiked belts, which seems to be working very well in Canada?  Trials have been undertaken there and there is a claim that they are resulting in fewer damaged police cars&mdash;&mdash;</P>

That is <Col N="1660" /> something which I would have to weigh very carefully.</P>
      <P>I would also make the point, which is relevant in the context of this debate, that the problem is a very different one in a built up urban area &mdash; these are the areas which the Deputy has in mind &mdash; from the problem in a less densely populated area.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister have a look at the study to see what is happening in Canada?  The police members there seem to be content to maintain contact with the offending vehicle, well knowing that the pursuit will end at a given point. They would not have to pursue in the same high speed way.  Through radio contact they could choose a particular place. There could be a great deal of practical value in that.  What spurs me to mention this is the danger I have seen in the streets, particularly to small children. That would have to be weighed against finding the appropriate spot for dealing with the car which is giving trouble.</P>

      <P>A total of 613 robberies and 274 armed robberies and armed aggravated burglaries have been recorded by the Garda as taking place in the DMA in the first five months of this year; for the same period last year, the figures were 747 and 240 respectively. for the country as a whole, a total of 685 robberies and 320 armed robberies and armed aggravated burglaries were recorded in the first five months of this year; for the same period last year the corresponding figures were 856 and 286 respectively.  These figures indicate that, both in the DMA and in the rest of the country, while the number of armed raids, regrettably has increased since last <Col N="1662" /> year, the total number of all robberies including armed robberies, is down in the first five months of this year when compared with the same period last year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware it was stated in the national plan <i>Building on Reality 1985-87</i> that the conditions of the criminal injuries compensation scheme would be reviewed with a view to reducing the impact of the scheme on the Exchequer.  That review was undertaken and, following it, the Government sanctioned changes in the conditions of the scheme.  The revised scheme was laid before the House on 18 March 1986.  I do not intend to undertake any further review of the conditions of the scheme at present or in the near future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the compensation for pain and suffering <Col N="1663" /> has been removed from this scheme?  As Minister for Justice with responsibility for victims of crime, is he not anxious to ensure that this compensation would be available for the victims?  Is the Minister also aware the victims' support groups depend very much on this compensation as the main remedy which they can offer to victims of crime, particularly where there is personal injury involved?  Would the Minister not consider reviewing the scheme with a view to providing adequate compensation to the victims of crime?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy may take it that I am fully aware of the terms of the revised scheme that I laid before the House on 18 March last.  I indicated briefly here, and at greater length on earlier occasions, the reasons why that review was carried out.  I mentioned in my original response that one of the main concerns was the impact on the Exchequer. As I said, a review was carried out recently.  A revised scheme was laid before the House and it is now in operation. I have no plans to review the scheme again so soon after the revised scheme came into operation.  I differ with the groups that see this kind of compensation as the main support that they can offer to victims of crime.  It is not.  This type of compensation is offered to victims independently of victim support groups which have a completely different role to play in supporting the victims of crime in other ways.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister might check with them again and he will find that it is one of the main introductions that they make for victims of crime to show them where the State cares about them.  It is through this scheme that the State offers this care.  The Minister has cut back the care which it offers.  Is the Minister aware that in the North of Ireland people are still compensated for pain and suffering? I know that the Minister is always very conscious of maintaining equity between here and the North of Ireland.  If a citizen goes to the aid of a member of the RUC <Col N="1664" /> in the North and is injured he will receive compensation under the scheme there.  If he goes to the aid of a member of the Garda Síochána he will not now, since I April, receive compensation for pain and suffering, under the Minister's revised scheme?  Does the Minister not think that this is a somewhat ridiculous situation? Would he review it and change that system?</P>

    <Title>National Lottery Bill, 1986: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is a form of tax collection being devised by the Minister for Finance for the very hard-pressed consumers and the public.  There are many flaws in the proposals being put forward at this stage.  The intentions announced some time ago by different Ministers in relation to this Bill indicate that there has been a major change of emphasis since the proposals were initially put forward.  I refer particularly to section 3 of the Bill which, the explanatory memorandum states, enables the Minister to grant a licence to a person authorising the holding of the national lottery on the Minister's behalf.  I understand that An Bord Post have been allocated the franchise for this national lottery.  I believe that An Post are ideally suited to be the holders of the franchise to carry out the work on behalf of the Department of Finance.  An Post have in the region of 2,000 offices spread in every village throughout the country.  They are now geared up to launch the lottery in the very near future.  The Minister has decided for some reason or other to exclude specific mention of An Post in relation to this legislation.  Section 3 states:</P>
      <P>(1) (a) The Minister may grant a licence to a person authorising the holding on behalf of the Minister of the National Lottery.</P>
      <P>(b) Not more than one licence under this subsection shall be in force at any time.</P>
      <P>Apparently the Minister has given a commitment to An Post that they will be granted the franchise, but there is no reference to An Post in the Bill.  We would like to know what the position is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1781" /> The Bill itself is a kind of a lottery because there have been conflicting reports that representations have been made by different organisations.  We have been told that a very prominent national handler, Frank Flannery, has been very active on behalf of certain organisations, and we have been told that all these claims for the franchise have been discussed by the Cabinet after which a decision was made to grant the franchise to An Post.  Perhaps there has been a decision to reverse that.  I presume the Government will have enough votes to get the Bill through despite certain opposition by this side of the House.</P>
    <P>Our main criticism is that we have been kept in ignorance of how the proceeds will be allocated.  Apparently the fund will be taken in by the Department of Finance and it can be devoted to a multiplicity of causes.  There is no guarantee that a percentage will be awarded to sporting and cultural organisations. Therefore, we are anxious that the Minister should clear up this matter.  The fund should be kept completely separate from the Department of Finance and stated budgets should be devoted to supporting cultural and sporting activities.  Much money is being spent at the moment on other lotteries but this will be far more successful.  I can see many demands in my constituency, and in my own parish of Fuerty there are organisations who will be making demands and who would benefit greatly.  However, apparently the Department of Finance are prepared to absorb the proceeds instead of appointing an autonomous group to administer the funds.</P>
    <P>It is rather sinister that the Department have excluded An Post from the Bill and I hope the Minister will rectify this omission on Committee Stage.  Section 15 states:</P>
    <P>(1) The determination by the Company of the remuneration (including superannuation and any allowances for expenses) and other terms and conditions of service of the staff of the Company shall be subject to the approval of the Minister given with the consent <Col N="1782" /> of the Minister for the Public Service.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) refers to remuneration or allowances for expenses to be paid to the staff of the company.  The unions in An Post have made it clear they are not satisfied with this provision and consequently they are seeking for deletion of the section, in anticipation, of course, that An Post will be given the franchise and that there has not been a change of mind.</P>
    <P>At the moment, other organisations operating lotteries are hard pressed and, therefore, it seems to be inappropriate to bring in this form of taxation, albeit the lottery will be voluntary.  It will be agreed that people addicted to gambling will find this form of lottery compulsory because they will be attracted by the better prizes and they will be inclined to invest more than they can afford.  People in the lower income groups are generally more attracted to lotteries and this may create problems for them and their families.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to let us know what will be the status of lotteries run by such organisations as Gael Linn, the Mater Hospital Pools, the Rehabilitation Centre and other such organisations.  Will they be restricted or will they be able to continue to hold their lotteries?  The Bill is not clear in this regard.  There is no reason why they should not be allowed to continue.  They will be under great pressure from this new competition. They have been providing much needed finances for charitable purposes.</P>
    <P>The Minister should make clear what the intentions are in regard to the percentage of the proceeds to be allowed for administration.  The Bill will allocate 40 per cent for prizes and we should be made aware of the percentage to be allowed for expenses and all administrative costs.  A limit should be prescribed for the overheads of the company and we should be told how much will be allocated to sporting and cultural organisations. There should be a clear indication whether it is the intention to establish a representative body to administer the proceeds so that it will become clear that it will not be organised on a party political basis or that grants will not be awarded <Col N="1783" /> in a purely political way.  It would politicise the national lottery and would be detrimental to its success if it were clearly seen by the public that the funds which accrued would be used by the Government for party political reasons in the constituencies.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that, with the opinion polls indicating such a low level of support for the Government parties, in particular for the Labour Party whose support is down to about 3 per cent at present, it would be very tempting for the Minister for Finance to use the proceeds from the national lottery to bolster politicians who may be in electoral difficulties.  I know many Labour and Fine Gael Deputies who would be very tempted to apply for major allocations to their constituencies to the detriment of Opposition Deputies. That is being realistic and down to earth. The Minister of State is well aware of the method by which he is allocating funds in West Cork and how a windfall to the State has been used for party political purposes.  In this case, there would be global allocations to constituencies.  If that is the case, we can be assured it will become a party political type lottery and will not attract widespread support from all interested parties.</P>
    <P>As we represent over 51 per cent of the electorate, if the proceeds were to be used for purely party political purposes it would be detrimental&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. L.T. Cosgrave Mr. L.T. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L.T. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Deputy making a claim for 51 per cent?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>We are satisfied that the polls indicate that we have 51 per cent of national support.  This has been proved by recent opinion polls.  We will not give much credence to all opinion polls as they have been proved to be incorrect in the last week or so.  Nevertheless, on a conservative basis and reckoning we would feel we represent over 51 per cent of the total electorate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to make this a totally non-political lottery.  The proceeds <Col N="1784" /> should be allocated on a fair and equitable basis having regard to the demands and needs throughout the country for sport and recreational purposes.  I commend the former Minister of State, Deputy Creed, who has indicated his opposition to some items in the Bill.  He announced on many occasions the benefits which would accrue from the national lottery and said he would be responsible for bringing the Bill forward. I regret that Deputy Creed will not be Minister of State with responsibility for sports.  I say this genuinely.  I found Deputy Creed a most responsible Minister of State and responsive to the demands and needs of the people in relation to school transport and sporting facilities. Deputy Creed feels the maximum of the profits, 75 per cent, should be allocated to sporting and recreational facilities.</P>
    <P>Part of the funds should be allocated to the national sports centre which I hope will be located near my constituency in Athlone which is the centre of Ireland and would be ideal for a national sports centre.  I would like it to be in my own constituency but, being realistic, it is better to opt for a constituency very close to one's own when one sees there is a very good opportunity of making that proposal a reality.  That is why Roscommon County Council have indicated their full support for the location of the national sports centre in Athlone.  It is an ideal location and I hope the Minister of State will indicate his support for the location of the national sports centre in Athlone.  That would be a worthwhile beneficiary from the national lottery.  It would be seen as a suitable investment for the proceeds from the lottery.</P>
    <P>Sporting and recreational facilities are the best possible areas of investment to prevent crime among young people and to give them the opportunity to spend leisure time in ideal locations.  We have made great progress over the past few years in the provision of sporting facilities. The work of AnCO should be recognised in the building of sporting facilities for local community groups.  A lot of work remains to be done.  There are areas <Col N="1785" /> in my constituency where we could usefully spend part of the proceeds from the national lottery.  For instance, in the town of Ballymoe in the constituency of Roscommon-Galway, they are proceeding to build a community centre and they would welcome a major investment from the proceeds of the national lottery.  It is a very small community which has a great tradition behind it, a tradition which has been recognised in the naming of the community centre after the famous Fr. Flanagan of Boys' Town.  It would be very appropriate if some of the proceeds of the national lottery were used to finance the building of a community centre which would be non-political and non-denominational in the town of Ballymoe.</P>
    <P>It would be an extremely good investment to provide funds for the erection of a covered swimming pool in Castlerea, County Roscommon.  It is a matter of an investment of £200,000 to cover an open air swimming pool in that town.  It would provide a worthwhile investment in an inland county which is surrounded on all sides by the River Shannon and River Suck.  We need to train our young people to become proficient in swimming.  An investment of £200,000 would be worth while and would provide a much needed facility all the year around.</P>
    <P>These are the kinds of investments which should come from the national lottery. The Department of Finance should not call on this money to finance other functions, for example, health matters which at this stage are being financed by the Central Exchequer.  In all other constituencies there are areas which need recreational facilities.  Some of the funds could be used to finance sporting and recreational facilities attached to major schools which would be open to the public.  Gymnasia also would be a worth-while investment.</P>
    <P>We have expressed our reservations on the Bill.  We are not excluding the setting up of a suitable national lottery which will be properly administered.  There are many flaws in this Bill which should be rectified by the Minister before it completes all stages in this House.  My main objection is that An Post who were initially <Col N="1786" /> named as the company to be allocated the franchise have not been nominated in the Bill.  That should be rectified to give a status to An Post and enable the company to proceed with the role of providing a national lottery.  They are very well equipped.  They are a very efficient company who are geared towards the provision of additional services. They have outlets which are very well placed throughout the country.</P>
    <P>As regards the fund, it should be stated quite clearly that it will be a separate fund which will be used for sporting, recreational and cultural matters.  The fund should be administered on a non-political basis by a non-political group including representatives of sporting and national organisations.  Any local community could apply in an open manner for support and the application would not be dealt with in a partisan manner.  This would be very acceptable to all sides of the House because sports should be above party politics.</P>
    <P>These are the major flaws I see in the Bill.  I would also refer to the labour negotiations with the unions and I would ask the Minister to make adjustments to section 15.  Trade union representatives who are very familiar with the workings of An Post believe that these provisions would make the operation of the lottery very difficult.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the people entrusted with responsibility for the lottery to have all tickets and other material printed in Ireland. There should be a totally Irish involvement in all aspects of the organisation and running of the lottery.  There is no justification for purchasing ideas for lotteries from other countries or engaging outside specialists.</P>
    <P>The funds are badly required but there is a feeling among the public generally that the lottery is not a welcome development. People are very hard-pressed by excessive taxation and feel this is an attempt by the Department of Finance to raise revenue in an indirect way.  The Minister should dispel the fears of the public and make the Bill and the lottery more attractive and suitable.  The Bill could be amended on Committee Stage <Col N="1787" /> to make it more acceptable to the public generally.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. L.T. Cosgrave Mr. L.T. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L.T. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  I support the concept of a national lottery which I hope will benefit sports organisations, the arts, cultural activities and recreational facilities.  I hope that the various questions which have been raised in the course of this debate will be answered by the Minister when concluding or on Committee Stage.  I welcome the decision in principle to go ahead with the national lottery but it is important that the running of it and the benefits that will accrue should be fully thought out and properly promoted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that 40 or 50 jobs would be created but it would be less than honest if we did not draw attention to the fact that some 140 or 150 people have been laid off or are working only on a temporary basis for the longstanding Hospitals Trust.  It has been indicated that An Post are to run this lottery but I am sure various submissions were made by other organisations who felt they could best run it.  I do not know what these various submissions contained or what tipped the scales in favour of An Post.  However, in view of the successful operations of the Hospitals Trust over the past 55 years, I would have thought that some individuals or some aspects of their expertise would have been availed of.  Time will tell whether An Post or a subsidiary will run this venture successfully. When we are talking about an extra 40 or 50 jobs being created, let us not forget that 150 or even 200 people will find themselves left on the scrap heap. Certain representations were made regarding the running of some other type of draw and I hope that a definite response, be it positive or negative, will be given to the Hospitals Trust.  If they are totally out, they should be told.  We must look at the net situation in regard to jobs.  I do not know how the decision was reached as to who should run the draw but I hope that the people from the Hospitals Trust will not find themselves <Col N="1788" /> in the same position as the former employees of Irish Shipping.  If a communication has been received from the Hospitals Trust, a definite response should be given.</P>
    <P>I do not know exactly what was in An Post's submission.  As I did not see any submission I am not aware of what tipped the scales in favour of An Post, but it appears that they, or a subsidiary, will run the lottery.  I wish that body every success in the promotion of the lottery and I presume certain rules and guidelines will be laid down.  A person who pointed to the limited success of An Post in the collection of TV licence fees asked me if they would be successful in collecting what will be an optional contribution to the lottery.  Is it the intention of An Post to recruit specialists to promote the lottery or will officials of that organisation undergo special training?</P>
    <P>If the lottery is to be a success An Post will have to embark on a major promotion programme.  Obviously, the prize will be an attraction but people will be encouraged to buy tickets if they are aware of the organisations that will benefit from the fund.  A national lottery has proved successful in Australia, America, Sweden, New Zealand and Brazil and there is no reason why it should not succeed here.  The lottery in those countries has caught the public imagination with people hoping to hit the jackpot but another important factor was that people were aware that a big percentage of the money collected in the lottery benefited the community.</P>
    <P>We are all aware of our great sporting tradition and the constant demands on the Exchequer to provide money for sports facilities.  A lot of money is needed if we are to maintain our standard at international level.  Those who get expert tuition, such as those who go abroad on athletics scholarships, can compete with the best in the world.  I hope funds from the lottery will be used to provide recreational facilities in deprived areas. Money should be devoted to cultural activities and so on and the public will have to be assured that the money will not be used by Ministers for other projects.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1789" /> They will have to be made aware that Ministers will not nip away at the till for other activities.</P>
    <P>I would prefer if the distribution were done by a different body that would deal with applications for assistance.  That body should consist of representatives from different sports and the arts.  The distribution of the funds should be done by an independent group and I hope the lottery will not be used as a top-up by the Departments of Finance or Education. I hope the administration costs will be minimal.  It will be difficult to sell tickets in the lottery if people consider it a top-up for the tax man.  The Government should consider establishing an independent group to deal with applications for assistance.  Areas without a theatre or sporting facilities should be given special consideration.  We should not see a repeat of what happened earlier this year when a festival was refused financial assistance.</P>
    <P>All moneys collected in the lottery should be accounted for.  We should not be given a global figure without being told what areas benefited from the lottery.  I hope the money is no siphoned off and put into other projects.  It will be difficult to promote the lottery if it is not made clear that sport and the arts will benefit.</P>
    <P>I expect the initial response to the lottery to be good but it will be necessary to promote it continuously.  The tickets should be sold in outlets other than post offices.  In my view post offices are busy dealing with pension books, postal orders and stamps.  A person anxious to buy a ticket in the lottery will not wait too long if there is a big queue for pensions or stamps.  What other outlets are envisaged? Tickets for the lottery will have to be readily available and that will mean selling them in pubs and shops.  It will be necessary to carry out a publicity campaign following each draw.  I am sure most people who have prize bonds cannot identify their numbers when the results of the weekly draws are announced.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister tell the House how the national lottery will affect the existing draws organised by charitable organisations? <Col N="1790" /> We are all offered tickets daily for such draws.</P>
    <P>In his speech the Minister indicated that provisions had been included in the Bill to protect and enhance the position of existing charitable and voluntary lotteries. That appears to be fine but will it work out?  Already the national lottery has hit the workers in the Hospitals Trust and many are now out of work.  In his reply I should like the Minister to indicate what assurances he can give existing charities in view of the effect of the national lottery on them.  It is obvious that the greater the proportion of funds given to the national lottery the smaller will be the amount given to existing charities. Many of the flag days and draws are organised by bodies who do valuable voluntary work.  Those involved in such groups are dedicated people.  It is important that certain safeguards or assurances be given that the voluntary organisations will not suffer.  I should like the Minister to indicate what discussions have taken place with the other charities in relation to the effect the national lottery will have on them.  Will the lottery be able to work in tandem with them?  It is obvious that there will be a certain amount of competition and that there will be winners and losers.  The chances are that the State lottery will take over from some of the existing organisations.</P>
    <P>It is inevitable that there will be difficulties in running the national lottery, particularly in the initial stages.  As a country we are good at contributing towards charities but we are not used to a system of weekly draws.  Apparently An Post have been awarded the national lottery but they have not been named in the Bill.  Irrespective of who runs the national lottery, the Minister should tell us, for example, when the lottery tickets will be put on sale and where they will be available.  Reference has been made to the jobs that will be created but we do not know how many will get work.  Will it be a case of an extra 40 or 50 jobs or will the people recruited have special knowledge in relation to the running, promotion and selling of the lottery?  In order to catch the public imagination the <Col N="1791" /> national lottery will have to be sold on a few fronts.</P>
    <P>People will not buy tickets on a weekly basis unless they are reassured as to where the money is going and what is happening to it.  Apart from the money allocated for prizes and the amount necessary for administration purposes, the public will have to be assured that the remainder is used for the purpose intended, namely, towards sports and the arts.  If a special body is not set up to ensure that this happens the whole scheme will run into difficulties.  If such a special committee were set up they could advise on special projects that might be partially funded.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to a national sports centre.  Wherever it is sited, I hope it is in an area accessible to many people. While all of us would like to have it in our own constituency, personally I have no hang-up about the matter as long as it is a success.  At the moment there is a proposal in Dún Laoghaire for the development of a marina to allow for a greater range of sea-going activities.  The proposal involves the reclaiming of land. Perhaps the Dún Laoghaire Corporation or the other bodies involved in the development of the marina could put in a claim for some of the funds.  The availability of the DART has ensured that Dún Laoghaire is easily accessible to very many people.  I hope details will be given about where the money will be spent so that people will not think the proceeds of the lottery are being swallowed up by the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>It is obvious it will be necessary to provide funds to start the project and perhaps the Minister will indicate what amount will be provided.  While some matters have been clarified, much of the detail of the scheme has been left very vague.  It is important that the promotion and selling of the national lottery in the early days be successful.  If the project falls on its face initially, the chances are it will never succeed.  When it is launched later in the year there should be adequate publicity so that people will be aware of the facts, will know the various outlets <Col N="1792" /> and so on.  We must operate it successfully, as has been the case in other countries.  It is important that the scheme should catch the public imagination. Obviously the chance of winning a jackpot prize for a small amount of money will have its appeal and even if people are not successful they will be happy to continue purchasing tickets when they realise that much of the money will go towards the provision of recreational and sporting facilities and for the promotion of the arts, health care and so on.</P>
    <P>I do not know what was in the submission of An Post that tipped the scales in their favour.  I do not know who made the decision.  However, I have to question this body who will be selling these tickets because they have not exactly covered themselves in glory collecting RTE fees. If An Post get sidetracked selling these tickets, there might be a case to be made to transfer the collection of licence fees to RTE or to some other body.  Apparently the World Cup led to a boom in discovering people without licences because the detectors knew people would be watching the matches, especially the late night matches.  It will be interesting to see the number of cases and fines which will be imposed in a few months' time because people did not have a television licence.</P>
    <P>It has been mentioned that 40 or 50 jobs will be created.  I hope there will be many spin-off benefits to Irish businesses. This lottery has affected 140 to 150 people working in the Hospitals Trust and their families.  We must weigh the loss of 150 jobs against the creation of 40 or 50 jobs.  A decision should be made soon and this pussyfooting must stop.</P>
    <P>I welcome the concept of a lottery and hope it will be a success.  Definite benefits can accrue to the people, to sport and to the arts from a lottery, but there are inherent dangers because, if it is not a success or if the money is not seen to benefit certain areas, the lottery could be a flop.  Perhaps the Minister will reply to some of the points I have made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to put the emphasis of my contribution on the <Col N="1793" /> effects of the proposed national lottery on existing local, parochial, county and semi-national lotteries.  In this Bill, with 37 sections, there are a great number of unanswered questions.  It is fine for the Minister to state good intentions about the possibilities of this lottery, but we know from recent experience that intentions on another piece of legislation had to be changed within a few weeks and we had a new set of intentions.  If that activity achieved anything it was that it raised great doubts in the minds of the people. I am speaking about the recent proposed amendment to the Constitution.</P>
      <P>In this Bill we have intentions which are not specifically included.  I have read through this Bill time and again to see how the existing fund-raising activities around the country will be accommodated. Is it intended that the national lottery will supersede all the draws, raffles and so on throughout the country? For instance, Cumann Luthchleas Gael run a very satisfactory Ciste Gael competition or lottery, a lottery which is used by the 32 counties.  There may be other lotteries, like the Mater, the Belfast one and so on, but is it proposed in this legislation that the national lottery will wipe out the Ciste Gael lottery of Cumann Luthchleas Gael?  If that is the intention, the Government had better have a rethink. One element which is necessary for the success of any lottery &mdash; and this is something to which the Government do not appear to have given any consideration &mdash; is the loyalty of the people to a particular aim, ideal or fund.  I honestly believe this will be missing from the proposed lottery. In any parish where a raffle or lottery is mooted the loyalty and commitment of the people of that area come into play and the people get involved because the benefits of the lottery will be seen locally and will be for the betterment of the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure every Deputy in this House is subscribing to draws for five weeks, ten weeks or even for 52 weeks.  The parish of Inniscarra collected close on £60,000 from the people who gave their loyalty and commitment to that draw because it was for the parish.  The same happened <Col N="1794" /> in Grenagh and Whitechurch.  I am giving as examples the parish where I live and the neighbouring parishes.  I have already referred to the sporting organisation to which I belong and which I see threatened by this proposal.  Before this debate is over, if the Minister tries to convince me that I am not correct, I will give his reply all the attention it deserves.  In this national lottery that local loyalty and commitment will be missing as sure as day follows night.</P>
    <P>I have no intention of politicising this venture but, in their efforts to launch this national lottery, the Government got into a right political tangle about who would be given responsibility for it.  A number of statements have been made that An Post will be entrusted with the operation of this lottery, but is it not surprising that nowhere in the 37 sections of this Bill is An Post mentioned?  The post office savings bank is mentioned in section 8(2)(f)(ii) which says:</P>
    <P>An investment under this paragraph shall be in securities in which trustees are for the time being authorised by law to invest trust funds or in any of the stocks, funds or securities in which moneys of the Post Office Savings Banks are for the time being authorised to be invested.</P>
    <P>That is the only reference I could find in that Bill to An Post being given a licence. There is much mention of a company. These references are incomplete.  To whom is the franchise to be given to run this proposed lottery?  Who is to be responsible?</P>
    <P>Let me next pose the question: at whom is this lottery aimed?  It is the people who will be hoping to win the prizes who are mentioned.  It will be up to the company to indicate what the prize money will be, but the Bill indicates that it will be substantial.  Because of the economic situation and because of unemployment in particular many people have been devastated by the economic events of the past years and cannot afford to go on holidays within the country let alone go to resorts outside the country whether in Costa del Sol, costa del fortune or <Col N="1795" /> whatever you like to call it.  Many of those people out of sheer hope will see in this lottery possibly the only opportunity they will ever have to take a holiday.  The danger is that out of their meagre resources they will plunge &mdash; that is a better word to use than &ldquo;invest&rdquo;&mdash; into this lottery if it becomes a reality.  Many thousands of people will gamble anyway and if they do not win they will accept that, but quite a number of people will experience an enormous feeling of depression, of failure at having been trapped into this lottery.  They are not the people I mentioned who are involved in the various lotteries, draws and raffles operated throughout the length and breadth of this country.  I see this Bill as proposing not alone to supersede those draws and raffles but to wipe them out entirely.</P>
    <P>Nowhere does the Bill indicate how the profits attained &mdash; if there are to be profits &mdash; are to be distributed.  Broad statements to the effect that profits from the national lottery will be used for sports organisations and for development of the arts and culture are not sufficient.  We will have to be more specific about that, and the only way we can be specific and have it accepted by the people is to have it contained in the Bill.  As I have said, good intentions from this Government are not worth the paper they are written on.</P>
    <P>I have no wish to politicise this debate because if there is to be a national lottery it should be a national lottery.  I have indicated the disagreement that was evident between sources within the Government and people supportive of the Government, whether in or out of the national handlers group, and everybody will accept that that was a detrimental way to have this proposal emerge and give it the title of a national lottery, An Bille um Chrannchur Náisiúnta.  It was a pity, a shame.  If the ideas and ideals of the former Minister for Sport, a man of honesty and integrity from my county, saw the benefit of such a lottery I would value his judgment.  Other people, maybe at a higher level in Government, did not <Col N="1796" /> value his judgment and ability and moved him sideways, but that will do him no harm because the people in Cork are rebels and will answer that one when the opportunity comes.</P>
    <P>This Government were incapable of presenting even a lottery Bill.  They failed to introduce it with confidence and cohesion to the Dáil, the Oireachtas and ultimately the people.  If any success is to be achieved in the promotion of a chrannchur náisiúnta it is regrettable that it should begin its life in such a manner. It is a disgrace to the Government, the Cabinet and all those people who clamoured within Government and close to Government for the setting up of this lottery.  With their usual ineptitude they have thrown cold water on this proposal but I suspect it will have detrimental and serious effects on local draws and fund raising lotteries for specific purposes. Perhaps the Government realise this as they have not indicated in the Bill who will benefit by the profits from this lottery. They may be in for a rude awakening because when you try to take something dear to the hearts of the Irish people away from them you will be taught a severe lesson.</P>
    <P>If members of the various organisations and groups throughout the country feel that this lottery will interfere with their fund-raising efforts and campaigns to provide local community centres and dressing rooms beside playing fields instead of togging out in ditches, they will fight to the bitter end &mdash; not physically &mdash; and will show where their priorities lie in a manner befitting their organisations and commitments.  A number of charitable groups collect on a regular basis and, if the Government want to do something positive in this respect, they should examine some of the operations which are not so wholesome in regard to the collection of money.  They should investigate and establish how much of the subscriber's amount reaches the charity or fund raising activity for which it was intended because doubts have been expressed about some activities. Therefore, it is the duty of the <Col N="1797" /> Government to allay the fears of the public lest it be considered that all raffles and fund raising activities should be tarred with the same brush.  That would be incorrect and unfair but if there are doubts about money in a particular case &mdash; I do not allege that people are committing fraud in these raffles &mdash; an investigation should take place.</P>
    <P>This Bill is very wordy but the central facts and the main elements are missing. There are 37 sections.  Section 3 (1) (a) says that the Minister may grant a licence to a person authorising the holding on behalf of the Minister of the national lottery and (b) but not more than one licence under this subsection shall be in force at any time.  I am not in the legal profession and I do not know anything about parliamentary drafting but I should like to ask what all these sections are about.  They consist of beautiful language which is well phrased.  Section 8 deals with the national lottery fund, section 9 deals with the remuneration of the licensee, section 10 deals with the company, section 11 deals with the memorandum of association of the company and section 12 deals with the articles of association of the company.  I could go right through the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 15 deals with terms and conditions of employment.  Subsection (1) says the determination of the company of the remuneration, including superannuation and any allowances for expenses, and other terms and conditions of service of the staff of the company shall be subject to the approval of the Minister given with the consent of the Minister for the Public Service.  That sort of phraseology has turned up recently.  I put an amendment down to a section of a Bill and the Minister acknowledged our objection to it by withdrawing the section.  These proposals seem to be aimed at discontinuing recognition for the trade union movement.  I should prefer if agreement and remunerations were freely negotiated and entered into between the company and the trade unions.</P>
    <P>My main concern is the effect which the proposed lottery will have on local fund-raising activities.  There does not <Col N="1798" /> seem to be any protection for these groups of people who currently provide a valuable community service.  In regard to hospitals their efforts meet the short-fall in funds provided by the Department of Health.  Nowhere can I find any guarantee that this proposal will not have a detrimental effect on existing fund raising activities.  I wish to restate &mdash; it has to be said over and over&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that, and to be forewarned is to be forearmed so I suppose I deserved the rap on the knuckles. I will be a little bit more choosey about forewarning in future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nevertheless, it is insufficient for the purposes of this Bill to have repeated good intentions outlined if the Bill has no substance.  This is the case with this Bill, particularly with regard to the effects it will have on existing lotteries; there is no protection in the Bill for those worthy <Col N="1799" /> causes for which there are lotteries, draws and raffles at this time.  There is no indication, good, bad or indifferent, of how the surplus of the lottery will be used.  It is not sufficient just to state good intentions.  I would prefer to see definite statements included in the 37 sections of the Bill.  The Bill is full of terminology but the basic ingredient are not included.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will indicate that this proposal will not in any way destroy, diminish or supersede the many charitable, sporting and community draws and raffles in every parish and county throughout the length and breadth of this country.  I should like to see where the profits from the direct contributions and from the investments mentioned in the Bill will go.  What are the priorities? There is mention of a central fund in the Bill and I know it is not the Central Fund that we all have in mind when we talk about a central fund, but the central fund of the lottery.  I am afraid that profits that may accrue from this proposed national lottery will go to top up the other Central Fund for the day to day spending of the Government because it seems that every piece of available revenue finds its way to the same direction.</P>
    <P>In the context of this Bill I must refer to the proposal known as the DIRT tax. because it affects the same group of charitable organisations who are accuring money for the various commitments they have.  In this one year we have the taxing of their small savings and now the introduction of this lottery will further erode the activity of community associations, charitable organisations and sporting bodies.</P>
    <P>I have made a number of specific points to which I would like to reply from the Minister.  I will conclude by indicating that because of the unsatisfactory presentation of this Bill it is our intention to oppose not alone sections of it but the whole of it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very relieved that Fianna Fáil are not neutral on this Bill.  I would be very afraid of their stance in that instance.  Unlike the last speaker, I <Col N="1800" /> will not take long to cover the few points I wish to make on this Bill.</P>
      <P>First, I welcome the Bill.  It meets a number of criteria which are important. It meets a Government need to provide resources for things which in other circumstances might not be provided for through normal taxation.  It also extends a form of entertainment to a number of people, as part of the Irish culture and psyche is to enjoy gambling and betting and it facilitates that.</P>
      <P>My contribution will be very brief indeed.  There are just a few points I would like to put on the record of the House for the Government to consider.  First, in relation to the proceeds of the lottery, I concur with the previous speaker who would like to see specified in the legislation itself where the surpluses of the lottery will go.</P>
      <P>I should like to see the proceeds going equally in four directions, the first being sport.  There is a grave need in my home town of Enniscorthy for a swimming pool, a very important recreational facility, and a local voluntary group have to raise £250,000.  There is a very limited scheme by way of loan subsidy in the Department of the Environment for this type of activity.  County Wexford has no athletics track.  I should like the portion of the lottery proceeds which goes to sport to go for capital expenditure on sport.  Money going to pay administrative expenses of an organisation tends to be latent and hidden.  It would be preferable to have tangible results of the lottery in the form of capital expenditure.</P>
      <P>Sport is very important.  While he is in the House, I should like to pay tribute to the former Minister with responsibility for sport, Deputy Creed, who originated this lottery idea.  This was included in <i>Building on Reality</i> and every Member of the House welcomed it at the time.  It is disappointing, after his work, that there is no provision for sport under this Bill. I support Deputy Creed's demands that it be specified.</P>
      <P>However, there are other needs which also should be specified.  Voluntary charities, no doubt, will lose a certain element of their fund raising through the lottery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1801" /> Instant bingo cards for polio and other organisations, sold on a weekly basis, including the Enniscorthy weekly draw, HOC &mdash; Help Our Community &mdash; will be hit.  The more draws there are to compete, the more the total demand will be affected.  There will be some small repercussions, so I would like a quarter of the surplus to go in that direction.  In the Union of Voluntary Organisations for the Handicapped there are some very worthy organisations dealing with everything from arthritis to asthma, from palsy to polio, the blind, the deaf, the Irish Cancer Society, the Haemophilia Society, Irish Kidney Association, Irish Society for Autistic Children and so on. These are all deserving causes.  A quarter of the proceeds of the lottery would be ample compensation, without affecting the other needy areas.</P>
    <P>The two remaining quarters I should like to see going, respectively, to youth and the arts.  In the arts we have seen enormous difficulty due to lack of funding of the Arts Council.  It is only natural, perhaps, that perceived luxuries like the arts would be hit in a time of economic recession.  However, because of the cut-backs to the Arts Council funding the Wexford Opera Festival has been very severely curtailed.  I have spoken to the director of that council and money this lottery could give would be deeply appreciated.  A quarter would be about fair.</P>
    <P>We are not talking about something very middle or upper class, very remote from the ordinary punter, when we are talking about the arts.  One must consider the Graffiti organisations and other literary, theatrical and dramatic societies, people who are now making their livelihood out of the arts.  Many hundreds of young graduates coming out of third level education with Arts degrees have no particular direction in which to go.  This are needs to be developed and is deserving of a quarter of the proceeds.</P>
    <P>With regard to youth, we all know the demographic proportions of our population, the million people in education in Ireland and the preponderance of young people.  It is very important that the voluntary <Col N="1802" /> youth structures, whether the National Federation of Youth Clubs the National Youth Council of Ireland, or the many other subsidiary groups, including scouts, particularly in disadvantaged areas and urban communities should be assisted in their efforts, whether it is in the provision of a premises from which to do administrative work, or helping employment schemes to get off the ground, or ensuring that they get the right blend of partnership with the statutory organisations under the new National Youth Policy.  All four of those areas are deserving of the proceeds of the national lottery.  I should like the areas of sport, voluntary charities, youth services and the arts specified on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>There are some other areas in relation to the lottery on which I should like to dwell.  We are all aware of the demise of the Irish sweepstakes and recognise their role in the past in generating funds for hospitals and in providing employment. One of the major advantages of the sweepstakes was that they attracted sales of tickets abroad, in other words, overseas revenue.  I do not see it specified here, but I hope it is the Government's intention and that of the board overseeing the lottery that every effort will be made to attract overseas sales to bring money into this country, assuming that the lure of a big prize would hold equally well for people in Northern Ireland and the Republic.  We would then be able to boost prize money as a proportion of total gross sales and generate extra revenue for the good causes I have outlined.</P>
    <P>I understand that this lottery will be run under licence from the Minister for a two year period.  We had Irish Sweepstakes Limited, An Post and a derivative of Independent Newspapers bidding.  The Government were impressed by the presentation of An Post and I must concur. The network of facilities in terms of manpower, offices and sub-post offices of that organisation is unequalled in this country, especially in rural Ireland, as every household in the country is covered by An Post.  Local shopkeepers cannot compete with that type of service.  At <Col N="1803" /> a time when all State organisations are undergoing rationalisation, An Post have here one bright spot and I hope vacancies will be created for people who otherwise might have become unemployed.  I have no doubt that Mr. Fergal Quinn and his cohorts and colleagues in An Post have the professionalism required to make this scheme a success.</P>
    <P>The Bill states that at least 40 per cent of the surplus is to be given in prize money.  Going by the previous provisions in the 1956 Gaming and Lotteries Act and the general run of locally run prize funds, at least 50 per cent would be a more appropriate figure.  There should be no element of rip-off perceived by the public.  It must be remembered that we already have two State gambling services, one the Prize Bond system and the other the Totalisator Betting Service.  It could be argued that both of these present opportunities to the Exchequer to get increased revenue.  The Prize Bonds organisation are very staid and conservative in their approach and outlook.  With a bit more professionalism and dynamism they could raise substantially increased revenue if they advertised more and if more generous prizes were given.</P>
    <P>In relation to the tote services, this potential has not been tapped at all. There is a great need for extra money backing to the racing industry, instead of taking taxes and levies from it.  I would like that service computerised so that we would have off-course tote facilities just as we have SP betting offices on a licensed arrangement, so that the off-course punter could participate in tote betting. That would raise extra revenue, because there are certain types of bet such as place betting, forecast betting and the jackpot, which the ordinary punter cannot place except through the tote.  I should like an extension of those areas, consistent with the spirit of this Bill.  It would give the State a more positive and constructive role in relation to the national gambling that goes on, the State would get a better take and could provide for essential needs.</P>
    <P>One of the fall-out effects of this Bill <Col N="1804" /> is on voluntary organisations and charities. I am sure all Deputies have received letters and correspondence from the Union of Voluntary Organisations for the Handicapped, which cover at least 30 organisations and are very representative. I understand there was full consultation with the relevant Minister since the lottery was announced in the national plan and it has been agreed to amend section 34 of the 1956 Gaming and Lotteries Act whereby the existing prize limits for bingo and ordinary draws will be increased from £300 to £500.  In the Fine Gael draw the prizes are well in excess of that amount.</P>
    <P>People hold numbers draws in order to get around the provisions of the Gaming and Lotteries Act.  All political parties and many sporting organisations do this. The whole law needs to be up-dated. With the advent of this national lottery the special position of these voluntary and charitable bodies needs to be specifically revised.  Damage will be done to their fund-raising programmes, especially those promoting weekly pools and instant number games.  I welcome the effort to up-date section 34 of the Gaming and Lotteries Act.  It needs to be more specific and to state that special provision will be given to these agencies whereby they will be compensated for any losses arising out of the lottery.  I also ask that they be given representation on the board of the company of the lottery.</P>
    <P>Turning to the administration of the lottery it is often the case that, where a State organisation runs something like this, the first thing they do is get a head office with very expensive overheads. That is one sure way that this lottery will fail.  It is very important to remember that most of the lotteries that are voluntarily run are run on zero overheads. They are run voluntarily by people who give up their own time and their own expenses.  If there is a very cumbersome, bureaucratic and expensive administrative system running this lottery, they will run into some fatal errors whereby people will see that their money is not going towards a good cause but is being wasted. I urge An Post, the board which will run <Col N="1805" /> the lottery, to have a very thrifty, prudent and tight approach to their overheads.</P>
    <P>The people who are already agents for selling weekly tickets who have their own set of clients, should be utilised as well as the employees of An Post.  They should try to minimise as much as possible so that it will not be jobs for the boys.  I would like to see either at executive level of the company or on the board itself some semblance of the international experience that exists in relation to draws.  The Minister outlined in his Second Stage speech that in the United States, Australia, Sweden, across Europe and also in South American countries there is a vast experience of draws and lotteries.  It is very important that we try to tap some of that expertise and involve it in the administration of our national lottery.</P>
    <P>Fraud can be a problem.  It only takes one major fraud for this national lottery to be a disaster for all time.  It is very important that people have confidence in the scrutineer provided for under the legislation.  I suggest that this person should be somebody such as the Garda Commissioner, the Ombudsman or somebody of independent rank.  It is important that the current situation in relation to lotteries be clarified.  Over a year ago there was a total limbo in relation to the law.  A very famous punter who owned an estate put it up for sale by way of lottery.  The tickets were £200 or £400 each.  A famous commentator took part in the draw.  Later several people were arrested and others absconded.  It seemed crazy that the lottery could be held in the first place if it was illegal. There is a loophole that if a small element of the proceeds goes towards some GAA club it becomes legal.  That whole position needs to be cleared up.  In County Wexford where there is a severe problem with agricultural debts many farmers who had to sell out gave grave consideration to a national lottery in order to raise money for their farms.</P>
    <P>It is important that the national lottery is operated in the same way as the petrol coupons where one has to get three Xs in a line on a card.  It is important that <Col N="1806" /> people have an instant result.  As a person who bought sweepstake tickets, I did not find it very exciting.  People knew that the draw was to take place in a week's time but invariably the closing date was extended.  When the draw came up one did not know whether or not one had won.  It was never clearly publicised especially if a person drew a non-runner or a horse that was not going to run in the race.  It did not make dramatic news and therefore you had to work on the assumption that you had lost.  I hope this lottery, especially in its initial stages, will be simple and that people will know instantly whether they have won or lost.</P>
    <P>There are certain quiz programmes on television which are in limbo at present. Gay Byrne, Mike Murphy and Derek Davis are regularly whining, with some justification, about losing their draws on RTE.  It seems that the Gaming and Lotteries Act is unworkable or is unclear in its operation.  It seems foolish in a time of high crime to have the gardaí overly involved in this area.  Once the lottery gets going perhaps a number could be drawn every Sunday evening before the 9 o'clock News so that people would know exactly where they stood and would not be in doubt as to whether they had won or lost.</P>
    <P>I hope the lottery will have a good regional spread.  I hope the people adopt the national lottery.  I wish it well.  I hope this House of the Oireachtas retains its right to vet the lottery.  Often when new State organisations and semi-State bodies are set up they grow beyond their particular stature and become a monster which it is hard for this House to control.  We set up committees of public accounts and on public expenditure but they never seem to grapple with the problems.  I hope this structure will always be small and flexible enough to be answerable to this House.  I hope the two year trial period will be fully exercised so that, after two years, if other people can come up with a better idea for a lottery than An Post, they will be given consideration. I wish the lottery success.  I hope the Minister when replying can give a commitment <Col N="1807" /> that the proceeds will be divided equally between sporting organisations, for capital expenditure, for youth organisations, for the arts and for voluntary bodies and charities who will have losses because of the effect this lottery will have on their existing draws.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>Many Deputies referred to the effect this lottery will have on charitable organisations and voluntary bodies. I share those concerns.  There is a lot of fund-raising on behalf of schools especially in rural areas.  Parts of the proceeds of the lottery should go towards national, vocational and secondary schools.  Great difficulties are incurred in running schools, particularly high insurance costs, cleaning and maintenance of schools. One of the major concerns of the boards of management in these schools is the effect the national lottery will have on them.  They are busily engaged in organising their own lotteries and sponsored walks.  This is one area that has not been highlighted in this debate.  I am sure every Member of this House is subscribing to some draw for the renovation of schools, the building of new schools and extensions to secondary and vocational schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred to charitable and voluntary bodies but did not refer to the type of fund-raising that is so badly needed in our schools at present.  The Minister's Bill is very vague in most areas, particularly as regards who will benefit from the proposed lottery.  The Minister stated that it is possible to specify such purposes in the Bill but the Government consider that this approach lacks flexibility.  For example, the provision of national lottery resources to some areas not included in the list mentioned would have to await amending legislation.  He referred to the benefits that will accrue to sport and recreation, the Irish language, the arts and health care.  It was very disappointing that there was no reference to the fact that a subsidiary of An Post will be conducting the draw.  The Minister was vague and I hope <Col N="1808" /> that when replying he will answer the many questions put to him from all sides.</P>
    <P>One of the purposes behind the national lottery as outlined by Deputy Creed and his predecessor was that it would benefit sports and recreation.  In that case, many communities in rural Ireland would make applications for facilities. It saddens us that such facilities are not available and, as the Minister of State knows, the use of schools is restricted. We should like to see sporting organisations meeting in assembly halls and recreation centres, but that has not been possible in many cases.  The only hope of a capital grant towards the provision of such centres has been through the local authorities.  Galway County Council have increased their allocations but they still fall far short of what should be given to local organisations.  We should like to see all rural areas helped in this way.</P>
    <P>We will all have noticed that much of the legislation we have discussed in recent months dealt with Dublin in particular. It is no wonder that people like the Minister of State and I regard much of that legislation as Dublin oriented.  We have had provision for urban renewal, the beautifying of the streets of Dublin and improvements to the Phoenix Park.  It is time we had legislation to help rural communities who have been forgotten about.  This Bill has good intentions in regard to sport, our national culture and health care, according to the Minister's opening speech.  That being so, we may be told that the Western Health Board, representing three counties, could make up their short-fall of £4 million from the national lottery.  If that were so we would be moving away from a gamble to taxation and I do not know anybody who would agree with such a departure.  The health boards have to consider providing for hip operations, dental treatment, eye testing, etc., and it will not be acceptable if they are told they will be funded in future out of this lottery.  That would be funding from the Exchequer and the Department of Health and it would be nothing short of a new form of taxation. I hope we will get clarification on that.</P>
    <P>In the past, voluntary organisations, <Col N="1809" /> the GAA and management of school boards have had a great commitment in this field.  The problems for the GAA have been accentuated by the very high insurance premiums they have to pay for cover for players of different ages, and they will now be hit again because of the DIRT as well as this Bill.  There was no indication in the Minister's opening speech as to how such organisations will be helped, if they will be helped at all, from the proceeds of the lottery.</P>
    <P>A subsidiary of An Post, apparently, will be running the draw.  I take it that all post offices and sub-post offices will sell tickets.  Some sub-post offices think they will not be allowed to do this.  If tickets will be available only in post offices they will provide a very limited outlet.  As in the days of the Irish Hospitals Sweepstakes, tickets should be available in most retail outlets.  A case has been made that those who lost their jobs in the Irish Hospitals Sweepstakes should be employed in any lottery which will be operated.  I hope the Minister will look at that.</P>
    <P>A question arises on the role of An Post in the issuing of television licences. If a subsidiary of An Post are to deal with the national lottery, RTE will make the case, as they have done on many occasions, that they should deal with the issuing and checking of television licences. I ask the Minister to give us some information on that.  The Government's commitment to sport is open to question. We have seen over the past number of years many organisations who have raised funds in all kinds of ways.  One community in Gort, County Galway, set off to walk all the way to Dublin.  They were luckier than most.  They did get some assistance.  The Minister of State knows that in our own constituency of East Galway in places such as Kiltormer, Monivea and Clonberne&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am talking about those places where they are looking for assistance. <Col N="1810" /> The list goes on.  Some of those areas are looking for grant assistance.  If money was provided for sport and recreation, those areas would expect to receive assistance.  Deputy Leyden spoke earlier about places in north Galway, the part of Galway in the Roscommon constituency. We hope that money can be provided for the people in those areas.  When we were discussing the Funds of Suitors Bill recently the money provided on that occasion for sport and recreation was very disappointing.  An organisation very involved in arts and culture, namely, Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann, were very disappointed with the allocation they received under that Bill.  Despite our best efforts to get the Minister to double the amount of money for Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann we did not succeed.</P>
      <P>That is the reason I say that in the areas of national culture, sport and recreation, the response has been very disappointing. I should make a parallel point that at least when the Funds of Suitors Bill was published there were very specific allocations decided on for the King's Inns, for the arts and for sport.  Unfortunately, in this Bill we have only vague good intentions about what may be in the Bill and what will be published and listed in Iris Oifigiúil.  The Government used the excuse that they want flexibility.  That is why we do not get any specific undertaking as to where the moneys and benefit will go.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point has been made on many occasions by Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann that they received less money than other areas of the arts such as ballet. For that reason, they have raised many questions on the Bill.  Deputy Lyons referred to some of the problems encountered with organisations who do not give details of where all the money which they collect goes.  He did not go so far as to say that they are bogus organisations, but that accountability is not there.  I have no information on that type of operation but I notice, as I am sure other Deputies notice, that most charitable organisations are now engaging in house to house selling <Col N="1811" /> of tickets and sponsorship for their fund raising.</P>
    <P>It shows how desperate an organisation are when it is not just a question of a church gate collection or tickets being left in a shop, supermarket or post office, but a question of being engaged in house to house selling of tickets or lines.  I imagine that An Post or a subsidiary will have to engage in the same type of salesmanship. I said at the outset that charitable organisations and voluntary bodies are in financial difficulties.  This has been stated over and over again, in particular by St. Vincent de Paul.  They have to work harder than they did in the past to get funds. Some people suggested the success of Band Aid last year affected the contributions to voluntary bodies and charitable organisations, particularly before Christmas.  That may be so.  They have to engage in house to house collections in order to get their funds together.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to the section of the Bill which deals with the prize fund. We are told that not less than 40 per cent of the lottery fund will be made available in prizes.  Most Deputies who have spoken referred to this figure as being very low.  If only 40 per cent is being made available in prizes, it indicates that a very large amount of money will be taken up in administration.  I hope that if this Bill goes through, the Minister will look again at the possibility of increasing the amount of money for prizes.  Surely, 60 per cent will not be spent on administration. I do not think there is any need for a large head office to administer the lottery.  I hope we do not have the same story in this lottery as we have with other State bodies whereby, as soon as they are set up, they have their head offices in Dublin.  There is no need for the head office to be in Dublin on this occasion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann, deeply concerned about the serious situation that exists in regard to crimes involving firearms, robbery with violence and physical assault, calls on the Government to make adequate finance available for the necessary levels of overtime in the Garda Síochána needed to deal with this situation.</P>
      <P>It is a matter of great regret that we on this side of the House again find it necessary to bring to the notice of the Minister and the Government the serious and unacceptable level of crime and violence in our society.  It is also a matter of concern that, despite the views expressed in this House on so many occasions during the past four years, the Government are now, by virtue of their allocation of funds, effectively abandoning our people and leaving them unprotected against the revages of an unacceptable crime rate.  There were encouraging signs that the gardaí were beginning to come to grips with the serious problem of crime and vandalism.  On previous occasions I welcomed in this House statistics, although sometimes dubious, which showed a levelling off and an improvement in the crime rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In any debate dealing with law and order and crime it is important to recognise and pay tribute to the efforts of the Garda Síochána.  We were always generous in our acknowledgement of the work of the gardaí on our behalf.  That is as it should be and I know that the gardaí <Col N="1813" /> accept that acknowledgement and recognition in the spirit in which they are meant when expressed by Members on all sides of the House.  The Minister will no doubt agree, however, that goodwill and kind expressions to the gardaí are of very little use at this time.  It is our duty as legislators to create for the Garda Síochána the economic, social and structural environment in which they can carry out their duty in a free and unrestricted way. Under any of those headings there has been a considerable amount of confusion, disappointment and frustration on the part of individual members of the force, particularly during the past couple of years.</P>
    <P>It does not surprise me when I hear individual gardaí express their disappointment at the lack of support in real terms by way of legislation to enable them to carry out their duty in the difficult environment in which they operate.  It is for that reason that we have tabled this motion.  The success of the gardaí in coming to grips with serious crime is being negatived by the restriction on duty which will follow the cutback in overtime. The Minister in his contribution on the Estimate did not admit that the cut-back would have any real effect but by virtue of this decision we are recreating and strengthening the environment in which vandals can operate.  We are, in fact, diminishing the return on our increased investment in law enforcement over the years.  It would be nothing short of a national disaster if, having seen the gardaí beginning to come to grips with the unacceptable crime rate and bearing in mind the cost to this nation of bringing about this situation, a short term monetarist decision by the Minister and the Government were to undermine and undo that progress.</P>
    <P>The Minister has given much thought to the reform of our finances and I give him credit for it.  I am sure he would be the first to admit that if investment in a project leads to a certain amount of progress then it would be a false economy to undermine that development by cutting <Col N="1814" /> back on the level of support which is needed to keep up the momentum.  This is exactly what the Minister and the Government are doing in cutting back on Garda overtime.  As I said earlier, they are recreating the environment in which vandals can operate and diminishing the return on our investment in the control of crime and the maintenance of law and order.  Apart from the social and political implications, there are serious questions to be asked relating to the financial wisdom of making that decision.  The taxpayer will be asked at some stage in the future to pick up an increased bill in an effort to bring the situation under control.</P>
    <P>During my speech last week on the Estimate, I said that the level of crime in society is a reflection of the success or failure of the Government in the areas of economic and social reform.  There is a clearly defined link between the level of unemployment and the level of crime and vandalism in society.  I have not come to that conclusion through my own research; it is an established fact throughout the world that the economic and social development of a nation is linked with the levels of crime and violence.  The Government got their priorities wrong. If they had given job creation the priority it deserves and boosted the economy so that social conditions improved instead of having to provide more money for the protection of society against the ravages of crime and vandalism we would not be here expressing our views on the inadequacy of the allocation to enforce law and order.</P>
    <P>It is a pity that the Government always appear to be reacting to events rather than planning ahead.  Our motion is evidence of the Government's attitude.  One of the tragedies of the present position is that the public now have the worst of both worlds.  Their economic policies have failed and they have not provided the money necessary to protect society from the fall-out from their disastrous policies in the social and economic areas. The Government cannot have it both ways.  If they have failed through their economic and social policies to create the <Col N="1815" /> environment where crime can be minimised they must take action to protect our citizens from the worst effects of those policy failures.</P>
    <P>In dealing with the question of Garda overtime the Minister denies that a problem exists.  He blames sensational newspaper reports, irresponsible statements by gardaí and Members of the House for the problem.  The Minister would be better acknowledging the extent of the problem and being frank with the House, the public and the Garda.  I do not think the Minister can continue to deny that there is a problem in the force in regard to inadequate funding for overtime between now and the end of the year.  One cannot tailor law enforcement and crime control to any rigid pattern of budget management. The Minister is endeavouring in the Department of Justice to do what he did in the Department of Finance.  I will not comment on his success or failure in the latter Department but I must point out that the increased allocation necessary for law enforcement is a by-product of the Government's failures in other areas.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is right to restrict law enforcement to a rigid budget.  If the allocation is not sufficient to provide the level of police protection needed by our citizens the Minister has a duty to be frank with the House and seek additional funds if they are required.  The Minister should spell out the position in regard to Garda overtime for the remainder of this financial year, not so much in regard to the income of individual gardaí but from the point of view of its effects on the overall performance of the force.  Irrespective of what the Minister says, a cut from £2 million per month &mdash; the expenditure incurred in the first four months of this year &mdash; to £500,000 per month for the remainder of the year represents a frightening reduction in the level of Garda duty.  That is what we are concerned about tonight.  The Garda Commissioner, or the Minister, cannot maintain the same level of Garda activity for the remainder of the year at the same momentum of the last four months with <Col N="1816" /> the funds being made available by the Government.  I hope the Minister will be able to reassure the House tonight that the performance of our police officers will not be unduly restricted for the remainder of the year.</P>
    <P>I fully support the Minister in his efforts to get the best possible return from the money allocated to his Department.  I give him credit for bringing about savings through efficiency in administration, but I cannot accept a restriction on the level of Garda activity. Our newspapers carry stories every day of a shortage of gardaí in urban areas to deal with the deterioration in law and order.  I recall that in previous debates on law and order in the House reference was made to urban communities only; but, while the problem still exists in urban areas, it has spread to rural areas.  In rural parts of my constituency of Laois-Offaly the level of Garda manpower has been reduced because of the existence of the top security prison in Portlaoise.  Constituents from rural areas have expressed their disgust and disappointment to me at the failure of the Government to provide a proper level of Garda protection. Those people are entitled to that protection. The Minister should reassure those people, and the Garda who are frustrated with the present position.</P>

      <P>The Minister is not giving the people the protection they are entitled to expect from the Garda Síochána. The Garda, who have a commitment to local communities and local development projects, are disappointed at the reaction of the Government.  Many gardaí in rural <Col N="1817" /> areas go beyond the call of duty to provide a proper service for local people. Gardaí in my constituency are torn between providing that dedication to local communities and being officially called on to provide an unreasonable degree of service at the prison in Portlaoise. Gardaí were never trained to do prison duty.  They are qualified to act as police officers and to work in a community as law enforcers.  The atmosphere in prison is alien to them.  I do not intend to get involved in that security matter in this debate, but the Minister cannot have a Garda presence at the prison in Portlaoise at the expense of rural communities in Laois and Offaly.  He should not shrug his shoulders and say that there is not a problem in Portlaoise or in Laois and Offaly.  I hope the Minister will be man enough to admit the extent of the problem and tell us his plans to deal with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last week, when replying to the debate on the Estimate for his Department, the Minister by implication said that the £2 million per month spent on overtime for the first four months of this year was wasteful and unnecessary.  If that is his view it is a reflection on the Government and a former colleague of the Minister who found it necessary to provide the level of finance to pay for overtime.  At the beginning of the year it was held that £2 million per month was necessary for essential Garda overtime but for the next eight months only £500,000 per month will be provided.  Does the Minister really think that the vandals will decide not to commit crime just because the Government have not got the money to provide for a sufficient number of gardaí on the streets?  The Minister knows the opposite is the case.  He knows we are dealing with professional people who are perhaps even more capable of monitoring the situation than we are or than the Garda Commissioner is capable of doing.  They know when gardaí will not be on duty because of the restrictions on overtime and they will select those times to engage in their criminal activities.  The Minister is a practical man and he must know that what I am saying is true.  There cannot be any <Col N="1818" /> answer other than to provide adequate money to keep gardaí on full-time duty.</P>
    <P>I know that Border duty constitutes a great demand on Garda manpower and financial resources.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">

    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has not heard me up to now.  I have spoken here on many occasions in the past few months since he became Minister for Justice and now I think I have been talking to myself. I thought on this occasion if I raised the volume a little the Minister might take note of what I am saying and respond more effectively.</P>
      <P>A great demand on Garda manpower and on our finances is imposed because of Border duty.  The cost in human and financial terms is all part of the tragedy of the partition of our country and, sadly, the position is not improving.  Earlier I made the point about the Government reacting to events.  Part of our problem arises from the fact that the Government made no provision for the additional Garda security necessary in Border areas following the signing of the Hillsborough agreement.  Surely the Government were aware that such provision would have to be made.  In real terms they decided to strengthen Border security at the expense of the citizens by reducing overtime, which effectively means a 10 per cent reduction in Garda duty.  That cut-back in real terms when applied to a restricted Garda working day constitutes the equivalent of 1,000 Garda man-days lost on duty.  The Minister is shaking his head and does not agree with me on that point. However, I asked people more capable than I am to do research into that matter and I was told that was the effect of the 10 per cent cut-back.</P>

      <P>I should like to have more time to deal with the very wide area that directly and indirectly will be affected as <Col N="1819" /> a result of the proposed cut-back. Already I have brought to the notice of the Minister the serious effect in rural towns and villages of the proposed cut-back. I have told him of the frustration of the Garda who do not know where they stand.  How is it possible to prepare any effective long-term programme for policing when one is not sure that the level of finance necessary for its implementation will be available?</P>
      <P>I have listened to lengthy and sometimes very constructive contributions from the Minister.  I ask him to recognise that we have a problem here.  He should inform the House how he will deal with it between now and the end of the financial year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall speak more softly than my colleague.  I think he is getting ready for the forthcoming election and is getting his voice into training for the parish pump meetings.  I have always taken the attitude that whoever is Minister for Justice always deserves the support of the Opposition in the very onerous taks he has to perform.  Generally speaking, people on this side of the House have been fair.  Sometimes I think a Minister of Justice has to fight the Department of Finance and this Minister, having come from Finance, is probably sorry now he did not always realise more fully the real problems of the Minister for Justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On this side of the House we are deeply concerned about the high level of crime. I do not have to tell Members of the House that daily we meet people whose lives have been affected by what is going on around us.  This afternoon I went to a meeting of the Arts Advisory Committee of Dublin Corporation which was held in the Hugh Lane Municipal Gallery.  I met the members of the staff who, to put it mildly, were brutally treated by their captors for the short time they were in their clutches.  These people were literally terrified out of their skins.  All kinds of questions were addressed to them by the criminals, such as if they were married and the number of children they <Col N="1820" /> had.  All of these intimidating tactics were designed to put a man in fear of his life and they were employed by vicious brutes who showed no mercy to their victims. The little cleaning lady, the darling of the staff, was knocked to the ground and, I think, was handcuffed.  It was suggested that this elderly person should be taken to hospital because it was thought she might suffer other side effects as a result of her bad experience.  She survived the ordeal, but even at this stage she is still not over what happened to her.  The bleeding hearts say we are vindictive and so on when we state in this House what is happening to the victims of crime.  I have nothing but the highest of praise for the Garda.  They responded almost immediately to the alarm raised at the time of the attempted robbery.  The alarm system was fully operational and it was attended to promptly by the Garda.  Full marks must be given to them because they did their job well.</P>
    <P>In recent times we have heard various Ministers for Justice talk about the reduction in the figures of recorded crime.  I am sure the Minister is aware that much of the crime committed is not recorded. People have given up going to the Garda to complain about being mugged or robbed or about their houses being broken into.  They feel that it is all so hopeless.  The law abiding citizenry of this country are very reluctant to take the law into their own hands, but some of them are becoming very angry.  I appeal to people not to attempt to take the law into their own hands, not to go after criminals.  Defend yourself to the best of your ability, but do not give chase to criminals.</P>
    <P>Many of these criminals have criminal records.  In reply to parliamentary questions the Minister told me that for the first four months of this year there were 265 armed robberies, two a day including Sundays.  These armed robberies are committed by people who are known to have criminal records.  I know sentences have been increased to 14 years for armed robbery but obviously this is not acting as a deterrent.  In the present climate we <Col N="1821" /> must impose sentences which are horrendous &mdash; 25 years to 30 years.  I do not know why, but whenever I speak on this topic, more than on any other topic, I get a great public response by letters from all over the country.  People tell me to keep pursuing this subject and to speak out on it.  These people want protection.  The Minister inherited a very serious situation. Any Minister for Justice will have to face this problem but he must be backed up by the courts.</P>
    <P>As regards overtime, the Minister must look at the quality of service the people are getting for their money and see where he can make cut-backs but when it comes to protecting the people in their homes and on the streets, I do not believe he can cut back in this area.  The State's first priority is to protect the people so that they are free to walk our streets.  There has been a big decrease in the number of joy-riding incidents because these joyriders have been sent away.  We have complimented the Minister and his predecessor on this improvement on many occasions, but we still have a very high crime rate.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister know the number of armed robberies which have taken place in the past six months?  Is it very much greater than the 265 armed robberies which took place in the first four months? If the Minister has those figures I would be interested to have them because that is the only barometer we have to see if crime is on the increase.  I want to emphasise that we are talking about armed robbery and robbery with violence, not the ordinary crime or robbery or mugging, which is armed robbery because a person uses his fists which can be a lethal weapon.</P>
    <P>The question we must ask ourselves is how the money provided for overtime is being spent and the quality of service the community are getting for their taxes.  It is the Minister's job to say how we can maximise every £1 we spend in defence of the public.  He will earn the thanks of the community if, before he leaves office, he introduces a Bill to change the system which compels our gardaí to spend so s.  As the Minister <Col N="1822" /> knows, most gardaí appear in the courts on their day off.  How much overtime is actually paid for gardaí appearing in court?  Any journalist who does not cover the District Courts should go to that court any day and he will see how many gardaí are waiting there, often from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.  I suggest that an inspector go to the court and put the charges for the gardaí.  I think this system operates in Britain.  The money spent on overtime keeping gardaí in the courts could be spent keeping gardaí on the streets.  We will have to look at this system.</P>
    <P>Recently we took the preventive measure which enabled a district justice to give consecutive sentences for crimes committed by a person while out on bail. It would be interesting to know if we are benefiting from this.  Are fewer people on bail committing crimes now than heretofore? I do not have any statistics about this but perhaps I will put down a parliamentary question.  Unfortunately, it is too late to do it this session&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I will.  Tonight we are to vote to abolish claims for malicious damages for victims of crimes, people who had their cars stolen or burned or people whose businesses were destroyed and find it very difficult to get insurance. This is being done at a very bad time because crime is at a very high level.  We are talking about saving £120 million paid out in malicious damages, but the hardship imposed on a small section of the community will be horrendous.</P>
      <P>This party will always support anything the Government do to reduce crime.  If they were to come in next session asking for an additional Estimate for the Department of Justice, I believe this house would welcome such a move.  The Government have to realise that morale is very low because of the apparent freedom with which young criminals wander through our streets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many people are very unhappy about the way District Courts operate.  If one goes to these courts one will see how many cases are adjourned for a week, a <Col N="1823" /> fortnight or even longer.  This may happen because a garda does not turn up or somebody else is away and the justice will postpone the case for two or three weeks.  There is a great deal of time wasted.  The job of district justice calls for a very special type of person.  I would go crazy if I were in that job for six months, seeing the same type of people day after day.  This is particularly true in the courts dealing with petty crime.  The Minister should look at the magistrates system as it operates in Britain.  Let us see whether we should have a couple of pilot areas in Dublin where we might operate a magistrate type system advised by a legal clerk with local people who know their own people, and let us see how it works.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Dukes)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the amendment which appears in my name on the Second Supplementary Order Paper:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann commends the Government on the level of manpower and other resources made available to the Garda Síochána, requests that these resources be used with maximum effectiveness and notes with satisfaction the reduction in recorded crime for the second successive year.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am more than a little amazed that we are having this discussion again this evening and tomorrow evening.  The Opposition might have chosen a different subject for a three hour debate in the last week of this present Dáil session from one which has already been well discussed in this House over the last few weeks. As recently as last Friday I dealt at length with the matters raised by my friend, Deputy Hyland, when I moved the 1986 Estimates for my Department and the related votes, an Estimate which was <Col N="1824" /> accepted unopposed, let me add, by the Opposition.  I also dealt with some of those matters in responding to a motion put down, again by the Opposition, I think by Deputy Hyland, on 13 May last.</P>
    <P>In those debates I spelled out in some considerable detail the resources that have been made available to the Garda in recent years and which will continue to be provided.  Honest to God, I am moved to the reflection that there is none so blind as he who will not see.  Having this debate on this subject that has already been so well travelled in this House over the last couple of weeks is simply an indication that the Opposition were paying no more than lip service and taking the opportunity of very partial comment to make what they believe are telling political arguments, all of which can be shown to be without foundation.</P>
    <P>As I have stated on a number of occasions recently and as the Deputies on the other side of the House must know very well by now, the level of indictable crime is decreasing.  I intend to go into that in more detail.  Nobody denies that the crime situation is serious and that we should be, as we are, concerned about it; but I wonder why some people seem unable to acknowledge and admit that the picture is a good deal brighter than it has been for many years past and that the Garda's efforts, with the full support of the Government, are finally paying off. Indeed, for the first time here tonight I heard Deputy Hyland admitting this, in a grudging way perhaps, but he was able to bring himself to admit it.  I wish that Deputy Hyland would pay himself, the House and the Garda the compliment of recognising the truth a little more fully and generously&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;than he could bring himself to do tonight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Opposition motion calls for the provision of adequate finance for the necessary levels of overtime in the Garda Síochána.  There is no need for the Opposition to make a call of that kind.  The <Col N="1825" /> necessary finance has been and will be provided.  It is hardly necessary for me to point out that more overtime is not the answer to the crime situation.  As I have said, overtime represents only a small part of the total resources provided for the Garda Síochána, and it is totally misleading to suggest that more money allocated for overtime has some correlation with the problem posed by crimes of violence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister saying that the £2 million is wasted money?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I must raise my voice against my better judgment if the Deputy interrupts me.  If I were to invite him to follow the logic of what he was saying about the social and economic roots of crime, had he gone down that road &mdash; I hoped that he might &mdash; he would logically come to the conclusion that he would propose that instead of giving more money for Garda overtime we should divert resources from Garda overtime and ordinary Garda pay and equipment and put them into job creation. If Deputy Hyland wants to make that proposal I will be very happy to discuss it with him.  It might do him good to think about that from time to time.  It would help him to get away from this perverse obsession that the Members on the benches opposite have with this question of overtime which is only one small part of the total picture.</P>
      <P>I have already given the House in considerable detail information about the sources available to the Garda Síochána and of the various measures that the Government have taken to enable the Garda Síochána to deal with crime more effectively, but it appears that I must go over the ground again.  I will do it with some relish because I am going to take up some of the more irresponsible allegations that have been taken up by some of the media and by the Fianna Fáil Party in the recent past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no doubt whatever about the Government's commitment to underpinning <Col N="1826" /> the efforts of the Garda and supporting them in the job they are doing for our community.  The most important resource of any police force is, of course, their manpower.  Total Garda strength has increased by over 700 since this Government took office.  Recruitment continues in order to maintain an overall strength of 11,400.  In the last three and a half years we have recruited 1,400 members of the force in order to achieve the target figure of 11,400 in addition to filling the normal vacancies which arise. The Garda are exceptional in this regard in that, in spite of the fact that there is a general policy of restriction in the total numbers in the public service, we have exempted the Garda Síochána from that as a special measure in order to deal with crime and we have willingly provided the necessary finance to underpin that.</P>
    <P>When we consider that the ordinary salaries bill for the Garda in the current year is almost £200 million it is very difficult to understand why so much prominence is given to this alleged inadequacy of an overtime provision of £12 million. When we are talking about a normal salaries bill of around £200 million, £1 million here or there in relation to overtime can be seen in its proper context.  It is not a major issue nor is it a major influence in determining the level of Garda activity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>That is trivialising the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not trivialising; it is fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>So is crime a fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>That is fact, although Deputy Hyland might not like to hear it, and the Opposition owe it to themselves and to the people to recognise the facts and not to dramatise the situation and play on people's fears by the kind of claptrap that we have heard from the Opposition benches about this matter. From reading some of the reports one would get the impression that normal Garda pay accounts for nothing and that everything must be done on overtime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1827" /> Obviously, there are times when overtime is necessary and is an efficient and cost-effective way of meeting the demands of particular circumstances; but it is entirely misleading to regard a high incidence of overtime working on its own as any kind of reliable or valid measure of the effectiveness of policing.  The vast bulk of Garda services are provided by members working in the course of their normal duty hours.  That is as it should be and will continue to be.</P>
    <P>I think I should spell out the position on overtime with reference to publicity about the matter.  The Government made an allocation of £12 million for Garda overtime for 1986.  Because expenditure on Garda overtime in the first four months of the year was running at a very high level the Garda authorities undertook a detailed review of this expenditure to ensure that the best possible return is got from it.  I am very glad that Deputy Briscoe showed clearly again tonight that we are not alone on this side of the House in recognising the need for that kind of examination.  I hope that the contagion of Deputy Briscoe's good common sense will spread across the benches there on the other side of the House.  They could do with much more of it.</P>
    <P>I have no hesitation in admitting that that review was undertaken at my suggestion nor do I make any apology for saying that.  As might be expected, that review together with a general reappraisal of Garda deployment, has led to some changes in the use of resources; but the situation is being menitored closely by the Garda authorities and by me in order to ensure that resources are being deployed in such a way as to maintain effective policing in all areas.  To read some reports and to listen to some of the things that Deputy Hyland said one would nearly come to the conclusion that all Garda activity was coming to a stop. One recent newspaper article reported on about ten different incidents, accidents and crimes of various degrees of seriousness which it was alleged had been left unattended by the Garda because of <Col N="1828" /> the so-called overtime cut-backs.  That paper may be the end of the week newspaper, but it is pretty weak on facts.  I want to go into some of those allegations.</P>
    <P>An allegation was made that no attention was paid in time to an outbreak of fire at Clancy Barracks, Islandbridge in Dublin.  The military authorities sought the assistance of the Garda Technical Bureau on 12 May and it was provided the following day.  I do not intend to go into details but I assure the House that there was no urgency regarding the matter and the Garda authorities do not think the involvement of the Technical Bureau was warranted.</P>
    <P>There was a post mortem examination in the case of a man who died as a result of a stabbing incident in his home on the night of 10-11 May and a person has been charged with manslaughter.  The post mortem held on 12 May was attended by a member of the photographic section of the Technical Bureau.  It had been the practice &mdash; and this was picked up in the article &mdash; for a member from the ballistics section of the Technical Bureau to attend such post mortems also but on this occasion that was not considered necessary. However, the newspaper in question claimed that this was a deficiency due to an alleged cut-back in overtime. There was a hit-and-run incident in Finglas on the night of 11-12 May and a member of the local detective branch attended at the scene.  Assistance from the Technical Bureau was not considered necessary but this newspaper seems to believe that it is in a better position to judge that than the Garda authorities.  It is not.</P>
    <P>There was an armed robbery at a public house in Cabra and the scene was examined by a member from the ballistics section of the Technical Bureau on 12 May following a request received on the same day.  Again, this was presented by the newspaper as being a deficiency in the provision of overtime.  Another post mortem examination was held on 12 May which was attended by a member from the photographic section of the Technical Bureau.  It was decided at that stage that it was not necessary for a member from <Col N="1829" /> the ballistics section to attend but the newspaper again seemed to suggest that there was a difficulty in relation to overtime. The Garda are far better at deciding what is required in those circumstances than any Sunday newspaper and they always will be.</P>
    <P>A request was received by the Technical Bureau on 12 May to have an examination carried out on a van suspected of being involved in a hit and run accident in Tullamore.  It was refused on the grounds that that work was considered to be more appropriate for the local scense of crime officer who had attended the scene of the accident.  I know that Deputy Hyland knows all about this and he should talk to some of the people in the Sunday newspapers to tell them that, contrary to what they seem to believe, we have local scenes of crimes officers in Garda divisions all round the country and it is not always necessary to have officers from the Technical Bureau to attend.  I could go on and on in respect of every allegation made by that newspaper.  However, every so-called deficiency was perfectly, properly and normally handled by the Garda authorities.  One incident in particular received prominence, a hurling match between Limerick and Clare in Ennis on 1 June&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Six sergeants and 36 gardaí were on duty at that event, three of the sergeants and 32 of the gardaí were on overtime and there was an adequate Garda service available elsewhere in County Clare at the time.  How that newspaper made the allegation it did, I do not know.  If I were paying the salaries of some of the people who produced that kind of story, I would have them in for a very immediate examination, not just of overtime but also of their ordinary pay. However, I will not go into that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was also alleged that a major investigation was stopped for the weekend because there was nobody available from the Technical Bureau.  That is not true. The local officers, who have primary <Col N="1830" /> responsibility for the investigation of the case, continued their investigations and members of the Technical Bureau were on standby in the event of any development. Those are a number of incidents which have not just been misrepresented by various section of the media and Deputies opposite, but which have been grossly distorted and presented in a way which is deliberately or culpably ignorant or intended deliberately to do damage.</P>
    <P>We had another example of a partial representation of a number of matters concerning the Garda Síochána in a recent RTE programme.  It seems to be my night for having a difference of opinion with the media but it is important for the House and the public that these things should be put on the record.  A recent &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo; programme, which I am told took two months to make, was very badly prepared and was a shallow attempt to look critically at the very serious matter of the management of our police resources.  The tone of the programme was set from the beginning with suggestions of shebeening and pool playing in Dublin Garda stations.  Other Members of the House, apart from myself, have been in Garda stations and divisional headquarters where there is a recreation room and a pool table.  Indeed, Deputy Hyland knows that you will find the same thing in prison officers' messes and it is right to provide recreational facilities for those who are waiting to go on duty or who have come off.  I do not think any suggestion could be made that we should not provide such facilities.  They are good for morale and relaxation.</P>
    <P>Let us see what appears to have happened on that programme.  It raised the allegations but did nothing to find out if there was any truth in them or if they were the result of an over-fertile imagination. &ldquo;Shebeening&rdquo; is a very attractive little word.  I have been in touch with the Garda authorities about that matter and they inform me that the allegation was fully investigated by a chief superintendent when it first came to light some years ago and that no evidence was found to substantiate the allegation.</P>
    <P>The allegations about pool playing in <Col N="1831" /> a named Garda station are being investigated by the Garda but at this stage they are only allegations and there was no attempt to examine their basis.  It was also suggested during the course of the programme that thousands of so-called fraud cases were not recorded in crime statistics.  What is a case?  It could be that a case of a bounced cheque is reported to the Garda but the fact that a cheque bounces does not necessarily imply that a criminal act was committed.  There has to be a clear intention to defraud and where there is no such intention and no criminal behaviour is detected, naturally a case of that kind is not recorded as a crime.  That is as it should be and to present it in any other way is at least a partial representation of the situation.</P>
    <P>There was also an allegation that certain crime forms were not available.  I heard that trotted out in the House a few days ago.  I have looked into that and the Garda authorities inform me that last year it came to their notice that in a small number of Garda cases they had run short of crime recording forms.  Arrangements were immediately made to have the necessary from provided without delay and the garda authorities have assured me that there is no question of any crime not having been recorded.  I am glad to have this opportunity to nail that allegation.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the right of reply and I know I am being provocative to people outside the House as well as to those inside it.  However, I will make the point. When RTE invite a party to send a spokesman for interview &mdash; Deputy Woods knows something about this &mdash; and the party decline, RTE, to their credit, are punctilious about mentioning that fact.  Many viewers would take that to mean that the party concerned are not in a position to stand up and reply to the criticism.  However, on this occasion, the shoe was on the other foot in that the Garda asked for a right of reply at the end of the programme to the points that were raised.  That was not given; nor was it announced on the air that the Garda had asked for a right of reply and been <Col N="1832" /> refused.  I do not know what RTE expected them to do.  Perhaps they expected them to pay for an advertisement to announce that they had asked for a right of reply and been refused.  I must say that that kind of reporting does not reflect a great deal of credit on the people who do it.  That is not even what I am worried about.  I am extremely worried by the way in which any kind of sensational allegation or one that appears to be potentially sensational is taken up and there is never a follow-through to find out was there a foundation for that allegation.  If there is, we need to know; if there is not, it should be withdrawn. In these particular cases there was no foundation for any one of those allegations.</P>
    <P>The £12 million allocated this year for Garda overtime was never reduced, nor was it ever under any threat of reduction.  As I have said, none of the allegations, none of the alleged instances of failure to provide an adequate Garda response as a result of alleged cut-backs, stands up to investigation.  I have given the House some of the details of some of the cases. I could go on for longer, but time is limited.  But I find that there is no cause for concern or misgiving and there is certainly no cause for the kind of scaremongering publicity that has been indulged in in relation to this subject.  That kind of publicity is certainly misguided and is arguably &mdash; I believe this firmly myself and I am saying arguably just to be polite &mdash; contrary to the public interest.  It unnecessarily raises fears.  In fact, it can have another effect in that if we are constantly being faced in our newspapers and on the medium of television with unfounded allegations that there is a cut-back in Garda services, that may indeed help to encourage people who might not otherwise get involved in criminal activity. I do not say that to make life any easier for me or for the Garda.  Deputies know I am perfectly prepared to look after myself and the Garda can do the same thing.  But I am very worried about the wider consequences of that kind of unfounded allegation being made.  Nor <Col N="1833" /> do I think that anybody in this House has ever found me, either in my previous job or in my present job, at all reluctant to investigate fully any complaint that is made to me about any of the things that come under my jurisdiction.  The House can be assured that that will also be my position from here on.</P>
    <P>To conclude on the question of overtime, I would emphasise to the House that what is involved in this overtime expenditure review is to ensure that we get the best return from the £12 million involved.  I cannot see how anybody could reasonably quarrel with that.  As I have said, and I repeat the assurance, no essential Garda duty will be left undone for want of the necessary finances and I and the Government will see to that.</P>
    <P>I referred previously to the fact that the Garda are being provided with up-to-date technological resources.  Deputies on the other side of the House know I have a very thick skin, but I was a bit upset during the course of our Estimates debate last Friday to hear it suggested by the other side of the House that I was taking too much credit for providing the Garda with an up-to-date radio network that covers all of the country with the exception of the Dublin metropolitan area, that we are providing them with improved computer facilities which I detailed last Friday, that we will shortly have a new radio network in operation in the Dublin metropolitan area and that I hope in the very near future to be able to sign a contract for a new command and control system here.</P>
    <P>All of that represents a very considerable investment and it would be seriously wrong for anybody in this House to even appear to try to dismiss that as being just so much gadgetry, because better communications, instant access to information, instant crime reporting, instant access to memory banks in relation to incidents, types of crime, types of criminal, suspect vehicles &mdash; all of that is of direct and immediate assistance to the ordinary garda or detective garda who is doing his job out on the streets or wherever <Col N="1834" /> he happens to be.  All of it is necessary; and I am glad to be able to say that we have over the last few years &mdash; and I fully recognise that it did not start just at the end of 1982 &mdash; been able to provide our Garda with those facilities.</P>
    <P>The computer system, for example, and the new facilities we have provided for the Garda, have not reached anything like their full potential yet.  It became live last February and will be a very valuable tool to the ordinary garda on the beat or in a patrol car.  It will help the Garda to respond more quickly to situations that arise.  Just as importants as that, it will help the Garda in crime prevention.  Those of us who talk to gardaí, as most of us do in a helpful way and in present circumstances, know that the ordinary garda on the beat or on patrol is very concerned with crime prevention.  We know that a garda policing an area that he is familiar with will spot things that seem to be a bit out of kilter and if he can find an answer to a question that comes into his mind if he sees something out of the ordinary &mdash; and he can be helped to do so by the kind of communications and data processing system we have &mdash; that is going to help that garda in crime prevention.  That has been provided and it is only right that we should record in the House that that is so.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to go in detail into aspects of the Criminal Justice Act which would be of assistance to the Garda except perhaps to remind Deputy Briscoe that the Criminal Justice Act substantially increased the penalties for conviction of offences involving firearms.  I can assure the House &mdash; and Deputy Briscoe knows this perfectly well &mdash; that I fully share his abhorrence of that particular type of crime and an concerned to ensure that all possible measures are taken to combat it and stamp it out.</P>
    <P>We have made changes in trial procedures. For example, an accused person is now required to give advance notice of any alibi he intends to put forward in a jury trial.  We have introduced provision for majority verdicts in criminal trials. The right to make an unsworn statement has been abolished.  New procedures to <Col N="1835" /> allow proof by written statement and formal admissions in trials saves court time previously taken up in formally proving matters that are not really in dispute and also &mdash; and this is another important part of it &mdash; frees greater number of gardaí to deal with crime on the streets instead of requiring them to attend in court for unnecessarily long periods.  We also have the new provision which provides that any sentence for an offence committed while on bail should be consecutive on any other sentence passed.  I am not in a position yet to respond to Deputy Briscoe's question about how effective that provision is seen to be.  I believe, and obviously the House believes, that that was an important measure and it will be monitored to see if we can identify any effect from it.</P>
    <P>The level of serious crime in our society over the past decade has emerged as a major cause of public concern.  There is no doubt about that.  Between 1977 and 1981 the level of indictable crime rose by 42 per cent.  That increase continued in 1982 and 1983 but at a lower rate &mdash; about 9 per cent and 5 per cent, respectively, in those years.  In 1984, for the first time in six years, national serious crime figures actually decreased by 2.6 per cent.  In 1985 that downward trend not only continued but accelerated, with a reduction of 8½ per cent and the indications so far this year, I am glad to say, are that that trend is being maintained.</P>
    <P>Some of my friends on the other side of the House seem to have some difficulty in accepting those statistics.  Of course, they had no difficulty whatsoever in accepting the figures when crime was rising.  I ask them, in the name of their own role in our society as the Opposition &mdash; and long may they continue to be the Opposition &mdash; to recognise the facts.  Let us not waste the time of this House in going over and over again all these old, spurious allegations about cut-backs in Garda overtime, Garda presence, crime statistics.  If we are to spend time, as indeed we should, in speaking about <Col N="1836" /> these matters, let us have a real discussion on ways to make our whole machinery for law enforcement more efficient for doing the job.  Let us not be afraid. If that requires us to be a little more discriminating about the way we spend money, I ask Deputies opposite to have the guts to realise that, if one is to be more efficient about something, one will divert money from one purpose to another.  Let us not go around puking and mewling about a little change that has not been made in a little part of the total resources made available.  Let us not waste our time with this kind of nonsense.</P>

I must be living in a different country from him, or perhaps it is that I am more in touch with my constituents, or that my constituency is a very different constituency from his.

      <P>The problems have been magnified.  The same applies in the Department of Justice.  I shall quote facts and publications and let the Minister deny them if he wishes.  The <i>Irish Independent</i> of 11 June 1986 published a report in which a spokesman for the Department of Justice is quoted as saying there is no cut in Garda overtime.  All the evidence available at the time when that statement was made and the overwhelming amount of evidence that has since become available demonstrate that that statement is a blatant untruth and I am sorry to have to say that.  I shall say it outside as well as inside the House.  We have all been in touch with the Garda. We do not come in here irresponsibly and talk off the tops of our head.  We do our research and talk to the people involved, who are the subject of these debates. Every single member of the Garda Síochána with whom I have consulted on this topic has told me that there is a substantial reduction in the amount of overtime being worked by the Garda since the early months of this year.  If time permits, I shall quote some figures to demonstrate that.  If it is true &mdash; and I am saying it is &mdash; it shows a peculiar sense of priorities on the part of this Government.  They are prepared to spend in excess of £61 million on trying to introduce divorce into this country, to spend countless millions of pounds topping up some financial institutions and to make grandiose gestures in London and spend millions of pounds&mdash;&mdash;</P>

At the end of March and beginning of April, only a quarter way through the year, £5.3 million was left to be spent &mdash; in other words, 40 per cent of the money in 75 per cent of the year.

      <P>These undoubted cut-backs on Garda overtime over the past few months have led to several extraordinary consequences.  First, they led to a severe restriction in late night Garda patrols in Dublin.  That is a fact.  On Wednesday, 11 June the <i>Irish Independent</i>&mdash; which the Minister agrees with when it suits him &mdash; reported that Dublin city was left without its crime task force for two nights in that week alone.  Normally ten Garda patrol cars provide the vital back-up for the Garda stations and the gardaí on the beat in the greater Dublin area.  That report of 11 June goes on to state that that was the first time in 15 years that had taken place.  It was the first time gardaí who would be assigned to the task force were ordered to go on their normal rosters.  Yet, according to the Minister there is no cut-back and no problem.</P>
      <P>A senior member of the Garda has been quoted as stating that if the Government begin to attack this special task force then the link between the ordinary Garda patrols and their back-up is broken.  I have also been informed by sources within the Garda that on Sundays the special task force normally has seven patrol cars allocated to it.  For the past month or six weeks this has been reduced to one.  I would like to hear the Minister's comments on that.  According to the Minister there is no cutback and no problem.  There are other areas in which this has begun to make itself very manifest &mdash; for instance, in the forensic areas of Garda activity.  On 3 June there was a report in page 5 of the <i>Irish Independent</i> by a Mr. Michael Lavery.  The Minister can doubt the veracity of Mr. Lavery's comments if he wishes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>Mr. Lavery stated that about 90 Garda Technical Bureau staff went on duty on the bank holiday, the day before the report was written.  Listen to it now, you will not be here much longer to hear debates here.  Only nine of those 90 gardaí had been rostered for duty by the chief superintendent in <Col N="1842" /> charge of the area, Mr. John Moore.  One member of the staff who turned up that day is quoted as saying that if they had not turned up &mdash; and I am quoting directly &mdash;&ldquo;there would have been no one to go out to the convent fire and to the pub explosion.&rdquo;  He was referring, of course, to the tragedy at the Loreto Convent at St. Stephen's Green where six people lost their lives and to the pub explosion in Talbot Street.  That garda went on to state: &ldquo;We felt that it was in the interests of the public that we should turn up and work the normal holiday complement as we had for the past ten years&rdquo;.  For the first time in ten years this was cut out, and then we are told that there is no cut-back in Garda overtime and that there is no problem.</P>
      <P>I have had numerous reports from members of the Garda of the effect of those cutbacks in the fingerprints area, criminal records, photography and radio workshop areas of the Garda Technical Bureau.  There were problems relating to the delay and presentation of criminal proceedings and books of evidence.  I have ample information from the Garda about those matters.  I can get them to write to me if the Minister wishes.  I can bring their statements into this House and read them here.</P>

      <P>The Garda are not able to keep their vehicles in proper repair.  It has now become clear that many gardaí, even those in the special task force and <Col N="1843" /> the special detective unit, are using vehicles with over 85,000 miles on the engine. Most of those are on the road 24 hours a day.  Cut-backs in the Garda depot and in the time available to mechanics to keep those vehicles roadworthy are disastrous in the present environment.  There is a report in <i>The Garda Review</i> of April 1986 by the editor which states that he went to the Garda depot and asked one of the mechanics to check out one of the cars. The mechanic's report stated that the back axle was falling out and the clutch and brakes were about to go.  We are back to the era of the Keystone Cops.  It would be funny if it was not so tragic.</P>

      <P>That was when Mr. Cosgrave was in power.  In January of this year 15 Garda cars were taken off the road and 15 replacements were requisitioned. By May of this year those 15 replacements had not materialised.  I ask the Minister for Justice or the Minister of State at that Department if those 15 cars have been produced yet?  In addition to those quite foreseeable effects of those undoubted cut-backs in Garda overtime, there are a number of unforeseen effects. For example, the Association of Criminal Lawyers recently reported that the operation of some of the District Courts throughout the country is in chaos.  I have some experience of this.  It appears that prisoners' applications for bail are being delayed and apparently charge sheets have gone astray.  The reason is that gardaí who normally work the courts cannot now work on Saturdays because of the overtime cut-back.  Ordinary gardaí on the beat are rostered for Saturdays. The gardaí who are now coming in to take over some of the court work and the charge sheets have no experience whatsoever in this area.  Consequently, prisoners' applications for bail and other incidental matters are being interfered <Col N="1844" /> with.  This matter was brought to the attention of the Minister for Justice on three or four occasions by the Association of Criminal Lawyers and the Prisoners' Rights Association.  I am now bringing it to his attention and I hope something can be done about it.</P>
      <P>I was informed as late as today that the radio control unit of Dublin Castle have decided to cut their six weeks training programme to two weeks.  Yet we are told that there is no cut-back and there is no problem.  Garda cut-backs will also affect major sporting features.  In some parts of the country there is conflict between the Commissioner and the local superintendent.  I was in touch with two superintendents today who said that it is their belief that they have no right to bring gardaí in on overtime to cover major sporting features such as the all-Ireland, the Munster final or the Ulster final.  The Commissioner has not said yea or nay.  He is inclined to cloud the issue. I want the Minister to state if superintendents have the right from here on in to bring in gardaí on overtime for major sporting fixtures such as these.</P>

Many rural stations are in imminent danger of closing down.  The radio communication centre at Portlaoise is not manned as well as heretofore.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I was referring to section 4 and the proportion of the proceeds, 40 per cent, to be distributed in prizes.  We regard that as far too low and we ask the Minister of State why it could not be increased to at least 50 per cent.  On administration costs, I asked earlier if there would be elaborate headquarters. I do not believe the An Post subsidiary who will be running the lottery should have elaborate offices and be based in Dublin like most semi-State bodies.  I hope the office will be a rather simple one and that it will be located outside Dublin.</P>
      <P>Section 14 provides that there shall be seven directors, four to be appointed by the company with the Minister authorising the appointment of the chairman and nominating the three remaining directorships. Why not let the company deal with the entire question?  The present formula seems to be very political.</P>
      <P>The lottery will be very important.  I pointed out earlier the difficulties that organised voluntary bodies have in raising funds.  Many of them go from house to house to raise funds.  To be successful, any lottery must have the loyalty of subscribers and it has to be promoted through the media, especially RTE, and I suggest that a suitable time for RTE promotion would be Sunday evening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I repeat that I am disappointed at the way the Bill has been introduced.  In his opening remarks the Minister told us of the beneficiaries he had in mind, but he was very vague.  He used the word &ldquo;flexibility&rdquo;, which I do not accept.  We <Col N="1846" /> want to know exactly how the lottery will operate so that it will be of benefit to sporting organisations.  I understood that was why the lottery was being introduced. I regret that the Bill is so vague and I hope the Minister will give us the information requested.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and I am sorry Deputies opposite have made this into a sour grapes issue.  The purpose of the Bill is to improve the lot of those participating in sport and other recreational facilities, the Irish language, the arts and health.  This new source of money being tapped by the Government will be of benefit to all the community.  I know very well there are people in the Opposition benches who had major associations with sport.  Indeed, it has been a contributory factor in their political lives.  The former Taoiseach, Jack Lynch, made a major contribution to the political life of the country and to sport.</P>
      <P>Through this Bill the Government are trying to provide funds for sport.  Why, therefore, should the Opposition take the stance they have been exhibiting here? Why should they change their spots now? When they were in Government they never tied themselves down to specific arguments like those they are now making.  I thought they would welcome this with open arms.  The Leader of the Opposition has displayed a keen interest in sport.  He has been associated with national clubs like St. Vincent's in Dublin.  He has seen fit to sponsor in my constituency the Charlie Haughey Soccer Club and he has owned racehorses.  Why then have his party chosen to oppose the Bill?  Apparently Fianna Fáil have adopted a national strategy to depress the Irish people and if they cannot continue to depress them there is something wrong.  They had a little victory the other day: they did their little sums behind closed doors and had a &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote whispering campaign.  It was successful, but they did not come in here beating their chests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nevertheless, they are going around now saying the Government cannot last very long.  Deputy Haughey has been <Col N="1847" /> talking about a general election next October.  Why does he want to deny the sporting fraternity a little money in 1986 or 1987?  Why does he want to depress employment in An Post?  Why does he not do the decent thing and support the Bill?  The Bill will contribute funds to organisations which need them.  I heard Deputies opposite complaining about lack of funding for sport.  Deputy Keating, now in the Progressive Democrats, is a former Minister with responsibility for sport and at that time he provided a grant-in-aid of £25,000 for a recreation facility in my home village.  It is admired nationally.</P>
    <P>The Government should invest most of the profits from the national lottery in sport as it has major problems.  I appreciate that the other beneficiaries such as the Irish language and the arts are important. I support the Deputies who spoke about them but sport, recreational facilities and health are all tied together. Despite what Deputy Kitt said, the Government have put substantial funds into sport.  When Deputy Creed was Minister with responsibility for sport he put plenty of money into the promotion of this facet of Irish life.</P>
    <P>Over the past 18 months in County Clare the youth employment scheme has given £200,000 to the GAA for sports fields.  That is not too small a sum.  It is a significant gesture to the people of County Clare.  We will not win the All-Ireland, but at least we are improving. We have won two matches this year in the Munster Championships and we are going to Killarney with a reasonable hope that we might win a niche for ourselves in the hurling annals of Munster.  The contribution made by the Government and the confidence they placed in the GAA in County Clare was a very big gesture.  I refute the claims made by Deputy Kitt that the Government have not put money into sport.</P>
    <P>Deputy Creed in his period as Minister with responsibility for sport travelled to every constituency and county in Ireland. He can vouch for the amount of money which was put into sport.  In this Bill, we <Col N="1848" /> have an opportunity to expand it further. It is irresponsible of Fianna Fáil to come into this House and oppose this Bill.  It is playing a meddling political role.  As I said earlier, the object of the exercise is to keep the people ignorant, say the Government are not capable of doing anything and keep the depression going. Be like the bad weather, have a bad depression and you are bound to succeed. The people will not be fooled by that. Certainly, the sporting people of my constituency will not be fooled by the spurious objections which the Opposition have to this Bill.</P>
    <P>Perhaps, reasonable points are being made by the Opposition regarding how the money should be divided and whether there should be specific references and percentages inserted into the Bill. Deputy Yates wanted sport, voluntary charities, the arts and youth on a <i>pro rata</i> 25 per cent.  I am not certain I would agree with that.  I know this much: when the Government get the opportunity to distribute the funds they will have a very difficult task.  As Deputy Creed pointed out, the lottery will help sport.  There are 64 national sporting bodies catering for 1.4 million individual units.</P>
    <P>Therefore, are the Opposition saying the Minister should insert specific categories into this Bill to deny individual units access to it, give them grants which will be so small as to be insignificant? They should have been objective when they decided to oppose this Bill.  If they had put down an amendment or two they might have been acting positively.  I resent totally their attitude especially that of their Leader, Deputy Haughey, who is a sporting man.  It would be wrong to criticise Government actions on the provision of sporting and recreational facilities on a rural versus urban bias.  We have to be generous and say that the urban areas should be given a priority in the provision of sporting facilities.  After all, housing policies have not been generous in providing open spaces.  There is a need to give young adults an opportunity to engage in sports.  In my constituency, we have a serious problem.  In the new <Col N="1849" /> town of Shannon there are no recreational facilities, especially an indoor facility.  At present, a group of individuals are trying to raise substantial funds to complete a project which will cost at least £250,000.  That type of facility and the imagination behind the proposal will benefit the youth of Shannon.  When the proceeds of the national lottery are allocated we will have to emphasise sport, recreational facilities and health.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister on the expeditious way in which he brought this Bill into the House.  I would like to see the matter concluded very quickly.  There are more urgent things to be discussed.  The city of Dublin has to do without certain firm proposals the Minister for the Environment wanted to make for the improvement of Dublin because of Fianna Fáil expediency.  I commend the Minister on introducing this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am calling on the Minister at 9.10 p.m.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend to take little of the time and I am grateful for the chance of getting in.  There is no basis for opposing the principle of the national lottery. I welcome its introduction as affording people a choice.  I want to make three basic observations.  As somebody who was involved at the very beginning of the proposal for the development of this concept in the Department of Education where I had the pleasure of serving for a short time, I think we have an ideal opportunity to learn from the experiences of other countries.  I argue very strongly that it is important to educate people on the wise use of the potential of the lottery. Many of us have some reservations about open ended gambling but, on balance, people should have the right to choose.  I hope in due course responsible use of the lottery will help people to be <Col N="1850" /> entertained and yield revenue which will be useful for worthy causes.</P>
      <P>Secondly, I want to make the point that a principle which I hold dear is that we should not set up a new institution unless we have shown there is no existing corporation or institution which can cope with the principle we are introducing.  I made a few inquiries about the prize bonds scheme, a scheme which is almost a Cinderella in the sense that it is totally unsung, quite unglamorous, never marketed and, as far as I can judge, never gets the slightest bit of attention from anybody.  I discovered that the prize bonds scheme offers potential for the principle of a lottery to be developed within it.  I wonder whether the Minister has given any consideration to whether or not the revamping of the prize bonds scheme or the introduction of a comprehensive new, fresh and dynamic launch to the prize bonds scheme might offset the need to establish a new organisation. I was made aware that the prize bonds scheme has extraordinary potential, is very popular, is seen to be part of the State apparatus, even though it is not, and is approved of by the general populace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the same time I was disappointed to learn that there is no marketing of the prize bonds scheme.  It does not have an advertising budget and the staff do not have the power to sell its advantages. Time does not permit me to go into this matter in any great detail, except to say that this House, instead of just noting the regular publication of the winning tickets, should see this as an area which might offer some potential.  The prize bond service might be relaunched with a whole new marketing approach.  The scheme, first introduced in 1957, is widely accepted and popular.  It does the State a service.  If it became clear that the prize bond scheme could provide an option for people to invest a few shillings &mdash; it could be as little as that under a revamped scheme where people could buy a smaller share of a ticket &mdash; we might find that we do not need to launch a new apparatus. I tried to communicate this view some months ago to those who make the decisions <Col N="1851" /> in these matters but it fell on deaf ears.  I mention it now to the Minister.</P>
    <P>I have looked up the legislation setting up the prize bond scheme and the debates which took place.  There was a definite concept of development but that has not happened.  Not only has the prize bond scheme remained static but it has actually been forgotten about by Government Departments and public representatives. I should like to bring it out from the shade, dust it off and relaunch it.  It might not merely supplement this Bill but could even supplant it.</P>
    <P>Many people have expressed concern recently about gambling excesses.  I take the view that the best answer to this problem is an enlightened, intelligent, educated populace who are selective and discriminating.  If I have any reservations it is that our school curriculum and educational process do not necessarily enlighten people.  Often many of these options for gambling a few shillings are a form of exploitation.  I should like to see an enlightened educational approach to that issue, but not one that would stop people having the right to invest.  Many people in this House like the occasional gamble but that does not mean they are gamblers or that they suffer from an addiction.  There are, however, people in the latter category who do need our consideration.  The Minister, in the marketing of his scheme, should bear in mind those who are vulnerable and might find themselves, unconsciously or otherwise, robbed of their housekeeping money. Nobody wants that, but the problem can be avoided if the scheme is properly marketed. We should guard against excesses and take action in that respect, but that is not a reason for not affording people the right to exercise this option.</P>
    <P>I have heard much about competition by various people to control the running of this lottery but I do not wish to comment. I wish the scheme luck and success and I hope it gets off the ground.  The Minister might do me the honour of considering what I have said about the prize bond scheme which, properly handled, <Col N="1852" /> might obviate the need for a national lottery.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankPrendergast" hpid="Mr. Prendergast Mr. Prendergast">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Prendergast</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Nolan for allowing me five minutes of his time to make a few brief comments.  I welcome the Bill.  In so far as it is designed to support sport, it will be welcomed by the whole nation and by the local authorities.</P>
      <P>There is much discussion about the location of a national sporting centre and I believe that the Thomond region has an unanswerable case.  The Thomond College of Education has unrivalled facilities in physical terms, as well as the most competent and highly trained professional staff.  This would require the least investment by the State.  I hope that objective criteria will be applied in the selection of location of this centre.  I have no doubt that on its merits the case for Thomond College will be outstanding.</P>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to withdraw that section of the Bill where it is intended to interfere with the normal industrial relations process for the negotiation of wages, salaries and conditions.  This is a foolish, short-sighted and unwarranted intervention by the Government of the day in the normal industrial relations procedures. Semi-State bodies were established for two principal reasons.  In some areas of national importance private commercial concerns were unable or unwilling to promote undertakings and activities which were seen to be vital to the industrial and social fabric of the nation.  Semi-State bodies were also established at a remove from the Civil Service in order that they could have the necessary freedom to develop with commercial and industrial businesses at home and abroad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These bodies could not successfully operate as part of the Civil Service.  They would be put off completely by the red tape and the moribund methods that we normally associate with the Civil Service, not just in this country but in every nation.  I would ask the Minister to act as he has already agreed to do in the case of CIE and in the Harbours Bill and <Col N="1853" /> remove that intention to lay down guidelines for movements of pay and working conditions.  The trade unions are not unpatriotic subversive organisations.  In spite of the impression often wrongly given by the media, they do take account of the national situation at any given time.  This is effectively proved by the fact that in the last four national wage agreements union members lost out <i>vis-á-vis</i> the consumer price index.</P>
    <P>I understand that the funds from this lottery are to be devoted to the Irish language.  As someone who has devoted all his life to the promotion, expansion and development of the Irish language, I am aghast at that proposal.  It is an insult that the funding of our first and major national language, which, with Welsh, is the oldest in the entire Continent of Europe, should be more or less dependent on a game of chance.  Will the Minister explain the thinking behind this? There should be a more definite provision for the development of the Irish language. What proportion of the money will be devoted to the development of the Irish language and how will it be applied?  I am aghast at this whole idea. It seems to trivialise the Government's approach, although I accept that that is not the position.  This is the first Government to establish a Comhchoiste for the Irish language in this House since the foundation of the State and that is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>People are concerned that An Post have not been designated as the appropriate company to run the national lottery. The Minister was queried about this on a radio programme on Saturday morning and he was evasive.  Normally, he is not an evasive person and I am not attributing any ulterior motive to him because there may be good reasons for the reluctance by the Government to nominate a particular company.  I suggest that the Minister should nominate An Post, a very professional, competent and thorough organisation that is as good as any similar company in Europe or anywhere in the world.  The company is competent to deal with the demands of a national lottery. Unless the Minister has some serious and <Col N="1854" /> practical objection he should name An Post as the body to run the national lottery. I understand from their spokesman, unless I am gravely mistaken, that they are prepared to undertake this duty as part of their normal day's work.  That should mean a huge saving to the whole fund because if another company was to undertake the work and draw salaries and administration expenses the amount for distribution to sport, and <i>inter alia</i> the Irish language, would be considerably reduced.  I am grateful to Deputy Nolan for his kindness.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MJNolan" hpid="Mr. Nolan Mr. Nolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate.  Initially we welcomed the proposal to run a national lottery but many essential provisions have not been included in the Bill.  It is obvious that the text of the Bill has been changed a good deal over the years. Fianna Fáil first mooted a national lottery but we did not have time to introduce it in our term of office.  Deputy Creed, as Minister of State, supported the idea of such a lottery.  I was heartened to hear his comments about the Bill and pleased to hear his proposals for a lottery.  It is unfortunate that Deputy Carey is not present to hear Fianna Fáil speakers outline their concern about aspects of the legislation.</P>
      <P>We are not convinced that the proceeds of the fund will go to sporting and cultural bodies.  Heretofore it was intended that the lottery would establish a line of funding for our sporting organisations and we are not happy that the funding of certain voluntary organisations will not be affected by the lottery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole question of leisure time activity has been highlighted in recent times mainly because 50 per cent of our population are under the age of 25.  Our level of unemployment is the highest in the history of the State and most of those affected are under 25.  It is because of the level of unemployment that people have suggested that we should consider leisure time activities.  In the referendum last week the Government's proposal was heavily defeated and I understand that leisure time activity was mentioned in the <Col N="1855" /> course of that debate.  Young married men and women who may not have worked since they left school at 18 years of age reached the stage where they are upset at the thought of not having a prospect of a job.  Those young people must have some outlet and leisure time activity is one.  When the Government decided to run a national lottery I was pleased because I felt the funds from it could be used to provide facilities for sporting organisations.  However, last week the Minister of State, Deputy Nealon, outlined in no uncertain terms that the proceeds of the lottery should be devoted to the area of arts and culture.  I disagree with his suggestions.  The proceeds should be orientated more towards the area of sport.</P>
    <P>In a debate of this kind it is only fair to pay tribute to the GAA for the great work they have done for our youth down the years but I am concerned that the work of that organisation will be affected by the lottery.  It is not possible to calculate the amount of work being done by that organisation in the areas of sport and culture.  I understand that state lotteries are run in more than 80 countries.  One reason why I would like to see a national lottery here is that it may halt the flow of money on British football pools.  We have been told that the purpose of the lottery is to generate surplus funds that will benefit the community in a number of ways, but the Government have failed to specify how the money will be spent.  I regret that the Government have not announced that all the surplus funds from the lottery will be given to sporting and cultural organisations.  The proceeds from national lotteries in other countries have been spent in many different ways and I was under the impression that the surplus funds from our lottery could go to sporting bodies.  I regret that that will not be the case.  We have been told that 40 per cent of the gross receipts will be returned in prize money and I should like to know if it is expected that administration will account for the remaining 60 per cent or if any profit earned will go to central funds.  We do not have any guarantee <Col N="1856" /> that the surplus funds will be spent in the areas of culture and sport and that is regrettable.  If we had been given such a guarantee Fianna Fáil would have adopted a different attitude.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankPrendergast" hpid="Mr. Prendergast Mr. Prendergast">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to compliment the Deputy on his remarks in regard to the Irish language.  I admit that it is an area that needs a lot of attention by the Government and I support the Deputy in his call for more funds for the promotion of the language.  The Government have told us that an independent scrutineer will be appointed to ensure that there is not any fraud on the part of the agency given the task of running the lottery.  Why is there a need for an independent scrutineer? Do we not have enough confidence in the auditors in the different Departments? We reject the Government's proposal because we are not happy that the surplus funding of the national lottery will go towards the purposes we would like, namely, for cultural and sporting purposes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Public Service (Mr. J. O'Keeffe)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have followed this debate with considerable interest and I want to thank Deputies on all sides of the House for their contributions. The number and length of these contributions is an indication of the lively interest in this measure.  A number of points were made which I want to address specifically.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First, there was the question of a reference to An Post in the text of the Bill.  I would point out that this will be enabling legislation.  It will enable the Minister for Finance to appoint a licensee who will operate the national lottery on his behalf. It is neither necessary nor appropriate that the Bill should identify the first or any licensee.  Indeed, since the Bill contains a number of conditions precedent to the award of a licence, such as that which requires the conclusion of satisfactory <Col N="1857" /> terms between the Minister and the prospective licensee, it would be anomalous if the Bill were to specify who the licensee were to be.  I am happy to say that arrangements with An Post to run the lottery through a subsidiary specially to be established for the purpose are proceeding satisfactorily and I have no doubt that these arrangements will be brought to a successful conclusion after enactment. They cannot be brought to a conclusion until after enactment.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies on both sides of the House have expressed concern that the purposes for which the national lottery's surpluses are to be applied are not specified in the Bill.  I can reassure Deputies that there is no intention to use lottery funds for general Government purposes.  All the proceeds, after expenses and prizes are met, will be devoted to beneficial uses as already announced by the Government.  However, in the light of the views expressed from all sides of the House, I am proposing to introduce an amendment to section 5, the relevant section of the Bill, which will be more specific as to the purposes for which lottery funds will be used.  These purposes as already announced by the Government are sport and recreation, national culture including the Irish language, the arts and health.  There will, of course, also be provision to extend the list of purposes, should the Government so decide.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankPrendergast" hpid="Mr. Prendergast Mr. Prendergast">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Prendergast</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister explain what it is proposed to do in respect to the Irish language?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am coming to the point made by the Deputy.  Knowing his strong interest in the Irish language, I was a little surprised at the point he made. Any funding will be additional to existing State funding in support of the Irish language.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankPrendergast" hpid="Mr. Prendergast Mr. Prendergast">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Prendergast</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the interest of Deputy Prendergast in the Irish language. It would be rather remiss if we included arts and culture and ignored the Irish language.  However, there need be no fears among Deputies that this will allow the lottery funds to be subsumed or absorbed into general public expenditure purposes.  Any addition to the list of purposes to be contained in the Bill will have to be published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i>.  Moreover, through the process of allocation of funds proposed, this House will have the opportunity to consider all the purposes for which the funds are used and the entire proceeds of the lottery will be accounted for in a completely visible manner.  The legislation needs to allow for extension of the purposes in order to cater, for example, for arrangements which may become necessary in relation to existing charitable and voluntary lotteries when the national lottery becomes operational and also to allow the Government flexibility to meet other beneficial community purposes which may arise in future without having to amend the Act.</P>
      <P>As to specific percentages being spelled out, this would introduce an unwarranted degree of rigidity into the Bill and would not be appropriate.  Although a possible surplus, after payment of expenses and prize money, of £10 million has been estimated, we cannot as yet be certain how much the lottery will earn and what the pattern of that income will be.  To specify such percentages in the Bill would, therefore, to a degree, be working in the dark and worse, it could raise false hopes on the part of prospective beneficiaries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to refer now to those voluntary and charitable bodies who run lotteries and who may be fearful of the effects of the national lottery on their fund raising.  As I said in my opening <Col N="1859" /> speech, there have been extensive discussions between a number of such bodies and officials of the Departments of Finance and Justice with a view to ensuring the viability of existing charitable and voluntary lotteries after the national lottery commences.</P>
    <P>Specific measures are being provided in the Bill to give these bodies a greater chance to compete.  Section 34 will enable the Minister for Justice to improve the prize limits at present specified in the Gaming and Lotteries Act, 1956, for lotteries operated under Garda permit or licence from the District Court and also will exempt such lotteries from the restrictions on advertising and publicity set out in section 22 of that Act.  I am in a position to state that the Minister for Justice has in contemplation new prize limits of the order of £3,000 for lotteries under permit and £10,000 for lotteries under licence.  I believe strongly that these measures will provide adequate opportunity to those bodies concerned to compete successfully with the national lottery.</P>
    <P>It must also be borne in mind that most subscribers of lotteries run by charities or voluntary bodies do so to support the charity involved and not for the prizes offered.  I believe that the start of the national lottery will not seriously diminish this loyalty, which is rooted in a deep appreciation of the excellent work which charitable and voluntary bodies undertake in our community.</P>
    <P>Only time will tell how, if at all, the national lottery will affect the situation of these bodies who hold existing periodical lotteries.  However, I have already given an assurance on this point.  I am stating clearly that where such bodies can demonstrate satisfactorily that the lottery has adversely affected their receipts the Government are prepared to take steps to make funding available to them from the lottery's surplus.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankPrendergast" hpid="Mr. Prendergast Mr. Prendergast">

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>In the circumstances, I had better continue.  I hope we will deal with Committee Stage tomorrow and there will be an opportunity for further discussion on that point.  To conclude on this aspect of the Bill, I regret to say that there appears to be some misunderstanding about the participation of charities or voluntary bodies in selling tickets for the national lottery.  Such participation would not be consistent with the intention to support, not to supplant, existing charitable fund raising.  Moreover, the best technical advice indicates that sales outlets should be fixed retail business locations which will have to satisfy a number of criteria from a business and security point of view.</P>
      <P>On a minor point, I was surprised to hear Deputy O'Kennedy express astonishment at the, to him, novel aspect of section 35, which provides for the alteration of provisions of the Bill by regulation for a period of two years after enactment. This, as I am sure he realises, is purely a technical measure and could not be used to alter substantively the provisions of the Bill.  It is merely a prudent measure in legislation dealing with an innovation of some technical complexity such as the national lottery represents.  I have to point out that there are precedents going back over many years, the latest being section 25 of the Farm Tax Act of 1985. On another point, raised by Deputy O'Rourke, concerning the use of electronic equipment in the national lottery, I have had this looked into but it would seem since the present Bill exempts the national lottery from the Gaming and Lotteries Acts, a problem does not arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to my proposals on section 5, I might mention at this stage that a number of minor drafting and presentational aspects of the Bill have come to my notice and with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle I shall be introducing a number of amendments to cover these during the Committee Stage.  With the exception of section 15, which I am proposing to delete from the Bill, these <Col N="1861" /> minor amendments in no way change the sense or intent of the Bill.  I propose to put down an amendment to delete section 15.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I will explain my thinking on this point on Committee Stage.  This point has been raised by Deputies on both sides of the House.  The deletion of section 15 has been decided in consultation with the Minister for the Public Service.  There have been calls, again on both sides of the House, for all or a large proportion of the lottery funds to be devoted to sport alone.  I understand the enthusiasm of the proponents of this point of view.  Deputy Creed, who deservedly received tributes from all sides of the House for his dedicated commitment to the establishment of the lottery, made an eloquent plea on behalf of sporting bodies.  I can reassure him that the proportion of lottery finds to be devoted to sport will be significant.  The needs of sport were very much to the fore in the Government thinking when drawing up plans for the lottery.  I am convinced that we will see in due course substantial support from the lottery funds for the projects Deputy Creed had intended in the sporting area.  A strong case has also been made for funding for the arts and national culture.  There have also been calls to support various other causes including those charitable and voluntary organisations which operate in the health area. The areas identified by the Government <Col N="1862" /> to benefit from the national lottery represent a balance of deserving causes to be given assistance from the lottery.</P>
      <P>Deputy Liam Skelly made a substantial intervention in this debate.  I would like to comment in relation to two matters which I know to be of considerable interest to him.  First, he referred to the possible ill effects of lotteries, through encouraging young people to gamble, absorbing an excessive amount of people's money and so on.  It is important to recognise a distinction between lotteries and gambling.  We have of course had gambling in a number of forms in this country for many years.  In fact in 1983 we spent more than £200 million as a nation in on and off course betting. Experience elsewhere in the world has shown that State lotteries are regarded as a harmless form of legalised gambling.</P>
      <P>A recent UK Home Office study on gambling concluded that there was evidence to show that lotteries and pools which provide a natural limit on participation &ldquo;are unlikely to be a significant potential danger to the participant&rdquo;. Apart from this, I think all Deputies recognise and a number have welcomed this, that the Minister for Finance who will ultimately be responsible for the national lottery is given in this Bill extensive controls to regulate the lottery and if necessary to intervene to prevent any undesirable ill effects such as might for example arise through excessive promotion of lottery ticket sales.  This covers one of the main points raised also by Deputy Keating.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Keating had some interesting suggestions in regard to the development of the prize bond scheme.  Unfortunately time did not allow him to develop fully the point and in the circumstances my reaction has to be similarly brief.  The fundamental rationale of the prize bond scheme is to promote savings.  I am not sure that this scheme would be the best vehicle through which the objectives we have in mind for the lottery could be achieved.  On the other hand, I take on board as a separate item the point made about the revitalisation of the prize bond scheme and I will arrange to have the <Col N="1863" /> views expressed by Deputy Keating looked into.</P>
    <P>Secondly, Deputy Skelly and others were interested in ensuring that the maximum benefit for Irish Industry accrues from the establishment of the national lottery.  I can assure them that the Government are fully conscious of the need for maximum benefit to the country in terms of jobs and purchases.  The board of the Lottery Company will I know be aware of and take fully into account the need to ensure that Irish firms reap the maximum benefit from this new venture.</P>
    <P>Unlike some sorts of fund raising that exist at present, in which the proportion of total proceeds going to benefit the named purpose of the fund raising can be very small, there will be full transparency in relation to the operation of the national lottery.  The public will know precisely how much is collected and where it is spent.  In deciding on the areas to benefit, the Government were conscious of all <Col N="1864" /> these deserving purposes which will now be spelled out in the Bill.  The amounts they will receive will be decided in due course and all the interests will have an opportunity to be heard during the allocation process.</P>
    <P>First, however, we must get the lottery established.  It will take up to six months after the passage of this Bill to complete all the complex arrangements that have to be made before the first tickets can go on sale and the lottery begins to generate revenue.  I know that the majority of Members of this House, and indeed the public generally, are anxious to see this happen as soon as possible and I conclude by urging Deputies to help to speed the passage of the Bill so that all the beneficial community purposes that have been mentioned can begin to enjoy its fruits as soon as possible.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 1 stand part of the Bill&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 1 sets out the interpretation applying to the Bill and it says that its purpose is to amend the scheme of compensation for malicious damage to property contained in the Malicious Injuries Act, 1981, to confine awards of compensation to damage caused by riot and activities of unlawful organisations.</P>
      <P>The Act referred to is the Malicious Injuries Act, 1981, which provides for compensation for malicious damage to property and for loss of property unlawfully taken as a result of various malicious acts.  The 1981 Act is very widely used especially now when crime levels are so high.  We are opposed to the Bill and to the steps taken by the Government in relation to the 1981 Act.  This Act provides compensation for malicious damage to property and for loss of property where the aggregate amount of damage exceeds £100.  The Government are now proposing that the 1981 Act should be taken in conjunction with this Bill which is very restrictive because it confines compensation to very limited circumstances which are set out in the Bill.</P>
      <P>Could the Minister give details in relation to expenditure under the 1981 Act for the past five years or so?</P>

      <P>In 1980, the total cost amounted to £6.139 million; in 1981, <Col N="1867" /> it was £8.468 million; in 1982, it was £9.972 million; in 1983, it was £13.664 million; in 1984, it was £17.347 million; and in 1985 it amounted to £20 million.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the estimated figure for 1986?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is just under £20 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>From the figures which the Minister has given it can be seen that expenditure in this area has increased from about £10 million in 1982 to £20 million in 1985.  Expenditure has doubled since 1982 and, presumably, this is why the Government want to alter the 1981 Act because it has resulted in an expenditure of £20 million in compensation to the victims of crime.  Indeed on Second Stage the Minister was quite fortright about that and he said that the purpose of the Bill was simply to reduce the impact on the Exchequer.  We can see then why the Minister is planning to do this at this time.  During the period from 1982 to 1985 the cost had doubled from almost £10 million to £20 million per annum and is continuing to rise at more or less the same rate.  Can the Minister tell us what amount of that money was expended in relation to Dublin city and county and in relation to Cork and Limerick, the three major areas principally affected by this Act as it stands at the moment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>Dublin city and county, taken together, represent about 50 per cent of the total claims.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>If I remember rightly, the figure for Dublin city and county came to approximately £13 million which is more than 50 per cent.  These are figures which were put together earlier.  I thought the Minister might have figures available for us tonight so as to make clear to the House the impact of the measures she is proposing.  In reply to a question dated 26 February I was told that the 1985 estimated amounts for Dublin Corporation <Col N="1868" /> and Dublin County Council were £7.898 million and £4.488 million respectively. I discovered later that the actual amount paid in 1985 in the county was £4.7 million as against an estimate at that time of £4.488 million.  This totals roughly £12.5 million for Dublin city and county. Has the Minister got any more accurate figures?  Am I correct in thinking that that is approximately the impact of this Act on Dublin city and county? The Minister has not given us any figures for Cork and Limerick.  My understanding is that this Act is particularly important in Dublin city and county, and in Cork and in Limerick. That is why I wonder if the Minister can tell us just how important it is, in financial terms, to these three major cities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>The figures I quoted to the Deputy are the figures for the whole country.  I do not have individual breakdowns for the regions he mentioned except to say that approximately 50 per cent of the totals are for Dublin city and county.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to point out that that is most unsatisfactory.  The Minister is proposing virtually to wipe out this Act or to maintain only a very small part of it.  I would expect that the Minister, coming into this House with a proposal to abolish this major scheme of compensation for the victims of crime whose property has been damaged &mdash; and that includes schools, community centres, motorists whose cars have been damaged &mdash; would know what she is talking about.  I would be suggesting that the but to approach it in this way I need to know exactly what the effect is.  The Minister says approximately 50 per cent relates to Dublin city and county.  But we know that it is a good deal more than 50 per cent; it is more than £12.5 million for Dublin city and county.  Has the Minister no estimate for Cork and Limerick?  My understanding is that Dublin, Limerick and Cork are the three areas where the impact of this Government decision will <Col N="1869" /> be most felt.  Can the Minister give us any idea of what the position is in Cork?  I appreciate that she has some idea of what the position is in Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not got the exact figures, as I have already said.  I can only give the Deputy approximate figures for Dublin and we are still on the interpretation of section 1 of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not mind if the Minister gives me the figures later.  The point is that I am trying to interpret the impact of this Bill and the Act that we have.  I am talking about the Malicious Injuries Act, 1981, which is the one that we have and which the Government are proposing to change.  It is the impact of this Bill that I am talking about.  Are the Government not concerned about its impact in Cork or Limerick where, as I understand it, the impact will be very considerable? Have the Government no estimate of what the impact will be in these two major cities?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister have these figures available for tomorrow if the debate is due to go on tomorrow morning?  With respect, I would suggest that we really should not be discussing this without realising what this Bill means to the ordinary people in places like Dublin, Cork and Limerick.  We have little option but to go ahead and discuss <Col N="1870" /> this because we know that the Labour Party will line up with Fine Gael and vote down any suggestions we make here &mdash; that seems to be the intention of the Government in this respect.  But we, and people around the country need to know what is happening.  People in Cork, particularly, would like to know what the position will be so I would be grateful if the Minister would give us this information as soon as it is possible to provide it. The Malicious Injuries Act of 1981 has been very important to ordinary citizens who have fallen victims of crime and that is the Act we will be altering.  Once the Government force this measure through the House there will no longer be compensation for the vast majority of people who would normally benefit under the provisions of the Act.  I presume that there is no point at this stage in asking the Minister if she has any idea of the local authority share in the Act at the moment.  The Minister has a global national figure.  Has she the share to be contributed by the local authorities, either nationally or broken down?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">

      <P>First, I was asking about the global expenditure in Dublin, Cork and Limerick.  Subsequently, I was asking about the share under the present legislation for Dublin, Cork and Limerick. Does the Minister know the share paid by the local authorities in those areas?  I take it that she does not have figures for that with her.</P>

      <P>The costs appropriate to local authorities, starting with 1980, are <Col N="1871" /> as follows: 1980, £2.920 million; 1981, £3.689 million; 1982, £4.336 million, 1983, £3.871 million; 1984, £3.671 million; and 1985, £4 million.</P>

      <P>I wish to raise now the question of unlawful organisations.  The interpretation section says that &ldquo;unlawful organisation&rdquo; has the meaning assigned to it by section 18 of the Offences Against the State Act, 1939.  Section 18 of that Act states in Part III &mdash; Unlawful Organisations:</P>
      <P>In order to regulate and control in the public interest the exercise of the constitutional right of citizens to form associations, it is declared that any organisation which&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) engages in, promotes, encourages, or advocates the commission of treason or any activity of a treasonably nature, or</P>
      <P>(b) advocates, encourages, or attempts the procuring by force, violence, or other constitutional means of an alteration in the Constitution, or</P>
      <P>(c) raises or maintains or attempts to raise or maintain a military or armed force in contravention of the Constitution or without constitutional authority, or</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(d) engages in, promotes, encourages, or advocates the commission of any criminal offence or the obstruction of or interference with the administration of justice or the enforcement of the law, or <Col N="1872" /> (e) engages in, promotes, encourages, or advocates the attainment of any particular object, lawful or unlawful, by violent, criminal, or other unlawful means, or</P>
    <P>(f) promotes, encourages, or advocates the non-payment of moneys payable to the Central Fund or any other public fund or the non-payment of local taxation,</P>
    <P>shall be an unlawful organisation within the meaning and for the purposes of this Act and this Act shall apply and have effect in relation to such organisation accordingly.</P>
    <P>That section is being used in relation to this Bill which we have before us.  Could the Minister tell us at this stage what organisations at present would be regarded and listed as such unlawful organisations?</P>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>

      <P>Paragraph (f) in section 18 mentions an organisation which promotes, encourages, or advocates the non-payment of moneys payable to the Central Fund or any other public fund or the non-payment of local taxation.</P>
      <P>Some organisations such as the Association of the Combined Residents Association recommend the non-payment of certain funds.  They advocate the non-payment of moneys payable to the central fund or any other public fund or non-payment of local taxation.  ACRA, for instance, would relate to water charges, ground rents and so on.  Are those organisations included in the Minister's definition?</P>

      <P>It is a rather difficult question.  There is no case law on the definition of unlawful organisation. While one cannot be definite one way or the other as to how the courts might interpret the definition, it might be that the operation of any such organisation would have to affect the security, including the economic security, of the State before it could come within the definition.</P>

      <P>It seems rather odd that this vague term &ldquo;unlawful organisation&rdquo;, which has been used in the Offences Against the State Act, 1939, should be carried forward into this legislation in 1986.  The Minister admitted just now that there is no case law in the definition of unlawful organisation.  I think the debate has illustrated the fact that the term is extremely vague.  I wonder if we could ask the Minister at this stage to have another look at the legislation so that we will know exactly what is involved. We are talking about a whole new code for malicious damages.  This term &ldquo;unlawfull organisation&rdquo; is central to the proposed new code of malicious damages. We would like, as Deputy Woods has asked, a list of what is involved.  We would like some definite idea of what is involved.</P>

      <P>Perhaps the Minister might see if there is any further information available on this section before Report Stage, which is likely to be debated tomorrow morning.  As far as the interpretation is concerned, it sets out fairly clearly the Acts we are dealing with, the Malicious Injuries Act, 1981, and this Act. The Principal Act is the Malicious Injuries Act, 1981.  That is referred to in this Act thereafter as the Principal Act.  That Act is now about to be substantially emasculated and would hardly be a Principal Act once the Government have gone ahead with their intentions.  Finally, the question of the unlawful organisations seems to be left as a residual.  The Government were determined to take away everything else and said &ldquo;We have to cover subversives and the possible activities which could arise in that respect and therefore we will just leave the definition of unlawful organisation&rdquo;, even though that would appear to be a fairly wide definition given what we have read from the 1939 Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as this interpretation section is concerned, I know that we cannot go much further with it at this stage other <Col N="1875" /> than to point out that there will be very little to interpret once the Government go ahead with their intentions.  The Act, which is and will continue to be called, the Malicious Injuries Act will be a very pale shadow of its former self and will have very little to offer to the citizens of the Republic in relation to protection and support in the event of their becoming the victims of criminal attacks.  Their property will no longer be compensated under this Act.  It will become some sort of a mini Act which will only be brought into operation on fairly rare occasions which might arise under the definition of the unlawful organisation.</P>
    <P>Section 1(2)(a) states:</P>
    <P>A reference in the Acts to a section is a reference to a section of the Act in which the reference occurs unless it is indicated that reference to some other enactment is intended.</P>
    <P>I take it that that is purely a technical definition.  Section 1(2)(b) states:</P>
    <P>A reference in the Acts to a subsection, paragraph or subparagraph is a reference to the subsection, paragraph or subparagraph of the provision in which the reference occurs unless it is indicated that reference to some other provision is intended.</P>
    <P>I take it that that also is purely a technical provision.</P>

      <P>When replying to Deputy Woods's question the Minister revealed the rather staggering and frightening increase in the level of malicious damages caused between 1980 and 1985.  There was an increase from £6.1 million to £9.9 million to £13.6 million to £17.3 million to £20 million.  Those figures reveal the real motivation behind the Government's intention to bring in this Bill.  I would like to ask the Minister, in the event of householders not being able to afford house insurance &mdash; which is the only alternative to malicious damages &mdash; and with the Minister's intention to disband malicious damages in that instance, are these <Col N="1876" /> householders to be left totally abandoned to have their property destroyed with no redress in any way against the State?</P>

      <P>Amendments Nos. 1 to 7, inclusive, and amendment No. 10, were intended to preserve part of the statutory charge and they have been ruled out of order.  Standing Order No. 95 (1) and (2) provides as follows:</P>

    <P>It is quite clear that our amendments would be in order, but we find on page 87 that Standing Order 188 provides that an amendment to a Bill which could have the effect of imposing or increasing a charge may not be moved by any Member save a member of the Government or a Parliamentary Secretary &mdash; I take it that now applies to a Minister of State.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I am speaking on the section.  My first amendment was:</P>
      <P>In page 3, between lines 21 and 22, to insert the following subsection:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(2) Subject to the provisions of this section, where damage the aggregate amount of which exceeds £100 is caused to any premises or property whose principal purpose is the provision of education, the person who suffers the damage shall be entitled to obtain compensation in accordance <Col N="1878" /> with the Malicious Injuries Acts 1981 and 1986.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I was suggesting that the Minister might leave the provision there in respect of primary schools in particular and it would mean that only part of the statutory charge would fall.  It might mean additional expenditure which the Minister did not intend in the Bill.  It is regrettable that under Standing Orders the Opposition cannot make a proposal that the Minister would abolish part of the existing statutory charge.  We cannot propose that the Minister would go half way.  We cannot suggest that the Minister might go further than half way.  The Minister in that way would be getting most of what she and the Government want but she would still be providing protection for primary schools for whom this provision will be disastrous in parts of this city and in Cork and Limerick.</P>
    <P>We are particularly familiar with the position, particularly in primary schools, in Dublin as the result of increasing crime and vandalism and the inability of the Government to control them.  The cost to the schools have gone up with the increasing rate of crime and vandalism, which has doubled since 1982.  The Government's response is to pull the props from under the schools.  Can the Minister tell us what would be the cost of accepting these amendments?  As far as the Chair and the rules are concerned it is regrettable that we cannot make such a proposal, though we propose a reduction but not as big a reduction as the Minister has in mind.</P>

I appeal to Deputies to go out and to speak to school boards of management and ask what the impact of these proposals will be.  On the other hand the Minister could adopt this amendment and put it down on Report Stage tomorrow, because under Standing Orders the Minister of State would have the same authority as former Parliamentary Secretaries. The Minister could take our amendments and modify them and resubmit them tomorrow.  I would love to have a vote on this amendment&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I want to see Labour Deputies coming in here, voting and then going out telling the boards of management that they are being looked after.  I should like to see them having an opportunity to vote on this simple question. Deputy Taylor has said that the school managements can get insurance policies. If he had gone out to inquire he would have found that the increase to be borne by primary schools in Dublin as a result of this Bill will be between 40 per cent and 45 per cent.  I will have great pleasure in giving the Deputy an opportunity to vote on this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are totally opposed to what is being done.  It is classical Thatcherite Government action which we are seeing.  I am surprised to see the labour Party and, in particular, their Chief Whip trotting in behind as they trot behind most of the other things these days.  It is about time they stood on their own feet and looked after those who are going to suffer as a result of this measure.  I would ask the Minister of State if she has the information available on the cost in a year of excluding educational facilities?  If the Minister of State does not have a global figure which covers education generally, perhaps she could tell us what the figure is for primary schools?  That is an easy one to get.  Can the Minister of State tell <Col N="1880" /> us what the impact will be in total on primary schools?</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>As I understand section 2, where damage is done either as a result of riot or by an unlawful organisation anybody whose property is damaged will be able to recover the cost of that damage from the State.  Under the existing malicious injuries code this would include State bodies.  Obviously, it would include individuals and private companies but it would also include semi-State bodies such as the ESB and Bord Telecom.  It seems to exclude one group, peculiarly, and they are the local authorities.  In other words, if a property owned by a local authority is damaged, even as a result of riot or by an unlawful organisation, as I understand the Bill the position will remain that the local authority will not be able to recoup their losses from the State.</P>
      <P>This anomaly has not arisen for the first time on this Bill.  It is already an anomaly which exists in the malicious injuries code.  To maintain the spirit of providing some source of funds for local authorities who are faced with difficulties such as this it would not be unreasonable to correct this anomaly now particularly in view of the general changes which have taken place and to provide in the event that property owned by a local authority is damaged either as a result of riot or unlawful organisation the local authority would be able to recoup their losses from the State.  I would ask the Minister of State to consider amending the section, if I am reading it correctly.  I do not think it is an unreasonable request.  In view of the policy that now exists and has existed for a number of years where local authorities have access to central funds to deal with damage done in this type of situation they should, equally, in respect of damage to property they own be able to recoup their losses directly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. J. Leonard Mr. J. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising from what the previous speaker has said there has been an amendment tabled by Deputy Woods which states that notwithstanding any other provision of the Malicious Injuries <Col N="1881" /> Acts 1981 and 1986, a local authority shall be entitled to apply for compensation in accordance with the particular section. I mentioned on Second Stage that this applied to County Monaghan more than to any other county.  We had a situation where in 1981 during the H-Block hunger strikes one of the finest buildings in the county was burned down.  Under this Bill the property owner must still institute proceedings against the appropriate local authority.  He will receive compensation from the local authority's own property recoup it from the Minister.  This means that if the local authority's own property is damaged in a riot they cannot institute proceedings against themselves.  They cannot pay compensation to themselves and they cannot recoup from the Minister. There is a serious anomaly there. This has caused much concern to local authorities and it has caused a lot of expense to local authorities.  This is money which they have not got and which they have to provide.  We had the property covered by insurance.  We met a number of Ministers and discussed the problem.  The position was that, while we were covered by insurance, when the insurance company's assessors came to examine what was left of the property their estimate was much less than the actual damage.</P>
      <P>A further problem was that the Department of Justice following the proposal to reconstruct the building asked for additional changing rooms and an additional court.  These added considerably to the expenditure, expenditure which if the incident had not happened we would not have had to carry.  The ESB and Bord Telecom are protected in respect of riot damage.  Local authorities are not.  It would appear desirable and practicable that some clause be inserted to the effect that damage to local authority property would be covered.  I have not got the figures in the case I referred to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Costs will now be paid.  In a recent case the local costs to Monaghan County Council were over £5,000.  This was for a claim that had been reduced.  The claim was for £800 in the District Court.  The <Col N="1882" /> award, which was for a glass, was £50. There was an appeal to the High Court. The award was increased to £75.  It cost Monaghan County Council £5,000 in fees to defend the case plus the appeal because the applicant was successful in getting the award increased from £50 to £75.  This was for a claim which previously had been lodged for £800.  I have raised this case in the House continuously.  It is a serious situation.</P>
    <P>In all fairness, the applicant should have been at some loss for making such an excessive claim which did not stand up.  That was the council's view at that time.  We also believed that there should be some incentive to settle cases.  The county council should be allowed to lodge an amount in court which would be described as being a reasonable settlement sum.  Then, if the applicant went ahead with the case and the award was less, he would suffer as far as costs are concerned.  That is something we have given deep thought to on a continuing basis.  I would hope that the situation will not be allowed to continue where local authorities cannot be reimbursed for damage caused.  This is an ideal time to deal with this matter.  It is very important that the Minister of State should deal with it because we have a practical situation in County Monaghan.  A similar incident could occur again along the Border. Some of the other courthouses in the county might be more easily damaged than that one which had a very strong structure.  Nevertheless, it would be a very costly exercise to restore them as we have tried to do on money which we have not got and for which we have to float loans from the local loans fund.  I would appeal to the Minister of State to redress that anomaly.  She can do so under Deputy Woods' amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to agree with Deputy Woods in one respect, but in one respect only, and that is in connection with the subject matter of his amendment. I was not aware that his amendments were to be ruled out of order and I did not have an opportunity of studying the wording of the Standing Order.  The <Col N="1883" /> Minister brings in a Bill, the effect of which if passed would be to reduce the charge on the public purse by, say, £1 million.  It seems strange as a matter of general principle to rule out of order an amendment that would save the taxpayer £0.5 million.  At this juncture the whole thing is in the melting pot and the end result would still be a net saving to the taxpayer, not an increase.  The Chair has obviously studied the terms of the Standing Order but there seems to be something there which requires amendment and perhaps the Committee on Procedure and Privileges should consider the matter.</P>

      <P>I have not studied the wording of that Standing Order and it is some time since I looked at it.  I accept the Chair's ruling that this is the effect of it, but it would seem to be quite illogical and something that ought to be amended. The net effect overall would still be a saving to the public purse rather than any increase.</P>
      <P>I find it very strange that the Fianna Fáil Party oppose this measure, of which this section is the crucial factor.  I believe they are opposing this for the sake of opposing something and that they have not thought it through.  We all know what the origins of this measure are.  This was a punitive measure brought in by the British authorities of the day to punish Irish people who were fighting for their freedom.  In effect, the British said that they could blow up or destroy as they wished but they would pay for it through the local rates.  This is the measure that the so-called party of reality attempt, with some measure of bravado, to stand over and preserve.  It is a peculiar measure which has no parallel in any other country, as far as I know.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>For some peculiar reason the party of reality decided to make a thing about this measure.  They overlooked the fact that if a loss occurs as a result of a malicious injury it has to be borne somewhere.  We are not in the 1977 situation where it can be pulled down from the skies or one imagines that perhaps the German authorities or the USA or the Soviet Union will send a donation to pay for it.  We have gone past that now.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>There are four categories I can think of which could bear the loss incurred as a result of a malicious injury. The first category is represented by the general body of taxpayers; every taxpayer would make his contribution and the State would pay for the malicious injury.  Secondly, the local taxpayers or ratepayers could bear the cost; that is another possibility.  The third category would be the insurance companies, who are very much involved in this issue.  The fourth and final possibility, although maybe there is another one I cannot think of, is that the person who suffers the damage should bear the loss.  One has to approach this problem with some kind of balance and not talk about it as though there were some magical source from which the money to pay for these losses could come.  It must come from one of those four categories.</P>
      <P>Up to now the schools, like most other people, covered their property against malicious injury with their insurance companies, just as they took out fire and burglary cover.  Most institutions and individuals took out an insurance policy. In most cases when a malicious injury occurred the insurance company paid out to the person or institution which suffered. Then in the fullness of time, perhaps two or three years later, the insurance company recouped their loss from the taxpayer in one form or another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not really possible to say whether an insurance company in assessing the level of their premiums took into account the fact that they would get the money <Col N="1885" /> back from the local authority.  Everybody can have his own view on this point.  My opinion is that this was not at all a factor they took into account in assessing the amount of the premium they charged. That was their own little joke at the peculiarity of the Irish malicious injuries system.  There was none of that nonsense in the UK.  The British Parliament brought in the system but only for the Irish; there was no way they would bring it in for the British.  The insurance companies, most of which were British, saw this as a great little number in Ireland. They would collect the premiums in the same way as anywhere else, pay out for the damage with one hand but with the other hand they would get the money back from the ratepayers and the taxpayers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.  The money went into their coffers.  The insurance companies' executives sat in their leather-lined boardrooms with their paintings on the wall in their millionaire office blocks.  If anybody tells me that they sat around their boardrooms assessing the amount of their premiums and decided that the premiums would be £x for this type of insurance but because they would be getting back from the local authorities what they paid out they would reduce the amount to be charged in those cases in Ireland, I will not accept it.  I do not believe it for one moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They did not take that factor into account.  It was a handly little extra profit number they got from the Irish, not from the British because in Britain they paid it out in response to the premiums on their policies.  That is the type of system we have been carrying on from the time the British imposed it on us.  One thing I find remarkable about the whole system is that we have waited until 1986 to deal with it.  Down the years millions of pounds went out of the country to British insurance companies.  Every local authority from Monaghan and Cavan to Cork and Waterford made their contribution to the profits of British insurance companies <Col N="1886" /> since 1922.  Somebody should try to explain why it has taken until 1986 to tackle the problem.</P>
    <P>I find it strange and remarkable that the Opposition for some convoluted mystical reason feel there is a way of providing the necessary funds and that the insurance companies collecting the premiums should not bear the cost.  That is what they collect their premiums for and any company accepts that it is commensurate with collecting premiums to pay out on claims.  However, as far as this brand of insurance is concerned, those companies have had it both ways all these years.  I am glad the time has come when we are calling a halt to that nonsense.</P>

      <P>If one followed Deputy Taylor's argument through to its logical conclusion one would think there should not be any malicious injury compensation fund even for damage caused by riot or unlawful organisations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">

      <P>Presumably it is Deputy Taylor's view that there should be a Bill to abolish malicious injury compensation altogether.  I should like to ask the Minister if there were negotiations with the insurance companies and if, as Deputy Taylor said, insurance companies are collecting premiums that should cover the cost of malicious injury claims.  Is it true that there will not be any increase in the cost of insurance when this legislation is passed?  My understanding is that the companies will increase their premiums and that people who have to insure any item will be affected.  The already hard pressed motorist will suffer.  Many people are not insuring their cars because they cannot afford to.  That is deplorable but we must consider young people who need a car to get to work.  They are being asked to pay a premium in excess of £1,000 for insurance cover and they now face the prospect of another massive increase in their premiums when this legislation is passed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Woods has told us that a 40 per cent increase in premiums for primary <Col N="1887" /> schools will be the order of the day when the Bill will be passed.  Will this be a question of a circular transfer?  Will the Department of Education be paying the increase or will it be left to the management of the school?</P>
    <P>Deputy Taylor suggested that Fianna Fáil may be considering going to Germany or the United States for the money but there was never any question of that. It was the Taoiseach who went to the US begging for money under the Anglo-Irish Agreement to try to sustain Garda activity in the Border counties.  With the overtime allocation practically absorbed, there is very little money left for the remainder of the year for overtime.  It is not hard to understand the serious consequences which will result in other areas of the administration of justice.  It is the Deputy's Government who are in the business of going around the world begging for money.  It was never suggested by this side of the House that we would go to the US, Germany or anywhere else to find the money for a malicious injury fund.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that Deputy Woods's amendment was disallowed because it sought to give local authorities the same right to apply for compensation as anybody else.  Why are local authorities excluded from claiming damages?  I am surprised that Deputy Taylor, a member of a local authority, did not support Deputy Woods's amendment.  All local authorities, particularly those in the Border area, will suffer when this legislation is passed.  It is a glaring injustice that local authorities who own property will be unable to claim when their property is damaged.</P>
    <P>When Monaghan courthouse was burned the repair bill was £1¼ million.  I accept that the Department of Justice who used the courtroom made a contribution to the repair bill but the county council had to raise the remainder.  In introducing the Bill the Minister should have ensured that local authorities had the same power to claim compensation as anybody else.  Why should the Department of Justice have to subvent <Col N="1888" /> a local authority when a courthouse is damaged?  Why should the Department of Justice have to pay £1 million out of their allocation when the bill should be paid from the malicious injury fund?  Why did the Minister not avail of the opportunity to remove a glaring injustice against local authorities who own property?</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the analysis put forward by Deputy Taylor.  He put his case admirably.  He asked if the Opposition were serious in opposing a measure that is designed to save the taxpayers money.  As a member of a local authority I am aware of the cost of claims to the ordinary taxpayer.  The measure was introduced by the English to protect their own coffers because of vandalism against property.  We have reached the stage here where there is little respect for property, private or State property.</P>
      <P>The question of schools has been mentioned. The level of vandalism in schools is in excess of what could be considered acceptable.  The schools concerned are not necessarily in inner city areas.  They are situated throughout the country.  The question must be asked why this is the case.  Why should we ask the overburdened taxpayers to continue to pick up the tab for these acts of vandalism against property?  I agree with what is proposed in the Bill, that taxpayers should not have to continue to bear the cost.</P>
      <P>I am not sure that insurance companies are being fair with the public with regard to the level of premiums charged and I ask the Minister to monitor what is happening in this regard.  An examination should be made as to how insurance companies will behave with regard to premiums when this measure is passed into law.</P>
      <P>The level of compensation for some properties in respect of malicious damages is in excess of what it should be.  When rates were levied on the community, local authorities could levy a few pence in the £ to take account of malicious damage claims.  However, only a small proportion of the population now pay rates, mainly the business interests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1889" /> Eventually, it all comes back to the taxpayers, mainly the PAYE sector. Other sectors claim to pay taxes.  I agree they pay a certain amount but it is much less than what they should pay.</P>
    <P>I support what the Government propose, even though it may create problems for schools, as Deputy Woods has claimed, and it may also give rise to problems for those involved in the running of recreational centres.  I submit it is a matter of responsibility for the communities concerned to ensure that the level of vandalism diminishes.  Insurance companies will increase premiums if their level of profit is not consistent with what it is at the moment.  They may point out to us that profitability from this type of insurance is small.  Nevertheless, they are in that business.  I should not like to think that people could not make a legitimate claim against an insurance company, but where the State is concerned there has always been a certain level of bad behaviour that is quite a scandal.  I should like that situation to be brought under control. Where it cannot be proved that an illegal organisation was involved in an incident, even though it may be suspected, will the Minister tell the House what kind of procedure will be followed to ensure that a property owner is entitled to compensation from the State?</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>We have to come back to the reason for the introduction of this legislation.  I was absolutely stunned to listen to the contribution of Deputy Taylor.  He is a person for whom I have some respect but I was amazed at his contribution tonight.  He told us this legislation was introduced initially in the twenties to punish the poor Paddies for their misdeeds.  Even if we could look into the minds of the people who brought in the legislation then and establish that was the motivation behind it, does Deputy Taylor, the Minister or anybody on that side seriously expect us to believe that was the reason this legislation was brought before us in the past fortnight? Does anyone in the country seriously believe that?  Do they believe the Labour <Col N="1890" /> Party have had a sudden rush of justice to the head for the first time in the past three years since they have propped up this Government, and that they have suddenly decided to do the right thing by the poor taxpayers?  Everyone knows the legislation was introduced for one reason only, namely, to cut back on public expenditure.  It is a cost cutting exercise, an expenditure saving measure.</P>
      <P>The reason such measures have been brought before the House is that people in the country who have sufficient industrial and economic muscle can wrest what they like from this so-called Government of rectitude.  This Government punish those who cannot hit back and they will cut costs at their expense.  This is a cowardly, mean and a bullying type of legislation directed against people who cannot fight back.</P>
      <P>The pseudo smoked salmon socialists talk about directors of insurance companies in plush boardrooms with paintings on the walls but this cannot conceal the economic fact and the business reality that insurance companies will act to protect their margins.  Anyone with a scintilla of common sence knows that.  Insurance companies will protect their profits and the taxpayers, whom the Labour Party are so concerned to protect, will finish off being worse off because they will have to pay increased premiums.  At the very least, the property owners will suffer because if this Government stay in power much longer there will be no taxpayers left because nobody will be left in employment.  Therefore, the taxpayers or property owners whom we are told will be saved all this money may finish up worse off, while at the same time the legislation introduced here will give rise to a number of grotesque anomalies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Hyland referred to poor people who will not be able to afford the increased premiums.  What will happen to them?  I should like to hear the Minister answer that point.  Must they just accept their lot and walk away?  Deputy Woods' amendment was ruled out of order for reasons I cannot understand.  Organisations such as the GAA are providing much needed social and community <Col N="1891" /> activity, particularly in rural Ireland and among young people, and they will find themselves having to pay increased insurance premiums.  Deputy Woods also referred to schools.  I should like to see how this measure, which we are told will promote social justice and save money, will deal with the many cases to which reference has been made during this debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to point out to Deputy Woods that there is a threeyear limitation period within which proceedings for compensation for malicious damage must be commenced.  Therefore, there can be a delay of up to three years in processing claims.  There will always be a timelag between a fall-off in crime and a reduction in claims for compensation. I accept that malicious damage to schools is a serious problem.  This matter was the subject of discussion between officials of the Department of Education and the Department of Justice.  I understand that measures are being taken to improve security in schools by the installation of better fencing, burglar alarms and toughened glass and that grants are available for such measures in the case of new and existing primary schools and, in certain circumstances, in the case of secondary schools.  We anticipate that this will have a beneficial effect overall on the level of insurance premiums for schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next point raised related to malicious damage to local authority property. This does not come within the scope of the malicious injuries scheme.  It is not appropriate in this Bill, which deals with claims from local authorities, to have a provision whereby local authorities could claim against themselves.  This matter could not be dealt with under this Bill. This point was raised on Second Stage by Deputy Leonard and Deputy O'Hanlon. The Minister for Justice is in communication with the Ministers for Finance and the Environment on this matter.  It has been decided that this Bill is not the appropriate place to deal with this matter because this Bill essentially <Col N="1892" /> relates to the way the cost of repairing damage to local authority property should be met.  It is a matter for further consideration and is not being forgotten or ignored.  The Minister is in consultation with the Ministers for Finance and the Environment as to how such damage should be dealt with.  By virtue of section 6 local authority legal costs will be fully recoupable under the new scheme.  This point was raised by Deputy Leonard.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Hanlon raised the question of insurance.  We saw no reason for the Government to negotiate with the insurance industry on the introduction of this Malicious Injuries Bill.  The insurance companies were aware of our proposals and conveyed their views to the Department, which were taken into account.  As to the increases in premium as a result of the passing of this Bill, any such increases will be subject to the normal consultation process betwen the Department of Industry and Commerce and the insurance industry.  Deputy Dowling asked about damage which was proved to have been caused by unlawful organisations.  Section 3 makes provision for proving whether the damage was caused by an unlawful organisation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister says the Department obtained the views from the insurance companies.  What were these views?  Did the insurance companies indicate what the likely outcome of these measures would be?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>When replying to the Second Stage debate I referred Deputies to a statement which appeared in <i>The Irish Press</i> of 30 January 1986.  A spokesman for one of the insurance companies said that while the measures would have an effect on premiums, he did not expect a dramatic increase.  I understand the existing levels of premiums are likely to be increased, but not dramatically, partially because of the anticipated increased cost for insurers arising from this Bill, but also because extended cover is to be provided in the area of public liability and indemnity.  As I mentioned earlier, these increases will be subject to the <Col N="1893" /> normal consultation process between the Department of Industry and Commerce and the insurance industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister stated that the insurance industry said there would be increases but not dramatic increases. I do not know if Deputy Taylor has influence to get the insurance companies to accommodate the views he expressed here tonight, but I doubt if he has much influence with them.  The increases they are already imposing on primary schools are of the order of 40 per cent.  I consider that to be a dramatic increase.  The statement of 30 January may have been a global statement but that is not what we are dealing with here.  We are dealing with the direct impact in specific groups.</P>
      <P>Deputy Taylor's contribution was very interesting because he went back to 1836 when these measures were first introduced. That would be of great interest if we were engaged in an historial study on the origins of this kind of measure but what we are facing is the increase in these costs which have occurred in the last five or six years as a result of a very big increase in crime and vandalism.  We are not suggesting that this damage is being done by other than members of our own community.</P>
      <P>I have to take issue with Deputy Dowling because as far as the communities involved are concerned, these people have done everything in their power to stop crime and vandalism.  It is their inability, and the inability of the Garda Síochána, to prevent this type of crime and vandalism which is the real problem.  I accept that in Deputy Dowling's area this may be an occasional problem but the fact is that the areas most affected are Dublin, Cork and Limerick.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Almost £13 million of this money is spent on Dublin.  I had hoped the Minister would tell us how the money was spent in the Dublin area but perhaps she will have this information tomorrow.  The latest figures I have relate to 1984.  The Dublin area can be divided into postal districts.  In 1984, 16.9 per cent of the Dublin expenditure was paid in Dublin 1 <Col N="1894" /> and in Dublin 2 the figure was 8.6 per cent.</P>
    <P>We are saying that more than 25 per cent of the Dublin expenditure is going into districts 1 and 2.  I know Deputy Taylor is familiar with Dublin, and surely he is familiar with Dublin 1 and Dublin 2, where the major impact of this measure is felt.</P>

      <P>The 1984 figure for Dublin 24 was 1.6 per cent.  I do not have the figure for 1985 but perhaps the Minister will be able to give more up to date figures.  Perhaps it is understandable that Deputy Taylor is not getting excited about the measure because the impact in his area does not appear to be so great, and there are other areas where the impact is even less.</P>

      <P>The Deputy did his Pontius Pilate act earlier and we all had to witness that and it was very sad to see it because I would have thought he would be in here shouting about the poor, depressed people in the areas which are suffering very seriously from crime and vandalism and about the fact that the Government are planning to pull away one of the props <Col N="1895" /> available for people in these areas.</P>
      <P>The Minister might have the 1985 figures.  Admittedly those I have are for 1984 but presumably his figures will not vary much from those.  Deputy Taylor and Deputy Dowling do not seem to realise that since 1982 the schools' policies in the Dublin area have been loaded by up to 100 per cent, that the schools are already carrying very heavy loadings.  I know the two Deputies would like to run a pioneering scheme to force the insurance companies to bring down their charges in these areas, and of course we would all be very glad to support them in that effort.  On the other hand, it is better to face the reality as it affects the people on the ground.  If Deputy Dowling inquiries from the people on the boards of management in Dublin he will find that what I am saying is borne out in very real terms by the people who are trying to keep these primary schools functioning in Dublin.  The Minister says discussions are going on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister accepts that the problem in relation to the first amendment &mdash; the education area &mdash; is serious.  I would like Deputy Dowling to take note that there is a serious problem.  It is not something that is being dreamed up and, when this Bill goes through, the impact will be much more serious for the people concerned. That is why we put down this amendment.  I leave it to the Minister to consider whether she should exclude schools from the provision being made here, from the abolition of the malicious injuries compensation.  It is pretty clear that the Minister for Education will not go out to the schools and say: &ldquo;There is the money to cover the extra insurance you will incur as a result of this measure which this Government are taking&rdquo;. Does the Minister think that will really happen?  Does she not realise that discussions have taken place already with the Minister for Education who said there is nothing he can do about it, that he has raised the question with the Minister for Justice and the Minister for Finance?  He might as well be talking to a blank wall. They are not interested.  The Minister for <Col N="1896" /> Justice said at the outset that the only reason for this measure is to reduce the impact on the Exchequer.</P>

      <P>It will be a great day when the taxpayer happens to get the benefit. The Government could not care less about the schools.  That is all I can conclude from what I have heard here tonight and on Second Stage.</P>
      <P>In relation to this section I asked the Minister the cost of that measure and of giving that relief.  He did not reply so I take it the Minister of State has not got that information available now.  Maybe she will have it tomorrow.  There might be a great deal more information about the Bill then and we will know what we are talking about.  I ask Deputies on the other side of the House how cold and hard they can be when they just could not care less about the impact.  They say they will do this anyway.  When somebody asks about it they have not got the information because they have never considered it.  They have a stony, hardfaced approach of &ldquo;Just go and do it&rdquo; and the Labour Party trot along with them: &ldquo;What do we want facts for?  Why do we want to know who is affected?&rdquo; Surely that is obvious to anyone who has listened to the debate so far tonight.</P>
      <P>My second amendment reads:</P>
      <P>In page 3, between lines 21 and 22, to insert the following subsection:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(3) (a) Subject to the provisions of this section, where damage the aggregate amount of which exceeds £100 is caused to any premises or property whose principal purpose is the provision of recreational or sporting facilities, the person who suffers the damage <Col N="1897" /> shall be entitled to obtain compensation in accordance with the Malicious Injuries Acts 1981 and 1986.</P>
    <P>(b) For the purposes of this subsection the following organisations shall be deemed to engage in recreational or sporting activities:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i) The Gaelic Athletic Association,</P>
    <P>(ii) The Football Association of Ireland,</P>
    <P>(iii) The Irish Rugby Football Union,</P>
    <P>(iv)  The Golfing Union of Ireland,</P>
    <P>(v)  Any other organisation as the Minister may by order designate&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I am quite happy to leave it to the Minister to designate any sporting organisation who may be appropriate or who should be excluded in this area.  I mention the GAA because I can see that bodies like the GAA and the FAI are providing massive facilities throughout the country for the young people who are growing up, and the work these organisations do is an antidote to vandalism and crime.  These are the people who are really helping to prevent crime.  Surely Deputies on the other side realise that.</P>
    <P>In another Bill debated here today the Government are bringing in a national lottery to get money allegedly to give to sporting organisations, although they do not say that in the Bill.  It is just raising money for the Exchequer, but they say the intention is to spend this money principally on sporting organisations.  If we accept the bona fides of the Government in that respect and therefore that the Government are anxious to encourage and promote these sporting organisations, in this Bill we find that the Government are anxious to penalise these organisations, to pull away the props and supports.  You might say this will not happen very often.  On the Bull Island St. Anne's golf club and the Suttonians Rugby Football Club were vandalised and burned down.  These are the <Col N="1898" /> realities outside this House, not the cloud cuckooland Deputy Taylor and his colleagues live in.  The Government are turning a blind eye, turning their back on all of these groups.  Any Deputy who has anything to do with the soccer, Gaelic and rugby clubs will know that they attract hundreds of thousands of young people, engaging them in worth-while activities, giving them a sense of discipline, community and participation, and what do the Government say to them? &ldquo;We do not care what you are doing, or if you are vandalised and burned down.  We are not prepared to make an exception of you in this area.  Run a few more flag days.  Try to work up some more money.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>What is the whole principle on which this Government are acting?  The people who are doing the real work bring out the kids at weekends.  They train them during the week.  They scrounge to try to put some money together to provide facilities for them.  They are finding difficulty in getting insurance.  Last week in my constituency the sport weekend was cancelled because the organisers could not pay the insurance costs to cover public liability.  We were all set to go out to this annual event and it was just cancelled, many young people were disappointed and let down.  How are voluntary groups who are running these organisations supposed to manage?  The Government could not care less.  They are turning their backs on these groups. That is why I was giving the Minister and the Government an opportunity in amendment No. 2 to say to these people that they realise they are doing a special job, making a special contribution, helping to provide an antidote to crime and vandalism, and that they are giving worthwhile outlets to young people which is good for the community.  They should be exempted because the IRA and the INLA are exempted.  Why not exempt constructive organisations&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am saying where it lies as far as this measure is concerned and if the Deputy cannot see it I cannot do anything for him.  The Ceann Comhairle will not let us press amendment No. 2 and, therefore, it cannot go to a vote. However, the Minister is entitled to consider it and to come back on Report Stage with an amended version or, indeed, to adopt the amendment as it stands.  I appeal to the Minister to take a serious look at the work done by these organisations in the community and not to abolish the props and supports which exist at present for these organisations because the effect of withdrawing them will place an extra strain on voluntary bodies and organisations.</P>
      <P>The third amendment which I sought to introduce reads as follows:</P>
      <P>Subject to the provisions of this section, where damage the aggregate amount of which exceeds £100 is caused to any premises or property whose principal purpose is the provision of religious, or charitable or voluntary service, the person who suffers the damage shall be entitled to obtain compensation in accordance with the Malicious Injuries Acts 1981 and 1986.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister should exempt religious, charitable or voluntary bodies from the abolition of malicious injuries.  They should be given special status because of their work.  I am thinking of community <Col N="1900" /> associations who raise funds to run services for the community in a voluntary way and who get nothing out of it.</P>
    <P>In the debate on the Combat Poverty Bill, the Minister for Social Welfare said that it was very important to set up a body which would encourage voluntary organisations to develop self help in the community.  However, the Minister for Justice said that he would withdraw support for these organisations although he knew that the effect would be to increase insurance costs for these bodies.  Some of these organisations cannot get insurance except at a prohibitive rate and most of their funds are now going on insurance because of the level of crime and vandalism. This applies especially to cities like Dublin, Cork and Limerick where they cannot get cover.  Surely the Government can find some way of continuing support for these people?  I ask the Government and Deputies on that side of the House to consider the difficulties which these people are having and to introduce an amendment exempting them.</P>
    <P>The amendments I put down deal with schools and educational establishments, sporting organisations and recreational facilities and community centres and charitable and voluntary bodies.  All these people have put a great deal of effort into the community and indeed primary schools are now run by boards of management.  However, these boards cannot afford even to heat the schools for the rest of the year.  I do not know what it is like in Deputy Dowling's constituency but that is the way it is in Dublin because there have been so many cut-backs already.  Of course Deputy Taylor is in favour of cutbacks, he calls them tax savings.  At least in England Mrs. Thatcher calls them cutbacks&mdash;&mdash;</P>

His cynical exercise in trying to extract that statement from me should be noted because the Labour Party have <Col N="1901" /> descended to those depths.  They do not understand how to manage £10, let alone £1 million.  They are on a downward spiral.  I do not know if Deputy Taylor heard the Taoiseach answering a question today which confirmed that there is massive emigration.  He should be addressing himself to that problem instead of making petty remarks.  We accept that the Bill needs to be amended and on Second Stage I said that we were prepared to sit down with the Minister to sort out the problems.  I ask the Minister to consider the exemption of these people and I put forward these amendments&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and are not smothered by this general smokescreen so that sight is lost of the problem.  These amendments are down for the record.  I am purposely <Col N="1902" /> reading them into the record so that Deputy Taylor and his colleagues can go away and consider them.  Amendment No. 4 is:</P>
      <P>In page 3, between lines 21 and 22, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(5) Subject to the provisions of this section, where damage the aggregate amount of which exceeds £100 is caused to any mechanically propelled vehicle, motor cycle or cycle, the person who suffers the damage shall be entitled to obtain compensation in accordance with the Malicious Injuries Acts 1981 and 1986.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Here I mentioned damage to stolen cars and stolen bicycles.  That is the business we are in nowadays.  I would like to hear from the Minister the extent to which cars account for this money.  Here again Dublin, Cork and Limerick are the main areas where this is happening.  I have the figures for 1984 which might be helpful to the Minister.  Perhaps she might try to get us some more figures for 1985 for tomorrow if she does not have them here tonight.  The damage to cars and motor cycles in 1984 was 48.2 per cent, so it is very close to 50 per cent of the total damage.  The poor motorists and motor cyclists will suffer an insurance increase as a result of the measures being put forward by Government.  I have tried to ascertain the level of increase in insurance premiums for motorists and have been told that on comprehensive policies it will be about 5 per cent as a result of the abolition of the malicious injuries code and for third party, fire and theft policies the figure will be considerably more than that but I have no more detail. If the Minister has figures in relation to the expected increases which might have resulted from the discussions that the Minister presumably had with the motor industry about the impact on it of this measure we would be very interested to hear about it.  The motorists are also taxpayers, probably some of the heaviest taxpayers in the country.  The tax contribution from motorists is quite staggering and it is reasonable that they should <Col N="1903" /> expect that in relation to the stealing and damaging of their cars the State might be of some assistance to them.  If this measure goes through they will be left to carry the can themselves.  Here again Dublin, Cork and Limerick will carry the bulk of the burden, Dublin more than anywhere else.  Deputy Dowling says that it is the responsibility of the communities to deal with vandalism and crime.  That is a very naive statement but one can accept it coming from a Deputy who is not immersed in this crime and is living in a rural constituency.  It is unrealistic to call on people in inner city areas to pay for this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not suggest that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Saying that the responsibility is on the communities implies that it is up to them to get their house in order.  They would be delighted if the Government provided the security and sufficient gardaí to get their house in order because they are afraid to go out on to the streets; they cannot leave their cars outside their houses or in their garages; they are putting up all sorts of protections which do not seem to be sufficient. Cars are still being stolen and damaged. While the level of crime and vandalism to cars and motor cycles is so high we should not remove the support.  Why take away the prop that is there?  Again I ask the Minister to look at that amendment in relation to cars and motor cycles.</P>
      <P>The fifth amendment which I propose here relates to this section also.  It is:</P>
      <P>In page 3, between lines 21 and 22, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(6) Subject to the provisions of this section, where damage the aggregate amount of which amount of which exceeds £100 is caused to any premises or property whose principal purpose is the storage of agricultural fodder, the person who suffers the damage shall be entitled to obtain compensation in accordance with the Malicious Injuries Acts 1981 and 1986.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment concerns another area <Col N="1904" /> where the Minister could provide a remedy for the farming community in these circumstances.  I note that the provisions in the Criminal Injuries to Persons (Compensation) Act (Northern Ireland) 1968 have been reduced but provision is made for agricultural people.  Maybe Deputy Dowling would have a particular interest in this because it will very much affect his constituents.  I appeal to him to take note of my amendment No. 5 and have a word with his own Minister to see if she or Minister Dukes would make some arrangements to deal with the rural population in this area because they are being excluded here now.  The protection which they had under the 1981 Act is about to be removed.  Even where schemes have been reduced in Northern Ireland they have maintained cover for the agricultural community.  I would ask the Minister to consider whether it is necessary to remove this protection from the agricultural community.  Section 2 of the Capital Grants to Industry (Amendment) Act, 1956, is as follows:</P>
    <P>2.  Where damage, the aggregate amount of which exceeds twenty pounds, has been maliciously or wantonly caused to&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) any building which is an agricultural building within the meaning of the Rating and Valuation (Apportionment) Act (Northern Ireland), 1928; or</P>
    <P>(b) any of the following kinds of property, found present or growing on, or unlawfully removed from any land which is agricultural land within the meaning of the Agriculture Act (Northern Ireland), 1949, or found present in, or unlawfully removed from any building to which paragraph (a) applies, that is to say&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  any livestock.</P>
    <P>I presume Deputy Dowling has seen some livestock around the country.  That legislation includes:</P>
    <P>(ii) any agricultural or dairy machinery and utensils, implements and utensils of husbandry, any harness, fuel oil <Col N="1905" /> or spirit, and any power or horsedrawn farm vehicles and trailers (including farm vehicles and trailors constructed or adapted for the conveyance of goods),</P>
    <P>(iii) fruit trees or growing crops.</P>
    <P>Where Thatcherite policies have applied elsewhere, they have still left the old agricultural&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, of course, is entitled to accept all, or some, or none of these amendments but my duty on this side of the House is to point out the problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>Why put the amendments in at all?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>It is my job to show the implications.  The Minister would like to say that the Government want to push this legislation through, that they are in a hurry and do not want too much said about it, or too many questions asked.  It <Col N="1906" /> is my duty to point out, for the benefit of Members on both sides of the House, but particularly on the Government side &mdash; in case the Minister would not explain fully to them &mdash; the implications of the changes for the farming community in this case.  I put down amendment No. 5 specifically to show that while other jurisdictions have cut back in this area, they have not completely removed cover. I accept that the British Government have done and the Coalition Government are mad to follow the British Government in everything.  Let them go ahead if that is what they wish, but let them not expect us to support them on that.  Our intention is to make it clear that there is an option open to the Minister to exclude this area.  Our amendment No. 6 is as follows:</P>
      <P>In page 3, between lines 21 and 22, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(7) (a) Where the applicant satisfies the Court that it would not be reasonable to expect the applicant to have insured against the damage, the person who suffers the damage shall be entitled to obtain compensation in accordance with the Malicious Insuries Acts 1981 and 1986.</P>
      <P>(b) In determining what is reasonable for the purposes of this section, the Court shall have regard to:</P>
      <P>(i) the means of the person who has suffered damage, and</P>
      <P>(ii) the cost of obtaining insurance.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>
      </P>
      <P>Deputies might wonder what that is about, but there are centre city areas where it is not possible to get insurance cover any more.  This amendment would cover those circumstances.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 7 states:</P>
      <P>In page 3, between lines 21 and 22, to insert the following subsection:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1907" />&ldquo;(8) Notwithstanding any other provision of the Malicious Injuries Acts 1981 and 1986, a local authority shall be entitled to apply for compensation in accordance with this section.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We discussed that amendment earlier. These are the amendments that we propose and it is up to the Minister to accept all, or some of them.  We leave it to her to consider those proposals.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. J. Leonard Mr. J. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said previously that amendment No. 7 would not be appropriate.  In 1981 during the H-Block campaign a courthouse was burned and we have raised that issue by way of Parliamentary Question and debate to <Col N="1908" /> try to impress upon various Ministers for the Environment and for Justice the need to change the legislation.</P>
      <P>We hope that the Minister will in this instance redress this imbalance and bring in legislation which will ensure that local authorities will be in the same position as any other body and can claim for such damage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend to share my time with Deputy Noonan.  I thank the Chair for allowing me to raise this very important matter at this late hour and I thank the Minister of State for coming here to listen to what I have to say.  A couple of years ago the programme for the eradication of bovine TB was described in the Seanad by Dr. Whitaker, former Secretary of the Department of Finance and former Governor of the Central Bank, as the greatest financial disaster since the foundation of the State.  About £1 billion has been spent in disease eradication in our herds during the past 30 years but by any standards the present level of TB in the national herd is a scandal.  The Irish people, particularly the farmers, were pleased with the publication in <i>Building on Reality</i> of a specific commitment.  I quote:</P>
      <P>The Government have also decided to make a fresh onslaught on bovine disease, particularly tuberculosis, Substantially increased funds will be made available for disease eradication, including an additional provision for stock replacement, subject to a number of radical changes in existing practices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the time the Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Deasy, wrote to the veterinary profession outlining the changes he wanted and stating that increased funding <Col N="1911" /> would be available over a three year period, totalling £85 million.  Last year £29 million was spent on the eradication programme, but this year £4.5 million was cut from the allocation.  We are now back to the same old stop-go attitude towards bovine TB eradication.  That is very unfortunate.  Either we will go about eradicating the disease totally or we are not serious about it.</P>
    <P>It is no use saying it cannot be done because we can see that other countries throughout the world, particularly in Europe, have succeeded in eliminating the disease.  Even in Northern Ireland, which had a problem similar to ours, the incidence is five times lower than here. We continue to make excuses that things are different elsewhere.  They are not. We are disgraced: we are the laughing stock of the world.  We have spent 30 years tinkering around trying to get rid of this scourge.  The farmers contributed £14 million in levies last years.  Our position is damaging to our international image as a producer of good clean uncontaminated food.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances the Department of Agriculture and the Government stand indicted because they have not lived up to their commitment to make certain allocations of money, to carry out full rounds of testing so that once and for all we can eradicate this disease.  I call on the Minister of State to give us an assurance that at last the Government will take the matter seriously and allocate sufficient funds to ensure a full round of testing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick West) Mr. Noonan (Limerick West)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> I am glad of this opportunity to speak on this important issue.  We are sorry to have brought the Minister of State here at this early hour of the morning, but the situation is so serious that it needs to be clarified.  As Deputy Walsh has stated, the Government gave a commitment that a certain amount of money would be spent each year on this programme for eradication.  They have reneged on that. Farmers and the livestock industry are contributing more than 50 per cent of the total cost of disease eradication.  Not alone <Col N="1912" /> are the Government throwing good money after bad, taxpayers' money, but they are throwing the farmers' money away because the money spent last year might as well not have been spent: we did not have a full round of testing this year.</P>
      <P>Time is against us.  We are an exporting nation and I wonder how long will the EC Commission and our colleagues in Europe continue to accept that we have not got disease free status.  The indecision by Government is something they will live to regret.  They have had a stop-up programme in this respect.  That has been the policy in the past number of years.  It is a waste of resources.  Only a concerted effort over three or four years will give the required results.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last year Fianna Fáil published a tenpoint plan for disease eradication.  If that plan were carried through forcefully over a three year period the disease would be reduced to manageable levels.  The kernel of Fianna Fáil's plan is to give more discretion to the technical people in the field as against the current regime of bureaucratic tinkering and red tape.  It is imperative that those who know the job would be allowed to get on with it without interference from the Department, particularly the administrative section.  We have highly qualified people in the field. The veterinary staffs throughout the country know what the situation is.  However, the bureaucracy in the Department is interfering with the technical efforts to get on with the job and the people in the field see fit.  I appreciate that guidelines must be established and adhered to, but an obsession with keeping the files right will never succeed in eradicating bovine TB.  Vast sums of money have been spent on the programme over a number of years.  Some good work has been done. Eighteen months ago we suggested to the Minister how the job should be done.  That is why this party over 18 months ago gave the Minister the opportunity of doing a job but we never thought the Government would pull the plug and renege on their commitment in the document, <i>Building on Reality</i>.  I presume all the other promises will go the same way as <Col N="1913" /> the commitment on disease eradication.</P>
    <P>A lot of work has been done over the years but more and more has to be done. The only way we can eradicate this disease is through concerted effort.  The stakes are high and the rewards are great. Bovine TB must be eradicated sooner rather than later.  It would be worth investing greater resources in the short term to overcome the problem once and for all rather than to attack it piecemeal which has been the case over the years. It also seems to be the situation under the Government.  It is important to appreciate the role the cattle industry plays in our economy.  We must seek to increase exports and we can do that.  To achieve this growth we must have disease-free status for herds.  The challenge is there to be met and it needs the co-operation of farmers, veterinary officers, departmental officers as well as all of us if we are to succeed in this great task.</P>
    <P>I want to appeal to the Minister as my colleague, Deputy Walsh, has done, to give a commitment, coming up to 12.30 a.m., to restore the moneys which were taken by the Minister for Finance and which were committed in the document, <i>Building on Reality</i>.  Those moneys should be restored forthwith so that there will be one full round of testing in each herd this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Hegarty)</NameTxt>
      <P>In the first instance I would have to repudiate the suggestion that the situation regarding the bovine TB eradication scheme is unsatisfactory.  We have not reneged on the document, <i>Building on Reality</i>.  The national herd has been tested one and a half times in the recent round.  Our selective testing programme based on area disease incidence is designed to continue the effective process of eradication. I have spoken on a number of occasions, including during a recent Question Time, about the many unfair comments emanating from various quarters about the approach to the scheme this year.  I want <Col N="1914" /> to state again that there is no question of affording a lower priority to TB eradication or any slackening in our determination to make progress against the disease.</P>
      <P>To put the matter in perspective I would like, first of all, to comment on the 1985-86 round of testing which was a considerable success.  This round of testing, from 1 June 1985 to 6 April 1986 was the most intensive in the history of the eradication scheme.  During that ten month period 261,827 herd tests, covering over nine million individual animal tests, were carried out.  As well as the full monitor of all herds, the round involved extensive additional check testing and special area programmes.  These special programmes, focusing on herds considered to have been at greatest risk, were carried out in all counties in conjunction with the full monitor.  The strict procedures introduced by Government in 1985 led to a situation where, to an unprecedented extent, testing was carried out by private veterinary practitioners on schedule, herdowners co-operated fully in having tests carried out promptly and reactors were removed for slaughter with minimum delay.</P>

    <P>The main elements in these new procedures were as follows: farmer nomination of the veterinary surgeon to test his herd was replaced by direct Department of Agriculture nomination of veterinary surgeons to carry out testing; testing and blood sampling fees were paid direct by the Department to the veterinary surgeon who carried out the operations and who was, therefore, personally responsible for their proper execution; payment of reactor grants to farmers was conditional on removal of reactor animals from farms direct for slaughter within a maximum of ten days from the date the herdowner was notified to remove the animal; tight official supervision of all trading at marts, including control of trading hours; strict enforcement of all procedures and prosecution in all cases of detected breaches of the law and regulations relating to disease eradication; establishment of a central epidemiology unit in the Department of Agriculture to co-ordinate <Col N="1915" /> and assist in the analysis of disease outbreaks, prevention of disease spread and so on.</P>
    <P>Apart from the record number of tests, it is worthy of note that 4,629 herds were restricted at the end of the round, i.e. on 6 April, 1986 and 7,849 herds became restricted due to the discovery of reactors in the course of the monitor and special programmes.  The disease prevalence recorded at the end of the round, 2.42 per cent, is a significant improvement on the situation at 31 October 1985 when the highest level of prevalence during the round was recorded, i.e. 3.73 per cent, equivalent to 7,128 herds restricted.  It is also an encouraging feature that from October 1985 to the end of the round in April 1986 prevalence levels fell consistently throughout the country.  Some 34,000 reactors were slaughtered during the round.</P>
    <P>The 1985-86 round of testing was highly successful.  Based on the disciplined procedures which I have mentioned we were able to carry out a full monitor round of testing on the entire national herd in record time as well as carrying out a special testing programme in the highrisk herds.  The net result was that the national herd was, on average, TB tested almost one and a half times, and twice or more in the worst-affected areas.  This was the most comprehensive testing campaign carried out since the scheme began, and significant progress was achieved. Our predictions of the trend in disease outbreaks were fully borne out.  The prevalence of disease increased during the early months of the programme, reaching a peak at the end of October, when 7,128 herds were restricted, representing a herd prevalence of 3.73 per cent.</P>
    <P>Since then the situation has steadily improved and at the end of the round on 6 April, the prevalence figure had fallen to 2.42 per cent with 4,629 herds restricted. Such progress would not have been achieved without the whole-hearted support and commitment of all concerned including the farmers, veterinary practitioners and officials.  As the Minister for <Col N="1916" /> Agriculture said recently: &ldquo;The discipline and sense of purpose which they displayed indicates what can be achieved through co-operation and determination&rdquo;. There is, however, no room for complacency.  The number of herds restricted shows progress but in view of the number of clear herds at risk from diseased herds it is clear that an enormous task remains to be carried out, especially in some counties where the levels of disease are worrying.</P>
    <P>This is why, faced with a difficult budgetary situation, we have embarked upon a selective approach concentrating on badly infected areas.  Testing is being concentrated in areas considered most likely to yield the best returns in terms of identifying reactors and controlling the spread of disease.  The current programme will therefore match testing activity to disease prevalence, with special regard to a certain minimum level of activity in all counties.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the unavoidable cut-back in resources there will still be very considerable expenditure on TB eradication this year.  The selective programme coupled with special campaigns in south west Cork and the north midlands &mdash; two particularly bad regions &mdash; together with the normal backup service which will continue to be provided in the case of locked up herds, will contribute greatly to the fight against TB.  Furthermore, we shall continue to seek ways of improving the scheme.  I hope to see shortly the introduction of a reactor collection service with State assistance in the region covering Cork, Kerry and Limerick.  We have increased the ceiling payments from the depopulation fund from £6,000 to £10,000 with corresponding increases in the stock replacement scheme and we have introduced a special incentive for the disposal of latent carriers of disease, that is, animals which do not react to the test but which in the opinion of the Department's veterinary officers could be the source of disease.</P>
    <P>The success in the campaign against brucellosis, marked by the achievement <Col N="1917" /> of officially brucellosis free status earlier this year, is an excellent example of what can be achieved with co-operation, discipline and proper procedures.  I am confident that with this same mix of co-operation, <Col N="1918" /> discipline and procedures we will also succeed in getting rid of bovine TB from the national herd.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 12.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 2 July 1986 until 10.30 a.m.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Dukes) Alan Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Dukes)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Criminal Justice (Community Service) Act, 1983, which was brought into effect by ministerial order on 5 December 1984, enables a court to make a community service order in respect of any offender over 16 years of age who has been convicted of an offence for which the appropriate sentence would otherwise be a custodial one.  Under a community service order the offender must perform a specified number of hours of unpaid work for the benefit of the community.  Before making an order, the court must consider a report on the offender prepared by a probation and welfare officer.  The court must satisfy itself that the offender is a <Col N="1666" /> suitable person to perform work under a community service order and that arrangements exist for him to undertake such work.  The work is carried out under the general supervision of the probation and welfare service of the Department of Justice.</P>
      <P>Community service is generally performed in an individual's spare time and, therefore, during the course of an order, the offender will continue to be available to discharge his family and employment commitments.  If an offender is unemployed, community service may be performed by him for up to three days per week without affecting entitlement to Social Welfare employment payments provided he would be free to take up a job if one should become available.</P>
      <P>Where an offender fails to carry out the community service obligations in a satisfactory fashion &mdash; for example, absenteeism &mdash; arrangements may be made by the supervising probation and welfare officer to have him brought back before the court.  In that event the offender would have to explain to the court the reason for non-compliance.  The offender may at that stage be dealt with in any way, including imprisonment, that he could have been dealt with in the first instance for the offence.</P>
      <P>Up to 31 May 1986 a total of 1,553 convicted persons have been referred by the courts for reports.  One thousand and thirty-five orders have been made during that period.  Four hundred and fifty-three of those orders have been satisfactorily completed.  Fifty-two offenders who failed to comply with the requirements of community service orders were returned to court and a custodial sentence was imposed in each case.  The average length of the orders made was between 85-90 hours.</P>
      <P>A wide range of activities has been undertaken for the benefit of various groups of individuals in the community, including construction work for the physically handicapped, painting and decorating work in hostels for homeless men and preparing meals in day centres.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am satisfied with the operation of community service so far.  Orders have <Col N="1667" /> been made in all District Court areas throughout the country and in a number of Circuit Court areas.  General indications are that the introduction of community service in this country has been justified.</P>

      <P>The Tara ore reserves indicated in my replies of 4 and 5 June 1986 were the net proven and probable ore reserves as at, 31 December 1985; none of these reserves had been extracted prior to 31 December 1985.</P>
      <P>The Geological Survey has not made any calculation of the recoverable reserves in the Tara leasehold remaining to be extracted at 31 December, 1985.  Apart from the information already provided in reply to other questions, I am not aware of any calculation of &ldquo;recoverable reserves&rdquo; made by Tara.  As this is a variable concept which would be governed by the play of market forces and other factors, I do not think it would be appropriate to endeavour to procure such information.</P>

      <P>Apart from a section of the Miltown Malbay/Kilrush road which is classified as national secondary route N 67, the roads in question form part of the network of regional roads.</P>
      <P>The improvement of the N67 is being carried out on a phased annual basis with the aid of full cost road grants.  The 1986 grant commitments for improvement works on the road total £200,000 in respect of work at Calluragh and between Kilrush and the ferry terminal.  The road will also benefit from the 1986 commitment of £554,000, notified for maintenance of the national secondary roads in County Clare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Primary responsibility for the planning and execution of any improvement works on regional roads, including the timing and the provision of the necessary finance, rests with the local authority. <Col N="1678" /> The local authority may, at their discretion, use the block grant for roads to supplement expenditure from their own resources for such works.  The block grant of £711,000 made available to Clare County Council in 1986 represents an increase of 22 per cent on the corresponding grant in 1985.  In addition, the 1986 road grant commitments notified to the local authority include a sum of £90,000 for regional road strengthening and I understand that part of this grant will be used to finance works at Cooraclare, between Miltown Malbay and Kilrush.  A road grant commitment of £130,000 has been provided this year towards the cost of improvement works at Tuamgreany, south of Scariff.</P>
    <P>It is not possible, at this stage, to provide any additional road grants because the funds available in 1986 have been fully allocated.</P>

The provision, in conjunction with the Mid-Western Health Board, of a health care centre and medical services, which forms part of the proposal, is a matter for the Department of Health to which it has been referred.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may be assured that I recognise fully the need for the early provision of community facilities in new housing areas.  However, the financing of items such as shopping facilities and community care centres is not a matter appropriate to my Department.</P>

      <P>1,000 temporary clerical trainees were appointed to various Government Departments for a one year period of service following the publication of the White Paper <i>Serving the Country Better</i> in September 1985.  As announced in the White Paper, a number of trainees will, depending on their performance during training, be given an opportunity of competing for permanent positions in the Civil Service.  It is intended to hold a competition in October 1986 confined to temporary clerical trainees, serving on 1 September 1986 for 100 clerical assistant posts in the Civil Service.  Those appointed to permanent posts from the competition will become eligible for the full range of formal training provided for the grade of clerical assistant, in addition to specific &ldquo;on-the-job&rdquo; training.</P>

There is also a free bottled <Col N="1713" /> gas scheme and this gas, in common with natural gas and most other non-road fuels, is liable to VAT at the 10 per cent rate.  VAT applies to all supplies of natural gas at this rate regardless of the status of the purchaser.  Only in this way can the tax operate efficiently and effectively.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department of Health recognises the crucial importance of medical manpower planning in the health services due to the numbers and costs involved.  This is particularly important in view of the high proportion of pay costs to overall costs and the high talent and long time involved in training doctors.  Effective medical manpower planning is the health services presents huge challenges.  The size of the workforce is large; ther are multiple grades and specialities, workloads can be variable and cover is usually needed 24 hours a day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department of Health has initiated an analysis of the medical manpower situation in Ireland.  The Department recognises the necessity of soundly based rational analysis in this regard.  Decisions can only be taken in this area after the most careful consideration because they may influence the career opportunities and income levels of health professionals.  For these reasons the Department of Health has not drawn up the total projected manpower needs <Col N="1717" /> and the needs in each medical discipline for each five year period to the year 2000.</P>
    <P>There is not a medical manpower board in existence.  The analysis and examination of medical manpower is being conducted within the Department of Health in consultation with the relevant bodies, and with the most recent available information.  The Department is the competent authority in this regard and has the expertise available and for these reasons I do not intend to establish a medical manpower board.</P>

He is, accordingly, in receipt of unemployment assistance at £7.80 <Col N="1723" /> weekly, being the appropriate maximum rate payable in his case of £67.05 less means of £59.25.  He appealed against the means assessment and an appeals officer, on 14 January 1985, also assessed his means at £59.25 weekly.  He was informed of this decision.</P>
      <P>If the person concerned is now of the opinion that his circumstances have changed in that he is incurring additional expenses in operating his farm, it is open to him to request a review of his means. A form for this purpose may be obtained from his local office.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed disability benefit from 6 June 1984 to date.  He was paid from 6 June 1984 to 8 June 1985, after which date his entitlement to benefit was exhausted as he had under 156 contributions paid on his behalf, since entry into insurable employment. However, it has now been established that he has in fact 156 contributions recorded on his behalf, and is therefore entitled to continuous payment of benefit.</P>
      <P>The person concerned is currently in receipt of disabled persons maintenance allowance, which will cease with effect from 17 July 1986.  Disability benefit will be issued from that date at the maximum rate payable to a single man.  Arrears of benefit are being withheld pending receipt of details of supplementary welfare allowance paid by the Southern Health Board.  An application form for invalidity pension has been issued on 30 June 1986, to the person concerned.</P>

      <P>The person concerned is a married woman and she was in receipt of <Col N="1725" /> unemployment benefit up to 26 December 1984 when she had drawn her maximum entitlement of 312 days benefit.  In order to requalify for unemployment benefit she requires at least a further 13 weeks contributions paid at the appropriate class providing cover against unemployment. Weeks of employment since the date on which she received 156 days of unemployment benefit may count for this purpose.  However, as she had no insurable employment after 156 days of her benefit claim she does not requalify for payment of benefit.</P>
      <P>In accordance with the equality provisions implemented under the Social Welfare Act, 1986, the maximum duration of unemployment benefit payable to married women was increased from 312 to 390 days with effect from 15 May 1986. This applied to both new claims from 15 May 1986 and also to claims on which the previous maximum of 312 days had not been drawn by that date.  Also under transitional arrangements a claimant, who had drawn 312 days benefit in the three-month period from 14 February 1986 to 14 May 1986 and continued to prove unemployment, was entitled to payment of benefit from 15 May 1986 to the date on which she would normally have completed 390 days on her claim. However, as the person concerned had drawn her 312 days entitlement on 26 December 1984 she is not entitled to additional payment from 15 May 1986. She has continued to sign the unemployed register since 27 December 1984 for credited contribution purposes.</P>

      <P>Arising from the legislation to provide equal treatment between men and women in regard to social welfare schemes, the duration of unemployment <Col N="1726" /> benefit for married women was extended from 312 days to 390 days, the same as men and single women, with effect from 15 May 1986.  Any married woman claimant who exhausted 312 days unemployment benefit on or after 15 May 1986 is entitled to an additional 78 days benefit. Under transitional arrangements married women who exhausted their entitlement within 78 days prior to 15 May 1986 are entitled to benefit in respect of the remaining days of unemployment after that date.</P>
      <P>Married women who exhausted their entitlement to 312 days unemployment benefit more than 78 days prior to 15 May 1986 did not qualify for extended payments.  Records are not kept in such a way as to enable details to be readily obtained of the numbers in this situation who may have applied for and been refused payment.  Such persons can requalify for unemployment benefit after they have had a further 13 weeks of insurable employment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mrs. Hussey)</NameTxt>
      <P>A claim to optical benefit was received from the person concerned on 29 May 1986.  In order to qualify for optical <Col N="1727" /> benefit a claimant must satisfy certain statutory contribution conditions one of which requires a person over 21 years of age to have had not less than 26 reckonable contributions paid or credited in the contribution year which governs the claim.  The governing contribution year for claims made during 1986 is the 1984-85 contribution year from 6 April 1984 to 5 April 1985.  According to the Department's available records the claimant had only 21 contributions (credited) in this period.  She was not, therefore, qualified for optical benefit and she was informed of the position on 3 June 1986.</P>
      <P>PRSI contributions at Class K rate have, since her retirement in 1980, been paid on behalf of the person concerned in respect of an occupational pension from her last employer.  Contributions at Class K however give entitlement only to benefits under the Health Acts and are not reckonable for optical benefit purposes under the Social Welfare Acts.</P>

      <P>Entitlement to unemployment assistance is subject to the condition that a person must be available for, capable of and genuinely seeking work.  The person concerned was in receipt of unemployment assistance up to 6 May 1986.  His claim was disallowed from 7 May 1986 following his refusal, for medical reasons, to accept an offer of employment under the social employment scheme with Cavan County Council.  He furnished medical evidence stating that he was unfit for work and he also stated himself that he was not capable of employment outside his own holding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He appealed against the disallowance of his claim on 26 June 1986 and arrangements are being made to submit his case to an appeals officer for determination at the earliest possible opportunity.  His entitlement to unemployment assistance will be reviewed in the light of the outcome of the appeal.  In the meantime, if the means of the person concerned are insufficient to meet his needs it is open <Col N="1745" /> to him to claim supplementary welfare allowance from the health board by contacting his local community welfare officer.</P>

      <P>From experience it has been found that the most effective method of control of disability benefit claimants is by means of the Department's medical referees.  Claimants are referred to them for a second medical opinion to ensure that only those who are genuinely ill and incapable of work are in fact paid disability benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The person concerned is claiming disability benefit since 9 July 1984.  He has been called for examination by medical referees on four occasions since June <Col N="1746" /> 1985.  He attended one examination on 12 December 1986 and the medical referee who examined him considered that he was incapable of work.  However, he recommended a further examination in the near future.  Further medical referee examinations were arranged on 24 February and 19 May 1986 neither of which he attended.</P>
    <P>While he has stated in correspondence to the Department that he has spent time in hospitals in Dublin, Cork and England and has undergone major surgery he has not submitted any hospital reports for consideration by the Department's medical adviser.</P>
    <P>Arrangements are presently being made to have the person concerned examined by a medical referee in the near future.  His claim will be reviewed in the light of this further examination.  All disability benefit payable to 5 July 1986 has been issued.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed unemployment benefit from 9 December 1982 to 12 March 1984.  Following inquiries by a social welfare officer it came to light that he was not unemployed during the periods 1 June 1983 to 7 June 1983 and from 21 September 1983 to 22 November 1983.  Consequently his claim was disallowed in respect of these periods on the grounds that he was not unemployed and an overpayment of £1,132.33 was assessed against him.</P>
      <P>He appealed against the disallowance of his claim and his case was listed for an oral hearing on three separate occasions &mdash; for 10 September 1985, 31 October 1985 and 8 January 1986.

    <P>Notes:</P>
    <P>(a) Because the scheme was introduced in late 1980, the sheep headage inspections for 1980 were used for ewe premium purposes in the disadvantaged areas while outside these areas, random inspections were carried out in January and February 1981.</P>
    <P>(b) For the marketing years 1981-82 to 1983-84, <Col N="1754" /> it was possible under the EC Regulations then in force to carry out inspections during each marketing year.</P>
    <P>(c) Changes in the EC Regulations notably the introduction of a 100 day retention period during which flocks must be inspected involved a switch to later inspections for 1984-85. As sheep numbers have increased in recent years, this is to be advantage of most flock owners in Ireland.</P>
    <P>(d) Marketing years previously covered the year ending April but this was changed to a calendar year basis for 1986.  The &ldquo;year&rdquo; 1985 covers, in effect, a nine month period.</P>
    <P>(e) Inspection arrangements in respect of the 1986 marketing year have yet to be finalised in Brussels.</P>

      <P>The Community has considerable overproduction in a number of sectors and various policy changes have been made over the last decade to take account of that factor.  We are heavily dependent on the CAP for the viability of farming in Ireland and it is important to us that the policy is adapted so that it remains viable in current circumstances.  It is, of course, also important that farmers and processors become much more market-orientated and less dependent on support mechanisms.</P>
      <P>I would also refer the Deputy to the Debate in this House on 29 April on this year's EC farm price package.</P>

It would, however, be contrary to established practice to give details of the patrols operating in a particular area at any given time.</P>
      <P>As regards the incidence of burglaries in the area in question, the Garda authorities state that a neighbourhood watch scheme launched by the local community last year is in the course of development and they hope that this scheme, together with the current patrolling arrangements for the area, will help to prevent crimes such as burglary and to allay the fears of the elderly people living there.</P>

The Garda authorities are taking part in discussions with RTE on the matter and are willing to co-operate in any way open to them.  However, I wish to emphasise that, as stated by my predecessor in reply to a similar Parliamentary Question (No. 166) on 19 November <Col N="1758" /> 1985, the radio equipment and transmission channels being used by the gardaí meet with the approval of the appropriate licencing authority.</P>

      <P>The tabular statement hereunder sets out most of the particulars sought by the Deputy in relation to the last competition for entry to the Garda Síochána.</P>
      <P>The position about the other particulars sought is as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Candidates who qualified at the competitive interview conducted by the Civil Service Commissioners in the last recruitment competition were placed in order of merit by the commissioners and considered for appointment in that order. Candidates who are successful at the medical examination and, where appropriate, oral Irish test, and who are otherwise suitable, are offered appointment in that order.  Recruitment is continuing but a decision has not yet been taken as to precisely how many more of those who <Col N="1762" /> qualified in the last recruitment competition will be offered appointments.  This will depend mainly on when the next recruitment competition is held.  I hope to be in a position shortly to announce details of the new recruitment competition which is planned to be held later this year.  It is not clear what category of candidate the Deputy is referring to at (h) of the question.  As already indicated, qualified candidates are considered for and offered appointment in order of merit.  It could happen, however, that the timing of a candidate's appointment could be affected by the need to undergo a second medical examination, or at times a candidates call-up might be deferred at his own request.</P>

      <P>The basis for the general requirement of a minimum of four grade Cs in higher level papers in the leaving certificate examination for purposes of the higher education grants scheme is to give financial assistance to students who reach a high standard in the leaving certificate but who, because of family financial circumstances, might not be in a position to proceed to a university or other approved third level course of education.  The <Col N="1765" /> higher education grants scheme is, therefore, based firstly on attainment and secondly on the need for financial assistance. Special consideration is given to students obtaining a grade C or higher level in higher level papers in the subjects Irish and mathematics, and also in science and engineering subjects.  The specification of a requirement of a minimum of grade C in two subjects in higher level papers is considered appropriate for the award of third level scholarships by vocational education committees, for attendance at the regional technical colleges and colleges of technology, having regard to the standard of the relevant courses and of the qualifications to be awarded to successful students.</P>

      <P>In accordance with the provisions of the Government's National Plan, <i>Building on Reality: 1985-1987</i>, the increase to be made in the maintenance element of grants and the income eligibility limits on the higher education grant and related schemes in 1986 is that which is warranted by reference to the rate of inflation since 1985.</P>
      <P>In accordance with that provision increases as follows have been made in the higher education grant and related schemes for the 1986-87 academic year: (a) the maintenance elements of grants were increased by 4.59 per cent (e.g. the maximum grant was increased from £1,160 to £1,213), and (b) the income eligibility limits were increased by 4.59 per cent (e.g. the upper income eligibility limit was increased from £16,540 to £17,300).</P>
      <P>I wish, also, to say that the lecture fee element of grants is being increased in line with the increases in third level college fees for the 1986-87 academic year.</P>

      <P>There is no such statutory instrument.  As I indicated in my answer to Questions Nos. 157 and 158 on 4 June 1986 the deed of trust for Community Schools provides, <i>inter alia,</i> that: &ldquo;Subject to the provisions of the Minister as to the general educational character of the school and its place in the educational system the Board shall have the general direction of the conduct and curriculum of the school&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Cooney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 272 and 273 together.  The model lease or deed of trust for community schools is not a statutory instrument but is a model of a contractual agreement between the parties involved in the establishment of a community school.  The provisions of the Statutory Instruments Act, 1947, do not, therefore, apply.  My powers in the matter derive from the Ministers and Secretaries Act, 1924, and the State Property Act, 1954.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that there is nothing in the model lease which is unconstitutional.</P>
