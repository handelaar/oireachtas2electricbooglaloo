      <P>The details of redundancies already effected by the Office of Public Works for the years in question are as per tabular statement which I propose to circulate with the reply.

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that some of the best experts in the Office of Public Works are about to be displaced and made redundant?  In view of the fact that there are at least one million acres of land, particularly in the west, needing to be drained, even at this late hour, would the Minister reconsider transferring those people to Dunkellin or other catchment areas in the county to ensure that their expertise is not lost to the State?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. A. Doyle Mrs. A. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>It should be understood that while some drainage employees can be retained for maintenance operations and others sometimes can and will be transferred to new construction schemes, employment on drainage generally means employment for the lifetime of a particular scheme only.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that some of these people being made redundant are some of the most expert in her Department?  Is she aware that some of these have been employed there since 1950 and 1955?  Having given that level of service to the State &mdash; bearing in mind that the job has not yet been completed &mdash; would the Minister agree that there is no way she can justify terminating their employment while ample work remains for them in the western area?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. A. Doyle Mrs. A. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted the Minister has admitted that her main purpose was to heal the rifts in her party in that area.  Having examined the Portumna Castle project where 50 jobs could be created over five years and alluding to her earlier remarks from which it appears that most of the jobs in her Department are of a temporary nature, can the Minister give any commitment &mdash; after what she has seen at Portumna Castle or harbour &mdash; that she can sanction some project between now and Christmas?</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that the timber for roofing Portumna Castle was delivered three years ago and is still in storage awaiting sanction of the necessary moneys to proceed with the work?  In view of the high unemployment in the area and in view of the vast contribution that this castle could make to the development of tourism in SouthEast Galway and North Tipperary, will she now consider sanctioning the project for immediate commencement?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance (a) whether, under Article 25 of the Ireland-UK Double Taxation Convention, any information has been received from the UK authorities in relation to bank deposits of Irish residents in the UK; and, if so, the number and amount of such deposits; (b) whether any arrangements have been made for granting reciprocal information to the UK authorities in relation to bank deposits in Ireland by UK residents; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The terms of Article 25 (Exchange of Information) of the Ireland-United Kingdom Double Taxation Convention, 1976, are similar to provisions contained in the Model Double Taxation Convention which were being formulated at that time by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and which were published in 1977.  The provisions are also on the same lines as corresponding provisions in other double taxation treaties concluded by Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Article 25 provides for the exchange of information necessary for the carrying out of the Convention and domestic tax law in each country.  In this regard it should be noted that, in general, information is not returned to the Revenue authorities here on bank deposits to which the retention tax applies or in respect of which a declaration of non-resident beneficial ownership has been made.  Any information available for <Col N="1779" /> exchange under Article 25 is strictly confidential between the Irish and UK Revenue authorities and therefore I cannot reply in detail on that matter.  There are no special arrangements for granting reciprocal information to the UK authorities in relation to bank deposits and none are envisaged.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a pity that this information is not available to Members of this House.  I contend that the provisions of the Finance Act, 1986, taken together with the provisions of the double taxation convention have resulted in the exodus of much finance from this country because the double taxation agreement and the provisions in the Finance Act, 1986, required disclosure of non-residents' accounts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of what the Minister has said, that information passed between the Revenue authorities in Ireland and the UK is strictly confidential, would he not acknowledge that that is the main cause of the problem in relation to non-resident accounts here or <i>vice versa</i>?  Would he not agree that the apprehension is sufficient to encourage the run on deposits out of this country <Col N="1780" /> which has been a feature of the last 12 months, in particular since the DIRT tax was introduced?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The practice in regard to the double taxation agreement has not been changed.  There was some misinformed comment upon which I have made statements in order to clarify it and to put it in context, clearly indicating that the practice was not changed in so far as double taxation arrangements for exchange of information is concerned.  I do not accept, nor do the experts who have studied matters concerning the outflow of funds, the residual factor in the balance of payments, that the deposit interest retention tax or arrangements of this kind were a significant factor affecting any outflow.  They may have had some minimal effect but it was minimal in comparison to other factors which contributed to the temporary outflow of funds.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not agree that while the practice has not changed the law has changed?  The application of the practice to new law, namely deposit interest retention tax in particular, has had a very damaging effect and has meant not only a very significant outflow&mdash;&mdash;</P>

That at least would amount to the same as the money that went out of the country.  The practice may not have changed but the law has and the application of the practice to the law is the big problem.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">

      <P>There has been a change in the law in regard to the powers of the Revenue Commissioners to get information for their own use in order <Col N="1781" /> to eliminate the practice of bogus nonresidents' accounts in the hands of people who are resident here but claiming to be resident elsewhere.  I am sure that neither the Deputy nor any other Member of this House would condone this activity or criticise anything the Revenue Commissioners might do as being necessary to stamp out the use of bogus accounts as a means of taxing them.</P>

      <P>I drew the Minister's attention to a reply from the Minister for Finance to a question on Wednesday, 18 June 1986 in which the first sentence of the Minister's reply was &ldquo;By end-May 1986 the Farm Classification Office had determined the adjusted acreage of 2,340 farm holdings&rdquo;. The Minister now in November <Col N="1784" /> 1986 informs me that it is only 2,100.  Can he reconcile these figures?  Was I misled in June 1986 in the reply that was given?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite possible, if the Deputy thinks about it for a moment, to reconcile the two figures.  Of the farms that would have been classified during that period some would have turned out to be more than 150 adjusted acres and some to be less than 150 acres.  The 2,143 farms that I refer to are the ones that have been classified in this year's list as being over 150 acres, because it is only those to which the tax will apply.  Obviously, more farms will have been assessed than the total number which are over 150 acres.  These, of course, will be subject to display in classification lists in subsequent years when a lower limit for applicability of the tax will be possible on the basis that all relevant farms in that acreage category will by then have been classified.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister explain why he cannot estimate then on the 2,000 odd holdings of over 150 adjusted acres what the revenue will be next year from this tax?  Can he indicate when he expects that the estimate given by his predecessor this time 12 months of £60 million to £70 million intake for 1986 will be achieved?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is too early yet to be able to say what the yield from the tax will be in 1987 in that we are not certain at this stage what level in acreage terms will be the one above which the tax will apply on the date 1 September 1987 when one will have to close the books, so to speak.  To determine what the acreage is above which the tax will apply one will have done at that stage a comprehensive evaluation of all the holdings with adjusted acreages above the level in question. Until the level is set it is not possible to determine what the yield of the tax will be.  It is also necessary before determining the yield of the tax to determine what the rate of the tax will be.  As the Deputy is aware, a formula is provided in the Bill for this purpose but it is not possible at this stage to say definitely <Col N="1785" /> what figure that formula will throw up. Clearly, the yield of the tax will depend principally on the rate at which it is possible for the officers of the farm tax commissioners' office to complete valuations and classifications to enable the level above which the tax is to apply to be set reasonably low.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it then that they include a significant amount of purchase of material.  In that light may I put it to the Minister that the extra revenue which has been generated from the increase in tax is insignificant when compared with the revenue loss the Exchequer has had to bear and which is being caused by the downturn in the construction industry, a downturn that has been based directly on the increase in this taxation, and that therefore the increase was a retrograde step?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I cannot agree with the Deputy.  The decline in the level of construction is due primarily to a decline in the level of demand, a decline in the ability of people to buy new housing.  Of a 7 per cent decline it has been estimated that only 2 per cent is attributable to the VAT increase and that the rest is due to demand factors which would have applied regardless of whether the VAT change had been made.  I am sure the Deputy will agree that the level of yield as a result of the increase in rate has been quite substantial. If that yield had not been obtained the Government would have been forced to look at other sources for taxation.  I am sure the Deputy will agree that there are not many such sources available.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. A. Doyle Mrs. A. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>The National Monuments (Amendment) Bill, 1986, currently before the Seanad deals with this problem among others.  Treasure trove can be defined broadly as any gold or silver, whether coin, plate or bullion, found in the ground or in any other secret place in circumstances which indicate that somebody hid it with the intention of recovering it.  Treasure trove is explicitly excluded from the definition of an archaeological object in the National Monuments Act because it is deemed to be the property of the State.  However, the decision of the High Court in the Derrynaflan case was to the effect that treasure trove law does not apply in Ireland.  If this is upheld by the Supreme Court, all archaeological objects, including those which up to now were classed as treasure trove will come within the provisions of the National Monuments Acts in future. These provisions make it an offence to dig for archaeological objects without a licence from the Commissioners of Public Works.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One problem is that while a person might be observed using a metal detector at a site of archaeological or historical interest, it is difficult to catch anybody in the act of digging up such objects.  The National Monuments (Amendment) Bill, 1986, will make it an offence to be in possession of a metal detector at a protected site of historic or archaeological interest.  The National Monuments Acts also provide that archaeological objects must be reported to the Garda Síochána or the Director of the National Museum. Failure to do so is an offence.  It is also an offence to damage any such object <Col N="1790" /> or to export it without a licence.  The amending Bill will increase the fines for such offences.</P>

There will be specific provisions to include interested local groups such as local historical societies and others to help us in this most important role.

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. A. Doyle Mrs. A. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputies are aware, a decision in principle has been made by the Government to transfer management of Dún Laoghaire Harbour from the Commissioners of Public Works to a new harbour authority.  One of the first tasks of this new authority will be to provide accommodation for themselves.  The former nautical college premises may be required for that purpose, at least in the short term.  The premises might also be required for harbour purposes should it be decided to provide a unified car ferry terminal at Dún Laoghaire Harbour. Given these considerations it is not possible at present to decide on the long term future use of the premises but the position may become clearer in the next few months.</P>

It is a really magnificent location.  It is a wonderful college which should never have been closed down.  Unfortunately it was, and perhaps this is an opportunity to reinstate it.  But I am grateful to the Minister for the comprehensive nature of her reply.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as Deputy Byrne's question is concerned, and that is the only one that is relevant today, it is suggested that income tax relief be given in respect of interest on money borrowed to buy cars.  I am not in favour of that because I am not in favour generally of further increases in tax relief for interest charges.  If this were done it would mean that the people who saved out of after tax income to buy something like a car would get no income tax relief whereas those who borrowed would get tax relief.  That would be inequitable and I do not believe it would be a good tax move.</P>

Car numbers are down by 25,000 units, petrol sales are down by 20 per cent, and jobs are down by 9,000 since 1980.  Would the Minister not consider that this or some other proposal is not only appropriate but absolutely urgent to ensure that the motor industry is not driven underground?

      <P>The officer in question was informed of her promotion prospects orally in September 1984 and September, 1985 &mdash; i.e. that she was unsuitable for promotion.  She was informed in writing in October 1985 of the reason she had not been promoted prior to 1980 &mdash; the letter noted that she had been informed of her current prospects.  In December 1985 the reasons for her unsuitability were fully discussed with her.</P>
      <P>The proper course for this officer to follow is to avail of the grievance procedure which is a specific part of the structure of the Civil Service for dealing with such matters as are raised in the question.  She has not done so.</P>
      <P>An officer is entitled to information affecting his/her conduct, performance and prospects.  Procedures are in place for appraisal of officers and for dealing with grievances.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister saying that this civil servant, a middle-aged lady who worked for some decades in the Department, is entitled to a clear statement outlining why she has been passed over a number of years?

      <P>As I indicated in my reply, the unsuitability of this lady for promotion, in the view of her superiors, <Col N="1797" /> was fully discussed with her in December 1985.  As I said, if she is not satisfied with that she has available an agreed grievance procedure where she can take the matter to a higher authority for determination. I do not think it is a good idea to raise matters of this kind in the House.  This is not entirely consistent with the Deputy's parties espoused policy of public service reform where there is to be a greater degree of derogation of authority within the public service rather than a greater degree of centralisation of matters of this kind in the hands of Ministers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I am naturally grateful to the Minister for his opinion about whether I should raise this matter in the House, but the point I am making is that somebody who has served long and well in a Government Department was unable to get in writing a clear statement why she was found to be not suitable for promotion when those who were trained by her were subsequently promoted.  She is not interested any longer in promotion because, in her own words, her heart is broken because of the way she has been treated.  She simply wants to know why she was not promoted.  I want the Minister to tell me if civil servants have the right to such information about themselves in writing, not in the context of a personal chat about a matter like this.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister not agree that it would seem very desirable that the Minister should issue guidelines to all such bodies under this authority to ensure that anybody engaged in executive functions would not engage in the kind of activity referred to by Deputy De Rossa?  Is it not a matter for the Minister to issue the guidelines to each State body to guarantee that there cannot be a conflict of interest?  The Minister should not just rely on the management decision of a State body.</P>

      <P>I could not agree with that.  Essentially it is part of the system of semi-State bodies here which has been quite successful that day to day management matters are a matter for the companies concerned.  I would not wish to trespass unilaterally into the area of day to day management.  However, it is my responsibility to satisfy myself in general that such guidelines as are appropriate exist and are followed in general. That is something which I would consider to be part of my responsibility but it would not be wise, for many reasons, including the fact that these bodies all differ in their activities, to issue general guidelines from the Minister when the issuing of such guidelines is a matter of day to day management and is more appropriately done by the board concerned who would have a knowledge of the risks they wished to guard against.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Considerable progress has been made towards the objective of halting the deterioration in the public finances.  As the plan itself recognised, divergence from specific targets might arise if the economic outlook developed other than as envisaged at the time.  This is, in fact, what happened.  However, progress has been made under a number of the heads listed in the sections to which the Deputy refers:</P>
      <P>&mdash; the Exchequer borrowing requirement has been reduced from 15.7 per cent of GNP in 1982 to this year's projected outturn of 13.1 per cent;</P>
      <P>&mdash; the public sector borrowing requirement has been reduced from a level of 19.9 per cent in 1982 to this year's projected 15.5 per cent;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&mdash; foreign interest payments have fallen from 4.9 per cent of GNP in <Col N="1806" /> 1984 and over 5 per cent in 1985 to this year's projected level of 4.3 per cent;</P>
    <P>&mdash; the balance of payments deficit has been reduced to about half the level envisaged in the plan, in other words, a larger reduction has been achieved.</P>
    <P>It is acknowledged that the current budget deficit has not fallen but the reasons for this have been made clear in a number of statements, most recently in the statement accompanying the publication of the end-September Exchequer returns.</P>
    <P>The Government, on 16 October last, reaffirmed their commitment to make further progress towards reducing borrowing. The 1987 Exchequer borrowing requirement will be less than 11.8 per cent and the current budget deficit will be reduced to not more than 7.4 per cent of GNP.  Furthermore, such a reduction in the borrowing requirement will mean that its non-interest component will be reduced to less than one-half of 1 per cent of GNP so that in effect almost all of our borrowing next year will go towards repaying interest on past debt.  It is worth noting that in 1981 the amount we borrowed for non-interest purposes was 8½ per cent of GNP as against one-half of 1 per cent of GNP which is likely to be the case in 1987.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>We will make a judgment as to how much time is wasted by a contribution from any source in the <Col N="1807" /> House.  I wish to address myself to the following targets in <i>Building on Reality</i> which were described as minimum steps. It said that the target for Government borrowing as a percentage of GNP was 9.75 per cent but, by the end of 1986, it will be 13.5 per cent.  We were told that the national debt would be stabilised as a percentage of GNP at about 133 per cent but, at the end of this year, it will be 146 per cent of GNP reaching an all time record of £23 billion.  We were told that the total current expenditure would be 46 per cent of GNP and it is already estimated to be over 50 per cent of GNP. We were told that the budget deficit would be 5 per cent of GNP next year but clearly it will exceed 8 per cent at the end of this year.  We were told that taxation would not rise as a share of national output at 36 per cent of GNP but already the 1986 outturn represents 37.3 per cent of GNP.  If that kind of increase on all the fiscal aggregates represents progress, minimum steps or otherwise, will the Minister acknowledge that the document has no relevance now? All the main targets in <i>Building on Reality</i> have not only not been realised but have been clearly abandoned.  Does the Minister intend, even with the Government's last gasp, to introduce a new target to which we might be able to adhere?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have already indicated, the Government made decisions regarding the borrowing requirement for next year and for the current budget deficit for 1987.  The position is that some of the targets set in <i>Building on Reality</i> have been under-achieved &mdash; not surprisingly the Deputy has not dwelt on those &mdash; but other targets have been overachieved. For instance, in the area of bringing down the level of the balance of payments deficit we have achieved more than that projected.  The same applies to inflation.  We have achieved more than was expected.  Obviously, any plan of that kind is based on certain assumptions of what will happen in the world outside. Ireland is not an island in the world economy <Col N="1808" /> in the sense that it is unaffected by outside developments as 60 per cent of what we produce is exported.  A number of external factors negatively affected our ability to achieve some of our targets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, if we are to be treated to a lecture on external factors it will take ten minutes. Could the Minister indicate which external factors put the plan off course?  No doubt he will refer to falling oil prices which should have been a help&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>There are external factors in two senses, external to the country and to what the Government can directly control exclusively by their own actions.  In regard to the former, there was a slow growth in world demand for goods in general and for Irish exports in particular&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Hence, there was a fall in tax levels.  Furthermore, the volume of spending by Irish people and thereby the paying of value added and other taxes grew by only 19 per cent over the period as against a 26 per cent growth which was assumed in the figures underlying the plan.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government also abolished the income tax levy which meant that there was a reduction in the level of assumed take from taxation. There was a reduction in non-tax revenue from the 4.4 per cent projected to 3.7 per cent.  The main reason for this was the fall in the contribution to the Exchequer by Bord Gáis Éireann.

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance the total in (a) Exchequer foreign debt; (b) total State foreign debt; and (c) annual interest repayments in Irish currency as a direct consequence of the unilateral devaluation of our currency in the EMS; and if he will make a statement on the consequences for the economy generally.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The need to seek a downward adjustment of the central rate for the Irish pound in the EMS on 1 August 1986 arose from the sharp drop in the value of both sterling and the US dollar.  The depreciation of these currencies had resulted in an unsought appreciation of the value of the Irish pound which, if maintained, would have seriously damaged our competitive position and would have given rise to a danger of significant loss of output and jobs in Ireland.</P>
      <P>The downward adjustment has improved the competitive position of Irish industry, particularly in relation to continental European countries.  It has prevented the loss of output and employment which would otherwise have occurred.</P>
      <P>The exchange rate change increased the Irish currency equivalent of</P>
      <P>(a)  Exchequer foreign debt by £550 million,</P>
      <P>(b)  total State foreign debt by £676 million, and</P>
      <P>(c) interest payments on State foreign debt by £25 million in 1986 and £56 million in 1987.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the increase in foreign debt in Irish currency terms, this will have to be met only when the debt is paid off. Given the volatility of international exchange rates, the rates at the time of repayment may well differ considerably from those prevailing in early August. For example, the depreciation of the US dollar over the year preceding the August adjustment had reduced the Irish currency <Col N="1812" /> equivalent of the then outstanding dollar denominated State debt by over £750 million.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Dukes) Alan Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Dukes)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take the two questions together. As I have already stated in public, the threat posed by the planting of explosive devices in Dublin city centre is being taken very seriously by the Government and is, as I am sure the House will agree, a matter of grave concern to all of us.  I would not, however, accept the suggestion that what has happened can reasonably be regarded as a security lapse. Given the length of the Border, the very big number of crossing points, both approved and unapproved, and the constant high volume of cross Border traffic, it would be unrealistic to suggest that security can be so effective as to remove completely the possibility of somebody coming across with a small explosive device and remaining undetected.  This reality has to be faced.  Even if our security forces were to be doubled or even trebled, irrespective of their state of vigilance, such a degree of security could <Col N="1814" /> never be guaranteed.  In saying this I want to emphasise that I do not wish to provoke unduly public fears and anxieties.  It is essential that the public realise that they too, by their vigilance, have a vital part to play in ensuring that terrorist activities are defeated.</P>
      <P>At a meeting yesterday morning, with the Garda Commissioner and other senior Garda personnel who are the people professionally qualified to decide, I discussed the weekend's incidents and the action that should now be taken.  The Commissioner outlined to me the additional security measures that the Garda Síochána are taking to deal with this latest threat to the security and well-being of our citizens, not only in Dublin but in other places throughout the country. I have had a further communication from the Commissioner in the matter today and Members of the House will have heard that the Commissioner has organised during the course of this afternoon a further examination of the matter with the chief superintendents from the Border divisions.</P>
      <P>The House will be aware that, for obvious reasons, it has never been the practice to give precise details of the security measures that are taken in any particular case and I do not propose to depart from that practice.  The Commissioner has also informed me that he has been assured of the full co-operation of the RUC in the context of our cross Border security co-operation arrangements in relation to this latest threat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the Garda can be relied on to do their utmost, I want to repeat the point that security measures are not matters that are the sole concern of the Garda Síochána.  Every citizen has a duty to take adequate precautions to ensure that he or she does not unwittingly make the work of the terrorist easier.  Owners of premises, particularly those where people congregate, have a duty to ensure that close attention is given to measures designed to ensure as far as possible the safety and security of both the people and premises for whom they have a responsibility. On Saturday last, the Garda Síochána visited many premises in the centre <Col N="1815" /> of Dublin to give security advice.  They will be giving further advice in this regard publicly during the next few days and I urge everybody to heed this advice carefully.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to another matter. During the course of the day there have been a number of bomb scares at premises throughout the city.  As far as I have been informed it would appear that all of those have been hoax calls.  I should like the House to join with me in declaring very firmly that people who carry out this type of activity are not only committing an offence &mdash; they are committing an offence and if they are found they will be prosecuted for it &mdash; but are involved in a type of activity that can damage both the security and the morale of the general public.  I ask anybody who is involved in this type of activity for frivolous reasons, and there are probably some, to desist immediately from doing it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory-Independent Mr. Gregory-Independent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory-Independent</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that the most likely method of terrorist attack will be from car bombs?  In view of the many casualties that resulted from the last car bombings in Dublin, something I am very familiar with because many constituents of mine were casualties, I should like to know if the Minister is concerned that the Garda decision not to introduce any car parking restrictions may be unwise and ill-advised particularly in the light of the UFF threat?  Will the Minister consider introducing restrictions on car parking at least in the main shopping streets in the area of O'Connell Street in Dublin?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>On the specific question of parking restrictions in city centre areas, I should like to remind the Deputy and the House that it is already the case that parking is forbidden through the length of O'Connell Street, in Mary Street and Henry Street, over large sections of Abbey Street, in North Earl Street and, I think &mdash; I stand subject to correction on this &mdash; over an area of Talbot Street. I am not breaking my principle of not revealing the full amount of security <Col N="1816" /> measures by stating that some of the measures will obviously have to consist of a more strict application of the parking regulations in those centre city areas.  It is an area where I ask the public to co-operate in their own interests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister is aware that he will have from this side of the House every possible support and co-operation in dealing with this matter. The Minister will notice also that my question is in the form of simply asking for a statement from him so that we can have as much reassurance for the general public as possible while, at the same time, dealing with the matter as seriously as it requires.  I should like to ask the Minister whether he has been correctly reported as having said that some inhibitions on forays and excursions in the form of road blocks which had previously been in place were not in place on this occasion?  Will the Minister give the House an assurance that all possible precautions, particularly in Border areas, will be taken as well as whatever action the Garda may feel it necessary to take in the capital city and elsewhere?  I should like to ask the Minister to give us whatever assurance he can in regard to the adequacy of the arrangements for prevention of these incidents which are being taken by the Northern Ireland authorities and, indeed, by the British authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>On the first matter raised by Deputy Haughey, I can inform the House that all necessary measures will be taken by the Garda Síochána to prevent and detect this type of activity.  There will be a substantial increase in the level of certain kinds of activities by the Garda Síochána in the area around Dublin, along the Border and in other centres of population.  I do not wish to go any further than that for reasons which I am sure are obvious to the House but I should like to assure the House that the Commissioner and I are anxious that all practicable steps can be taken that will have the effect of dissuading people getting involved in this type of activity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said in my original reply, the <Col N="1817" /> Garda Commissioner has been assured by the RUC of their full co-operation to the extent that within our cross-Border security operation arrangements they can make a contribution and I am quite sure they can.  I have no fears on that score, that we will get every possible co-operation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister to give us an assurance that if necessary he will come before the House again and keep us informed of any important or significant developments or, indeed, any further statements he may wish to make as far as precautions by the general public are concerned.  In other words, I am anxious that our six months rule &mdash; it will shortly be a four months rule &mdash; will not apply in regard to this matter.  I want the Minister to assure us that the public are kept as fully informed as possible of the position and, in particular, of the seriousness of this, should that be demanded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said in my original reply, the Garda authorities over the next few days will be giving on a much wider scale and in public some advice in relation to the contribution the general public can make to security arrangements.  I hope particular attention will be paid to this piece of advice.  I hope, and I think Deputy Haughey will join with me in this, it will not be necessary to come before the House to talk about this at any stage in the future.  Should it be the case I hope it will be in circumstances where we will be able to show we have prevented activity of this kind taking place.  I can readily give an assurance to the House that should there be any serious developments that merit further discussion here I will certainly bring them forward.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory-Independent Mr. Gregory-Independent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory-Independent</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to state sincerely that I do not mean to be unfairly critical of the Garda Síochána or obstructive in any way in asking the Minister if there was an immediate action plan introduced following the discovery of the bombs on Saturday.  With regard to my earlier question about car <Col N="1818" /> parking, I should like to point out that late on Saturday night cars were illegally parked the whole length of O'Connell Street, the street where the bombs had been found on Saturday morning.  Will the Minister agree that if there is such a threat posed in the future there should be an immediate response and not one that takes a number of days to introduce? Will he ensure that the car parking problem &mdash; which I view as the main threat and the main hindrance to the Garda Síochána in locating the people responsible &mdash; is dealt with by removing speedily cars that are illegally parked, particularly on the main shopping streets?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not correct to say there was no immediate action by the Garda after the first incident.  They went into action very quickly.  I take the Deputy's point about illegal parking in O'Connell Street, even on Saturday nights.  I emphasise again that it is not enough for the Garda to take the steps that are open to them: they must also have the co-operation of the general public.  For what it is worth, at one point on Saturday afternoon I was in Grafton Street during a break between two bits of business &mdash; I was with my children &mdash; and I saw a car illegally parked in Grafton Street, benefiting from the tender attentions of three members of the Garda.</P>

I am afraid he is engaged in somewhat unsavoury parliamentary tactics in this matter.  We on this side would like to know why this proposal by the Labour Party is being withdrawn, particularly because they went to great trouble to ensure the maximum possible publicity in the media for their good intentions, for their concern for the public good, in having these unsavoury video nasties controlled.  Why now do this distinguished Labour Party who are so concerned with the public welfare and morality&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Of all the indications that go around in and out of the House regarding unsavoury activities, the objectives of the Labour Party in trying to advance certain important measures do not warrant the description of unsavoury.  There are things that go on and are talked about that merit that description, perhaps.  The purpose now is to put on the Order Paper in place of that proposed Bill a Race Relations Bill which is urgently needed here.  The present position is bringing the country into disrepute because we are the only country in Europe which do not have such a measure.  My understanding is that we may not have two Bills on the Order Paper at one time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. P. Barry) Peter Barry">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. P. Barry)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann hereby approves the terms of the Agreement between the Government of Ireland and the Government of the United Kingdom concerning the International Fund for Ireland, which was signed on 18 September, 1986, and copies of which have been laid before Dáil Éireann on 20 October, 1986.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 15 November last year, the Taoiseach signed on behalf of the Government the Anglo-Irish Agreement at Hillsborough.  The agreement to establish the International Fund for Ireland, whose terms I am asking the Dáil to approve, <Col N="1942" /> springs directly from the Anglo-Irish Agreement of last year.</P>
    <P>Article 10 of the Anglo-Irish Agreement sets out the commitment of the two Governments to co-operate to promote the economic and social development of those areas of both parts of Ireland which have suffered most severely from the consequences of the instability of recent years.  In the period since the coming into effect of the Anglo-Irish Agreement, the Irish and British Governments have worked closely together to secure international support for this purpose. Already generous support has been given or pledged and the International Fund for Ireland is being set up to manage those contributions.</P>
    <P>The agreement to establish the fund, the text of which is before the House, is a further instrument of co-operation between the Irish and British Governments which will bring practical benefits to the two parts of Ireland.  The creation of the fund responds to the interest expressed by the Governments of many foreign countries not only to see the aims of the Ango-Irish Agreement succeed but to support these aims by offering financial and other practical assistance for the economic and social development of this country &mdash; North and South.  The fund provides a channel for expressing international political support in a practical way.  In the words of the preamble to the agreement, the fund provides an important expression of international support for the common commitment of the two Governments to peace, stability, dialogue and reconciliation in Ireland and their common opposition to the exploitation of instability for political ends.</P>
    <P>The establishment of the International Fund for Ireland is yet another example of the steady implementation of the objectives outlined in the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  It is an example of the beneficial effect of the agreement for Nationalists and Unionists alike.  In Northern Ireland, where serious under-employment and multiple deprivation create a climate in which instability can flourish, the international fund will bring real benefits by increasing the resources <Col N="1943" /> available to tackle these problems.  It will also stimulate international interest among potential investors from abroad, especially from the contributing countries. The fund is yet another example of practical co-operation between North and South for sound economic and social ends.</P>
    <P>This new agreement will set up the international fund with the objectives of promoting &ldquo;economic and social advance&rdquo; and of encouraging &ldquo;contact, dialogue and reconciliation between Nationalists and Unionists throughout Ireland&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The fund will be established as an international organisation of which the Irish and British Governments are the members.  It will be administered by a board consisting of a chairman and six other members, appointed jointly by both Governments.  The membership of the board has already been announced. The members who have agreed to serve all have a distinguished record in business and public life.  I am confident that by bringing the wealth of their experience to the fund, they will ensure that it stimulates economic development in both parts of Ireland in a significant and imaginative way.  To encourage this and to foster initiative and innovation, the board will be given a free hand.  As article 6 of the agreement states:</P>
    <P>... The Board shall act independently and shall not receive instructions from Governments as to the exercise of their powers.</P>
    <P>Donor countries may send observers to participate in board meetings and the United States and Canada have indicated that they intend to exercise this right. The observers will put forward the views of the donors on the operation and development of the International Fund, but I hope that they will also be a valuable link to the business and investment communities in the donor countries.</P>
    <P>The board of the fund will be assisted by an advisory committee composed of representatives of both the Irish and British Governments.  Through the advisory <Col N="1944" /> committee the two Governments will make known to the board of the fund their views on the policies and programmes the fund may adopt and the projects it will finance.  Government Departments, North and South, will assist the board in assessing and evaluating projects and these assessments will be channelled to the board through the advisory committee.  However, I must stress that the role of the advisory committee will be an advisory one.  It will be for the board members to make up their own minds and decide.</P>
    <P>The agreement provides that approximately three-quarters of the resources of the fund will be spent in Northern Ireland with the remainder expended here.  In its operation in this jurisdiction, I expect that the fund will give particular consideration to the Border areas.  I do not have to spell out the special problems which these areas have experienced or the need for special efforts to promote investment opportunities and tourism revenue.  Outside these areas, projects of an all-Ireland nature which fulfil the objectives and satisfy the criteria of the fund may also be considered for assistance by the board of the fund.</P>
    <P>The priority areas for investment by the fund are set out in article 4 of the agreement which provides that the fund should give priority on a value for money basis to the following: (a) the stimulation of private sector investment, in particular by means of venture capital arrangements; (b) projects of benefit to people in both parts of Ireland; (c) projects to improve the quality and conditions of life for people in areas facing serious economic and/or social problems and (d) projects to provide wider horizons for people from both traditions in Ireland.</P>
    <P>In deciding what emphasis the fund should give to particular priority areas, the board will observe the agreement, will receive advice from the two Governments and will also take into account the preferences and requirements of the donors where these have been expressed. For example, Canada wishes its cash contribution to be used partly to fund exchanges between the young people of <Col N="1945" /> Ireland, North and South, and of Canada.  The US Congress and Administration have stressed the desirability of assessing private business enterprise.</P>
    <P>As soon as possible after the fund is established, once it has had a chance to begin its work, it would be normal for the board to advertise and to invite applications. Such an advertisement could spell out the priority areas which the board intends to emphasise and could publish the criteria against which projects will be measured.  At an early date, my Department will ask the board to consider the applications which have been received by various Government Departments since the announcement of the fund was made.  The large number of these applications reflects the interest in both communities and in both parts of Ireland in advancing co-operation and economic development.</P>
    <P>Another important aspect of the international fund will be the establishment of two investment companies, one in each part of Ireland, with similar objectives and common directors, whose functions will be to furnish venture capital for the private sector.  The role of these companies will be to stimulate viable and self-sustaining growth in the private sector of both parts of Ireland.  I expect them to give a boost to industrial development in Northern Ireland and in the Border areas and to increase the rate of business start-up and expansion there.</P>
    <P>Article 10 of the agreement provides that the accommodation and secretarial services necessary for the proper functioning of the fund together with its general administrative and organisational expenses shall be provided jointly by the two Governments.  These secretarial services will be provided by my Department and by the Department of Finance and Personnel in Stormont.  The Irish Government's share of the administrative costs of the fund, which are expected to be modest, will be provided by way of a grant from subhead I &mdash; Anglo-Irish and North-South Co-operation &mdash; of the Vote of my Department.</P>
    <P>The motion before us today would not have been possible without the generous <Col N="1946" /> contributions already announced by the United States, Canada and New Zealand Governments.  I wish to repeat here the Government's deep appreciation of this generosity.  The United States Government have already made a contribution of £50 million to the international fund and has concluded a technical agreement which provides for the US donation to be held in trust, pending the completion of the Irish and British parliamentary procedures and the establishment of the fund.  A copy of this technical agreement, which came into force on signature, was laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas on 20 October.  The US has authorised two further contributions each of £35 million for the fiscal years 1987 and 1988.</P>
    <P>Canada has decided on a contribution of Canadian £10 million over ten years, half in cash and half in loan guarantees. New Zealand will make a grant of N.Z. £300,000 to the fund.  I expect that the arrangements for these contributions will be finalised early in 1987.  Discussions are continuing between the Irish and British Governments on the possibility of a European contribution involving the European Communities and other western European countries.</P>
    <P>In respect of the agreement before us today, Dáil approval is being sought in accordance with Article 29.5.2 of the Constitution.  After such approval the Government will exchange acceptances of the agreement with the British Government.  The Government will also make an order under Section 40 of the Diplomatic Relations and Immunities Act, 1967, for the purposes of:</P>
    <P>giving effect to article 5 of the agreement to establish the fund;</P>
    <P>giving it the status of a body corporate in Irish law; and exempting it from the payment of direct taxes.</P>
    <P>In accordance with the Act, the Order will be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas.  The parliamentary procedures in Britain were completed last week and, if the Dáil approves this motion, the two Governments should have the fund legally established by the end of the month.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1947" /> In the Anglo-Irish Agreement, the British and Irish Governments committed themselves, <i>inter alia,</i> to co-operate to promote the economic and social development of both parts of Ireland. The Intergovernmental Conference has been working steadily to achieve this aim. The agreement which we are discussing today is yet another practical demonstration of the co-operation between the two Governments in their determination to tackle the economic causes of instability in Ireland.  The welcome which the International Fund for Ireland has received underlines the international support for our efforts.  I am convinced that the fund will make a real contribution to economic and social advance and to the process of reconciling the two communities in Ireland.  I commend the motion to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>We welcome in principle the setting up of the International Fund for Ireland as an indication of international interest, especially North American interest, in a solution to the Northern Ireland problem.  We see it as worthwhile. It is a useful gesture for which we are grateful to the Governments and people concerned, the Government and people of the United States, Canada and New Zealand.  While the funding is more limited than what was originally hoped, it is still significant and can only be very beneficial.  At the time of the New Ireland Forum there was criticism in many quarters of the notion that any other country or Government would be willing to underpin financially, for a temporaty period at least, a political solution to the problem of Northern Ireland.  Some of the economic studies of the Forum looked at a scenario where there would be no outside assistance at all.  We always maintained that there would be money available over a transitional period to support a solution likely to bring lasting peace and stability to Ireland.  The financial assistance we are discussing today bears out that point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the implications of the assistance is that the United States Congress <Col N="1948" /> now has a direct interest in the problem of Northern Ireland.  It will wish to see that the funds are administered fairly and that they tackle areas of greatest need. The fund will also make a significant and valuable contribution, as has the non-quota section of the Regional Fund, to cross-Border projects.  The Border areas have suffered particularly severely not only from the current troubles but from the original decision to partition Ireland thus in many cases cutting off towns and cities from part of their natural hinterlands.</P>
    <P>Some of the worst unemployment levels in Europe are found in northern Border towns.  We agree with the priorities of the fund, to stimulate private investment, to promote cross-Border co-operation and to tackle the conditions of life for people in areas facing economic and social problems, especially high unemployment, poor social services, infrastructure and environment and the provision of wider opportunities for people from different traditions.  We see in this fund a basis for support of future political developments and structures designed to solve the Northern Ireland problem.  A welcome for the fund has never been a point of contention between the parties.  Any points we would have to make about the question of the Anglo-Irish Agreement we would make in a separate context.</P>
    <P>Having listened carefully to what the Minister said I would like to bring one sentence in particular to the Minister's intention.  He stated:</P>
    <P>Discussions are continuing between the Irish and British Governments on the possibility of a European contribution involving the European Communities and other Western countries.</P>
    <P>The Minister must know there is a certain disappointment that progress has not been made in this area.  Perhaps when he has an opportunity to reply he will spell out in detail the reasons progress has not been made between the Irish and British Governments on this matter.</P>
    <Col N="1949" />
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this with reservations. I take the view that this is part of the Anglo-Irish Agreement and that the money that has been generously sent by the American, Canadian and New Zealand Governments is a contribution on their part towards peace and normality on this island which has made a very significant contribution to the development of their nations down through history. I am not at all convinced that the money which is available will make any major contribution to what these three nations indicate they would like it to do. The most significant part of the Minister's speech was when he stated that in the Anglo-Irish Agreement the British and Irish Governments committed themselves, <i>inter alia,</i> to co-operate to promote the economic and social development of both parts of Ireland. After 25 years in public life, I am convinced that not only is it not consistent but it is downright dangerous to be talking about the unity of the Irish nation, North and South, both in terms of people and in geographical terms, without looking at the economic unity of the country first.  No part of Ireland has lost more through partition &mdash; I am not talking about partition <i>per se</i>&mdash; than the county of which I am a native.  We are seen as not being part of the South.  We are northern in our attitudes and in our general ethos.  We are northern in the broadest possible definition.  We are not considered by the Government, whether the present Government or any other Government, as being southern.  It is sad to relate this and I say it as constructive criticism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My supporters in County Donegal will wonder why 25 per cent of this money is being spent in the most deprived part of Ireland and 75 per cent is going across the Border.  Deputies from the constituency will bear out that businesses are struggling to exist on this side of the Border. Filling stations have closed down.  Last week I saw a bulldozer in Lifford bulldozing a filling station.  It is now an obstruction to the local garage.  There is only one filling station between the Border and where I live.  If that closes I <Col N="1950" /> will have to go to Letterkenny or into Northern Ireland to buy fuel for my car. I know this Government &mdash; I do not say this with any sense of pride or for political pointscoring &mdash; had an awful job to do when they took over the economy of this country.  I support the direction which they are pursuing.  It is the only sane way to correct the economy.  Those who are paying most of this are people in Border areas.</P>
    <P>While we can talk about the unity of the Irish people politically, we have forgotten that it is not possible; it is putting the cart before the horse; it is codology; it is cloud cuckooland if we do not unite the economies of the country.  I am glad the Minister referred to the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  That is the most significant part of his speech.  The fact that we have got money from friendly nations gives a sense of satisfaction to all of us and we are very grateful to the countries which have subscribed.  The members of those national Parliaments gave that money out of the goodness of their hearts, a deep generosity and a wish on their part that normality, peace and everything that goes with it should be restored to Ireland.</P>
    <P>However, the onus lies on the Government here, whether it be of a coalition arrangement or a one party Government under Fianna Fáil, to recognise the central issue of the entire question in relation to North-South politics, and the communities who divide into things called Nationalism and Unionism.  At the end of the day it is economics we are talking about.  How many times have we as public representatives gone to the North to be told by people from traditions which do not subscribe to our ethos or are from a different political background, &ldquo;When you can guarantee us a better standard of living.  When our children are assured of a better income, when we can live in a house as good as we are living in at a cheaper rent or a better house at the same rent, do not talk to us about Irish unity because you will have nothing to offer us&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>Having studied history, I am satisfied that the reason Northern Protestant people did not give their consent to a <Col N="1951" /> separate state of Ireland free of being governed by Westminster was that they put a value on their customers in Scotland, England and Wales, because they put an economic value on being governed by Westminister even though they did not want to be governed by English people sitting in a British Parliament.  To this very day that debate is going on.  Only last week the Unionist Party were afraid to allow the press in to discuss this central issue.  Irish people, regardless of whether they come from the Protestant or the Catholic tradition, are what we are talking about at the end of the day.  The flags representing unionism, nationalism, republicanism and loyalism are conveniences for people who have not the courage to call themselves bigots.  I am sorry to say that, but that is my firm conviction at this time.</P>
    <P>It would be far easier to call ourselves Irish and let us practise our religions in whatever way we want to practise them. Until the Northern issue is settled, decade after decade, generation after generation, the things that happened in the past 20 years will be repeated.  If there is one thing that history tells us it is that as we become more sophisticated in the devices we use to murder and maim one another we can do this in more horrendous ways.  That is one thing that history is telling us loud and clear.  This generation must find answers to the problem of the people who live on this island, some of whom choose to put tags on themselves declaring.  &ldquo;I am a true republican, super Irish,&rdquo; or &ldquo;I am a true blue, super British&rdquo;.  I have no time for super anything.  At the end of the day we are Irish and we should settle for that and share pride in calling ourselves that.</P>
    <P>In welcoming the Minister's statement and in congratulating him on the record that is there to be examined, nevertheless I have to say that the amounts of money which are being presented as being a contribution towards a development of relationships between Nationalist and Unionist will be no contribution really.  If I were to go along with that thinking I would be dishonest with the House and <Col N="1952" /> with myself.  Catholic people living north of the Border have for two generations enjoyed the advanced economic background and standard of living there and they have not become anything other than Catholic-Nationalist-Republican.  If they were to have better conditions they still would not change, and neither would the Unionist-Loyalist.  That ethos of Northern Ireland people who have not given their consent to join in an all-Ireland settlement will never change their way of thinking just because money is put in front of them.  The only way it can be got is by both Governments recognising that partition has been an economic injustice to people living on both sides of the Border and that the closer you get to it the greater the injustice.  I see that as so glaring that I despair not alone of the party that I belong to and the Government I support but in the whole attitude of this House in trying to find a solution. Recently I said in a speech that I was not satisfied that Irish nationalism was led in the last 150 or 200 years by people living in the city of Dublin or south of it, good intelligent, honest, sincere people with a dynamic desire to try to do good, but who were incapable of understanding the minds of the northern person.  They were unable to understand the northern ethos. Here I was, blaming the politicians when I delivered the speeches.  Now I have come to the conclusion that the journalists who write the politics of Ireland are also incapable of understanding and I have discovered suddenly that if I want to communicate with a journalist in Dublin about the north I have to talk to a northern journalist living in Dublin or a journalist in the North.  There is a sympathetic hearing from Southern journalists and they agree completely with the things one is saying &mdash; it all makes sense &mdash; but at the end of the day they are not really switched on.</P>
    <P>We have a mammoth task which lies fairly and squarely with Westminster and Dublin.  Quite apart from the Government in power, I am not and never was interested in the party politics of the Northern troubles since they started. Neither was I ever interested in being a <Col N="1953" /> bitter politician because the stakes are far too big for play-acting.  I speak here as representing ordinary people in Donegal and I have no doubt that when Deputy Conaghan speaks for the Fianna Fáil Party he will confirm the economic stress in Border areas at the moment particularly in east Donegal.  I had sad experiences during the summer of discovering that in towns like Buncrana and Moville, holiday resorts, and in the smaller areas neighbouring those towns there just were no visitors and continually we hear complaints from people in family businesses, small grocers, people running small corner shops and street traders, that they are just hanging on because of the policy of this Government who are in a &ldquo;catch 22&rdquo; position of either facing up to the economic realities or letting us jog on to a crash at the bottom of the hill.</P>
    <P>With regard to cross-Border co-operation, only in the last couple of weeks An Post announced that they were delivering here in the Republic more letters posted from Great Britain and Northern Ireland than the British authorities were delivering for us, so An Post tell us that they are going to charge us extra for this.  All of us hear Dr. Ian Paisley stand up and talk about &ldquo;that foreign State down there and those foreigners from the Republic.&rdquo; Nobody believes him.  Certainly I do not. The people of Strabane in County Tyrone and those of Lifford in County Donegal are the same community.  I grew up in that community.  The people of Derry city and County Derry, particularly those close to the border with Donegal, are the same people as the Donegal people.  The people of south Down are the same as those of north Louth; the people of north Monaghan are the same as those of south Armagh.</P>
    <P>When we hear people like Ian Paisley saying &ldquo;that is a foreign country down there&rdquo; nobody believes it.  We say he is playing to the gallery but let us stop to think for a second.  Who has made it a foreign country?  An Post have now helped to make it a foreign country because if one wants to post a letter to the North there is an international charge.  If somebody in the North wants to post a <Col N="1954" /> letter to the Republic they have to put a price on it the same as any other country in the EC.  We are internationalising the Border between North and South.  Eight or nine years ago when I kicked up a ferocious row about breaking with sterling, everybody was talking about the economics of it.  I made the case that if we broke with sterling we would make sterling a foreign currency in the Republic and, conversely, we would make Irish money a foreign currency in the Six Counties.  Irish money would be foreign currency in part of Ireland.  We have internationalised the Border.  We have created a Border far stronger than the Unionists could ever dream of.</P>
    <P>I make this very passionate plea to the House to get our act together for the sake of people who live in Border areas.  I welcome with open arms the generosity and goodwill in abundance of the United States of America, Canada and New Zealand.  But why should they not be generous?  If they go back far enough they will find their roots in this country but while acknowledging that point, there is a wealth of generosity among the peoples who live there.  I participated in a survey which was carried out in the United States of America by Merseyhurst College in Erie in Pennsylvania who did it free <i>gratis</i>.  They believed their roots took them back to Ireland and they wanted to make a contribution.  Out of 2.1 million names, 10,000 names were scientifically selected and scientifically further refined down to 2,000 names. Then 2,000 letters went out to people with a questionnaire that the college authorities had come to Ireland to, as they said, get the bugs washed out of it, to discover whether this thing called goodwill could be translated into tangible economic support for the island of Ireland.  They put in a battery of telephones and for five days they made over 1,200 positive telephone calls, some repeated two, three and four times, and that survey tells us that there is no preference in the United States as to where in Ireland money subscribed should be spent.  They do not see Ireland as North and South.  They do not see it as green <Col N="1955" /> and orange.  As a matter of fact, many of them do not know where Belfast or Cork is, and most of them do not give a damn; they just want to help Ireland.</P>
    <P>I am surprised there has been an agreement that 75 per cent of the money given by these countries will be spent on the side of the Border which I have to admit is more economically developed than the side on which I live and which I represent. It is unfair that 75 per cent of the money should be spent on one side of the Border and 25 per cent spent on what I would describe as the economically deprived part of Ireland.  I say that because the people who give the money, the taxpayers in the United States of America, showed no preference according to the Merseyhurst survey.  They would say they wanted to give the money to Ireland so that she can find her own economic level and so that the people of Ireland, in a period of prosperity, peace and normality will then find a political coming together. That is what the Merseyhurst survey tells us, loudly and clearly.</P>
    <P>Incidentally, it is the only such survey ever conducted in the United States of America.  It is most incredible that a small nation like ours, with so many ties with the United States of America which we almost consider to be part of the same family, has never, since the foundation of the State, tried to penetrate the thinking behind the goodwill of that ethnic group, the Irish Americans.  The Merseyhurst survey is the first and &mdash; this is the first time I have had the opportunity to say this in Parliament &mdash; it is a credit to the college.  They would tell us that they are no different from the other colleges with the same ethos.  There are about 70 of them and any one of the 70 would have done what they did.  They do not want any particular credit or thanks but, as a matter of record, I know that it cost $78,000 and they paid it willingly and were glad to be asked to do it.</P>
    <P>I use this occasion to draw attention to the fact that parties who preach anti-partitionist politics cannot follow independent economic politics.  Any party who support a Government that does <Col N="1956" /> anything which interferes with the normal trading relationship between people on both sides of the Border are not truly anti-partitionist and have not really got their economic politics correct. As someone with 25 years experience in public life who has identified myself with the troubles in the North and has been fortunate enough to meet people who have broadened my view and made me think the thing out a little bit further, I believe that one cannot talk about the unity of the Irish people in advance of having economic unity in both parts of Ireland.  I believe the British people, the English particularly, would quietly admit to themselves in the comfort of their own homes that that nation and that Parliament, because of a history that they are not very proud of, would be quite willing to make a major contribution if their Government would go in that direction.</P>
    <P>In conclusion let me say that the most relevant part of the Minister's speech is the part I have already quoted, that the British and Irish Governments commit themselves, <i>inter alia</i>, to co-operation and promoting the economic and social development of both parts of Ireland. That must be the direction.  There is no other way.  Whenever we can unite the economics of North and South we will be well on the way to achieving peace and normality on this island.  When we achieve that, the political differences which separate us from the people of that other ethos who have not yet given their consent to be part of an all-Ireland nation will be resolved, but not until then.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I too am pleased with the setting up of this International Fund for Ireland.  It is not the be all and the end all of the Border problems, but anything that improves the economic structure of that area must be welcomed.  The fund might not be as high as we wished and we might not like the divide &mdash; 75 per cent to the North and 25 per cent to the South &mdash; but nevertheless it is to be welcomed.  I have been involved in cross-Border economic development over the last ten years and have always advocated <Col N="1957" /> the building of economic bridges.  This was done very effectively in Monaghan, Fermanagh and Armagh.</P>
      <P>A number of reports of the economic structure of the cross-Border areas have been issued over the past number of years and these can be used as a basis when it comes to distributing funds &mdash; the Erne catchment study report, the reports of the regional development organisations along the Border and, most important, the Irish Border Areas report issued by the Economic and Social Committee of the European Communities.  Admittedly, we did not benefit as much from that report as we expected, but it was recognised that that area was severely handicapped.  The introduction to the Irish Border Areas report, 1983, reads:</P>
      <P>This report is concerned with an area of 20-30 miles on both sides of the frontier, encompassing the district council areas of London Derry, Strabane, Omagh, Femanagh, Dungannon, Armagh and Newry/Mourne (N. Ireland) and the counties of Donegal, Leitrim, Cavan, Monaghan and Louth (Republic).</P>
      <P>The area covers 1,697,000 hectares spanning a 343 km land frontier and has a population of 747,000 (54% in Northern Ireland and 46% in the Republic).</P>
      <P>Statistics indicate that the area is particularly handicapped and has a special claim on Community assistance. Farming is the lynchpin of the economy &mdash; particularly in the South &mdash; and there is relatively little industrial employment.  Very low incomes, acute unemployment, outward migration and in some parts, falling population, are further features.  Small farms, poor soil, population structure and inheritence and marriage patterns combine to impede the introduction of modern farming methods.</P>
      <P>At present, cooperatives, tourism and small business appear to hold out the best hopes for development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The emphasis must be laid on funding for those areas which have been clearly <Col N="1958" /> identified.  The report continues:</P>
    <P>In many parts, road infrastructure, domestic water supply networks and drainage systems are clearly inadequate and those which do exist are sometimes disrupted by troubles in the area.</P>
    <P>In his speech the Minister said:</P>
    <P>The Board shall act independently and shall not receive instructions from Governments as to the exercise of their powers.</P>
    <P>I am very pleased about this because I feared there would be a tug-o'-war for the funds and that maybe the weaker areas would not get their proper share. That concern was fuelled further by statements made recently by the Taoiseach when, in response to pressure from a particular Deputy, he promised £10 million for County Louth.  Over the past few weeks several agencies have made a case to siphon the money from the Border areas into the midlands.  The Minister went on to say:</P>
    <P>The priority areas of investment by the fund are set out in article 4 of the agreement which provides that the fund should give priority on a value of money basis to the following (a) the stimulation of private sector investment, particularly by means of venture capital arrangements; (b) projects of benefit to people in both parts of Ireland; (c) projects to improve the quality and conditions of life for people in areas facing serious economic and/or social problems; (d) projects to provide wider horizons for people from both traditions in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Those four points sum up the problems of the area.  The Minister also said:</P>
    <P>The board of the fund will be assisted by an advisory committee composed of representatives of both the Irish and British Governments.  Through the advisory committee the two Governments will make known to the board of the fund their views on the policies and programmes the fund may adopt and the projects it will finance.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1959" /> I hope the functions of the advisory committee will be simply advisory.  I also hope that elected representatives in the Border areas will get an opportunity to discuss all the projects which have been examined locally and that they will be able to make an input.  This could be very useful.  The Minister went on to say that two investment companies would be set up one on each side of the Border, with similar objectives and he spoke about self-sustaining growth.  This will provide a great opportunity to investigate the economic structure of the area.</P>
    <P>Over the last number of years the area South of the Border has been devastated and the economy has been wrecked because of the flow of trade into Northern Ireland.  Many people believed that that flow northwards had tapered off, but that is not so.  Last Saturday I was talking to a number of business people in Monaghan town where I hold a weekly clinic and more concern was expressed about cross-Border business than I had heard at any other time.  People there said there was an intensification in the number of those shopping across the Border.  This is a cause of grave concern.  I hope wrongs will be righted when the Minister for Finance introduces his budget, because there is almost a complete closedown along the southern side of the Border of small filling stations and other outlets, especially those selling electrical equipment. I hope all this will be taken into account when we are dispensing this fund.  We had hoped for a higher amount and for a different division of funds, although I would not deny the people in the Six Counties.</P>
    <P>It has been said that the northern economy is stronger than ours but that is questionable.  In the North something like $120 million was allocated for 1977-1978 and something in the region of $25 million would have been available to the five southern counties.  Newpaper reports over the past few weeks have indicated that there are pressures to drag this international fund east and west.  Because of <Col N="1960" /> that fear I contacted public representatives of all political persuasions in Cavan, Leitrim and Monaghan and suggested that we get together to make sure we get a fair cut of the cake.  We worked on that committee in conjunction with our northern counterparts.  Much valuable work was done in identifying areas of need and pinpointing where money should be spent.</P>
    <P>We had the Border Counties Fund from 1982 to 1985.  That fund contained something in the region of £20 million to stimulate tourism and to fund roads infrastructure and so on.  A total of £17.8 million was spent on the five Border counties and £2.152 million went to Bord Fáilte and CTT promotions.  I objected to that because £½ million went to CTT to promote crafts in an area that does not produce crafts.  Within a fraction of 50 per cent of the £17.8 million went to one county and the other four counties got varying amounts from 10 per cent to 14 per cent of the fund.  That was our experience of that fund and that is the fund to which we would look to see how this fund will be administered.  Considering that fund gives us our reason for trying to ensure that on this occasion there will be a more even-handed distribution of the fund.</P>
    <P>At those cross-Border meetings we talked in terms of opening Border roads. I said consistently that we should have all the lines of communication open.  The closure of Border crossings has been a drawback to the economy of the Border regions.  I hope this committee in their deliberations will examine not alone existing cross-Border roads, but roads which have been closed for a number of years.  The closure of some of the cross-Border roads has caused problems to farmers and businessmen.  Farmers with land on both sides of the Border have had to travel ten or 12 miles to move stock and produce from their land as a result of the closure of some roads.  The committee should consider opening some of the roads and should reconsider the access roads to the Border.  The access roads are bottlenecked because there are <Col N="1961" /> so few of them.  We should do everything possible to open the roads and all lines of communication.</P>
    <P>This report makes positive proposals relating to tourism and agriculture.  It proposes to research agriculture along the Border.  The report also covers roads, telecommunications, energy, industry, tourism, drainage, forestry and agricultural training.  This report itemizes each county or region, outlines the drawbacks and proposes remedies.  The problems on each side of the Border are common so there should be no problem in coming together and coming up with projects which would benefit both sides of the Border.</P>
    <P>In these areas there are small industries only.  Monaghan has a fair number of small industries, mostly agriculture based, based on poultry, pigs, beef, etc. There are other industries on the other side of the Border.  There is a great opportunity for further development in this area.  The same applies to afforestation where there is room for further processing.</P>
    <P>There is also great potential for tourism because of the lakeland district of Enniskillen and the lakes of Cavan-Monaghan. We should exploit the Erne catchment area.  The proposals for the Ballymore-Ballyconnell canal linking it to the Shannon make it one of the finest waterways in Europe.  The money we received from the last Border fund did not go to the areas which deserved it most and I hope the same will not apply to this fund.</P>
    <P>I wish the proposal well and I hope that the points we made will be taken into consideration when the committee are disbursing the funds.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Conaghan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the fund and hope that by its very nature it will lead to the resolution of the problems confronting people who live on both sides of the Border.  The most significant aspect of the gesture is that it has been recognised at international level that there is a problem in relation to the Border areas and that the violence in Northern Ireland over the last 13 years has been caused by chronic unemployment and the nature of the economy which people had to endure in the Border regions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope the Government will give proper recognition to the true situation in Border areas.  I represent a Border constituency which is the hinterland of Derry city.  When one considers the unemployment statistics in the region, it is not surprising that there is turmoil and violence because when people have no hope, no prospect of employment and no future they will turn to violence.  In Donegal in 1982 unemployment figures stood at 9,500.  In answer to a Dáil question on 23 April it was stated that the figures had risen to 12,296 by 28 March 1986.  That is an increase of 3,000 which does not take into account the number of <Col N="1963" /> people who have emigrated and who are unregistered.</P>
    <P>In Derry city and in Strabane the unemployment figures are in the region of 40 per cent.  The Minister's most significant statement was that discussions are continuing between the Irish and British Governments on the possibility of a European contribution involving the European Communities and other western European countries.  We may talk about reports and surveys but the time has come for action to be taken on the material at the disposal of the Minister, the EC and the British Government. Something must be done to alleviate the problems in the region we are now discussing.</P>
    <P>The business fraternity in Border regions is devastated because of high taxation. This applies to people who have been in business for years but who have no prospects of continuing because of the tax structures.  The Government will have to look at this area if any impact is to be made on developments which may take place in relation to revitalising Border areas by bringing industry to them.  If we provided a factory in Buncrana where there is chronic unemployment it would mean nothing to other businesses in that town or those adjacent to it because most of the money would be spent on the other side of the Border where they get better value for money.  However, that is another question.</P>
    <P>The development of tourism is mentioned in the document and we should address ourselves to that matter.  The tourism board are not promoting the north-west region and have not made any significant contribution to the development of tourism in that area.  Their policy is to promote Ireland as a region and their defence of the neglect in relation to tourism in the north-west is its inaccessibility. That is a weak argument as we have a national primary route to Belfast from Donegal, right through to the port of Larne.  Are any promotional campaigns being organised by the tourist board by advertising that route?  I do not <Col N="1964" /> think so and indeed I have been confirmed in that view as a result of a meeting with the executive of the Sligo-Leitrim-Donegal Tourist Board yesterday.  If we intend to promote tourism, recognition must be given to that area and a promotional campaign must be intensified to ensure the region has the same facilities as the rest of the country.</P>
    <P>A survey was carried out in 1980 with regard to the feasibility of setting up a new industrial zone in that area, a complex which would accommodate the Donegal, Strabane and Derry region. This survey was carried out by the Shannon development authorities and the findings must be on the files within the Department.  It has been recognised in Brussels that the north west region is the most deprived region in the EC.  All that remains to be added is the political will of the Governments concerned.  It is significant that a member of the EC who was in Derry recently for a meeting had a special meeting with the Derry City Council.  He informed the council that grant aid from the EC could go only so far in solving the unemployment problem. However, at the meeting arranged by councillors who wanted to be advised on what grant aid was available Mr. Denis Kennedy of the European Commission office in Belfast stressed that more money could be on the way if only the British and Irish Governments could agree on cross-Border projects.  Mr. Kennedy also pointed out that the flow of grant aid to Northern Ireland has been steadily declining since 1983.  That is evident not only on the Northern side but also on the Southern side.  Part of the reason for this is the lack of imaginative, innovative and well laid out applications.  He added that the local councils could help out in this respect as they knew best the needs of their areas.  It is unfortunate that when local councils, and I am a member of a local council, forward projects to Central Government they seem to get lost.  When money comes from Brussels only a small proportion is allocated to the Border region.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to take cognisance of the fact that unless something is <Col N="1965" /> done and some movement is made within the broad parameters which are available to him I cannot foresee any great future for the area.  While we welcome this move our best approach lies in our ability to negotiate within the EC to obtain aid for our disadvantaged regions.  The most disadvantaged region is the area I represent. The sad thing about representing a Border region which is a hinterland to another portion of the country, which has been cut off from us, and because there is an economic taxation imbalance is that the effects on the economy within that area can be devastating.  The Government do not seem to recognise the disadvantages and handicaps the people residing in those areas have to confront. An unnatural Border creates problems for people in their everyday ordinary lives.  They have got to cross a frontier which is manned by custom officials and which, unfortunately, is now manned by military forces who set up road blocks at different times.  There is no compensation available.  They have to put up with it and endure it.  They have got to make the best of it.</P>
    <P>I hope the Government will take full advantage of this fund to aid the Border areas.  I further hope that the Government will use their good offices to exploit to the full the benefits that could accrue from the EC, of which we are a full member, for the better development of a region which is recognised by the EC as being the most deprived region within the EC.  Unless we promote the development of the area by attracting industry and unless we give people within the region the right to work out their own existence by their own endeavours in developing, through their own talents and initiative, private industry I see no hope for the region.  I have always held the view that the problems which confront the people of the Six Counties emanated from chronic unemployment which was orchestrated, manipulated and manoeuvred by the regime who have controlled the Six Counties for the last sixty years.  Derry and Strabane are the areas that have suffered the most.  The people of north-east Donegal have suffered along <Col N="1966" /> with them because they live in a hinterland of the city of Derry.  We have affiliations with every sporting body within the Derry region.  We are a community in our own right.  If things were any way half normal, I have no doubt that we could live as well as any other community.</P>
    <P>With those handicaps and disadvantages, and the chronic tax facing the community in that region, it is not surprising that the area is a virtual wasteland with people selling their businesses and posessions and emigrating.  Those people do not see any future for the area. Unless the Government persuade the powers that be in Brussels to give special support to the area in an effort to revive its economy we will go further down the road of no return.  There is no incentive to industrialists to set up business there. The area should be given special recognition and aid similar to that given to the mid-west and south-west regions.  Those areas were given great support to establish tax free zones.  The results of the feasibility studies that were carried out in our area are in the Department and it appears that the EC accept the need for special aid for it.  An EC Commissioner I met in Derry indicated that unless there was political will on the part of the British and Irish Governments progress would not be made.</P>
    <P>I hope the Government will recognise the problems of the area and will do something positive to give the people a chance to get out of the chronic economic depression that prevails.  They have had to live under such conditions for the last 15 years.  The young population are well educated and able to adapt to any type of work.  Unemployment is a massive problem in the area and it must be tackled by the Government.  There is little use in tinkering with it, a major drive against unemployment is needed.  We should give the people in the area some hope for the future.  It is unfortunate that only 25 per cent of the fund will be made available to the southern region but if we are honest in our concern for the Border regions we cannot be parochial and say that if we are not getting 100 per cent on this side we <Col N="1967" /> will block it going to the other side.  That is not the way we should view this project. The Donegal, Derry and Strabane regions should be given special consideration. The people there have been denied help for 60 years and they should be given some hope for the future.</P>
    <P>It is incumbent on the Government to give to those people the aid denied them in the last 60 years.  This gesture from other countries gives the Government an opportunity to rectify that wrong.  It will be a sad day if we do not show something up front in the next 12 months.  The area has been devastated in the last 15 years by chronic taxation, in particular that imposed by the Government in the last four years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been here for most of the afternoon.  I do not intend to speak at any length because I appreciate the difficulty of trying to get in on a debate like this under the arrangements that operate now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the agreement we are being asked to ratify today so that it can be brought into effect.  Clearly, it is something that most reasonable people will welcome because it cannot do any harm and must do good.  My hope is that it will do substantial good for those it is intended to assist because they have suffered a substantial loss in the last 15 years. One has to acknowledge the generosity of the countries involved, the United <Col N="1968" /> States of America, Canada, New Zealand and Australia, but must draw attention to the fact that the EC has not yet made or indicated its intention of making any payment to the fund.  It is particularly appropriate that it should do so as a Community, in addition to whatever payments may be made in the course of time by individual member states.</P>
    <P>Indeed, that part of the Single European Act which is relevant to this matter and which is entitled Economic and Social Cohesion, stops short of making any form of realistic commitment towards assisting the peripheral regions of the Community.  It states:</P>
    <P>the Community shall aim at reducing disparities between the various regions and the backwardness of the least-favoured regions.</P>
    <P>It is a great pity that that is as far as it goes because that is a rather noncommital and purely aspirational expression.  There is an opportunity in the establishment of this fund for the Community, as a Community, to make a significant payment into it from either the Regional or Social funds, or both because both are relevant to it.</P>
    <P>It is worth drawing attention to the fact that while we have referred to countries that have been generous donors to the fund the giving of donations to it is not confined to countries.  That matter should be borne in mind in the United States in particular where substantial funds could be raised from private sources for the objectives of the fund.  If the proper approach is made to raise such funds very significant amounts could be obtained. It has always been a difficulty faced by successive Governments here that certain funds could be raised in the United States for expenditure on this island which all of us would have preferred were never raised.  This is a very precise fund that will be under public supervision and it is an ideal vehicle for the use of that goodwill in a practical way.</P>
    <P>Deputy Leonard and Deputy Harte spoke of the economic difficulties along the Border, particularly on the southern side.  Unquestionably, that is true, and it <Col N="1969" /> is distressing.  I was in Dundalk recently and rarely have I seen a town anywhere that is more depressed, with virtually every premises up for sale, formally or potentially, but they are unsaleable.  It is distressing, too, to see the Lifford-Strabane areas.  Though Strabane suffered proportionately perhaps more severely than any other town or area in Northern Ireland, in the early years of this trouble at any rate, it is now more prosperous than Lifford.  The reason for that, of course, is the major tax difference on the two sides of the Border.  That will continue to be the case as long as substantially higher direct and indirect taxes are levied on this side of the Border. When there are two different jurisdictions on one small island, neither can operate in a vacuum or in isolation one from the other, and we had better learn that as soon as we can.  Otherwise, towns on the southern side will become even more depressed.</P>
    <P>The agreement for the establishment of this fund is only one aspect of the Anglo-Irish Agreement, and perhaps it is not out of place, now that it is almost 12 months since its signature, to look back on what the situation has been.  One thing is clear: though there may be differences of views and opinions between the British and Irish Governments in relation to this problem, there appears to be a genuine effort on the part of both to reach reasonable levels of agreement on how these difficulties should be approached.</P>
    <P>One might take that for granted now, but I was a member of a Government here in 1971 when we got a curt two-line note from the British Prime Minister of the day informing us that nothing that happened in Northern Ireland was any of our business.  There has been an enormous change of position by the British Government.  They have learned that the views they expressed and the attitudes they followed 15 years ago are now seen to be entirely erroneous &mdash; they were then and that is now acknowledged.  It is seen that the Republic of Ireland and its Government have a legitimate say in <Col N="1970" /> things that happen on the other side of the Border.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, there is just as great a gulf, but in a different direction, as there was 15 years ago.  The gulf now is not between the two Governments, because the British have changed very fundamentally in their attitude: it is between the two communities in Northern Ireland.  There is extreme polarisation in Northern Ireland that was not there 15 and 20 years ago but which, as a result of prolonged violence, is there today.</P>
    <P>In some respects it is ironic that we are discussing this agreement a day after the performance that went on in the Ulster Hall in Belfast last night.  It shows the different reactions to this agreement and the fundamental importance of the agreement. What we are discussing here today and what was passed in the British House of Commons a week or two ago is the reaction of the international community in trying to assist in alleviating the divisions and the violence that are part and parcel of Northern Ireland.  On the other hand, last night we had the reaction of other people to this agreement, to the fund and all the things that go with it: they regarded it as appropriately expressed in the raising of yet another private army, as if that will contribute anything to the solution of difficulties.</P>
    <P>It is well to remember that there were 1,000 people in the Ulster Hall last night and that there are hundreds of thousands of unionists who were not there and who would find an activity such as the raising or the dedication of a private army as abhorrent as I would and as nearly all Members of this House would.  One of the tasks that faces the two Governments today is to try to arrange things so that that large number of moderate and unbigoted people on the unionist side in Northern Irland would get some sort of opportunity to assert themselves.  This will not be done easily.  It is a delicate and difficult task to arrive at that desirable objective, but the lesson we should have learned during the past 12 months since the signing of the agreement is that a way must be found to enable the people on the Unionist side to realise that the old <Col N="1971" /> system is over, that there has to be change and that they have to be given the opportrunity to accommodate change.  When they are intelligent enough to see that when they are lacking in the bigotry that some of the public spokesmen seem to be imbued with, they will have to be accommodated.  The efforts of everyone of good will should be aimed towards trying to enable that to happen.  The objectives of this agreement are set out in Article 2 and are excellently put:</P>
    <P>The objectives of the Fund are to promote economic and social advance, to encourage contact, dialogue and reconciliation between Nationalists and Unionists throughout Ireland.</P>
    <P>I fully subscribe to that even though it has to be long term in its effects.  One of the areas to which the Intergovernmental Conference might well give some attention is education in Northern Ireland. People must now begin to ask themselves whether, in the specially polarised conditions of the North, it is appropriate to maintain a sectarian form of education, which may not do any harm in more normal societies but which cannot be beneficial in the conditions which have evolved in Northern Ireland and whether something can be done, through the Intergovernmental Conference or otherwise, to encourage a change in that position. I acknowledge that is something not likely to be achieved in the short-term. Unfortunately nowadays when we think of Northern Ireland in the short-term it becomes more and more difficult to think positively.  We must have some long-term feelings and thoughts about it also.</P>
    <P>This fund is important for what it will do for people living in relative economic deprivation as a result of all of these events.  It is particularly important that it has widespread international recognition on the part of many of the leading countries in the world, of the horror of the situation obtaining in part of this island, of their anxiety, joined with ours, to try <Col N="1972" /> to bring about commonsense and reconciliation, bringing the nightmare to an end.</P>

      <P>Not for the first time I find myself in a minority speaking in this House.  I am not surprised.  Earlier on I was worried we would not have sufficient time to debate this, what I regard as a very important subject and a totally unique occasion.  Apart from the Minister, there was no other front bench speaker and just one back bench speaker from the Government side so far.  On the Fianna Fáil side we have a five minutes speech from Deputy G. Collins and then some Border counties spokesmen looking for their share of the cake.  That is the pitiful position to which we have been reduced, scrabbling here for these few miserable dollars to ascertain what we can get for our own areas and how it should be allocated.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned in February last that it was nearly impossible to get in the door of his office with all of the submissions piling up inside it.  The establishment of the fund had only been announced and they were all scrabbling for a few dollars.  At the time of the signing of the Anglo-Irish Agreement the Minister and the Government were announcing 1,000 million dollars or five hundred million dollars.  That figure has since come down to something like 250 million dollars.  The American Government have made no announcement at all of how many dollars there are involved and Congress have passed only 120 million dollars.  We are talking at present about 50 million dollars for the current year, something of that nature.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the same point in February last the Minister spoke of the generosity of the American Government.  I greatly admire the generosity of the American people but I have never seen any generosity on the part of the American Government in their hand-outs.  In fact the American Government are the new imperial power who use the dollar as their invading army and they have conquered all of South America with American aid in dollars. They maintain their control by beginning <Col N="1973" /> to give aid.  The carrot and the stick then is whether they will stop or increase the aid which controls their foreign policy. That is evident throughout the world.  I invite Deputies to look again at the whole question of American aid, the question of generosity or otherwise that may be involved.</P>
    <P>In this case the history is that it was first announced in 1977 by President Carter in an unprecedented statement by an American President, when he announced that American aid would be available if an agreement between the two Governments could be reached.  The record of American aid is that they use it to develop client Governments who will bend to their will.  The great danger for Ireland is that once we accept the principle of American aid by way of this fund, we will be sucked into the position in which the factor determining our foreign policy &mdash; rather than having a principled approach to international affairs as we used have 20 or 30 years ago &mdash; will be to ensure that we will not upset our friends who are giving us this money.  Therfore, the financial position will decide our Government's foreign policy issues.</P>
    <P>In the past year, since the signing of the Anglo-Irish Agreement since this question of American aid was first raised, there has been evidence of a distinct shift in Irish foreign policy away from the neutral position we had maintained over the years towards a more pro-American stance on a number of issues.  In December last, shortly after the Anglo-Irish Agreement had been signed, the Irish delegation to the United Nations abstained on a resolution calling for the lifting of the US trade embargo on Nicaragua. That constituted a distinct shift in policy on the part of our Government. That UN resolution was sponsored by Algeria, Mexico, Nicaragua and Peru and was supported by 84 of the UN members.  The preceding May our Government had fully supported a UN resolution which, among other things, called on all States to refrain from carrying out, supporting or promoting economic or military actions of any kind against any State in the region which <Col N="1974" /> might impede the Contadora peace process. The Government had broken a very strong position on that.  If there was any doubt as to whether there was a shift in our international policy, surely it has been confirmed by the cowardly performance of the Minister for Foreign Affairs at the time of the US attack on Tripoli last April.  That was an occasion when the Irish people would have expected that our Minister would have condemned that action.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>If that was so it was a very brave performance, not a cowardly one.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>It was condemned by a wide range of opinion including the World Council of Churches, the United Nations, the non-aligned movement, by neutral countries.  Indeed, it was even condemned by the United States NATO partners but our Minister persistently refused at the time to condemn the United States action.  That refusal was seen as an effort not to disturb the Americans because of the possibility of interfering with this US aid.  That is a very likely cause of the departure from the position which had obtained before.  I am sure the Minister will agree we had at all times condemned with great vigour all acts of terrorism of any kind and this was a similar type of action which, in the normal course of events, the Irish Government would have condemned in the past.</P>
      <P>It is too much to expect our people to see these shifts in our foreign policy as having nothing to do with the Anglo-Irish Agreement or this US aid package.  If the cost of US financial aid is to remain silent on areas of international policy in respect of which we adopted a strong stance in the past, if we are now to alter our position in this respect &mdash; particularly the example I mentioned of attempts to overthrow the democratically elected Government of Nicaragua &mdash; because of the danger of losing this fund it would be much too high a price to pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Adopting a subservient attitude as a result of the possibility of gaining money is shaming the Irish nation.  Our people <Col N="1975" /> are proud.  All Irish people wish that we would hold our heads high and be independent in international affairs, even if we are poor.  Possibly the only real hallmark of our independence since this State was founded has been our international neutrality, our strong international position, a principled position which we held no matter who was annoyed.  If we lose that independence, no money would be worth it and certainly not 120 million dollars or even 250 million dollars, a figure which was mentioned.</P>
    <P>Last February the Minister said that so far there has been no official indication of the amount of money involved.  In the Department of Foreign Affairs bulletin of September last, <i>Iris Rinne na Gnóthaí Eachtracha</i>, it was stated that the US Congress authorised a sum of 120 million dollars.  It also stated that the Irish, British and US Governments signed an agreement covering the dispersal of the first tranche of 50 million dollars of US support. That is the figure that we are talking about.  A sum of 120 million dollars was passed by Congress.  Canada is to donate 10 million dollars over ten years and in order to make it look more international, New Zealand was brought into it and a figure of 300,000 dollars was mentioned. Basically we are talking about the American money.</P>
    <P>I should like to make some general points on the fund.  In the agreement the serious under-employment and multiple deprivation which created this problem in Northern Ireland is referred to.  In the first preamble it states that serious under-employment and multiple deprivation create an environment in which instability can flourish and that instability and conflict in turn create conditions inimical to social and economic progress.  It has been the policies of the Coalition Government here and the Tory Government in Northern Ireland which have contributed more than anything else to the unemployment, under-employment and multiple deprivation which exists on both sides of the Border.  While these <Col N="1976" /> policies continue, this multiple deprivation and under-empoyment will continue.</P>
    <P>When Mrs. Thatcher first took office in 1979 unemployment in Northern Ireland was 60,000.  It has more than doubled since then and is now 130,000.  Social services, health, education and housing have all been subjected to sweeping cuts. This year the Northern Ireland Housing Executive budget has been cut by £44 million sterling.  That is considerably more than the 50 million dollars we are talking about.  What is the function of this money?  Is it simply to provide a subsidy to the British Government?  Three-quarters of it will go to the British Government and one-quarter to the Irish Government who have their own cutbacks. What will be the net gain if the money is allocated to Northern Ireland and if the British Government continue to make further financial cutbacks?</P>
    <P>We have been told that this money is to be used by firms North and South. The political philosophy of the manner in which the money is to be spent is set down very clearly in three separate sections. Article 3 states that in pursuance of these objectives the fund shall stimulate private investment and enterprise, supplement public programmes and encourage voluntary effort.  Section 4(a) speaks of the stimulation of private sector investment, in particular by means of venture capital arrangements using some of the resources of the fund.  Article 9 states that the fund shall provide money for and initiate the establishment of two investment companies, one to be established in each part of Ireland with a significant number of common directors and similar objectives whose function will be to furnish venture capital for the private sector.</P>
    <P>I understand the American Ambassador stated earlier in the year that the funds being allocated must not be used for an enterprise in which the State will have an involvement.  There are very serious restrictions on the manner in which the money is to be used.  It is to be used for the private sector.  Deputy Harte wants the money to be used to get <Col N="1977" /> garages along the Border back in business. I do not know what private sector will be helped by this money but the philosophy is set out very clearly.  It is clear that the objectives of the agreement are largely to promote the private enterprise system, the system which has led to the deprivation, the unemployment and the general disaster on both sides of the Border.</P>
    <P>Attention should be drawn to the composition of the board.  It is made up of the predictable collection of businessmen, people who can be relied on not to offend the private enterprise system and the ethic of both Governments involved.  The significant thing about this group is that there is no representative of the working class people and no representative of the underemployed and the people suffering from multiple deprivation.  On this board there is no one who has the slightest understanding of the problems of the ordinary people in Northern Ireland, who has any idea of what it is like to live in the deprived areas, in the Protestant and Catholic ghettoes in Belfast and Derry, or what it is like to be unemployed, poorly housed or constantly harassed and intimidated by paramilitaries.  The people who will be involved in this fund &mdash; I do not know what say our Government had in their appointment &mdash; do not understand the problems which they say they are there to heal.</P>
    <P>The objectives of the fund, as Deputy O'Malley quoted, are to promote economic and social advance and to encourage contact, dialogue and reconciliation between nationalists and unionists throughout Ireland.  How in God's name are they going to do that?  Whatever hope there was of doing it a year ago, there is very little hope of doing it today.  They are now so far apart that if one threw the dollars along the middle of the road neither side would go out to pick them up. How will we encourage contact, dialogue and reconciliation at a time when the whole policy which is being promoted has had the effect of driving people further apart?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1978" /> I am well aware, and have said so constantly, that the main factor in driving Protestants and Catholics apart in Northern Ireland has been the Provisionals' bombing, and shooting and murder campaign there.  People right through that period and through that campaign were working constantly in an endeavour to have a solid group of Catholics and Protestants who wanted to work together or at least to promote peace rather than killing and shooting.  In the past year the unfortunate effect of the attempt in this Anglo-Irish Agreement has been to isolate the Unionist and Protestant population, give them a kick in the teeth, show them that nobody was going to pay any attention to them any more and to promote the SDLP and have them toasted in Brussels, Dublin, London and Washington.</P>

      <P>Deputy MacGahon is in a different world.  We are talking about Northern Ireland and the people involved in that have been the British Government, the Government here in Dublin, the American Government and, of course, the SDLP who were the promoters from the beginning, with John Hume, over the last three, four or five years.  The effect of that isolation attempt has been to unify the Protestant unionist people as never before, to drive them further apart from their Catholic neighbours, to intimidate people further and to create new barriers of galvanised walls between people in Belfast and other parts of the North so that all the work in that area of reconciliation of the groups involved has been wiped out.  I am not saying it is impossible or that nobody is talking to anybody, but the possibilties for development along peaceful lines have been put much further away than they were previously.</P>

      <P>I will conclude.  As I said, I felt from the beginning that much more time should be allocated for this debate.  I do not want to deprive other Deputies of their opportunity to speak and I know Deputy McGahon has points he wants to make here in the House.  He has referred to them on previous occasions.  I wish to draw the attention of the House to the dangers involved in accepting American Government aid.  I am not worried if the American Government just want to throw money to us. That is all right and we should use it to the best advantage, but the effects are beginning to be seen already.  I worry very much about the effect on our Government policy and on the attitude of our people to handouts and to American aid at a time when we are pretty poverty stricken and in big debt, and when we are promised £50 million or £100 million next year we will make our foreign policy conform to that handout attitude.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanMcGahon" hpid="Mr. McGahon Mr. McGahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>I deplore Deputy Mac Giolla's shameful attitude to the great American nation that I, like so many other Irishmen, admire.  He has handed an insult to the 40 million ethnic Irish in that great nation.  While I am not surprised at his attitude, I am rather disappointed at his dog in the manger attitude to the very generous contribution by the American nation in their effort to bring to an end the appalling tragedy that is Ulster.  Also, his use of the phrase &ldquo;working class&rdquo; is a chilling preview of what life would be like under a Marxist-Socialist Government.  Deputy Mac Giolla never loses an opportunity to attack the nation that is closest to the Irish people, the American nation.  His reaction is totally blank to the aid they have given to the free world starting with the Marshall Aid plan at the end of the last world war and he is always silent about the atrocities of the Russian Government.  While he never loses an opportunity to include Nicaragua he choses to ignore the appalling rape of Afghanistan and countries under the <Col N="1980" /> yoke of the hammer and sickle.  So much for his Socialist and Marxist philosophy.</P>
      <P>As a Border Deputy I have watched over the past 20 years the crucifixion of the two communities in the north.  At one stage in the early seventies I lived within two miles of the Border and I am married to a girl from across the Border.  I have watched with mounting horror the atrocities being perpetrated by both sides, by the two wild extremists in the two communities.  I watched with horror the atrocities committed by the Official IRA in the early seventies.  Many questions still remain to be answered about the activities of that sector of the community.</P>

      <P>As a Border Deputy I congratulate all concerned in the Anglo-Irish initiative and in particular I congratulate the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Barry, on their untiring efforts over four years. They have succeeded in getting the British Government to acknowledge in a written agreement for the first time in 70 years that some day they will vacate this country and that unhappy part of Ireland. That was a tremendous achievement, and history will evaluate their efforts very highly.  It was not easy to achieve against a very unyielding Mrs. Thatcher and an unholy alliance of unionists, Provisional IRA and INLA and on some occasions the begrudging attitute of the Fianna Fáil Party to this historic document.  As one person who felt that the problem of Ireland was insoluble, I believe now that we can at some time in the future achieve reconciliation in the North.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We can thank the nations of the world who have contributed so magnificently and generously to this thrust, particularly the American nation, and the Canadian Government for their contribution of £10 million.  This is recognition by the Governments of the world of the appalling, awful tragedy of Ireland and the division of this country.  The political parties should acknowledge this great feat, put their shoulder to the wheel and support <Col N="1981" /> the Government rather than indulging in nit-picking exercises and dog in the manger attitudes.</P>
    <P>In regard to the composition of the board, I congratulate the Government on their very careful selection.  I acknowledge the appointment of a man from my own region, Mr. Neil McCann, a businessman of international renown who has made a great success of his life and will do full justice to the board.  The other members of the board are all eminent men and I feel they will do a good job in achieving the desired objective, economic progress on either side of the Border.</P>
    <P>I do not begrudge the amount of money that will be spent in the Six Counties because that land has been tortured over the past 18 or 19 years.  I hope it will bring some semblance of peace along the Border.  I have watched my region being blighted.  In Dundalk and north County Louth we have borne the brunt of the Ulster troubles.  I feel very sore that successive Governments have not appreciated the economic deprivation that has occurred.  We have fallen from the pinnacle we once occupied as the best business town in Ireland and withered to economic extinction.  I fear that with the coming of Christmas, very large amounts of money will flow across the Border adding further nails in our coffin. However, we take some comfort from the fact that we have been told Dundalk will be one of the chief beneficiaries of the Anglo-Irish money and the quicker the money is allocated the better.</P>
    <P>I want to express some apprehension about the activities of the outlawed Ulster Freedom Fighters and their very frightening threats of bombs and retaliation in the south.  As a Border man I fear for the people of my region.  We suffered a tragic fatal bombing in 1972 when two perfectly innocent men I knew very well lost their lives.  There is a feeling of anxiety in Dundalk tonight and in all Border towns because of these threats.  I exhort the Government, although I know they do not need to hear my words to spur them into action, to ensure that all towns along the Border will be given <Col N="1982" /> maximum security against the threats of these outrageous people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>Six minutes is a very short time indeed to deal with the problems and economic difficulties we have on the Border, but I will have to try to give a synopsis.</P>
      <P>I fear that the international fund money will be projected by the Coalition Government as the solution to the economic problems affecting the Border regions and that mere infrastructural projects will take care of the severe unemployment that exists in County Louth where over 8,000 are unemployed, over 4,000 in the Border town of Dundalk.</P>
      <P>In this House and at other venues I have listened to the excuse being put forward that the economic ills of Dundalk and other Border towns flow directly from the northern troubles.  I submit that that is not so.  If it contributes it is a very small factor indeed.  The major contributory factor has been the price differentials and the differences in the levels of taxation.  The outflow of funds from our area northwards because of this has rebounded in turn on the trading sector with many businesses in Dundalk, Castleblayney, Ardee and other Border towns going into liquidation.</P>
      <P>We are approximately four years into Coalition Government here and there has been a complete lack of awareness of the economic ills affecting Border areas.  We have been treated to some verbal promises as to what will be done.  Unfortunately the sort of concrete measures that need to be taken are not in the pipeline. If they are, the Coalition Ministers have not been telling us about them, unless a general election brings them out, and at that stage it would be unrealistic to expect that promises will provide an instant solution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The industrial base of Louth was very traditional and labour intensive.  The natural environment for industry is still there.  We are fortunate to have a regional college and a more than adequate infrastructure.  We have the skills and the know-how which unfortunately are not being utilised because <Col N="1983" /> they are in the hands of the unemployed of this town.  Some time ago I asked the Government to consider the possibility of establishing an industrial development agency on a pilot basis for County Louth but we have had no response yet.  Many feel that in the various agencies who have direct or indirect responsibility, there is a lack of the co-ordination and effort that we need to give an edge to our industrial promotions.  I believe that the problem of perhaps some of this money being put towards an industrial development agency to come to terms with unemployment and to stimulate the industrial development which in turn will create the employment locally needs to be tackled immediately.</P>
    <P>I am sorry I must finish now since the time scale is very restrictive and the Minister wishes to commence at 6.30.  I hope when the Minister comes to reply he will freely recognise and admit that there has been a grievous neglect of the Border areas and County Louth in particular.  I hope he will tell us tonight that it is the Government's intention to bring forward the sort of measures which are needed immediately to tackle these problems.</P>

      <P>As a Deputy from a Border area, County Leitrim, there is one point I would like to mention.  This is the only Border county which does not have a direct link with Northern Ireland. There is no road open between County Leitrim and County Fermanagh.  If anything is to be done for this county under the Anglo-Irish Agreement, I hope County Leitrim will be given a direct link with County Fermanagh and that the road will once again be opened.</P>

      <P>Deputy Kirk appears to be under a misapprehension as to what this debate is all about.  He must not have read my speech.  This debate has nothing to do with the Government's contribution to the Border.  He said that the Government project the fund as being their solution to the Border region.  Had he read my contribution he would know I said the <Col N="1984" /> opposite.  The Government have nothing to do with this fund and that fact was welcomed by Deputy Leonard.  Most Deputies recognise that this was a very positive move.  In case Deputy Kirk did not get a copy of my speech, I will provide one for him.</P>
      <P>I want to thank the House for the welcome they have given to the International Fund for Ireland.  The setting up of this fund is another milestone not alone in our relations with Britain but also with those countries which have so generously contributed to this fund.  That fact was recognised and welcomed by all Members of this House, with one notable exception, Deputy Mac Giolla.  I thought his contribution was mean, begrudging and carping.  He failed to respond to the generosity of the American people in making available considerable funds for this country.  The practical assistance underlines the links of kinship and history between the people of this island and abroad.  It is worth noting that the countries which were first in with their contributions &mdash; Canada, America and New Zealand &mdash; have strong ties of kinship and friendship with Ireland.  There are many people of Irish descent living in those three countries.</P>
      <P>This fund will have a major impact on the Border areas and, as Deputy O'Malley said, it is hoped it will bring about peace and reconciliation between the different traditions on this island.  It was the intention of both Governments who signed the Anglo-Irish Agreement, which included a clause in relation to this fund, that it would make such a contribution. I believe this is the motivation behind the three countries which have already contributed to the fund and I am sure it will have that effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to reply to a number of points which have been raised.  Deputy Collins, Deputy Conaghan and Deputy O'Malley asked about the contributions from the EC fund.  Over a number of months we have held discussions with the British Government about the possibility of a Community contribution, because the Community would wish to have a joint approach from the two countries.  As <Col N="1985" /> recently as yesterday I spoke to the British Foreign Secretary about it and we have arranged a meeting of officials from both sides in the very near future to thresh out the methodology of a joint approach in this regard.  The question of access to the EC structural fund for cross-Border projects is important and has been raised by a number of Deputies, including Deputy Leonard, but this is not related to the international fund.  This could be debated at a different time.  I will bring to the attention of the Department of Finance the points raised here by a number of Deputies when the applications to the structural fund are being made.</P>
    <P>Deputy Collins made a very important point.  The US Congress, through this fund and the reporting back procedure, will continue to have a valid and continuing interest in this country and in the progress of the Anglo-Irish Agreement. The President of the United States is by law required to report back each year on the criteria set out in the fund &mdash; the extent to which the fund has contributed to reconciliation between the communities in Northern Ireland, ensuring the US contribution is meeting the objectives of encouraging new investment, job creation, economic reconstruction on the basis of strict equality of opportunity &mdash; this is a very important point &mdash; and that the fund has increased respect for human rights and fundamental freedom for all the people in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Deputy Harte made a number of very important points, one of which has been mentioned by nearly all Deputies, about the decimation of the Border towns, the effect that different levels of taxation are having on both sides of the Border and the effect the troubles are having not just on the Border areas but on the Irish economy.  I pointed out on a number of occasions recently the cost of the troubles in the North to the Irish taxpayers.  It is a bit late for Deputy Mac Giolla to come into this House and berate our efforts to deal with this problem.  When we established the New Ireland Forum almost four years ago Members were invited to participate on a party basis.  Deputy Mac <Col N="1986" /> Giolla's party were invited but they did not accept.  If he wanted to make a contribution towards bringing about reconciliation between the traditions in the North, he had the opportunity then, but he did not take it.  It is a bit late for him to come into this House and lecture us on this and on other matters relating to Northern Ireland.  He accused us of being in the pockets of the Americans with the handful of dollars.  He described this as a slush fund, I do not now where he gets that type of vocabulary or how he thinks it applies to a democratically elected parliament&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>This fund was established and contributed to by three countries the democratic structure of which was never in doubt.  Through their Governments the people of those countries are freely and willingly contributing to this fund.  It is a matter of which I am very proud.  Deputy Mac Giolla and his party declined the invitation to take part in the debate in the New Ireland Forum in which he would have learned a lot, including the cost of violence to this country and the problems in Northern Ireland over the last 15 to 17 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was quantified by very eminent economists at the time, for the Forum, and it quantified the loss in tourism to this economy, as £1,180 million in that period.  The extra cost of security because of the troubles in the North was counted as being £900 million, up to 1984.  It has cost us more since.  That is the extra cost, not the cost of our existing Garda and Army.  Our Army has doubled over that period and the Garda force has increased by two thirds.  These are extra costs to the taxpayer.  The Border regions have been affected and I would not dream of suggesting that they have not been hardest hit of all the regions.  It was in recognition of that that the fund was divided between North and South.  Deputy Leonard referred to how this fund would be spent in the Border regions.  I would <Col N="1987" /> draw his attention to paragraph 2, page 4, of my speech where I said:</P>
    <P>The Agreement provides that approximately three-quarters of the resources of the Fund will be spent in Northern Ireland with the remainder expended here.  In its operation in this jurisdiction, I expect that the Fund will give particular consideration to the Border areas.</P>
    <P>It is in recognition of the fact that the Border areas have been badly affected, that the division of the Fund was decided on.  The economy of the whole island has been severely damaged by the violence of the last 17 or 18 years.</P>
    <P>Our primary objective must be the humanitarian one of saving lives.  We all know that 2,700 lives have been lost during that time.  We know the appalling carnage that has gone on and we know of the damage to property.  We know, too, that the divisions that have been created have had political backing and have been unfortunately accepted, at least in those 17 years, as the norm in Northern Ireland.  For those reasons the British Government entered into negotiations on the Anglo-Irish Agreement. Another reason is the economic cost to both parts of the country.  A number of Deputies have drawn attention to the fact that the Border is badly damaged.  I fully accept that.</P>
    <P>Deputy Leonard made a good point, which I presume he will make to the board when it is established, that a lot of work in the Border areas has already been done in a number of studies that have taken place.  Deputy Leonard also said he was glad to see that the Government stipulated that there be a distancing of both Governments from the operation of this fund so that the board will be entirely independent of representations from Governments.  I would underline that point.  So far as I am concerned the board will not be interfered with; they will be quite free.  They will be given advice by civil servants from a number of Departments here and in the North, but <Col N="1988" /> they will make their own decisions independently of any politicians, Government or Opposition, North or South.  I give that undertaking here and now.</P>
    <P>Deputy Leonard referred to the £10 million promised by the Taoiseach when he was in Dundalk about a month or six weeks ago.  The Deputy may be under the impression that the Taoiseach promised this out of the fund.  The Taoiseach could not do that, as he has no say in the fund.</P>

I take the point made by Deputy Leonard that the fund should not be a substitution for funds already available but should be in addition to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Conaghan said he thought the violence was emanating from unemployment and that if that was cured there would not be a necessity for this fund. That is not correct, although I wish it was. It is undoubtedly a contributory factor in that it provides a pool in which paramilitaries can fish for young men and women frustrated with the whole system who are looking for an easy way out. There is no doubt that behind these innocent young men when they are recruited <Col N="1989" /> are evil people on both sides of the divide who are manipulating them.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley was quite right in saying that the signing of the Anglo-Irish Agreement is a major step forward and that it has the posssibility of bringing peace and reconciliation.  Deputy O'Malley referred to the fact that he was a member of a Government who, 15 years ago, got a curt two line note from the British Government to say that their views were not welcome and that they had nothing to do with the running of Northern Ireland.  Much more recently than that, only four years ago, the British Prime Minister answered a question in the House of Commons by saying that the Irish Government have no say nor would they ever have a say in the running of Northern Ireland.  I do not say that in a sense of triumphalism, at having changed that position.  The Forum report had a major influence in changing attitudes in Britain about Ireland and particularly about the North.  It was the voice of Irish nationalism being presented in a reasonable way with very generous offers in it and fully backed up with documentation as to how we saw the future of this island. It was that generosity and that detailed submission that grabbed the attention of the British Government, particularly the British Prime Minister, to show that here was a problem that could not be wished away and that it was not about sovereignty, loyalty or anything else but about a genuine problem of alienation in which a large slice of the population of Northern Ireland were against the regime of Government under which they lived. It was that that changed the attitudes. The change is a fundamental change and the agreement of which this fund is part, <Col N="1990" /> with courage on both sides, can bring about the objectives of that agreement in the future.  I thank the House for their warm welcome, with one exception, for this essential part of the Anglo-Irish Agreement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>When we were discussing this previously I said how futile it was for the Minister to bring pressure to bear on the building societies in regard to the interest rates they charge to mortgage holders.  In a free enterprise economy, building societies are in competition for depositors' funds with commercial and industrial banks, insurance companies, the Agricultural Credit Corporation and the Industrial Credit Corporation.</P>
      <P>The structure of the building societies leaves much to be desired.  Their costs are enormous and it is easy to see why. Their percentage management expenses on the sum of £2,000 of depositors' funds is higher than any of their competitors in the United Kingdom.  If, as a result of an EC Directive, we will have to allow foreign building societies to operate here, Irish building societies will be operating at a considerable disadvantage unless they put their houses in order.  It is not my business to tell them how to do that but, because of the extraordinary competition for depositors' funds, advertising campaigns must cost a fortune.  They must also have very high expenses in connection with their branch network.  They also pay fees to auctioneers and insurance brokers which means that their management expenses are very high.  They are competing so hard for investors' funds that, unless they reduce their management expenses, they will not be able to compete.  Competition by foreign building societies will not ease the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why are interest rates so high?  We <Col N="1991" /> blame everyone and everything we can think of, including the recession. However, one of the reasons for interest rates being so high is excessive Government borrowing.  Successive Governments try to raise finance to fund their programmes and it is a matter of supply and demand.  The total borrowing of the State at present is in the region of £23 billion.  This year the current budget deficit will be about £1,450 million.  The Government can only get this money at home or abroad and they are also competing for funds.  This, in turn, keeps up interest rates irrespective of those in other countries.  The voraciousness of Governments in seeking funds contributes to the problem of high interest rates.  If the Government could get their own finances in order some semblance of normality would return to the interest market.  This will not happen, irrespective of rates in the United Kingdom or elsewhere, because of our financial situation which has got increasingly worse over the past four years.</P>
    <P>The building societies must compete with the banks for the same funds.  The Government, in order to attract investors' funds, must offer higher interest rates and are mopping up any surplus supply.  However, demand is exceeding supply and, unless we get our public finances in order, high interest rates will continue.</P>
    <P>Several Deputies referred to the DIRT tax.  I agree with the Minister's comment that this tax would level the pitch for all concerned including the banks and building societies.  For years the banks had objected to the preferential treatment given to building societies regarding non-disclosure of accounts.  The building societies had to raise their interest rates to secure the small amount of funds on the market which meant increasing the mortgage rates.  The pitch may have been levelled as far as competition between the financial institutions is concerned by the introduction of the DIRT tax, but we must remember that it led to the introduction of higher mortgage rates because <Col N="1992" /> the banks were equally attractive in regard to depositors' funds.  The building societies want to keep the little margin they had over the banks to attract funds and that is why their rates have risen. The Minister for the Environment and the Minister for Finance have very little control over interest rates.  If the Government cannot put their own affairs in order, interest rates will continue to rise.</P>
    <P>This Bill will not have much effect on building societies.  There are two approaches one might take with regard to tiered interest rates &mdash; whether they are for a good or for a bad purpose.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann condemns the Government's failure to arrest the continuing rise in unemployment and emigration and calls for urgent action by the Government to deal with the present crisis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I reject the amendment which has been submitted asking the Dáil to support Government policies to promote the growth of employment.  I do not know what these policies are: maybe they will be outlined for me.  I also condemn the suggestion in the amendment that the reason for our unemployment has got to do with the European Community.  I hope in my short contribution to put lie to that indication.  The latest unemployment figures, revealing a total of 232,691 people on the live register, underline yet again the complete and utter failure of the Coalition on the jobs crisis and the <Col N="1994" /> threadbare content of the Government's economic policies.  The Government are hopelessly adrift.  They have lost all sense of direction in relation to the conduct of economic policy.  The result is an appalling and frightening number of people without jobs.</P>
    <P>It is well-nigh incredible to hear the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance in recent statements talking vaguely about setting the economy to rights.  What have they been doing for the past four years? They have presided over a massive hike in interest rates and mortgage rates, attributable to their short-sighted approach to investment policy, most glaringly evident in the introduction of the now notorious DIRT tax.  From their disastrous approach to economic policy has flowed huge increases in emigration and unemployment, as well as the flight of Irish capital abroad.</P>
    <P>Unemployment has increased by 70,000 since 1982, while in the period 1984-86, 51,000 people have emigrated. This relentlessly upward spiral in the jobless has completely overturned the central plank of this Governments' strategy coming into Government.</P>
    <P>At its inception the Joint Programme for Government, referring to the 170,000 people who were jobless in November 1982, pointed out the need for &ldquo;firm and decisive action&rdquo; and set the Coalition Government the task of &ldquo;halting and reversing the growth of unemployment&rdquo;. This central aim of the Coalition was restated in <i>Building on Reality</i> in October 1984 when the jobless level stood at 212,300.  <i>Building on Reality</i> said the numbers out of work would peak at 220,000 at the end of 1984 and would fall to 210,000 by April 1987.  It must be obvious that this expected drop to 210,000 in four months' time is not going to be achieved.  The other targets set did not happen.  Instead, we saw the unemployment figures climb to 228,000 in April 1985, to 240,400 in January 1986 and 232,691 in October 1986.  Let us keep in mind the 51,000 who have emigrated in the last two years.</P>
    <P>The latest figures available represent an increase of 7,100 in the seasonally <Col N="1995" /> adjusted figures over the past year. Between November 1982 and October 1986, unemployment rose by 70,000 or by 40 per cent under the present Government. This is directly due to Government economic policies which have led to a slump in investment and a drastic slowdown in the overall level of activity in the economy.  Irish capital flees freely from the country to create jobs abroad.</P>
    <P>The result has been tens of thousands of redundancies at home in the lifetime of the present Government: 29,915 in 1983; 31,290 in 1984 and 22,390 in 1985. In the same period of time there were 1,151 closures, 1,738 liquidations and 413 receiverships.  Therefore, in the years 1983-85 the Government presided over some 83,595 redundancies and in the first six months of this year there have been 384 liquidations and 58 receiverships.</P>
    <P>Ireland's unemployment in the lifetime of the Coalition has risen faster than in the other EC countries.  Between 1982 and 1985, unemployment rose by 44 per cent compared to 3 per cent in Belgium, 23 per cent in Germany, 18 per cent in France, 12 per cent in Holland and 14 per cent in the UK.  In Ireland, 18 per cent of the workforce is unemployed compared to an EC average of between 11 per cent and 12 per cent.  At present 72,423 of those out of work are under 25 years, compared to 50,400 in November 1982.</P>
    <P>The projection in <i>Building on Reality</i> that employment would grow by 33,000 between 1984 and 1987 foundered &mdash; between April 1984 and April 1985 some 30,000 jobs were lost.  This, if we are to include special schemes leaves the Coalition 63,000 jobs short of target.  The policies of the Government have totally paralysed the construction sector.  Some 50,000 people are out of work in the building industry.</P>
    <P>The unemployment figures, appallingly high as they are, fail to take account of the impact of emigration: 20,000 people emigrated between April 1984 and 1985; 31,000 people emigrated between April 1985 and 1986; and the trend is continuing unabated.  This <Col N="1996" /> exodus is the achievement of the present Administration.  This and the tragedy of 250,000 people out of work is the monument to the barren economic achievements of the past four years.</P>
    <P>Some 50 per cent of highly qualified graduates in the high technology sector who graduated this summer have already emigrated, according to a report in a Sunday newpaper of 9 November 1986 which put the cost of training this year's crop of graduates in hardware skills at about £7 million.  This represents an enormous loss of highly skilled manpower which should be harnessed to help build the indigenous advanced technical sector at home.</P>
    <P>High taxation and the fact that investment in industry has fallen to under 3 per cent annually over the past four years must be adjudged a huge factor in the failure to create the kind of advanced projects which would entice such graduates to stay at home, and which would contribute to the formation of the high tech sector in Ireland.  Instead of encouraging investment in this sector the Coalition have presided over the flight of the best and brightest to help to develop the economies of our competitors.</P>
    <P>It is clear that young people are woefully ill-equipped to deal with emigration. It is utterly disgraceful that the Government have failed to give any indication of devising a thoughtful approach to take account of emigration.  Last March a conference on emigration organised by the Youth Emigration Action Group, and the London-based Action Group for Irish Youth, noted that the Government's preoccupation with training schemes instead of creating jobs was forcing young Irish people to emigrate.  A resolute approach to boosting real economic growth is the long-term answer to emigration.  Faced with this massive human tragedy of joblessness and emigration, the Government have assumed a hollow blustering position.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce over the past six months has stubbornly repeated his belief in a consumer spending boom which will, he says, improve the situation.  This is a myth <Col N="1997" /> and the boom has failed to materialise. Consumer demand actually declined in the first six months of the year.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance in late spring was forecasting an increase in employment of 1 per cent this year but the latest bulletin from the Central Bank estimates the numbers at work will decline in 1986 by about 1 per cent indicating that the Minister's target is out by 2 per cent.  This partiality for fictitious economic forecasting is not shared solely by the Minister for Finance.  The Taoiseach has lost all credibility on the issue of unemployment, consistently claiming over the past three years that the unemployment trend has improved, despite the disappearance of 70,000 jobs in that period.</P>
    <P>On 11 March 1985, and on 3 July this year, as well as on a number of other occasions, the Taoiseach claimed in the House that economic activity and employment were improving.  That was not true and it is still not true.  The Taoiseach has constantly misrepresented the facts on jobs, revealing the barren and deceitful nature of the Government's approach to the problem.</P>
    <P>The Government have done nothing positive to create a climate of confidence conducive to investment where we can begin to tackle unemployment by developing our considerable potential in areas such as food processing, forestry, fishing, aquaculture, tourism and so on.  As I have just said, there would appear to be no investment strategy designed to exploit here at home our highly educated young people in pursuit of developing Irish enterprise.</P>
    <P>The Government sadly lack the resolution and the gumption to deal with a situation where one in five of the workforce is without a job.  This is clearly the view of the thousands of people who have emigrated over the past three years.  The Coalition's pledge to create employment by fostering a climate of enterprise through appropriate tax and incentive policies is meaningless.</P>
    <P>With the huge growth in the numbers out of work we have had an increase in the number of marginal groups in society with a corresponding increase in poverty, <Col N="1998" /> deprivation and inequality unprecedented in the history of the State.  Some urban housing estates have unemployment levels of 50 to 60 per cent. Instead of resolute leadership and a profound examination of the causes of the most pressing problem of our time, we are being treated to a pathetic display of lip service to the unemployed.  Statistics are being manipulated in a vain and cynical attempt to hide the true seriousness of the problem and the Government's gross ineptitude in dealing with it.  The cost of joblessness bears heavily on every sector in our society.  A tragic amount of financial and psychological damage has been imposed on those involved and their families.  It is terrifying to note that more people are now registered unemployed than work in the manufacturing sector.</P>
    <P>The Government's failure to move beyond the parameters of conventional thinking ignores the successful examples of other small nations with limited physical resources such as Austria, Sweden, Switzerland and Finland which have successfully pursued highly productive economic strategies with relatively low unemployment rates.  The Cabinet have failed to devise such a strategy and because of this the Cabinet Task Force on employment was doomed to failure from the outset.  Since its inception three years ago it has signally failed to bring an innovative and integrated approach to the problems of joblessness.  In this context the establishment at the beginning of March of a new ministerial task force to spearhead job creation was a meaningless measure.  Government intervention has increased to the employer the cost of taking on staff.  For the employee the rewards for work have been cut by high taxation.  The cost to the employer per worker in recent years has risen by 26 per cent in real terms while his take home pay fell by 6 per cent.  We will not increase jobs until we begin to remove the obstacles which make it unattractive for employers to take on workers and which act as a disincentive to work.</P>
    <P>On the record I have outlined the Government should resign and allow Fianna Fáil to take up the challenge <Col N="1999" /> which we will pursue confidently with all the success we achieved in the past.</P>

      <P>Táimid faoi láthair i dtréimhse cinniúna maidir le óige na tíre.  Tá líon na hóige anois ar phointe níos airde mar chéad chodán de iomlán an daonra ná mar bhí sé in am ar bith i stair na tíre.  Ach in ainneoin sin tá díomá agus easpa dóchais i measc na hóige mar nach bhfuil fostaíocht le fáil acu.  Tá méadú fíochmhar ar imirce, ar choirpeachas, ar fhoréigean agus ar mhí-úsáid druganna. Seo toradh an díomhaointis agus an éadóchaís  atá fómharaithe ag polasaí an Rialtais.

      <P>I support the motion.  This is the most important motion in the conduct of our business in this House because it addresses fundamentally and straightforwardly the greatest crisis and the greatest problem the country finds itself with.  I assure the House that the constituency of Dublin north-east which I represent can be described as an unemployment black spot, or at least 60 per cent of it.  I was very interested in the statistics used by Deputy Lyons.  He referred to housing estates around the country which in some cases have an unemployment rate of 60 per cent.  There are estates in my constituency, particularly throughout the Coolock area, with unemployment as high as 65 per cent. Fathers and their children, male and female, all older than school-going age, are idle, without prospects, without hope, totally demoralised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The clear message the Government should get this evening in the face of this enormous crisis, because of their inept handling and total failure to confront it, is that people in our urban and rural communities are frustrated, annoyed, disappointed and sick.  If the great social consequences of this problem are to be addressed this Government must step down because they have lost the will to govern, the ability to show leadership. <Col N="2000" /> The obvious solution is that they give way to an alternative Government who will deal with these problems.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lyons referred to many statements issued by the Taoiseach and the Ministers for Finance and Industry and Commerce in the past 12 months.  I often wonder if the Taoiseach and his Ministers are in touch with what is happening on the ground or if they know how people feel, how people are speaking.  I am in touch and it is obvious from what Deputy Lyons has said that he is.  Our people are fed up, depressed, and they no longer have confidence in the ability of the Government to provide their basic right to aspire to jobs.  When we ponder the frightening consequences of our unemployment rate and its corollary of emigration, particularly high youth emigration, one of the most abiding memories we have is of the bleak years of the fifties when the emigrant boats were leaving our shores with increasing frequency.  People were forced to leave in those days for varied reasons, not at all dissimilar to the reasons that are forcing thousands of our young people, and some not so young, to try to seek a living abroad today.</P>
    <P>It is not just a coincidence that both these periods have been dominated by Coalition Governments.  Then, like now, it was the misfortune of this country to have a Government completely bankrupt of ideas to stimulate an economy crying out for investment.  Then we had a Government incapable of opening factories. Now we have one whose Ministers are tripping over each other to close them down.</P>
    <P>I believe it was D. H. Lawrence who said, &ldquo;The only real tragedy is loss of heart&rdquo;.  It is unpardonable of any Government who, having lost faith in themselves, proceed to destroy the hopes, the dreams and legitimate aspirations of our young people.  A Government who do not understand the mistakes of the past are doomed to repeat them.</P>
    <P>In the past four years, this country has sadly witnessed unemployment climbing to almost a quarter of a million and, let us not be confused, this graph is still <Col N="2001" /> rising.  Penal taxation is stifling incentive and enterprise, is forcing many into the black economy and making emigration the only option for thousands of others.</P>
    <P>Just as the Coalitions of the fifties saw emigration as the solution to the unemployment problem, the present Government see nothing amoral in foisting our young jobless thousands onto the same foreign shores, in many cases young people who are ill equipped, unprepared and who are said to be cast as vulnerable fodder for the ruthless commercial interests they inevitably will encounter abroad.</P>
    <P>Every Irish citizen is entitled to claim the right to work in his own homeland and every Irish Government are charged with the responsibility of managing the resources of the country towards that end.  This Government's inept handling of our affairs has rendered this fundamental objective totally unattainable at present.  It represents a crime against Irish youth.</P>
    <P>So bleak and depressing was the situation towards the end of the fifties that the major objective of the incoming Fianna Fáil Government was to banish once and for all this spectre of emigration. I am proud to say that by the end of the sixties, emigration which had almost drained the life blood of this island for well over a century had become an irrelevancy in Irish politics.</P>
    <P>The then Lemass Government's belief in themselves and the ability of the Irish people forced a policy of industrialisation across the country and raised the hopes of the Irish people to meet with confidence the immense challenge of the second half of the 20th century.</P>
    <P>If we look at the statistics, and note the great lack of statistics up to very recently in relation to the rate of emigration, we will find a number of curious pronouncements in this House.  Speaking at a conference on youth emigration on Thursday 3 April last, the Minister for Labour acknowledged total emigration to be 25,000 per year.  Even if we accept these figures as accurately reflecting the magnitude of the problem, which we do not for one moment, the very fact of <Col N="2002" /> his acknowledgement alone is a dreadful indictment of the way in which this country is being managed.  The Taoiseach, in response to Dáil Questions from Deputy O'Kennedy and Deputy Frank Fahey on 19 February 1985, refused to accept that there had been any alarming increase in emigration.  Yet a Minister in his own Cabinet could quote figures showing an increase in youth emigration of 150 per cent for 1984.  How can these statements be squared?</P>
    <P>If the Taoiseach is so smug as to take consolation in what he described recently &mdash; and it has become a popular phrase of his &mdash; as a reduction in the rate of increase in unemployment, he should be reminded that his smugness will be at the expense of those 25,000 to 27,000 of our young people, apart from those who are not so young, who will be forced &mdash; and I mean forced &mdash; out of Ireland again this year in search of a job.  Many of them have already been pushed out.</P>
    <P>Just as the solution to emigration proved totally beyond the capabilities of previous Coalition Governments, so too it has baffled the present administration. Young people are now left without hope or opportunities and in increasing uncertainty due to the manner in which the country is being run.  We in Fianna Fáil have never believed in the politics of despair.  It is a most terrible indictment of any Government that their attitude should promote despair and lack of confidence. We have consistently asserted the potential of our highly educated young people, who are a flexible workforce, not only to come to terms with the micro chip revolution but to harness its power and influence its direction.  Surely what is required of any Government worth its salt is to chart a course for the national economy towards achieving that objective.  That must be the fundamental principle on which a Government should operate.</P>
    <P>Everybody accepts that the industrial base is changing right across the world. Everyone accepts that the challenge is to face up to change, to take it on and deal with it in the marketplace, whether at home or abroad.  However, along with <Col N="2003" /> that change have come new market situations. One of the things we have failed to do &mdash; and I shall be referring to it later in terms of the manner in which we have handled our fisheries policy &mdash; is to go out into that international market and secure a proper share of it.  Our performance and record in recent years in that respect have been disgraceful.</P>
    <P>This Government cannot claim any positive credit for achievements in the area of social or economic development during their tenure.  On the contrary, their achievements have been startlingly negative and have been impactful in the areas of increased unemployment, massively increased emigration and crucifying taxation.  The figures speak for themselves: they have been given so clearly and so accurately by Deputy Lyons.  We have 250,000 unemployed out of a population of 3½ million and surely this must put us at the top of the most despicable league in the developed world.  Indeed, it has already been said that we have the highest rate of increasing unemployment of all the EC countries.</P>
    <P>For those who like to philosophise, it must be remembered that employment is basically a means of distributing wealth. It is the most effective way that any country has to share out to all its people, or as many as possible, its package or cake of wealth.  It is the mechanism that provides for distribution of the national cake among our people.  To deprive a person of the opportunity to participate in the process is to foist an unacceptable inequity on him or her, particularly on so many who have skills to contribute and have a contribution to make.</P>
    <P>Employment increases the value of national resources.  Conversely, unemployment diminishes those resources.  It is nothing short of scandalous that people's skills are unharnessed, in many instances left to decay and indeed expire when the opportunity exists to increase our national resources through the development of our infrastructures, housing and facilities, food processing, fishing, tourism and many other areas all <Col N="2004" /> of which would enhance our attractiveness for investment in development.</P>
    <P>In the last six years, nobody would dispute that our unemployment level has grown to catastrophical proportions.  The depression that pervades our people as a result of that manifests itself in increased levels of crime, breakdown of family life, increased drug abuse and general apathy in terms of public spirit and ordinary unspectacular patriotism.  The more resourceful people in many instances are emigrating as a result and, regrettably, the economic climate from which they are departing does not infuse them with any enthusiasm to return.</P>
    <P>The Government obviously see emigration as one of the safety valves that release the pressure from the more vociferous of the unemployed.  The only hope, if one could extravagantly call it hope, that is offered by the Government is more of the same hopeless round of work experience, social employment schemes and social guarantee.  Increasingly recently we have heard of funds for these schemes drying up and of extremely small quotas being allowed to centres around the city and the country for participation in these schemes.  Even if we take it that there was a continuance of these schemes at the level at which they have operated over the last couple of years, they all at the end of the day guarantee nothing whatsoever in terms of sustainable employment, or indeed in terms of creating an economic base for future employment.  I should like to reflect here on the many things that I have heard from young people throughout the north eastern side of Dublin over the last couple of years in relation to these courses.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. L. Fitzgerald Mr. L. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>While many of these young people welcomed the opportunity to participate in these courses, to acquire skills which they hoped and believed would enable them to be in a more competitive position to get a job &mdash; and perhaps to a great extent it is true that it did <Col N="2005" /> put them in a more competitive position to get a job &mdash; nevertheless, what diminished their confidence, demoralised them and made them more cynical was that they were being trained, in most cases, to no avail.  There was nothing for them to compete for at the end of the line.  That is a raising of the level of expectation in our young people, only to have their hopes dashed as soon as they leave a course.  It is regrettable that to finance all this cosmetic employment &mdash; and it can only be referred to be as such &mdash; the taxation burden is increased further on those who are fortunate enough to be employed.</P>
      <P>Taxation levels are punitive.  The worker has his purchasing power diminished to a hand and mouth existence. As a result, the home market has suffered to an extent that endangers further the viability of many of our industries both in manufacturing and service.  The taxes raised through VAT and excise make us uncompetitive, even for our own people who go North in their thousands to buy goods and petrol.  As has been said in this House before, a shopping trip to Northern Ireland is now self-financing on the savings that can be made on one tankful of petrol bought up there.</P>
      <P>The Government with their monetarist policies that are pursued with unrelenting vigour are creating a cycle of diminishing returns from taxes, whereas it has been pointed out again and again that certain tax cuts can be self-financing.  If, for instance, the price of petrol were brought more into line with the price prevailing in Northern Ireland, people would find it less attractive to go up to the North to do their shopping.  This, in turn, would reduce considerably the amount that is spent on shopping in the North and would obviously be beneficial, not only to the Exchequer here but to our traders on this side of the Border and also in terms of the people employed here in terms of giving them greater job security.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Anybody who is immersed in the PAYE system, will be all too painfully aware of the difference between gross and take home pay.  Over the past three <Col N="2006" /> years, we have reached the ludicrous situation where a worker here can find himself on the top tax band with an income of just over £10,000.  Despite oil prices falling to the floor since last Christmas we are still in the position here of having the dearest petrol in the EC.  There is no way in which any economy can continue to sustain such a ridiculously high level of taxation.  The burden being carried by the Irish people, both with direct and indirect tax, is having a devastating and demoralising effect on our country.  It is frightening away huge investment from abroad and killing the incentive to work at home.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. L. Fitzgerald Mr. L. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am referring to it in the context of employment, because we are talking about unemployment, about the ability of and incentives of people to invest in employment creation. The level of taxation here is creating a distinct disincentive to people to invest in jobs, to be innovative and enterprising. That is the point that I am making here. The situation that pertains has created a distinct lack of confidence in the ability of this country to offer meaningful employment creation for those few who are fortunate enough to have a few bob to put into the country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. L. Fitzgerald Mr. L. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It is putting a terrible damper on this investment potential and if one takes the other side of the coin: if you save now, the Government hit you with DIRT; if you invest now they hammer you with tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another frightening consequence of this whole scene is that impoverished families are being pushed more deeply into the poverty trap.  The stories are legion of people going to the health board centres around this city &mdash; people who are working, trying to earn a living and are fortunate enough to be able to hold on to a job but simply not able to make <Col N="2007" /> ends meet.  Almost a thousand businesses went to the wall last year and we now have a new group in our society, the poor middle class.</P>
    <P>One of the most frightening developments of all arising out of that scene is the rampant black economy.  Instead of employment contributing to the Exchequer, contributing to the recycling of wealth, as all official employment is doing as fully as possible, we have what some people refer to as the gaping black hole, a cancer in our society.  While nobody in this House can condone the rapid development of the black economy, everybody must concede and understand that because of the lack of incentive and the high level of taxation more and more people are being forced into providing services through the black economy and more and more consumers are being forced to seek services from that quarter.</P>
    <P>Despite all the gimmicks that are being poured out in terms of grants to the building industry and other sectors &mdash; in themselves all grants are welcome to the recipients and do promote a bit of enterprise &mdash; the unacceptably high level of taxation has hammered the building industry.  Deputy Lyons referred to the fact that well over 50,000 skilled, semiskilled and unskilled workers from this industry are redundant with no prospect of jobs in the near future.  Another area which concerns us greatly is that of science and technology.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann supports the Government's policies to promote the growth of employment and intensify the fight against unemployment and recognises that an effective response to the persistence of large-scale unemployment throughout the European <Col N="2008" /> Community requires stronger action and closer co-operation on the part of all Member States.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the problem of unemployment represents the greatest single challenge facing us today.  In terms of both its social and economic cost it represents a burden which we cannot continue to bear and which we must use every means at our disposal to alleviate.</P>
    <P>This Government are committed to contributing in every possible and rational way to a solution to this problem. I say &ldquo;contributing to as solution&rdquo; because at the end of the day, the Government's task is to create the right environment for job creation; to bring about a situation where individuals and businesses up and down the country have the confidence to embark on new business ventures or expand existing activities. The creation of the right environment of business development is not a simple process nor is it amenable to instant solutions.  In recent years recessionary forces and the slowdown in the international economy have contributed to our difficulties.</P>
    <P>However, there is much which we can do for ourselves and indeed this Government have shown in recent years how a determined and concerted effort has succeeded in overcoming the great evil of inflation which was at the root of our growing uncompetitiveness and resultant job losses.  We have succeeded in our period in office in reducing inflation from a figure of 23.3 per cent which we inherited to a projected level of 3 per cent in 1987.  This of itself has been a major achievement and one which puts us in a position to compete on the international market with no little hope of success.</P>
    <P>But the conquering of inflation alone is not enough.  For some years now there has been a growing realisation that Irish industry has been lagging behind its overseas competitors in many respects, such as management weaknesses; lack of attention to research and development; the low equity bases of many companies; failure to diversify export beyond the UK market; the inability of most existing <Col N="2009" /> Irish products, with a few notable exceptions, to achieve a dominant position in international markets and the lack of commercial and educational links between foreign industry and Irish firms and between industry and educational institutions.  All of these deficiencies were contributing to our failure to produce the level of growth and employment which was so desperately needed.</P>
    <P>The process of addressing all these areas in a co-ordinated manner was initiated by the Government in their White Paper on Industrial Policy which was published in 1984 and has since been followed by the introduction of a wide range of specific measures aimed at addressing each of these shortcomings.  I am confident that the process begun by the measures set out in the White Paper is beginning to have the desired effect and with the advent of the measures contained in the Industrial Development Act, 1986, I am satisfied that we have now put in place a package of measures which will allow business ideas which have lain dormant to be brought to fruition. Indeed, evidence is now emerging that such is the case.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> May I continue without interruption or will I depart from my speech to tell a few more home truths?</P>
      <P>It is worth noting that in 1985, at a time when world trade was in a sluggish state, we secured on output growth of 2.7 per cent while our exports grew by a very creditable 7 per cent.  In addition, over the same period 12,000 jobs were created in grant-aided industry and in the small business sector in particular 700 firms were assisted, of which 400 were new enterprises.  In 1986, industry output is expected to grow by 2 per cent and exports are expected to grow by 5 per cent for the year as a whole.  The year end target for new jobs in projects assisted by the IDA and SFADCo is expected to reach 13,000.  This development will be encouraged by the continuing fall in inflation and reduction in oil prices.</P>
      <P>In this connection, it is encouraging to note that the OECD, in a recent commentary on economic prospects, projected a significant improvement in the short-term outlook for both inflation and real growth in the OECD area arising from the fall in oil prices and reductions in international interest rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the OECD's positive view is <Col N="2011" /> encouraging, much remains to be achieved. I am confident that we have now set the parameters within which business can begin to prosper.  It is worth remembering also that many of the initiatives which have been taken have just recently come into effect following enactment of the Industrial Development Act which I referred to earlier.</P>
    <P>Among these initiatives are the introduction of research and development grants and technology acquisition grants which will enable Irish companies to be at the forefront of technological development. At present there are over 80 Irish companies committed to taking part in the IDA's technology transfer programme and 40 more are expected to join before the end of 1986.</P>

      <P>The purpose of the programme is to link suitable indigenous and overseas firms with a view to developing new product or process possibilities for European markets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A new scheme of employment grants has been recently introduced.  This scheme allows promoters of small industry projects to avail of employment grants as an alternative to grants towards the cost of machinery and buildings.  The new employment grants will encourage further the development of small industry and will make the State grant system more employment oriented.  It will be of particular benefit to industries such as clothing and engineering where there is <Col N="2012" /> excellent second-hand equipment available. Both the technology acquisition grant scheme and the employment grants scheme have just recently been introduced, following receipt of EC Commission approval, but I am confident that these measures will make a very positive contribution to industrial development in the future.  Indeed, indications to date are that the schemes in question have attracted a lot of interest from industrialists.</P>
    <P>Many other schemes have now been put in place to address the weaknesses in Irish industry which I referred to earlier.</P>
    <P>The company development programme involves the IDA, the IIRS and Córas Tráchtála working closely with selected companies to help them identify and implement strategic development initiatives.  The programme is designed primarily to encourage indigenous companies to develop to a point where they are capable of developing their own research and development programmes and achieving a strong international marketing position.  Already many of the strategic initiatives identified by companies under the programme are being implemented.  The operating target for 1986 is that 50 companies will be covered under the company development programme.</P>
    <P>The national linkage programme commenced in July 1985.  Its objective is to optimise the amount of raw materials, components and services sourced locally by manufacturing industry.  In particular, it aims to develop business between the multinational companies which have established in Ireland and Irish-based companies which could act as suppliers to them.  The NLP started in the electronics and consumer products sectors.  By the end of 1985, 45 electronics multinationals were in the programme.  The target for 1986 is to place £40 million worth of business contracts with Irish suppliers.</P>
    <P>The regionalisation of the IDA's small industries programme was completed during 1985.  A service to promoters is now available from the IDA offices in all <Col N="2013" /> the regions with the exception of the midwest and Gaeltacht areas, where this service is provided by Shannon Development and Údarás na Gaeltachta respectively.  The administration of the programme, including decision-making on grant applications, now rests with the regional small industry boards supported, in the case of the IDA, by 130 IDA staff at regional level.</P>
    <P>New schemes and programmes to build marketing strengths within firms have been introduced by Córas Tráchtála over the past two years funded by an increase of over 40 per cent in CTT's grant-in-aid since 1984.  These include a marketing manager grant scheme, marketing training programmes and a marketing graduates in industry schemes.  The major marketing initiative has been the market entry and development scheme, the purpose of which is to help firms to enter new markets or undertake major developments of existing markets where substantial investment in marketing activity is required.  The scheme helps to offset costs such as advertising, promotion, travel expenses and overseas warehousing.  Seven firms benefited under the scheme in 1985.</P>
    <P>As part of a review of overall training grants policy, I have extended training grants to assist in management training and development.  This will provide support for companies &mdash; in particular small indigenous companies &mdash; which appraise their management skills and structures and seek to upgrade them by way of special advisory help or in-house support. Grant assistance will be paid by the IDA following approval by a joint IDA-AnCO committee and will be financed through a general tightening up of the scope and costs supported under the training grants programme.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> A crucial element of the Government's strategy for tackling the problem of unemployment has been the development of a climate more conducive to investment in industries and to the stimulation of enterprise. As I have said already, Governments do not of themselves create employment nor should they be expected to do so.  That is the mistake Fianna Fáil made between 1977 and 1981 when they stuffed the public service with everybody and we have been paying for it ever since.  It cannot be done.  Governments can create direct jobs but the taxpayer must pay for them.  However, they have a duty to create the right environment, to put in place the proper mechanisms to enable industry to prosper and so respond to the challenge of unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Government have been unstinting in their efforts in this regard.  Since taking office we have reformed many of those <Col N="2015" /> provisions of the tax code which discouraged productive investment.  In so doing we have honoured our commitment given in the White Paper on Industrial Policy to encourage the attraction of a much greater level of risk capital into industry.</P>
    <P>Most economic commentators will agree with my contention that the twin evils facing native industry are an over-reliance on bank borrowings and State grants resulting from the inability of industrialists to attract equity style investment and the unwillingness on the part of some business men to trade part ownership of their business in return for third party investment and outside expertise.</P>
    <P>My view on the under capitalisation of Irish industry is not a controversial one and is merely a statement of the factual position in which industry finds itself. Indeed, I have support from a number of auspicious quarters.  The National Economic and Social Council produced a report a little while ago on the Role of the Financial System in Financing the Traded Sectors.  The report shows that between 1972 and 1982 bank borrowings by manufacturing industry increased in real terms by 6 per cent per annum while production volumes increased by only 3.5 per cent.  The report also demonstrated that equity capital relative to total assets is much lower in Ireland than it is in the USA, Japan or the UK.</P>
    <P>The problem has also been recognised and acknowledged by Members of this House, through the report of an Oireachtas joint committee on manufacturing industry.  This report pointed to the undercapitalisation of small industry in this country and added that because of low profitability and the lack of any further equity investment this situation continues during the life of the company. The report states quite clearly that finance is without doubt one of the major problem areas for small companies.  The Oireachtas joint committee's recommendations for bringing about a reversal of these trends included the encouragement of additional venture capital investment through the banks, other <Col N="2016" /> financial institutions and through private investors.  I am pleased to say that I view the committee's report as being entirely supportive of Government policy in this area.</P>
    <P>The White Paper on Industrial Policy outlined the Government's commitment towards the encouragement of a greater level of risk capital in industry.  The first step in the Government's strategy came in the 1984 Finance Act with the introduction of the business expansion scheme which allows individual investors in industry to write off up to a maximum of £25,000 per annum against their taxable income.  The introduction of this scheme is an acknowledgement by the Government of the risk associated with investment in manufacturing industries.  It has already begun to have a significant impact in terms of strengthening capital structure of industry and is proving to be a major source of capital for aspiring entrepreneurs. To date investments of £7.5 million have taken place under the scheme in 65 companies.  A further 86 companies are in negotiation with the Revenue Commissioners regarding investments of over £9 million.  The size of investments made to date ranges from over £1 million to slightly more than £1,000 in companies ranging from film-making to fish farming.</P>
    <P>The success of the business expansion scheme cannot be measured, however, solely in terms of statistics such as these. The scheme has had a very important catalytic effect in terms of focusing attention on the benefits of equity style investment, thus putting this style of corporate financing into vogue.</P>
    <P>The impact of the scheme in this way is impossible to measure but it combines with the other initiatives taken by Government which are designed to increase the flow of funding to industry. For instance, we have reduced the rate of capital gains tax on long term investments so improving the risk-reward ratio for investors.  We have also introduced a significant relief from income tax on dividends paid by manufacturing companies so as to increase the attractiveness of industrial investment as a savings <Col N="2017" /> medium and not to concentrate entirely on the lure of capital gain.  We have also introduced a scheme similar to the business expansion scheme which is designed to encourage investment in research and development activities.  Indeed, may I remind Deputies that if they wish to know in more detail about the working of the business expansion scheme, they should contact officials of my Department who will be only too pleased to send them a copy of the explanatory booklet which we launched recently on the subject?</P>
    <P>I am also pleased to say that as a result of Government prompting and its willingness to respond to the need for change, the Stock Exchange is again threatening to become a force in industrial financing terms.  For almost a decade the exchange had witnessed a steady decline in the number of companies listed on it.  This trend has now been reversed and there have been a number of new listings on the exchange in the past 18 months.  The exchange have also responded to the Government initiative by launching the new smaller companies market as a mechanism whereby young companies, including those at a start-up situation, can raise capital.  The response to the launch of this market has, I admit, been disappointing.  But I have always maintained that we must put the right mechanisms in place first and, given the proper encouragement, I hope the private sector will respond positively.  An important cornerstone in the Government's strategy is the National Development Corporation.  This body is now known by the acronym NADCORP. NADCORP was established on 11 June last and it has already approved investments totalling almost £2.5 million.  The corporation has the primary objective of assisting in the creation of a maximum amount of viable employment in the State.  It will do this through the injection of equity style capital into all sectors of industry.  Its primary function, however, will be in areas of high technology, natural resources and tourism.  It is filling a much needed gap in what we call the venture capital market because the <Col N="2018" /> majority of existing venture capital companies operating in the private sector are inclined to target their investments at better established enterprises who can demonstrate an impressive track record.</P>
    <P>The National Development Corporation, on the other hand, will not be hidebound by any of these limitations. Although it will be required to act at all times in a commercial market, it will be a major source of capital for young and expanding companies.  The corporation has been much maligned by parties on the opposite side of the House.  But I am confident that with the right resources and the proper opportunities which this Government intend to afford it, NADCORP will become a vibrant investment and employment-creating organisation.</P>
    <P>I have outlined the wide range of measures which this Government have implemented at national level to combat the unemployment level.  However, as members of the European Community, our future prosperity is very much related to developments in the Community as a whole.  From Ireland's point of view membership of the Community offers us access to a market of 320 million people.  We must grasp this opportunity with both hands.  Indeed, there is growing evidence that Irish companies are beginning to seek out opportunities on the European mainland.  In 1981, 40 per cent of our exports went to the United Kingdom with 30 per cent going to the rest of the EC.  By 1985, this situation had altered to a position where only 33 per cent of our exports are going to the UK while exports to the rest of the EC had grown to 34 per cent.  This move was obviously in the right direction.</P>
    <P>In the case of small business in particular, the EC has just recently brought forward an action plan aimed at improving the business environment and the supply of financial and technological services particularly suited to the needs of small business.  This plan, which was welcomed by all member states, identifies a series of proposed measures which are aimed at improving the environment of small firms on an EC basis.  In endorsing <Col N="2019" /> this plan, the Community is giving recognition to the important role played by small business in job creation and is setting about creating an environment in which small business can flourish.  It is interesting indeed to note that very many of the measures now being proposed at EC level have already been adopted here under our Industrial Policy White Paper.</P>
    <P>I have outlined in the time available to me the details of the schemes which are set down by this Government to create the environment for small business.  I make one appeal to the Opposition &mdash; to please endorse the NDC.  I ask them not to leave a cloud hanging over it.  It is making a major contribution and if the Opposition decided to remove the suggestion to abolish it if they return to office then it could make even more progress. I remind them, with all respect, that they also threatened to abolish the IDA when it was first founded and they live to regret it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In supporting the Government amendment I think that it is worth while reviewing the response of the Department of Labour and its manpower agencies to the unemployment crisis and I will deal with that specifically.  The manpower bodies, soon to be merged in a single body, have demonstrated a capacity to respond imaginatively with special employment and training measures.  Whereas initially the contribution of the Labour Party's influence in Government was evident in the range of youth employment schemes, shifting demographic trends and the serious problem of long term unemployment among adult workers has resulted in pioneering community-based initiatives under the social employment scheme and the development of new training programmes such as the Building on Experience Programme to assist the long term unemployed.  Some of these schemes <Col N="2020" /> have been looked at very favourably by the OECD and they are examining them with a view to taking some of them on board, to apply within the rest of the OECD countries.</P>
    <P>There has been a persistent tendency in contributions from the Opposition benches in past debates on manpower issues to denigrate the contribution made by training to improve the job prospects of the individual.  Special employment and training schemes are not intended to act as a replacement for permanent employment.  The aim of these measures is to assist as many people as possible in their efforts to return to the workforce. Many programmes are also aimed at the less advantaged, such as the long term unemployed who have particular difficulties in obtaining regular permanent employment.  Participants of schemes are actively encouraged and given every opportunity to pursue permanent employment opportunities.</P>
    <P>The social employment scheme has, since its introduction in the first half of 1985, made a marked contribution to growth in employment for the over 25 age group.  By the middle of this year the ambitious target of 10,000 participants had been exceeded due to the extraordinary level of demand for the scheme. In my own region groups of organisations and individuals want to take part in schemes but have to wait until we get back to our original target level.  The scheme offers the long term unemployed a fresh start on work projects which have tapped community-wide support.  About a third of the projects now in operation are sponsored by voluntary services, recreational activity, tourism and heritage concerns.  The remaining 70 per cent of projects are sponsored by public sector bodies.  These include local authorities, schools and health boards.  The quality and range of the projects is impressive and the scheme is credited in many communities with counteracting many of the adverse effects of unemployment. Expenditure on this scheme in 1985 amounted to £7.25 million and the budget made available for this year's operation is in excess of £42 million.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2021" /> It is no harm to point out that every one of us has seen the manner in which this scheme has changed the environment in our own areas.  It has done tremendous work and it bears out the very valid argument of many people who, down through the years, have said that the best possible way that money can be given to the unemployed is that they earn it by doing other valuable community work.  I wish that there was infinitely more money available for those schemes.  I have seen schools in my own area which were brought up to a magnificent level of appearance and which have won environmental awards. Equally, all we need to do is to go to Limerick city to see the transformation that has taken place there and the work that has been done by the Limerick Civic Trust with the very generous contribution from the Government of £100,000.  I thank the Minister, Deputy Noonan for his influence in securing that.  It helped to transform our city as a prime example of the urban renewal that can take place with public money.</P>
    <P>At the outset there were many who doubted the willingness of participants to enter the scheme and who questioned the kind of social solidarity which has prompted voluntary organisations to take part.  They said it could not be done.  In this House there are others who now turn their backs on this achievement.  They reject the idea of socially useful work and advocate the dismantling of the scheme. They would turn over 10,000 men and women away from their only avenue back to a regular job.</P>
    <P>The enterprise allowance scheme represents another radical initiative which has already enabled over 15,300 unemployed people to build on their own skills and talents in creating fulltime work for themselves.  The scheme provides the essential financial back-up needed at the most crucial stage for any small business &mdash; its first year of operation.  It guarantees equity for the unemployed in access to opportunities to launch new business ventures and thus complements the mainstream job creation instruments of industrial policy.</P>
    <P>The scheme was introduced by this <Col N="2022" /> Government in 1983.  In the following year expenditure was £5.8 million increasing to £12.1 million in 1985.  Due to the continuing heavy demand for the scheme this year the initial allocation of £11.1 million has had to be increased to £11.6 million.  The scheme is being continuously monitored by the National Manpower Service and changes are being made in its administration to speed up decisions at local level, to improve project selection and to make it more cost-effective. There are currently 4,600 persons participating under the scheme.</P>
    <P>The community enterprise programme launched in 1983 is another example of the strategic utilisation of resources in the interests of harnessing community effort for job creation.  State attention was not directly focused upon the promotion of community enterprise up until then. Three hundred local employment groups are currently receiving assistance from the various State agencies co-operating in this programme, under the aegis of the Youth Employment Agency.  There has been a sixfold increase in the number of groups assisted since 1983.  This kind of State initiative provides locally-based organisations with the resources to involve the unemployed in efforts to find alternative means of creating sustainable employment in their local areas through worker co-operatives and community-based business ventures.  The programme will be incorporated in the restructuring of manpower services to apply to all age groups as the main instrument for local employment initiatives.</P>
    <P>Expenditure on the employment incentive scheme in the first nine months of 1986 has amounted to over £4 million and recruitments have been notified for 7,500 persons.  About 79 per cent of recruitments under the scheme are young people and the remaining 21 per cent are over 25 years of age.  Approximately 50 per cent of the over 25s are long term unemployed.  The standard premium payable to employers was doubled for this category so as to provide a greater incentive to employers to assist the long term unemployed in making a return to work.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2023" /> Recruitment under the scheme in general averages about 57 per cent male and 43 per cent female.  The main areas of employment are services and manufacturing with 64 per cent and 21 per cent of recruitment respectively.  Recruitment in construction totals 9 per cent; hotel and catering total 3 per cent and others, including agriculture and horticulture, total 3 per cent.</P>
    <P>In the context of the Government's announcement last October of a series of measures to combat unemployment, the scheme was extended to increase to four the number of jobs which an employer may have assisted under the scheme. This, together with the special facility to qualify for PRSI exemption, has led to a substantial increase in the take up under the scheme.</P>
    <P>Nobody would seek to defend high levels of unemployment.  Obviously that would be foolish.  This is merely to put the Government measures in context.  I quote from <i>OECD Employment Outlook</i> of September 1986, page 5:</P>
    <P>The OECD economy is in its fourth year of recovery but unemployment in the OECD area as a whole is unlikely to show much change next year from its present high level of 31 million.</P>
    <P>Forty-five per cent of that 31 million have been out of work for over one year, and the OECD predict a growth in employment in Ireland next year of 1¼ per cent as compared with ¾ per cent for Europe as a whole.</P>
    <P>Finally, Ireland in their opinion, will be one of the few countries to experience a decline in unemployment next year.  I say that merely to point out that there is no easy solution to this problem no matter who is in power.  I am setting that in the context of the international scene. That is not to justify the present high level of unemployment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the difficulties with Private Members' Time motions is that people come in from one side or the other and quote what scriptwriters <Col N="2024" /> provide for them.  I suppose any scriptwriters who are in full-time employment with research officers can go through all the data and put forward scripts that appear to answer some questions.  We have had two Government scripts written either by the national handlers or civil servants who in just doing as they are asked provide what is really old balderdash which people outside will study, read and examine, and then they will say that Dáil Éireann is really irrelevant. Tonight we have one of the better examples.  I have the pleasure to speak to some of my colleagues who have come to listen to this debate tonight.  We know the number of members in the Fianna Fáil benches compared with those not on the Coalition benches.  They have sent in only a Minister and a backbencher with a Minister's script.  That is all the interest the Government seem to have in a major problem which this country faces.  We have over 230,000 people unemployed. Thousands more in petty jobs are extremely concerned about their future, and Government aid and assistance and the proper climate for investment are being sought.</P>
      <P>The Fianna Fáil Deputies here tonight went through the Minister's speech carefully and listened carefully to the other speech.  Only far on in the Minister's speech do we see the policy statement which is put in in a different type, probably an afterthought, that Governments of themselves do not create employment nor should they be expected to do so. That is bad enough and you could argue its rights or wrongs.  However, they have a duty to create the right environment and to put in place proper mechanisms to enable industry to prosper and so respond to the challenge of unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Can anybody come into this House and seriously say that?  The Minister has an awful habit of smirking &mdash; when he is on television he almost breaks his heart laughing &mdash; and that was evident when he was reading his speech.  It is sad that, in the national Parliament, Dáil Éireann, the Minister for Industry and Commerce &mdash; he is faced with a difficult job as we <Col N="2025" /> acknowledge; we agree with Deputy Prendergast on that, although we do not agree we have the same difficulties as everybody else &mdash; comes in here and throws out this utter nonsense.  I am not going to quote the figures.  Deputy Lyons and Deputy Fitzgerald have laid out the facts and figures of how bad the position is, but is it not really sad that the Minister would have such arrogance?  He has a great deal of arrogance but I did not think he had as much as he displayed here tonight.  He does not believe a word of what he said.  He did not even read it with conviction.  What would happen if it was circulated in the areas Deputy Lyons and Deputy Fitzgerald were talking about and to which Deputy Prendergast must answer?  That Deputy does not like having to do that because it is a difficult job for any Labour person, not to mention a person who has given good and valuable service to the trade union movement. In those areas 60,000 people are unemployed and in areas such as Wexford, as my colleague Deputy Browne said, 11,000 people are unemployed.  Yet the Minister gave a speech like that about the Government creating an environment and climate for investment about the new drive they have and all these new fancy names about this programme and that programme.</P>
    <P>I was out this morning with two multinational companies in the Swords area. I will not name them here because they are commercial companies, but the Minister and the IDA would hold them up as model companies.  They explained about research and development, computer investment and so on.  The fact is we will not get research and development or the kind of projects we want.  Take any major component names, and you will find that they are being turned over in five years. What is being developed today on the planning boards is totally obsolete in about seven years and you only get about five years turnaround.  Unless you get the entire operation of research and development in the country there is no good in having any of it.  All the major companies in this country are using either Japanese <Col N="2026" /> or American bases for research and development.</P>
    <P>The Minister said we have introduced a scheme similar to the business expansion scheme which is designed to encourage investment in Ireland in the area of activity.  We are not doing it in the right way.  We are getting tiny bits of research and development.  Companies will tell you the IDA are battling with some of these major firms trying to get anywhere with very little Government support.  Our party leader said last week that the IDA were an excellent organisation and still are in many respects but they must be reviewed because everything outlives itself.  Deputy Prendergast talked about Manpower, AnCO, CERT, the YEA, about Manpower linked with the Department of Labour, the VECs, departmental environmental work schemes and all the rest.  They have all outlived themselves. Deputy Prendergast will acknowledge that what he expressed was from a Fianna Fáil discussion paper of 1983 put forward by me in 1984 and agreed here in 1985 by the Minister, Deputy Quinn, and now he has taken a decision.  We welcome what he has said because it is Fianna Fáil policy and anything that follows our policy, although taken up by the Coalition, is welcome.</P>
    <P>In this important debate we must state the hardships, difficulties, frustrations and anxiety of thousands of people, almost 20 per cent nationally, 40 per cent in many towns and 60 per cent in urban areas.  What is the Minister for Industry and Commerce doing for them?  What hope, what ideas, what investment opportunity does he offer?  What way is he trying to change the risk capital for manufacturing industry?  The hard fact is that a speculator can get very easily in the banks of the Isle of Man or Geneva, the same money in Government gilts, semi-State gilts or national gilts outside the country as he can get for risk capital in industry here.  As long as that obtains we will have black holes and all the deals being done outside the role of the Central Bank.  Investment is flowing out of the country one way or the other.  We are almost in a position in which the Central <Col N="2027" /> Bank has lost control.  A month ago with the change of position, money was vanishing because there were no incentives. Unless there is a proper investment policy we will get nowhere.</P>
    <P>There was universal agreement in 1984 when <i>Building on Reality</i> came out that there was not one single line indicating a policy, and there has been nothing since by this Government on investment.  So what is the Minister talking about here when he says it looks as if this is going to increase?  On the Adjournment debate before Christmas and again before the summer recess, the Taoiseach said it looked as if there would be a big consumer rise in the second half of the year. When we came to the second half of the year the Taoiseach said it would happen in the fourth quarter.  Now there are no quarters left so it will be next year.  The Government are now admitting by their amendment that they have no policy. Their amendment is that Dáil Éireann supports the Government's policies to promote the growth of employment and intensify the fight against unemployment, and recognises that an effective response to the persistence of large-scale unemployment throughout the EC requires stronger action and close co-operation on the part of member states.  What does that mean?  Between 1982 and 1985 unemployment here rose by 44 per cent compared to 3 per cent in Belgium, 23 per cent in Germany, 18 per cent in France, 12 per cent in Holland and 14 per cent in the UK.  What have any of those got in common with Ireland where 70,000 jobs have been lost in the life of this Government?</P>
    <P>I admire Deputy Prendergast for coming in here and saying that the Government have managed to create some short-term unsustainable jobs to keep the people who did not emigrate from going off their heads altogether; it was better than doing nothing, but that is about all.  The Government put forward a policy that they would halt and reverse unemployment, but the only thing they did was to create jobs in the community, cleaning up graveyards and churches.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2028" /> The trade unions did not allow it in Dublin city and county but they did in other parts of the country.  I agree that valuable work was done but that is surely not an industrial policy.  Cleaning up graveyards and chopping down ivy and branches from trees is not an industrial policy.  We have not heard one tonight in this House from the Minister and I am sure we will not hear one afterwards either.</P>
    <P>What is the Minister's policy on trying to build up our fisheries industry, our forestry industry or our whole food production industry to try to halt imports in the food sector or any other sector?  What is his policy on import substitution?  What is the policy on the large amount of raw materials we have to bring in here for manufacturing?  What is the policy on small industries?  What is the policy on trying to change the system where the IDA, even though it has been slightly amended, give grants to industry to invest in machinery and in high technology with taxpayers' money resulting in the displacement of more workers?  Have the Government ever thought about linking grants to labour, or basing them on the number of people employed?  Is it not ludicrous that we have almost no manufacturing industry?  There were more people employed in manufacturing in Dublin in 1926 than there are in 1986, although we have higher education, higher technology, higher numbers in the universities, RTCs, NIHEs and technical colleges.  In spite of all the work being done by them fewer people are employed.</P>
    <P>Other countries say that with high technology jobs are lost automatically.  It is not automatic.  An example is one corporation which is floating around this city at the moment and looking at the scene, the Mars Corporation, one of the biggest corporations in the world.  Every time they bring in modern technology they diversify and increase the workforce in some other area.  That can and has been done in a few companies here but only in a very few.  Why can it not be done?  Have the Government researched it?  Have they a policy on it?  Have they spoken to <Col N="2029" /> people like Mars?  We had hoped to get the answer to all these questions from this debate, as had the unemployed.  The people out there living on assistance who have been affected by the changes in social welfare hoped for answers from this debate.  The drastic cuts in social welfare must horrify people in the Labour Party, though they had to come in here and prop up the Government on that issue.  It was bad enough to come in here with no employment, industrial or investment policy, but to come in here and cut down the income of the poorest in our society, those on disability and invalidity pensions, because of some equality Act without making special provisions for them is appalling, pathetic and sad.</P>
    <P>We on this side of the House have a policy on technology.  We believe we have a good policy on the food processing industry, on forestry and fisheries.  We believe we have an industrial policy for small industries to make life easier for small business people, to make it easier for them to operate, to try to simplify the tax system for them, to try to help them and to give them advice.  At present a small businessman could set up in his back garden and the first thing he gets is not an order or a telephone call from CTT, AnCO or Córas Trachtála or any other organisation to find out how he is doing, but a visit from a tax inspector or a planning officer and a VAT form in through the door.  Is that how we will solve our unemployment problem?  I am afraid not.</P>
    <P>I hope the other side of the House will come in here tomorrow night and tell us the truth, explain to the nation that their policies over the past four years have totally failed.  We have a population of 3.4 million and a working population of 1.2 million.  Over 300,000 are in effect unemployed because the unemployment figure does not cover those people who are means-tested out of it because their parents' income is over a certain limit. The figure is over 300,000 and that does not take into account the emigration figure.  What type of policy do the Coalition Government have for them?  We would be prepared to forget that the <Col N="2030" /> Government have been a drastic failure if they would tell us where we go from here.  What are the Department and the IDA doing at this stage?  What ideas have the Government got for the future?  What ideas have Córas Tráchtála got?</P>
    <P>The Minister listed tonight a number of points on which he said Irish industry has failed.  He attacked them.  He said that for some years now there has been a growing realisation that Irish industry has been lagging behind its overseas competitors in many respects, such as management weaknesses, lack of attention to research and development, the low equity basis of many companies, the failure to diversify exports beyond the UK market, the inability of most existing Irish products with a few notable exceptions to achieve a dominant position. Then he forgets about them.  What is his advice to those companies?  What is being done to help the country to have a proper marketing base?  What assistance is being given to the NIHEs?  What Government Minister has responsibility for technology? I do not think there is any.  If most Irish firms have failed to diversify, what are the Government doing about that?  Have they been explaining it to them and asking why they are refusing to do it?  Is he attacking the Irish Congress of Trade Unions about the industrial relations?  He seems to be, although I believe the record is different.  One company in the high technology area to whom we spoke today have been 20 years in Dublin and have 500 workers.  They have lost only 200 man-days in those 20 years. That compares very favourably with any overseas company.</P>

      <P>I want to make a number of matters clear.  I realise the time of the House is precious and some sophisticates might suggest that this is not the type of assembly in which to raise the state of the Garda stations in Dún Laoghaire.  Nevertheless, I believe the welfare of the gardaí in Dún Laoghaire is very important and I do not apologise to the House for raising the conditions of some of the Garda stations in the Dún Laoghaire district here this evening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Saturday week last after my constituency clinic I took a tour of a number of Garda stations in the company of a number of Garda officers who, quite legitimately, lobbied me and other Deputies in the constituency for recognition of their plight, the conditions under which they have to work and the difficulties under which their subordinates, the ordinary gardaí, have to <Col N="2032" /> work every day.  I visited three Garda stations, and I have a knowledge of the other Garda stations in the constituency having represented the area for a long time and having a very close association with the Garda Síochána in the district.  I visited Kill-o'-the Grange Garda station, Cabinteely Garda station and Shankill Garda station.  I know the Blackrock Garda station very well because it is almost at the back of my garden wall and I have a close association with the gardaí there.</P>
    <P>The gardaí in the Dún Laoghaire area are performing their task admirably and very well but they should be supported by the provision of proper Garda stations.  It is not my intention to be negative about the problem but rather to bring to the attention of the House the conditions under which these gardaí work.  Having outlined those conditions, may I call on the Government to do something about the problem as a matter of urgency? Today the Leader of the Opposition, Deputy Haughey, and Deputy Gregory raised the question of security in the city of Dublin in the context of certain explosions in the city on Saturday last. My raising this issue can also be seen in the context of the security of the community. Given the appalling conditions of the Garda stations which I am about to outline, the House will appreciate that we can be grateful to the gardaí for doing their jobs when we take into account the conditions under which they operate.  I am not given to exaggeration ordinarily and my description of one of the garda stations in particular will leave one breathless.  I am sure the four Coalition Deputies in the constituency will join with me in inviting the Minister to visit all or even one of the Garda stations I am about to deal with.  I would be very pleased to welcome her and/or the Minister for Justice.</P>
    <P>One reads exposés of working conditions in the media, but I believe the forces of law and security in certain Garda stations in the constituency of Dún Laoghaire are working in sweat factories, more common to Victorian times than the end of the 20th century.  I know <Col N="2033" /> a site has been proposed for Corbawn Lane, Shankill, for the past 25 years and I propose that a substation be located in the Ballybrack area, or even a full new Garda station taking account of the triangle from Shankill to Cabinteely to Dalkey.  This area is empty of a permanent Garda presence by virtue of the lack of a substation or a Garda station proper.  I am calling on the Minister to examine my proposal for a sub-Garda station as a minimum for the Ballybrack area.  I want to remind the Minister that Corbawn Lane in Shankill has been nominated for a new Garda station for the past 25 years.  This is symptomatic of the way successive Governments have treated the plight of the gardaí in terms of accommodation in the Dún Laoghaire area over many years.</P>
    <P>The Dublin metropolitan area covers the city and county of Dublin, and Dún Laoghaire covers the south-east division, with headquarters in Dún Laoghaire proper.  The F District takes in Dún Laoghaire, Dalkey, Kill-o'-the-Grange and Cabinteely.  The W district takes in Blackrock, Dundrum and Stepaside.  The N district takes in Bray, Enniskerry and Shankill.  What I am suggesting &mdash; and this may not be relevant to the Minister of State at the Department of Finance but perhaps she would communicate it to the Minister for Justice &mdash; is that there might be one detention centre for each division and one detention centre located in the Dún Laoghaire division rather than having the pathetic custodial and cell conditions which are available in the Garda stations at present.</P>
    <P>I will return now to my tour of the constituency.  As I said, I understand other Deputies in the constituency were invited to visit these stations.  This is not a political issue, but rather a community matter.  I want to stress that.  The gardaí were very careful to stress the need to invite Deputies of all political parties to visit the Garda stations and examine the conditions under which they work.</P>
    <P>Kill-o'-the-Grange Garda station is located at an extremely dangerous part of the public thoroughfare.  To get in and out of that station one literally takes one's <Col N="2034" /> life in one's hands.  This applies particularly to the gardaí who work there every day.  Conditions are deplorable.  They are the worst I have ever seen.  We must recognise that the gardaí are entitled to accommodation which is as good as we can provide, but the conditions in that station are a disgrace to successive Governments and to those responsible for the leadership in the community, namely, Deputies.</P>
    <P>We should be ashamed of ourselves that we have let these conditions exist for so many years.  They are slum conditions, no more and no less.  It is grotesque that the gardaí should be required to work in such conditions.  One goes to what can only be described as a front counter to engage in conversation with a garda or if one wishes to make a complaint, but if one looks behind the counter as an ordinary citizen concerned about the gardaí, one would feel very ashamed.  The heating conditions are deplorable and one has to go through a back yard to arrive at a cell.  Not only are the gardaí entitled to proper conditions but people brought into custody are entitled to decent conditions. One is not guilty until proven guilty so having regard to that principle of law people in custody are entitled to decent conditions.  The cell in Kill-o'-the-Grange Garda station is disgusting. There is a mattress on the floor held inches from the ground by a sort of frame. The toilet facilities are foul.  The cell, even at this time of the year is unheated and is what one would expect, in atmospheric terms, a cell in Siberia, to be rather than what one would expect in a modern Dublin housing estate.  In order to get to the cell people brought into custody have to walk through the kitchen where there will be gardaí eating their meals.  As a matter of urgency the Minister should do something about this Garda station which is probably the worst Garda station in Dún Laoghaire if not in the whole Dublin metropolitan area.  The conditions in that station are revolting. One hears about the right of the citizen during custody to confidentiality but <Col N="2035" /> there is no question of holding a confidential conversation in the conditions in this station.</P>
    <P>In Cabinteely Garda station there has been installed what would be wonderfully effective modern equipment but it is inoperative.  To operate this equipment the gardaí must put out the fire in the corner because this direct heat prevents the machine from operating properly. Central heating has been approved for Cabinteely Garda station since 1976 but it is not yet installed.  The interview room is on the road front and there are no bars on the window to prevent people jumping out.  Happily the interview room is on the ground floor so there is no question of a person doing himself an injury by jumping out of the window, but the prospect is there.  There is no ladies toilet facility in the Cabinteely Garda station.  I understand that there has been an embargo on the purchase of lockers, desks, chairs and such furniture.  My information is that there are many pieces of furniture available within the Department of Finance which they will not release for a reason better known to themselves than to the Garda.  The shower does not work, water flows out into the yard, there are no stationery storage facilities and in the detective unit room the exhibits are strewn over the floor because there is no place to store or stack them.  There has not been a clerk permanently appointed to Cabinteely since April 1979. There are over 30 gardaí at that station as is the case also at Kill-o'-the-Grange.</P>

      <P>Cabinteely station has very sophisticated console communications equipment.  It is extraordinary to bring in that sort of modern equipment without first modernising the station so that it can be made operative. Conditions in Cabinteely are deplorable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Shankill Garda station has no interview room for prisoners and there are no parking facilities there at all.  The station is located on an extremely dangerous part <Col N="2036" /> of the Dublin-Shankill-Bray road and parking facilities are needed.  The cell in this station is against an adjoining house and an unruly prisoner invariably keeps the occupant of the house next to the station awake by banging on the cell wall during the night.  That is a poor show. There is also a stairway to the first floor and it is so steep and dangerous that to mount it is rather like climbing Mount Everest.  The detective unit is on the first floor and to bring people up and down that stairs is a test of one's endurance and nerve.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to take a serious note of the conditions I have outlined. I realise he is new to the job but newness, I hope would presume idealism and a wish to improve.  No doubt the Minister has all these qualities in abundance. I would ask him to consider visiting these areas.</P>
    <P>Blackrock Garda station is also located in a very dangerous part of the township and conditions for confidentiality do not exist there, either.  Detectives and uniformed members of the Garda work there in primitive conditions.  How they do so is a mystery to me.  Yet they perform their duties admirably.  I pay tribute to the gardaí in the Dún Laoghaire area. They have been working in bad conditions for years.  I am not attaching blame to any one Government but I am attaching global blame to succesive Governments for their failure to do something about the travesty of working conditions for gardaí.</P>
    <P>If the ITGWU were looking after the Garda they would simply down tools but the gardaí, because of their public spiritedness, refuse to strike in the interests of the local community.  That is as it should be and I encourage them to take that line and to continue the high spirit of public service which has always been part of their make-up.  One would not ask the ordinary factory worker to operate in the conditions under which the gardaí in Dún Laoghaire are asked to operate.</P>
    <P>I would not say that the Minister would look forward to the prospect of visiting the Garda stations to which I referred <Col N="2037" /> because they are in a deplorable condition but if she comes she will be welcome and treated with courtesy and civility as is the entitlement of her office.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mrs. A. Doyle)</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend the Deputy for a very reasonably put case in relation to the six Garda stations in Dún Laoghaire and the various problems and difficulties experienced in them.  He is probably aware that I am very familiar with the Dún Laoghaire constituency and some of the Garda stations he mentioned are also familiar to me.  I join with him in his commendation of the Garda and the Trojan work they have done on our behalf, not just in Dún Laoghaire but throughout the country, often under difficult conditions mainly brought about by overcrowding rather than a lack of proper building facilities, although that applies in some cases.  We must remind ourselves occasionally what a debt we owe to the Garda Síochána who, generally uncomplainingly, have continued in circumstances, as the Deputy said, which would have caused problems with other sections of the community.</P>
      <P>The position regarding the six Garda stations is briefly as follows.  The Commissioners of Public Works recently completed certain internal works at Cabinteely Garda station and plans have been prepared for additional internal work.  Works carried out at the station and future works planned were requested by the Garda authorities.  The authorities are satisfied with the general standard of accommodation at Cabinteely.  The Deputy referred to certain equipment which had been installed but is not yet operative.  I think he is referring to the new radio system which, by agreement with the Department of Justice, is not due to commence until 1987.  As I said, further works are planned before 1987 in relation to Cabinteely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The accommodation at Kill-o'-the Grange station is totally inadequate to cater for Garda requirements.  It is a stark case of gross overcrowding as the catchment area has outgrown the facilities <Col N="2038" /> available in that station, with which I am reasonably familiar.  Improved accommodation will have to be provided by the construction of an extension to the existing site or acquisition of an alternative site and provision of a new building. The question as to how best this accommodation can be provided is being examined actively by the Office of Public Works.  What happens in relation to Kill-o'-the-Grange Garda station is not just dependent on what is decided by the Department of Justice and ourselves but also actively involves Dublin County Council who have a road widening programme which will affect the existing station site if we are talking about an extension.  The Office of Public Works and the Department of Justice are seeking to clarify the council's intentions in the matter before embarking on detailed design in respect of an extension scheme.</P>
    <P>The problem at Kill-o'-the-Grange is not the building conditions but the fact that the station is grossly overcrowded. The Deputy referred to the cell but I should like to point out that it is seldom if ever used.  He also mentioned that one detention centre in each division should suffice.  This may be so, but he should refer that to the Department of Justice as it is more properly for their consideration than for mine.</P>
    <P>He also mentioned Blackrock substation but this is more properly a matter for the Department of Justice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry; it was my mistake.  However, this matter should be brought to the attention of the Minister for Justice.  The third existing station in the constituency is Shankill.  It is recognised that the existing Garda station there is in need of replacement.  Planning of a new larger station at Dorney Court, Shankill, to cater for the needs of this expanding area is under way and it is expected that tenders for the work will be invited in 1987.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am informed that Blackrock Garda station is overcrowded.  To solve this <Col N="2039" /> problem it will be necessary to build a new station on an alternative site.  The Commissioners of Public Works are at present awaiting a report from the Department of Justice as to the suitability of a site which has become available in the Blackrock area.  It will not be possible to extend the existing station and I am reliably informed that that report is on its way to us from the Department of Justice.</P>
    <P>A scheme of works is virtually completed at Dún Laoghaire divisional headquarters, with only heating works to the cells outstanding.  The works which have been done would have been completed much sooner but for the fact that the station had to remain occupied and operational during the course of the job.  The office of Public Works literally had to work in and around the gardaí to cause as little disruption as possible to their job. The outstanding works to the cells will be carried out in the very near future.</P>
    <P>A scheme of major improvements was carried out at Dalkey during the past two years.  We have received no request for further works from the Garda authorities in relation to Dalkey Garda station.  It is as agents of the Department of Justice <Col N="2040" /> that the Commissioners of Public Works carry out improvements at Garda stations. Acting on behalf of the Department, the Commissioners have completed works at many stations all over the country within the past four years and many more will be carried out in 1987.  I am satisfied that the Commissioners have carried out, or are arranging to carry out, whatever they have been requested to do at all the stations in the Dún Laoghaire constituency.</P>
    <P>The Department of Justice are quite satisfied with the progress of the Office of Public Works and their building programme. A sum of £15 million has been spent on new stations over the past three years.  For 1987 we have earmarked £5.3 million to maintain the momentum of this programme in relation to Garda stations.</P>

      <P>The exchange controls administered by the Central Bank are primarily directed at transactions of a capital nature which involve the transfer of funds out of the State.  Normal trade, commercial and other current transactions are merely supervised to ensure that unauthorised exports of capital do not take place.  Payments are made under a system of delegated authorities whereby commercial banks, having inspected documentation in relation to transactions, are in a position to authorise transfers without recourse to the Central Bank.  Most current payments and certain capital payments, generally those up to a specified limit, do not therefore require the direct approval of the Central Bank.  Details of outflows for the main capital transactions which do require Central Bank approval are as follows: Outward direct investment, for February to September 1986, £118 million; repayment of loans from non-residents, for February to August 1986, £175.3 million; outward portfolio investment, for February to August 1986, £10.1 million.</P>

      <P>It is estimated that the downward adjustment of the Irish pound in the EMS in August will increase the cost of foreign interest payments in a full year by about £45 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The effect in a full year of the recent increases in domestic interest rates will depend on the duration of the increases, and on the amounts and types of borrowing that may be undertaken at the higher rates.  As the Deputy will be <Col N="1820" /> aware, interest rates in the gilt market have in fact been declining in recent weeks from the high levels reached in mid-October.</P>
    <P>It is assumed that the Deputy is referring, in the final part of the question, to income tax paying units.  The estimated cost of servicing the national debt in 1986 when expressed as an amount per income tax paying unit is approximately £2,310; the coresponding figure for 1982 is £1,440.  This represents a much lower rate of increase than was incurred over the previous four year period 1978 to 1982.</P>

      <P>The principal way of controlling the growth of the national debt is by curbing the level of Exchequer borrowing which, as the Deputy knows, is central to the Government's policy on the public finances.  The Government have had a significant measure of success in this regard in the past few years.  For example, in 1981 Exchequer borrowing amounted to 15.9 per cent of GNP; this year it is expected to amount to 13.1 per cent, a reduction of almost three percentage points.  In order to maintain this downward trend, the Government, on 16 October, decided that the Exchequer borrowing requirement in 1987 would be kept below 11.8 per cent of GNP.  This <Col N="1824" /> will help to restrain further the growth of the national debt.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. J. Bruton) John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. J. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 33 and 36 together.  I reject the assertion that there is a crisis of financial confidence at present.  The basic cause of the speculation outflow of funds from the economy and the consequent interest rate increases lies in the weakness of the pound sterling and, to a lesser degree, the US dollar.  The Government have already acted decisively in the light of these problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They have made it clear that there will be no downward adjustment of the Irsh pound within the EMS.  The August adjustment was a once-off change which <Col N="1826" /> was necessitated by the unsought and unwarranted overall appreciation of the Irish pound due to the sharp drop in the value of sterling and the US dollar.  The adjustment has improved the competitive position of Irish industry, particularly in relation to the continental European countries.  The Government are determined to maintain the current EMS parities of the Irish pound.  This assurance should make it clear to speculators that they cannot hope to make gains by transferring or keeping funds abroad in anticipation of an adjustment of the Irish currency.</P>
    <P>The Government are continuing to take the steps open to them to create the conditions for an early return to lower interest rates.  The firm assurance on the exchange rate should lead to a reflow of funds and there are already signs that this has commenced.  In adition, because of the difficulties on domestic markets last month and so as to minimise the increase in interest rates, the Government significantly increase their draw down of foreign borrowings and ensured that there were further foreign loans available for draw down, if required.</P>
    <P>The Government have also indicated their intention to take firm action to improve the position of the public finances.  They have decided that the 1987 budget will involve a current budget deficit target no higher than that set for 1986, i.e. 7.4 per cent of GNP, and that the Exchequer borrowing requirement will be lower than the 1986 target of 11.8 per cent.  They have also indicated that, because of the negative effect of tax increases on economic growth, there is no scope for an increase in the overall level of taxation.</P>
    <P>These actions have served to clarify the Government's position on these key issues and to remove any uncertainty that may have existed.  I am confident that they have made a significant contribution to the recent improvement in market sentiment, that the reflow of funds from abroad will continue and that there will be a return to lower interest rates as soon as market conditions allow.</P>

      <P>The section has been invoked for four occasions to assess income alleged to be of illegal origin, but no tax has, so far, been collected directly under it.  Several further cases are under inquiry where the possible use of section 19 is indicated.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. P. Barry) Peter Barry">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. P. Barry)</NameTxt>
      <P>Ireland is fully committed to the process initiated by the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) which seeks to achieve more stable and secure relations in a divided Europe.  The CSCE Final Act, which was signed in Helsinki on 1 August 1975, sets out ten Principles to guide relations between the States of Europe and North America (except Albania), irrespective of their political, economic and social systems.  It also contains a balanced and comprehensive programme of measures for co-operation in the areas of military security, economics, science, technology and the environment, as well as in the humanitarian, cultural and information fields.  Although it is not a legally binding document, the Final Act represents a solemn political commitment by all the thirty-five signatory States.</P>
      <P>Ireland values the CSCE as a framework in which the problems of interaction in Europe can be addressed and as a network of contact and exchange which has endured in the face of international tensions and adverse developments within and beyond Europe.  We attach particular significance to the human rights and related humanitarian provisions of the Final Act and to the recognition that respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms is an essential factor for peace, justice and well-being necessary to ensure the development of friendly relations and co-operation between States.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The third CSCE follow-up meeting opened in Vienna on 4 November and will continue its deliberations into 1987. The purpose of this meeting, like that of the previous follow-up meetings in Belgrade and Madrid, is to review the extent to which the participating States have honoured the commitments entered <Col N="1832" /> into in Helsinki and at subsequent meetings. It will also discuss new measures designed to stimulate and improve implementation and will examine further means of developing and intensifying relations between the States concerned and of giving a new impetus to the process of detente.</P>
    <P>When addressing the opening session of the Vienna meeting, I drew attention to the importance Ireland attaches to the human rights and related humanitarian provisions of the Final Act and the Madrid Concluding Document.  I also highlighted areas where violations of these provisions persisted and stressed the urgent need for discernible improvements. In the course of the Vienna meeting the Irish delegation will continue to press for full implementation of all the CSCE commitments by the participating States, and, in particular, its provisions for human rights and human contacts. Together with our Community partners they will work for a substantive and balanced outcome of the meeting and for concrete progress towards more secure, humane and co-operative conditions in Europe.</P>
    <P>Many conferences, symposia and other similar events are being organised in the margins of the Vienna meeting by both Austrian and international groups and non-governmental organisations, of which the conference mentioned by the Deputy may be one.  Ireland attaches importance to the role of individuals and private organisations in contributing towards the achievement of the aims of the CSCE in accordance with the terms of Principle IX of the Helsinki Final Act.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to state that the Government have already made an allocation of £50,000 from the disaster relief fund towards relief efforts for victims of the earthquake in San Salvador.  This allocation was announced three days after the earthquake struck on 10 October 1986 and was channelled through the League of Red Cross Societies for their programme of relief activities. These activities include the provision of medical and rescue services as well as the distribution of relief supplied.</P>
      <P>The disaster relief situation in EI Salvador is being monitored and a further allocation is currently under consideration. I have no knowledge of any interference with the rights of victims to have their houses rebuilt on their original sites.  Consequently I am not in a position to comment on the matter.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> The company in question is a Gibraltar registered company which was wound-up by the Supreme Court of Gibraltar in 1984.  The society is Irish registered but it is not in liquidation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Registrar of Friendly Societies has conducted certain inquiries into the business of the society.  It appears from the information available to the Registrar that the society accepted deposits in the period 1975 to 1978 but that these were either repaid before the Industrial and <Col N="1834" /> Provident Societies (Amendment) Act, 1978, came into force or were transferred to the Gibraltar registered company with the agreement of the depositors concerned. The liquidation of that company is proceeding in Gibraltar; as the company operated outside the jurisdiction of the State there is no action that I or the Registrar of Friendly Societies can usefully take in relation to its affairs.</P>
    <P>In so far as new legislative measures are concerned, I would point out that the Industrial and Provident Societies (Amendment) Act, 1978, precluded deposit-taking by societies; it would not be possible to legislate in respect of companies registered and operating outside the State.</P>

In fulfilling this necessary and limited function, the polling card is quite effective.  However, misunderstanding can arise from the <Col N="1843" /> tendency on the part of some, including apparently some of those who man polling stations, to regard the polling card as a form of identity card, which, of course, it is not.

This included £41,400 in relation to the Glangevlin-Dowra area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. J. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>Unregistered farmers, including those engaged in pig production, are compensated on an overall basis for the VAT charged to them on most of their agricultural inputs by means of a flat rate addition, currently 2.4 per cent, to the prices at which they sell their goods or services to VAT registered traders.  As the level of the addition is determined by the levels of the main rates of VAT no adjustment in the former would be appropriate until these main rates change.</P>
      <P>I do not propose to apply a separate increased flat rate addition to the pig production sector of the agriculture industry.  Apart from the practical difficulties in applying sectoral rates, it is doubtful, due to the extensive VAT zero-rating of the major inputs used by pig producers, that such producers would be entitled to a level of flat rate addition above the current rate applying to unregistered farmers generally.</P>
      <P>I would not accept, however, that pig producers are less favourably treated under the VAT system here than is the case elsewhere in the Community.  Most member states operate flat rate schemes and these vary in certain respects from one country to another.  As the level of the flat rate is a function of the rates and coverage of VAT on agricultural inputs and as these vary from country to country, rates of flat rate will inevitably vary between member states.  However, EC VAT law explicitly states that the flat rate schemes may not be used to obtain for farmers refunds greater than the VAT charged on their inputs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unregisterd farmers in Ireland, including pig producers, have one advantage <Col N="1855" /> over their counterparts in other member states; they can recover in full the VAT on outlay on buildings and land improvement. This concession is unique to Ireland.</P>

      <P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that, following the recent receipt of outstanding details of his <Col N="1856" /> employment from the taxpayer and his employer, a certificate of tax free allowances, quoting the correct PRSI number, was issued to the taxpayer on 28 October 1986.  It is understood that all the tax which had been deducted from the tax-payer's salary since the date he commenced employment has now been refunded to him by the employer.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will facilitate farmers, who have been liable for the land tax this year and who have been notified of the adjustment of their acreage by allowing the full information in terms of the breakdown of different land holdings to be made available to the individual farmer; whether it is virtually impossible for a farmer to make comparisons between the adjustment of one farm to another where only total and global figures are given; in view of the fact that the previous PLV rate system gave an individual breakdown of each farm holding, will he ensure that the same is now done for such farmers who have already had their acreage adjusted; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. J. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that matters such as this are a matter for the Farm Tax Commissioner who is statutorily independent in the performance of his functions. I am advised that the Farm Tax Commissioner has complied with his statutory obligations in the information he has given in the classification list.  An agricultural land holding is defined as the aggregate of the land in the occupation of the same person or persons.  Section 4 (2) of the Act requires the Commissioner to classify each agricultural land holding, or part holding if split between local authorities, and he is not obliged to provide information on the breakdown of individual holdings.  As the Deputy will be aware, the Farm Tax Act specified detailed criteria on which the Farm Tax <Col N="1857" /> Commissioner must make his assessment. Owners, or occupiers of an agricultural holding can, of course, appeal against the particulars in the relevant classification list if they are dissatisfied in any way with that list.</P>

    <P>(a)&nbsp; Information regarding the number of Customs entries processed annually at ports is not available. However, details of the number of trade transactions processed are available but only for the years after 1978.  Each tariff code number quoted on an entry represents a trade transaction and while the number of trade transactions on an entry can vary significantly the average number of trade transactions on an import entry is 1.9 while the average number of trade transactions on an export entry is 1.2.</P>
    <P>(b)&nbsp; On 1st January, 1985, the Revenue Commissioners introduced a statistical threshold of £100 in trade statistics from which the details on the attached tabular statement have been extracted. Accordingly the 1985 figures generally do not include details of transactions less than £100 in value.</P>
    <P>(c)&nbsp; Information regarding the number of entries processed at Ringaskiddy is not available for the years prior to 1983 as prior to that year the details for Ringaskiddy were included in the figures for Cork port.</P>

      <P>It is assumed that the question refers only to the element of social insurance employee contributions (that is excluding the health contribution, the youth employment levy and the income levy). The total amount paid in these contributions was £284.7 million in 1985.</P>
      <P>Social insurance employee contribution rates already reflect indirectly an element of income tax relief.  Direct tax relief was allowed up to 1978-79 on the flat rate social insurance contribution referable to certain, long term benefits. When the present, fully pay-related social insurance system was introduced in 1979, it was deemed impracticable to allow direct tax relief on the variable contributions.  However, the saving to the Exchequer from cessation of this relief was taken into account in determining the rate of contribution.  In addition, persons who contribute at the full 5.5 per cent rate of social insurance contributions are entitled to an income tax allowance of £286.  In the circumstances, I do not propose to allow further income tax relief on these contributions.</P>

      <P>The information requested is set out in the following tables.  In addition to loans made by the EIB from its own resources, the tables include details of the loans received from the New Community Instrument (NCI), which is also administered by the EIB.  The loans made to the Exchequer were in respect of a wide variety of projects including roads, sanitary services, forestry, harbours, telecommunications, education-training centres, arterial drainage and factory construction.  I consider that the European Investment Bank has been a useful source of funds to Ireland since we became a member of the EC and I hope it will continue this role in the future.</P>

      <P>Contraceptive pills are medical preparations and consequently require product authorisation from my Department before they can be placed on the market in this country.  The inclusion of warning statements in product leaflets is one of the conditions of these authorisations.

      <P>The person concerned asked for a review of his unemployment assistance claim on 14 July 1986 and his papers were referred to a social welfare officer for reinvestigation of his means.  This investigation has now been completed and he has been assessed with means of £3.55 weekly, derived from the profit from the letting of his land.  This assessment entitles him to unemployment assistance of £31.95 weekly from 14 July 1986, being the appropriate maximum rate payable in his case of £35.50 less means of £3.55. Arrangements are being made to have payment made this week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the person concerned is dissatisfied with the amount of means assessed against him it is open to him to appeal and have his case determined by an appeals officer.  A form for this purpose may be obtained at his local office.  While every effort is being made to process claims with a minimum of delay, nevertheless, due to the large volume of claims received in the Department, there is an inevitable delay in some cases.  Delays <Col N="1895" /> are more likely to arise where means testing is involved, as in this particular case, where the social welfare officer must visit the claimant's home to investigate the means.</P>

      <P>Entitlement to unemployment benefit is subject to the condition that a person must be available for employment. The person concerned had been in receipt of disability benefit up to February 1986, when her claim was disallowed after she was found capable of work by a medical referee.  She claimed unemployment benefit from 27 February 1986 and her claim was allowed from that date.</P>
      <P>Following a review, her claim was disallowed from June 1986 on the grounds that she was not available for employment, on the basis that she failed to furnish evidence of any efforts to obtain employment.  She appealed against the disallowance and attended an oral hearing of her case on 9 September 1986.  The appeals officer also decided that she was not available for employment.</P>
      <P>She continued to sign the unemployed register, and following a further review of her case, her claim has been allowed from 10 September 1986, the date following the appeals officer's decision.  The person concerned has been notified accordingly and all arrears due will be paid this week.  Further weekly payments at the appropriate weekly rate of £41.10 will continue to be made as they become due.</P>

The investigation revealed that the claimant and two of his brothers benefit from the holding. Accordingly, the means assessed against him are based on his having a one-third share.</P>
      <P>The person concerned appealed against the assessment of means on 30 October 1986 and his case is being submitted to an appeals officer for determination at the earliest available opportunity.  His entitlement to unemployment assistance will be reviewed in the light of the outcome of the appeal.</P>

      <P>Under the equal treatment provisions an adult dependant allowance will no longer be paid in respect of a spouse who is in employment, except where the spouse's earnings are under £50 a week. Data is not available to give a reliable estimate of the cost of increasing the £50 earnings threshold.  The cost of the special temporary payment of £10 to a married man who loses the adult dependant allowance where his wife is also on social welfare is of the order of £4.3 million in a full year.  The cost of a £20 and £30 transitional payment would therefore <Col N="1897" /> be in the order of £8.4 million and £12.9 million respectively.  However, it should be noted that a £30 payment would give him an income in excess of what he was entitled to prior to the implementation of the equal treatment measures.  The information regarding net outflows from the Exchequer is not available.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if she will examine the case of an elderly person (details supplied) in Dublin 6 who was refused the contributory old age pension despite the fact that he paid a stamp contribution from age 16 years until he exceeded the limits of the scheme; and if this person is entitled to this, given recent comment on possible changes in entitlement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mrs. Hussey) Gemma Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mrs. Hussey)</NameTxt>
      <P>Two of the conditions for receipt of contributory old age pension require the person concerned to have entered into insurance under the Social Welfare Acts before he reached age 60 years and to have a yearly average of at least 20 reckonable contributions from 5 January 1953 or from his year of entry into insurance, whichever is the later, to the end of the last complete contribution year before he reached pension age.</P>
      <P>The Department's records show that the person concerned was first insured from 1929 to 1941.  His employment then ceased to be insurable until he re-entered insurance on 1 April 1974, by which time he had already reached age 60.  In order to satisfy the age-at-entry condition, his earlier insurance has to be taken into account and as a result his yearly average falls to be determined over the period from 5 January 1953 to 5 April 1979.  He had a total of 262 contributions since his re-entry and this total is equal to a yearly average of only ten over the 26 year period from January 1953 to April 1979. He does not therefore qualify for a contributory old age pension.</P>
      <P>The position regarding persons with broken insurance records is being considered in conjunction with the report of the Commission on Social Welfare.</P>

      <P>The person concerned is at present in receipt of disability benefit at the rate of £67.70 per week, that is £41.10 personal rate and an increase of £26.60 in respect of his wife as adult dependant. His wife is in receipt of invalidity pension in her own right at the weekly rate of £47.10.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1899" /> Under the overlapping benefit regulations an increase of invalidity pension is not payable in respect of a person who is receiving invalidity pension.  If the person concerned were awarded invalidity pension, it would be payable at the personal rate of £47.10 per week only, resulting in a cash reduction of £20.60 per week in his income from the Department.</P>
    <P>The person concerned was invited to claim invalidity pension in October 1985 but as it was not to his advantage to claim this pension he did not do so.</P>
    <P>However, when the equality of treatment for men and women in social welfare matters is introduced with effect from 17 November 1986, the person concerned will no longer be entitled to claim an increase of disability benefit in respect of his wife.  It is now, therefore, to his advantage to transfer to invalidity pension. A form on which to claim this pension has been forwarded to him and on its return, duly completed, the claim will be dealt with without delay.  Invalidity pension will be paid to him at the personal rate of £47.10 per week.</P>

      <P>The person concerned was in receipt of unemployment benefit at the appropriate weekly rate of £73.85 up to 9 June 1986, when he had drawn his maximum entitlement of 390 days benefit. He then claimed unemployment assistance and, following investigation, his means were assessed at £38.45 weekly, derived from self-employment. He is, accordingly, in receipt of unemployment assistance at the weekly rate of £41.45, being the maximum rate payable in his case of £79.90 less means of £38.45.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He appealed against the means assessment and, arising from contentions raised by him in support of his appeal, his papers were referred to the social welfare officer <Col N="1907" /> for further inquiries.  These inquiries were recently completed and arrangements are being made to have his case submitted to an appeals officer at the earliest opportunity.

      <P>It is assumed that the Deputy is referring to the means limits for receipt of non-contributory pensions.  In the case of non-contributory old age, blind and widows' pensions and social assistance allowances for deserted wives, prisoners' wives and unmarried mothers the maximum rate of pension or allowance is payable where the applicant's means do not exceed £6 per week.  There are no plans to increase this amount which has remained unchanged since 1975.</P>
      <P>The maximum amount of means which a pensioner can have and still qualify for a reduced non-contributory pension at the personal rate is £48 per week.  A pensioner with children may receive a reduced pension where the weekly means exceed £48 a week.  The means limits for payment of reduced pensions and allowances have been varied from time to time in the light of increases in rates of payments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mrs. Hussey) Gemma Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mrs. Hussey)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is presumed that the question <Col N="1908" /> refers to the manner in which UK social security pensions are assessed as means when determining entitlement to non-contributory pension.</P>
      <P>Under the provision of the scheme, pensioners are assessed with all income which they may reasonably expect to receive during the year succeeding the date of calculation.  This income includes foreign pensions.</P>
      <P>In calculating the value of a UK pension, the rate of exchange is taken from the rates of exchange which are fixed for each quarter year by Council Regulation (EEC) No. 2615/79 for the purposes of certain social security transactions between member states of the European Communities.</P>
      <P>In view of the variations which have occurred in recent times between Irish and UK currencies, the exchange rate in use is, in fact, the more favourable from the claimants point of view of the latest two quarterly rates under regulation.</P>
      <P>UK pensions are usually increased in November of each year and this can give rise to a revaluation of the means of non-contributory pensioners whose means are thereby increased.  The recalculation &mdash; which is carried out in the beginning of the following year &mdash; is similarly done by choosing the exchange rate from the regulations appropriate to last quarter of the year or the first quarter of the succeeding year, which is even more favourable to the pensioner.</P>
      <P>The old age, non-contributory, scheme does not allow weekly or frequent adjustments to means and thereby adjustments to entitlement.  If however, any pensioner feels that his means have changed substantially, it is open to him or her to apply for a reinvestigation of his or her circumstances with a view to having the entitlement reviewed.  The method of valuing UK pensions is considered to be both practical and fair.  It is however kept under review.</P>

The estimated gross margins per hectare in 1985 were £297, £593, £951 and £269 for winter barley, sugar beet, creamery milk and cattle enterprises respectively. A wide variety of factors affect the economic circumstances of any particular farm family and it would not be possible to assess the viability and profitability of every farm in the country even if an objective and satisfactory definition of these terms were to be agreed.  All of the Government's agricultural policies are aimed at promoting the development of our farms.  In particular, I would draw attention to the new farm improvement <Col N="1910" /> programme introduced this year and the two exchange rate guarantee schemes which provide a total of £235 million at attractive low rates of interest in respect of both new working capital requirements and existing loans.</P>

      <P>Bovine tuberculosis is a highly infectious disease caused by the bacterium mycobacterium bovis.  It is a chronic progressive disease which typically effects the respiratory system but can affect all organs.  In addition to bovines, the bacterium can cause disease in other domestic or wild animals and also in humans. The most common cause of infection is lateral spread from animal to animal but it can also be transmitted by means of contaminated feed, milk, water, machinery, transport, housing and land.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Deasy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose taking Questions Nos. 189 and 193 together.</P>
      <P>My Department's view is that, in certain circumstances, wildlife can be a factor in the persistence and spread of bovine TB.  Accordingly, where the disease is chronic in particular herds and the standard eradication procedures do not succeed in improving the situation, it is sometimes necessary to investigate the possible involvement of wildlife.  Such investigations are carried out under licences from the Department of Tourism, Fisheries and Forestry and under the direct supervision of veterinary inspectors of my Department.</P>
      <P>Where it is necessary to test wildlife such as deer for bovine TB the testing procedures correspond closely to those followed in the case of cattle.  For some species of wildlife including the badger there is no routine TB test available and the presence of the disease can only be established by <i>post mortem</i> examination.</P>

      <P>While the current levels of bovine TB are unsatisfactory in both counties the more serious situation exists in County Longford which has a disease prevalence (10 per cent) twice that of County Westmeath (4.8 per cent).</P>
      <P>Both counties have features conductive to disease spread including fragmented holdings, inadequate fencing and a high volume of cattle movement.  These features are undoubtedly contributing to the persistence and spread of disease especially since testing has been particularly intensive in Longford and Westmeath over the past two years.  With a view to reinforcing the intensive programme currently in operation in the midlands, a stricter interpretation of tests results has been introduced in Longford and investigations into a possible link between wildlife and disease spread are also being carried out in both counties.</P>

      <P>The popular article referred to is somewhat speculative on the possible consequences which modern farming techniques may have for future crops. <Col N="1921" /> However, the concentration of plant breeding material, by the use of a more limited range of cultivars, may carry with it some possible long term risk with respect to disease resistance of plants. International co-operation on the establishment of gene banks, which is of course now taking place, appears to be the most appropriate manner of dealing with any such possible risk.</P>

      <P>Prison officers injured in the course of duty are subject to the provisions governing occupational injuries which apply to civil servants generally.  These include payment in accordance with the normal sick leave arrangements in respect of officers unfit for work as a result of having been injured in the course of duty and, in cases where officers have to retire, benefits under the Injury Warrant, 1946 (as amended by the Injury Warrant, 1978).</P>
      <P>Officers injured in the course of duty may, in appropriate circumstances, claim under the scheme of compensation for personal injuries criminally inflicted.  I take it that in referring to compensation provisions which were operated up to recently the Deputy has in mind an amendment made to the scheme to exclude payment of compensation in respect of pain and suffering.  I am aware of the concern which has been expressed about the implications of this amendment for prison staff injured in the course of duty and I have been examining ways in which this concern might be met.  There are difficulties in this area, however, given the implications for other areas of the public service where staff representatives have also been seeking revised compensation arrangements.</P>

        <Col N="1926" /> The administration of the higher education grants and the VEC scholarships schemes have been statutorily entrusted to the local rating authorities and the vocational education committees respectively.</P>
      <P>The specimen higher education grants scheme issued by my Department to the local authorities each year contains a provision as follows: (b) &ldquo;Every effort will be made by the....  County Council/Corporation.... to pay the maintenance element (if any) of a grant holder's grant in three equal instalments, one as early as possible in each term, and the individual paying orders will be addressed to the grant-holders c/o the Bursar's Office of the University or other educational institutions concerned&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>A similar provision is contained in the specimen vocational education committee scholarships scheme issued annually by the Department to each committee.</P>
      <P>It is a matter for each local authority and vocational education committee to apply these provisions in its functional area and I would be concerned if there was any undue delay in the payment of grants or scholarships to students.  As I indicated in reply to Question 62 on Thursday, 6 November 1986, I am having the procedures for the award of grants/scholarships examined with a view to ameliorating any difficulties that may exist in the operation of the schemes.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the Department's middle-level technician programme, special training grants are paid to participants monthly, in arrears.  Whilst certain delays have occurred, I understand that, aside from the participants in programmes operated by colleges under the auspices of the City of Dublin VEC, payments have been made in accordance with the terms of the scheme.  I am informed that payments will be made by the City of Dublin VEC by the end of November or early December.  In this context the Deputy will be aware that it is a matter for each VEC to order its priorities to ensure the early payments of the grants in question.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Education the increased cost of insurance for (a) primary and (b) second level schools, following the abolition of the malicious damages scheme on 15 July <Col N="1934" /> last; and if additional funds will be provided in these schools to meet the additional cost.</P>

      <P>I understand that the implementation of the Malicious Injuries (Amendment) Act, 1986, will lead to increases of varying amounts in national schools' insurance premiums.  The matter of the additional costs will be considered when the question of an increase in the capitation grant for 1987 is being examined.</P>
      <P>In the case of secondary schools, the question of insurance is a matter for the school authorities.  My Department has no information on the cost of such insurance.</P>
      <P>In the case of vocational schools, the question of insurance is a matter for each vocational education committee which meets such costs from its annual budget which is derived mainly from Exchequer funds.  The Department is not aware of the additional cost, if any, involved for VECs in 1986.  The State carries its own insurance in respect of community and comprehensive schools and, accordingly, the question of increased cost for such schools does not arise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Labour the present position regarding payment of the award made by the Employment Appeals Tribunal to a person (details supplied) in County Dublin under the Redundancy Payments Acts, 1967-79 and the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act, 1973, and if payment can be expedited in view of the urgent financial need of the resident concerned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the person concerned was paid his full statutory lump sum entitlement under the Redundancy Payments Acts in December 1985 but that a problem has arisen in regard to payment of a minimum notice award because of doubts about the identity of the company by which he was employed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>According to the information available to my Department, the Employment Appeals Tribunal made an award in favour of the person concerned against a company which is in liquidation but the liquidator of that company claims that the person was not employed by it at the date of termination of his employment <Col N="1936" /> but by another subsidiary company.  I understand that the subsidiary company is not in liquidation or receivership.</P>
    <P>It is a matter for the employer in the first instance to pay a minimum notice award determined by the Employment Appeals Tribunal in favour of an employee but if the employer fails to pay because of insolvency, application can be made to my Department for payment from the redundancy and employers' insolvency fund under the terms of the Protection of Employees (Employers' Insolvency) Act, 1984.  Such applications must in the case of employees of an insolvent company be submitted to my Department through the liquidator or receiver as appropriate of that company.</P>
    <P>My Department has not received a formal application under the 1984 Act for payment of the minimum notice award in this case but it has nonetheless been endeavouring to assist the parties concerned in resolving the difficulty which has arisen.  If it transpires that the employer of the person concerned was the subsidiary company and the company is insolvent, it would be open to the employee concerned to seek to have the employer's name in the tribunal award amended and to submit a formal application for payment under the 1984 Act through the liquidator or receiver of the company.  If, however, the subsidiary company is not insolvent, it would not be possible to pay the award from the redundancy and employers' insolvency fund and the matter would have to be pursued through the courts.</P>

      <P>The person in question was paid a lump sum by his employer on 31 January 1986 in <Col N="1937" /> respect of a statutory redundancy entitlement. He did not agree with his employer's calculation of that entitlement and, therefore took a case to the Employment Appeals Tribunal for payment of the outstanding balance which he considered to be due to him.  The tribunal found in his favour but his employer refused to pay the additional amount.  He then made application to my Department for payment from the redundancy and employers' insolvency fund and payment of the outstanding balance was issued to him from the fund on 6 November 1986.  The amount of rebate payable to the employer from the fund will be adjusted to take account of the supplementary payment made to the employee.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware the ambitious national target of 10,000 participants on the social employment scheme was surpassed in June 1986.  In order to remain within the budget provided for the scheme in 1986 it is necessary to restrict further recruitments at present. Accordingly new appointments may only occur where sufficient numbers of participants have already terminated their period of employment under the scheme.</P>
      <P>I should point out that the monitoring committee for the social employment scheme is continuing to accept and assess new projects for the scheme.</P>
