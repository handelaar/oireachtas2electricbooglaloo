    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>This country has had considerable experience of Coalition Governments and it is unfortunately true that the major problems facing Coalition Governments have been inability to make difficult decisions in time and, perhaps still more important, to abide by these decisions once made when such decisions entered troubled waters.  This indecision resulted from real or pretended differences in ideologies.  I say &ldquo;pretended differences&rdquo; because I think it can be said truthfully that all Ministers, both Fine Gael and Labour, in this Government have shown themselves to be conservatives in economic matters, with the Fine Gael economic approach being predominant.  The Labour Party feel it incumbent on them to give the impression to their followers that they are pursuing their own objectives, so we have a pseudo crisis from time to time, the overall result being failure to make difficult but necessary decisions in time, the economy then being allowed to drift to the detriment of all our people.</P>
      <P>Perhaps Deputies on Government back benches will point to closures of hospitals and a college of education and to the teachers' dispute, and state that difficult decisions were taken by the Government.  Having seen Deputies opposite hightail in every direction since the decisions were made, I doubt it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From the beginning of the Coalition period of office it has been the &ldquo;in&rdquo; thing for Government back benchers, Labour and Fine Fael, to take credit in their constituencies for everything popular done by the Government, but to distance themselves from unpopular Government decisions, even going so far as to attack their own Ministers publicly.  The most popular pastime of Government Deputies when faced with unpopular Government decisions is to leak to the media how hard they had fought at party meetings to block the unpopular measures, in the <Col N="2594" /> hope that this lead will reduce the anger and frustration of those affected, when the same Deputies march into the lobbies later to vote for such measures.</P>
    <P>From long experience in this House.  I say to them that this will not work.  The public have more respect for those who defend their Government's decisions for which these Deputies, by keeping the Government in office, are responsible just as much as the Government.  The public have very little respect for or are not impressed by these manoeuvrings.</P>
    <P>The cutbacks recently announced were clearly not as a result of proper planning. They are panic measures forced on the Government by the fact that for three years they have failed totally to face up to the economic problems which beset the country.  If the Government had had a proper plan from the beginning of 1983 and followed such a plan through with courage and vigour there would not now be need for the panic and the insensitive decisions taken recently.</P>
    <P>One abysmal element threading its way through the performances of all Coalition Governments here is the failure to tackle unemployment and an inability to awaken in our people a belief in themselves and a hope for the future, which are fundamental to overcoming these grave problems.  I entered the Dáil in 1957 on the demise of the second Coalition Government.  Unemployment was rampant, emigration widespread, despair had gripped our people and the outlook was such that all hope apparently had gone.</P>
    <P>The problems were tackled by the incoming Fianna Fáil Government, and in a relatively short period the climate of despair and despondency began to disappear and Fianna Fáil proved what can be achieved by a determined single minded Government.  Employment increased, emigration was reduced rapidly and our young people could look forward to a worth while future at home.  It is my experience of 1957 and its aftermath, which, relatively speaking, was plagued with the same economic problems and the same serious unemployment as we have today, which gives me hope for the <Col N="2595" /> future, provided we have a Government who know their own mind and will have the courage and the conviction and the capability to make the difficult but necessary decisions for the nation's good; when we will no longer have decisions based only on the needs of conflicting ideologies.</P>
    <P>We have had three years of this Coalition. Our economy is in tatters, unemployment is soaring, industrial closures are a regular feature, emigration is rising rapidly.  It has become obvious that we cannot expect a unified approach to our problems and that only a new Government can instil the hope in the future which is so necessary to revitalise the economy, vitally important for all our people but particularly for our young people.</P>
    <P>The gravest problem facing the country is unemployment.  It is sad that since the Government came to power we have had to make this point year after year, yet the Government persist in doing little or nothing effectively to deal with the problem.  The average rise in unemployment in the EC was just over 1 per cent in the nine months to September 1985. The rise here was 8.5 per cent.  The Government no longer can claim that the high rate of unemployment here is related to conditions in the EC or worldwide.  At 18 per cent, our unemployment is the highest in the EC.</P>
    <P>The figures I have just given also belie the statement by the Minister in his Budget Statement last year that employment would rise in 1985.  A few small employment schemes have been introduced. They are welcome if only because they take some young people off the dole queues, but they are short term jobs.  The experience of the majority of our young people is that, when these jobs come to an end they find themselves back on the dole, more hopeless and despondent than ever.</P>
    <P>It is little wonder that emigration is increasing rapidly.  In a small village in my constituency I have learned that a dozen young people from the village emigrated to America relatively recently and <Col N="2596" /> have remained there illegally ever since. This scenario is repeated throughout the country.  When one notes the fact that County Louth was never noted even at the worst of times for high levels of emigration, the movement of young people from a once prosperous constituency is a positive vote of no confidence in this Government.</P>
    <P>Passenger figures in and out of the country show that emigration was running at around 30,000 in 1984.  If one is to judge by reports from my constituency and other constituencies, the figures for 1985 will be higher still.  Fianna Fáil Governments have tackled very successfully this problem of emigration and it is a matter of very deep disappointment for us on this side of the House that emigration is once again increasing rapidly.</P>
    <P>There are now 240,000 people signing at the employment exchanges.  Added to this exceptionally high number must be those on temporary employment schemes and those who are emigrating.  This situation is intolerable and totally unacceptable. In a sense, however, it is understandable because if one is to judge by the Government's most recent programme, <i>Building on Reality</i> the high level of unemployment appears to be acceptable to them.  In that programme the Government stated that unemployment would be higher at the end of the programme period in 1987 than when it was announced in 1985.  Such a programme offers no hope to the unemployed and such a policy could not but fail to spark off any enthusiasm among our youth, an enthusiasm which is vital for economic survival. Worse still, since this programme was published foreign borrowing has increased while unemployment has also increased.  The programme has failed. We have instances of countries in western Europe, such as Denmark, where foreign borrowing has been reduced while at the same time unemployment has also been reduced.  This is proof positive that with proper Government and with proper management both foreign borrowing and unemployment can be reduced.</P>
    <P>The introduction of the programme <Col N="2597" /><i>Building on Reality</i> was an acceptance by the Government that the Joint Programme for Government issued by the Coalition partners in late 1982 was a failure.  Now <i>Building on Reality</i> has also been proved a failure, as will any programme produced by this Government. While the desire to succeed may be there, the will to take the difficult decisions necessary to implement the programme is not there.</P>
    <P>In the constituency of Louth there are now 8,472 people registered as unemployed, an increase of 33 per cent since this Government came into office.  In Drogheda and district the number of unemployed is now 3,443, an increase of over 35 per cent in the same period.  We have now 2,112 more people unemployed in the constituency since the advent of this Government and this includes over 900 more people unemployed in Drogheda and district since December 1982.  We have large families of adults in the town of Drogheda with not one person in employment.  Mothers are at their wits' end trying to provide food for families when neither the father nor the mother nor any member of the family is working.  The deterioration in living conditions in the town is something I forecast before the general election should a Coalition Government be elected.  It was clear to me that Coalitions, like the leopard, never change their spots and that four Coalition Governments had already run their course leaving high unemployment in their wake.  This Government was not likely to prove any different.  So it is that once again the need to change the Government is obvious if any improvement is to be effected.</P>
    <P>If we are to make a lasting impact on unemployment it is of the utmost importance that we concentrate on the two major areas in which real jobs can be created, that is, manufacturing industry and the building and construction industry.  It is the function of Government to create the climate in which each of these major areas can flourish.  The budget does nothing to help in either case; it is quite the reverse.  The failure <Col N="2598" /> to reverse the disastrous decision in last year's budget to double VAT on the building and construction industry and the huge cut in the public capital programme all point to further unemployment. Investment is the life blood of industry.  Technological change demands investment in plant and machinery.  The need to create the climate for investment in industry is apparent.  However, this budget in effect increases taxation on manufacturing industry through change in tax treatment of investment in plant and machinery and because of special duties on loans and so on.  When one takes account of the fact that the volume of manufacturing industry, seasonally adjusted, fell in the first three quarters of 1985 with only a slight change upwards in the last quarter, it is clear that we can hope for little change in the coming year in this basic area where our main hope for job creation rests.  The provisions of this budget will inevitably increase the rate of inflation, which will further retard industrial growth.  Technological change demands investment in plant and machinery and the Minister's attitude in this budget will have exactly the opposite effect.</P>
    <P>The continuing exceptionally high level of personal taxation is a disincentive to initiative, effort and investment.  Apart from investment in plant and machinery we need investment in brain power.  Such investment is low here in comparison with other developed nations.  High personal taxation levels help to ensure that where we have an investment in brain power it will be lost through the brain drain when highly qualified young people, badly needed at home, through frustration, go abroad and give the advantage of their abilities to build up the economies of other countries.</P>
    <P>We need greater investment in infrastructure and control on costs of essential industrial services such as energy and transport.  This budget is doing little or nothing to help in these vital areas. Investment in management education and development and training in technological skills is not adequately catered for.  A thorough examination into courses <Col N="2599" /> available for managers must be made to ensure that our approach is the right one and that those responsible for such courses have the expertise and the up to the minute know-how which is so necessary.</P>
    <P>Our present tax structures are a major disincentive to industrial development here and the Government in their most recent published programme and in this budget have failed to put forward any programme for worthwhile change in this area.  The Government, in spite of election promises to introduce a fair taxation system, have done nothing over the past three years in this regard and inexcusably propose to do very little in this budget. Every effort was made to create the illusion in the presentation of this budget that taxes were being cut.  The facts are quite different.  Income tax in 1986 will bring in £2,356 million as compared with £2,103 million in 1985, a rise of 12 per cent.  Even allowing for higher incomes, the figures portray the reality.  The tax burden has clearly not been shifted from income to any worthwhile degree to other tax revenue sources.  We are informed that the Minister has given considerable concessions in the area of VAT, but VAT in 1986 will yield £1,562 million as compared with £1,402 million in 1985.  The facts are that we will pay more income tax and VAT this year than we paid last year.  The so-called concessions are an illusion.  We are being told that the banks, the building societies and the financial institutions will be taxed but the reality is that they will simply pass on the new tax to their customers.  It is the people who save money in these institutions who will be taxed.</P>
    <P>The general line pursued by this Government has been to increase taxation over the years, resulting, as we have seen from recent figures, in less and less income to the State.  We have reached an extraordinary situation where a single industrial worker with an income of a little over £9,000 a year comes within the top tax rating.  Does this tax system inspire people to invest in industrial <Col N="2600" /> enterprises?  Let us look at the facts. There has been a serious decline in investment in industry over the past three years resulting in a fall off in growth.  It should be clear to all that any real hope of reducing unemployment must come from industrial development.  The constant stream of closures in industry in 1985 is, to put it mildly, disheartening; indeed it is frightening.  While we must continue in our efforts to attract foreign industry to set up here, our major objectives must be to motivate people with worthwhile ideas to translate them to practical effect and we must also formulate a reconstruction package of proposals in an endeavour to halt further closures and to maintain employment which would otherwise be lost.</P>
    <P>The Government are pinning their hopes on the National Development Corporation but the reality is that we have sufficient tried and tested State bodies in this field and that we do not need a National Development Corporation but new practical ideas.  Even if we had large sums of money available for investment without worthwhile ideas it would be useless. The lack of ideas in the Government to date has been a major drawback and does not augur well for the remainder of their term in office.</P>
    <P>It is generally agreed that output in the industrial sector must be doubled if we are to make worthwhile progress in reducing unemployment and in raising living standards.  Competition for money is keen.  Banks, building societies and the Post Office are able to offer reliefs of various kinds to those who invest with them and it is important that industry should also be in a position to compete on an equal footing.  Unless something is done to help in this area, most people will continue to invest in what might be termed safe investments.  Risk capital will only be available in necessary quantities where the return is considered reasonable by the investor.</P>
    <P>The extension of the natural gas grid throughout the country and &mdash; from my point of view to County Louth, including Drogheda, Dundalk and, hopefully, Ardee &mdash; is a must.  The pace with which <Col N="2601" /> this great national asset is being made available to manufacturing industries is unbelievably slow.  A gas distribution grid is an essential element of modern industrial infrastructure and it is well to remember that our competitors in Europe, inside and outside the EC, have a gas distribution network.  This places us at a disadvantage in our efforts to develop industrially and to compete on home and foreign markets.  Natural gas is needed to help in developing industry in my constituency where unemployment has risen rapidly in the past three years.</P>
    <P>Premier Periclase, Drogheda, is a case in point.  This is an industry with a high employment content using natural resources and the only foreign element in production is imported heavy oil.  This foreign element could be removed to quite an extent and natural gas substituted. If that happened, we would have that most desirable of industries, one which relies on our own natural resources only.  The consumption of natural gas in such an industry would be exceptionally high and, therefore, I urge the Minister and the Government to proceed, in the national interest, with the extension of the gas grid to Drogheda and Dundalk immediately.</P>
    <P>Natural gas prices should be set at a level which will enable energy intensive industries to compete on an equal basis with foreign competitiors and thus create more jobs here.  Many of our energy intensive industries are competing with industries abroad which have much lower energy costs and when one adds transport costs the problems and difficulties for Irish companies attempting to break into foreign markets or to hold their share of these markets are all too obvious.</P>
    <P>The chronic state of our national finances under the Coalition is such that their main objective at all times is to siphon off as much cash as possible from all available sources.  One example of this was the demand for an enormous annual cut from our telecommunications services even before they were fully developed. Another relates to the price being charged for natural gas where the yardstick used is to add up all the energy costs <Col N="2602" /> of an industry prior to the installation of a natural gas supply and to charge for the gas at that level.  This is a very shortsighted policy particularly in a country with such a high level of unemployment. This great natural resource should be made available to industry at a reasonable price so that they can compete on equal terms with foreign competitors.</P>
    <P>I have repeatedly asked the Minister to grant relief to Premier Periclase in regard to hydrocarbon fuel oil tax.  This tax is an enormous imposition on the industry.  Every effort has been made to improve energy efficiency in that industry but they still need to use many thousands of tonnes of heavy oil annually and the heavy tax on this oil leaves the company at a grave disadvantage in relation to their competitors.  I have already pointed to the fact on previous occasions that Aughinish Alumina have been relieved fully from tax in this area.  If the Minister were far seeing he would appreciate that anything which would help to improve competitiveness can only result in more much needed jobs.  This industry is special in that its raw materials are all native materials.</P>
    <P>My constituency of County Louth has been devastated since this Government came to office, with industries large and small closing down and with others cutting back on the numbers employed.  This constituency, which under Fianna Fáil Governments, was one of the most prosperous in Ireland has now long queues outside the employment exchange, drawing State assistance, week after week, with no hope of a change in this sad situation.  We have a large number of secondary and vocational schools filled with young students, most of whom have little or no hope of getting employment when they leave school and this has an extremely depressing effect on parents and children alike.</P>
    <P>I have called on the Government on numerous occasions to make the same grants for industrial development available to County Louth which are already available to all other Border counties north and south of the Border, <Col N="2603" /> so as to give County Louth an opportunity to compete on fair and equal terms with other areas for foreign industry as well as to give our people there the necessary financial assistance to develop industrial undertakings.  A few years ago I would not have dreamt of making such a request here in this House.  County Louth was one of the most highly industrialised counties in Ireland, with good sound employment available to large numbers of people, and nobody would even think of asking for similar conditions as those applying in other Border counties.  Today the situation there is completely changed. As I said earlier, industries are collapsing and unemployment has increased dramatically and the need to come to the assistance of our hard pressed community cannot be denied.</P>
    <P>Far from helping my constituency the Minister saw to it in his budget provisions that unemployment will increase more rapidly than ever there. The increases in the prices of old reliables, drink, cigarettes and petrol may perhaps have been taken with a degree of equanimity in other parts of the country but I can assure the Minister that that degree of equanimity does not apply to my constituency or indeed to the other Border constituencies.</P>
    <P>The policies followed by this Government since they assumed office have devastated the Border areas.  Their high taxation policy has made it virtually impossible for the retail business in these areas to survive and there are regular closures of businesses, signs all over the place announcing sales of premises, all resulting in more and more redundancies. Lower tax rates in the North serve as an encouragement to the people of County Louth to travel north of the Border to buy goods of all descriptions resulting in a severe drop in trading in my constituency. Major attractions for people on this side of the Border to travel north to shop were the considerable differences in the prices of petrol and spirits.  Because they went north for petrol they tended to buy other goods there also.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2604" /> We, on this side of the House, protested vigorously to the Government and to the Minister about this state of affairs and eventually the Minister took some action which ameliorated the situation and helped to an extent to stem the rush across the Border.  He has, however, in this budget reversed the situation, by increasing the price of a glass of whiskey by 6½p and petrol by almost 11p per gallon.  This is a total increase of 15p in the price of a gallon of petrol in the past three months.  The Minister can be assured that the trek across the Border will return to flood proportions.  Petrol in the North is much cheaper than south of the Border and this added to the increase in the strength of the punt will ensure a rapid return of the problems which bedevilled trade and commerce, particularly in Dundalk but also throughout the county generally only a short time ago. It is believed by economists that cross-Border trade will extend to a greater catchment area then heretofore has been the case.</P>
    <P>The Minister, after repeated protests by us, stated that he recognised the special problems of Border areas.  So grave had the situation become that he eventually took some action.  He has wiped out in this budget the assistance previously given and he has exacerbated an already bad situation to a point where those involved in trade and commerce in my constituency are fast losing all hope for the future.</P>
    <P>One of our national papers made the point immediately after the budget that further falls in oil prices would soon equal the tax imposed by the Minister.  That, of course, is of no value to traders in Border constituencies because the price falls North of the Border for the very same reason and the differential remains.</P>
    <P>I am now asking the Minister to explain why, having in the past expressed concern for the plight of trade and commerce in Border areas and the number of redundancies caused by Government policies in this area of trade in my constituency and having taken some steps to alleviate the situation, he can now reverse his position and once again create the conditions <Col N="2605" /> in Dundalk and in County Louth generally which will wreck all hope for the business people there and their employees?</P>
    <P>I would remind the Minister that the Economic and Social Committee's report on Border areas recognises that Border areas in this country are among the least economically and socially developed in Europe and points to the extra problems created by an unnatural Border which hampers normal economic development.</P>
    <P>The other major job creation area to which I have referred is the building and construction industry.  In their first budget the Labour-Fine Gael Coalition Government cut the Fianna Fáil public capital programme by £220 million.  I deplored that cut at the time and forecast that the cut would have a catastrophic effect on the building and construction industry and on its workers.  Time has proved me to be only too correct in this prognosis.  The taking of this very large sum of money out of the public capital programme plunged the industry into a deflationary spin.  So much so that minor measures taken by the Government in recent times have totally failed even to slow up this deflationary cycle and so an industry, which should be capable of producing new stable jobs, instead has seen more and more of its workers and workers in ancillary industries losing their employment.  Construction output has been falling rapidly over the three years of this Coalition Government.  Public investment on construction has fallen by over 25 per cent in the last three years and the volume of State-funded construction work in 1985 fell very considerably.  Publicly financed construction work carried out by the private sector in 1985 declined by 10 per cent.  The output target for the industry, set out in the Coalition programme, <i>Building on Reality</i> of a 7 per cent growth rate between 1985 and 1987 is no longer achievable.</P>
    <P>The number of people unemployed in the industry currently stands at over 45,000 and the forecasts are that the number will be much higher.  Added to this must be the number of people who have lost their employment in ancillary <Col N="2606" /> industries.  Irish Cement Limited, in Drogheda has had redundancies since this Government came of office for the first time in its history.  Indeed, as I have said on a number of occasions, these redundancies had very severe repercussions in Drogheda and district because Irish Cement, since its establishment there by Fianna Fáil, was regarded as being as solid as the Rock of Cashel and the very idea of redundancies there was unthinkable.  Is it any wonder that workers in the building and construction industry claim and rightly so, that only under Fianna Fáil has their industry developed and prospered, and only under Fianna Fáil have their jobs been secure.</P>
    <P>The index of employment in the industry in September 1985 show a 15 per cent decline compared with an 8 per cent decline in September 1984 in respect of the previous year.  As I mentioned earlier, the recently announced scheme of grants, while it is welcome, will have little impact on the general depressed situation of the industry.  There is little doubt that because of the Government's lack of positive thinking in respect of this great industry, its major problem is a total lack of confidence.  Positive action is what was required from this Government and it was obvious that unless this action was quickly taken and unless adequate finance was made available the lack of confidence which permeates the economy generally and the building and construction industry in particular would remain.  Far from providing the necessary incentives, however, this budget has drastically cut by £25 million, the public capital programme, reducing the money for sanitary services by £4 million, for schools by £3 million, for house and improvement loans by £2 million, for farm modernisation scheme by £3.2 million and for IDA grants by £3 million, all of which will have a retrograde impact on the industry.</P>
    <P>We had, in the building and construction industry, an organisational structure of management and professional services which enabled it to undertake projects of every kind, large and small, and indeed which was the base from which many <Col N="2607" /> Irish building and construction companies were able successfully to compete worldwide for building work.  It is tragic that this great organisation is disintegrating. Old established firms have been liquidated and the building and construction skills of a trained workforce are unused because of the high level of unemployment in the industry and, eventually, unless quickly utilised, will disappear altogether.  We in Fianna Fáil believe that we can restore the industry to its former capacity but such is its state of demoralisation, that it will take quite a time to do so.  In the meantime I must again demand that the Government take an active interest in the industry, at least to show that they recognise its importance and its capacity to create new jobs quickly.</P>
    <P>Might I also draw the attention of the Minister to the fact that the building and quarrying material supply industry north of the Border has received huge capital grants, particularly over the past four years?  A very high proportion of these grants were for manufacturing units set up in close proximity to the Border in order to avail of the market here.  These grants have now been removed but as the industry north of the Border expected this to happen, they had geared themselves to such an extent that the effects can last for the next ten years.  These grants are contrary to the spirit of the EC concept and the industry here is entitled to some form of counterbalance to allow it to compete.  The net effect has been a big number of closures in plants in and around the Border areas resulting in a large number of job losses and a loss of revenue to the State.</P>
    <P>During the period 1981-84 the numbers employed in plants here servicing the areas affected by imports has fallen from 870 to 620, a loss of 250 jobs, most of which were as a result of imports from the North.  There is now a prospect of a further 200 jobs being lost.  A total loss of 450 jobs could mean a loss of over £9 million to the State.  I would strongly urge the Minister to come quickly to the assistance of this industry here to save the jobs which are in danger and to create <Col N="2608" /> new jobs in substitution for the jobs lost. The general consensus is that if present trends of market penetration continue, plants trading in the affected areas here will be forced to close or declare further redundancies.  I might add that the artificial price levels being employed by Northern producers in order to gain markets offer no long term benefits to consumers here because once competition is eliminated here prices from Northern sources will soar.</P>
    <P>In the Estimates for the Department of Communications I noted that the priority for capital grants for harbour developments would go to Dublin port, to Ringaskiddy in Cork and to Rosslare.  It is clear from a reply to a question to the Minister for Communications on 22 January 1986 that after the needs of these areas have been satisfied there will be little money left for the development of other harbours. There are two quays in Drogheda, Ballast Quay and Welshman's Quay, which are in critical condition.  I have over and over made the point that not only are these quays in danger of collapsing, but if one of them in particular should collapse, it will bring with it portion of another quay, on which large sums of public money have been spent.</P>
    <P>Let me again repeat that when I was Minister for Transport I made available to the Drogheda Harbour Commissioners almost £1 million in grants as well as large sums from the Local Loans Fund for the reconstruction of the other two quays in the port.  Because of inflationary trends since then, it would take £2.5 million to do a similar amount of work to the quays today.  The Department have offered £300,000 which is, to put it mildly, ridiculously low.  However, even this small sum of money, if one is to go by the most recent epistle to the harbour commissioners from the Minister, is unlikely to be spent this year.  The Minister states that the project must be financially viable and also technically viable, whatever that means.  The two quays are technically falling into the Boyne; that is certain.</P>
    <P>The Minister states that he will be deciding shortly on the allocation of State <Col N="2609" /> grant assistance for harbour works.  Provision was made in the 1985 public capital programme for a payment of a State grant of £300,000 to Drogheda Harbour Commissioners. No work was sanctioned by the Department, and so the £300,000 is still in the Estimates.  No doubt provision will be made in the 1986 public capital programme, or perhaps even in the 1987 public capital programme, but no action is likely to be taken by this Government. Meanwhile Ballast Quay and Welshman's Quay are further deteriorating.</P>
    <P>When one considers the importance of the port of Drogheda in the business and community life of Drogheda the refusal of the Minister and the Government to provide the necessary money to assist in the reconstruction of the quays is nothing short of disastrous.  Might I again stress that in a matter of great importance such as this, the £300,000 proposed is pin money?  If the Government are serious in their approach to the port of Drogheda they must immediately make the necessary money available and I call on the Minister for Finance to provide the funds which are urgently needed.</P>
    <P>This budget has been termed a holding budget, by the media, and indeed one Government Deputy privately said it would keep the show on the road.  While I understand that the purpose of the Government's approach to the budget was to try to hold the Coalition together, I do not know why it should be capable of holding it together.  When one looks at the social welfare provisions in this budget one cannot but wonder how the Labour Party which has so much to say about assisting the weaker sections of the community before the general election of November 1982, can stomach the miserable increases offered to the old, the sick and the unemployed in this budget and the fact that they are not payable until the third week in July 1986, the latest date for the payment of increases in the history of the State.  An increase has now been granted which is below the cost of living increase.  Because of the fact that the terms of this budget will result in increased inflation, the increase granted to people dependent on social welfare <Col N="2610" /> will ultimately be very much below the cost of living increase.</P>
    <P>I have often made the point that people on low incomes usually experience cost of living increases considerably above the national average because they can afford to buy in small amounts only.  This 4 per cent increase is clearly totally inadequate, and it is shocking that it will not be paid until the third week in July.  The reduction in the food subsidies in April will further increase the cost of living for those dependent on social welfare.  Life for these people is a constant struggle. Gone are the days when Fianna Fáil gave social welfare increases above the rate of the cost of living.  The new child benefit scheme is to be partially financed by the Minister by saving the increases in social welfare money normally applied to the child dependant supplements payable with the weekly benefits and assistance.</P>
    <P>Since this Government came to office their attention to the cause of the poorer sectors of the community has been abysmal. A typical example of this was when, instead of doubling the Christmas social welfare payments, the Government granted only a three-quarter increase.  All this is symptomatic of the Coalition's approach to the less well off in the community. It is easy to understand why the lower income sector wish for a change of Government.</P>
    <P>I am anxious that the Minister should explain the position of older people in respect of the 35 per cent tax on deposits. I am referring here to older people who do not normally have sufficient income which would bring them within the tax net.  There is no provision whereby they can reclaim this tax.  Many older people on fixed incomes are very perturbed about this matter.  It should be clarified by the Minister and then rectified so that these people can reclaim the withheld tax.  The method by which such a claim would be made should be simple because old people already have severe problems with complicated tax procedures.  The fact that individuals on low incomes will have 35 per cent deducted from their deposit interest and cannot reclaim it is <Col N="2611" /> totally unfair and unjust, and that position should be rectified.</P>
    <P>Voluntary hospitals are also very concerned about the retention tax.  Money which they accumulated over the years, and which they used for the development of their hospitals, is now subject to the 35 per cent tax.  Very often because of the use to which that money was put, the Department of Health were able to delay payments due to these hospitals.  It was also a fact that these hospitals spent money which they could properly have demanded from the Department out of their own funds.  They will no longer be able to do this and I strongly urge the Government to introduce some means by which such hospitals can be excluded from this retention tax.</P>
    <P>I want to again emphasise that the basic failure of this Government has been their failure to create the climate for job production, to encourage investment in industry and to stimulate the building and construction industry because we are largely dependent for increased employment on the building and construction and manufacturing industries.  This budget once again showed that the Government are unable to grasp the opportunity to help to create employment. There are now 240,000 registered as unemployed; emigration has reached serious proportions; and many young people are engaged in short term employment which provides no hope for the future.</P>
    <P>The signs are that unemployment will continue to rise.  What can only be regarded as a sleight of hand budget will clearly do nothing to help.  Families with several members unemployed are in despair.  Whole communities believe there is no hope.  A new confidence must be infused into our people, a belief in themselves, a belief that they can win through, that new employment can be created and that there is a future for our young people in this country.  This Government clearly cannot engender such confidence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is living in the seventies.  Deputy Faulkner is one of the most respected Deputies in this House, and that view is held by his opponents as well as his Fianna Fáil colleagues.  I was depressed listening to him because if well meaning, decent Deputies like Deputy Faulkner have no suggestion to make to a Government, running a country in such trouble as ours has been for the past 15 years, other than to pay out more and take in less in tax &mdash; because that is what his contribution boils down to &mdash; then there is no outlook for us and the sooner we bring in the International Monetary Fund or the Cubans, the better.</P>
      <P>The whole thrust of the Opposition approach to this budget is much like what used to be the whole thrust of the Fine Gael approach to a Fianna Fáil budget. If one had changed Deputy Faulkner's voice and appearance and changed the names of the parties in his speech, one could not have told which side the Deputy was on.  There was no philosophy in his speech.  There was not an idea which would give the impression that he understood what was dragging this country down.  I sympathise with the Deputy's complaints, and I agree with him about high levels of taxation, but the only other side of the matter which appeared to appeal to the Deputy was the opportunities for further spending.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy's constituency has taken a beating over the past few years, like every other constituency, and I agree that his was one of the best industrialised counties. Surely an experienced Deputy and former Minister such as Deputy Faulkner should have some better advice to offer the Government, even in regard to his own constituency, than to repair the quays and put more money into building? I accept from Deputy Faulkner that the quays need to be repaired, but surely there must be more to Government <Col N="2613" /> policy and rescuing an economy than pumping money into building projects. The repair of a quay is a productive investment; but merely putting up buildings, whether domestic or office buildings, is the worst form of investment if we are aiming for long term sustained job-creation.  A wave of employment would pass through the town while the building was going on but, once it is up, apart from the money which would be generated for contract window cleaners and people who may service those who live or work in the building, there is no productive long term employment.  Of the money generated a large proportion goes on imports.  Something like 50 per cent of every £ put into circulation disappears from the country.</P>
    <P>The real problem this country has faced for years is that the State is over-extended, over-exposed and overburdened. The State is over-extended into areas where it has no business.  What business has the State in broadcasting, in shipping and in virtually monopolising public transport?  These things are not necessarily part of the State's function. A State may be driven to supply these things in an emergency, or if they have some inherent social value which private enterprise cannot supply; I do not deny the necessity for State regulation, control, application of standards and so on. But the areas into which the State extends unnecessarily become part of the public service, and the notion of unsackability, and the notion that it cannot be closed down prevails.  It has taken a Minister of this Government to begin to chip away at that perception.  It is unfortunate that it should have had to be done at the expense of a very large body of excellent former employees of one of the best semi-State bodies.  But it has taken this Government at least to say there must be a stop and that we cannot, merely in the name of protecting a semi-State body, pump in unlimited quantities of money.</P>
    <P>The State is over-exposed for similar reasons &mdash; because of the expectation that there is no risk in failure, no risk for individual managers, workers or companies, that it does not matter if they <Col N="2614" /> overrun, if they have a bad purchasing policy, or if they open up an air route for which there is no commercial justification, because the State will pick up the bill at the end.  This Government have refused to bail out certain operations which were closed down, in part by the attitude of their own workforce, like some of the ones in Cork.</P>
    <P>The State is also overburdened by the immense back-pack of the public service structure which it carries and which must be paid for by a relatively small number of productive working people.</P>
    <P>These are the reasons why we have the conditions about which Deputy Faulkner complains.  The Deputy is right to stand up for his constituency, to complain about high taxation and call for investment. The reason why it is not possible for Ministers on this side who essentially agree with his sentiments, to do what he suggests is that they are weighed down with the burdens I have described.  Until we grasp that truth and deal with it, we will continue in this way no matter who is in office.</P>
    <P>This is the first time I have had the opportunity to address obliquely a member of the Progressive Democrats in the House.  I wish them the best of luck but if they get in, or play any part in a future Government, whether dominant or ancillary, if they are not able to produce some better way of dealing with the nation's affairs than budget manipulation, they too will fail.  There is no alternative to getting this State slimmed down, to getting its hands out of areas in which it ought not to have a role.  Until we face that fact, which is full of political dynamite and political thorns, we will have this situation.  All of us will come and go but the State will keep going downhill until somebody else takes over, unless we succeed in reducing the State's fat.</P>
    <P>In the budget debate last week the leader of Fianna Fáil cited the economic correspondent of the <i>Sunday Tribune,</i> Mr. Tansey, a correspondent whom I very much admire.  This correspondent had the high honour of being cited not only by Deputy Haughey but by Deputy <Col N="2615" /> O'Connell.  Deputies quoted some rather disparaging paragraphs from an article by Paul Tansey in the <i>Sunday Tribune</i> of 2 February about how the budget would result in higher taxes because the Government had succeeded in getting the deficit down a bit and, since they had not cut expenditure, the only consequence of reducing the deficit would be higher taxes.  Both Deputy Haughey and Deputy O'Connell carefully and fastidiously avoided transmitting to the House the burden of Paul Tansey's message since he has worked in the <i>Sunday Tribune</i> and before that with <i>The Irish Times,</i> which is, that State expenditure is at the root of our problems and, until that expenditure is ruthlessly tackled, we will not get anywhere.</P>
    <P>That is the core of the message implicity repeated in the article to which I have alluded.  That does not suit Deputy Haughey, Deputy O'Connell or any other Deputy who has that paragraph up his sleeve to throw at the Government; they would naturally find it disobliging to suggest expenditure cuts.  But that is the centre of that correspondent's message, and it has been so for years.  I agree with it.  If a Government do not succeed in cutting expenditure the results are as he says.  The results are something about which an Opposition can bleat, but it would be far more constructive if the Opposition, represented in the last few minutes by Deputy Faulkner, were to concentrate on the central problem in this area.</P>
    <P>So unaccustomed have we become to expenditure cuts that when the Government try to economise, when they say we simply cannot afford this or that, a frisson of horror runs through the country, naturally experienced at its strongest by the people immediately affected.  That sentiment, that we cannot afford something, is heard often enough in the family, but not from the State or from those who work for the State, as nothing is too good for the State.  Look at the uproar we have about teachers' pay.  I do not want to appear unsympathetic to the teachers. Perhaps by an accident of chronology <Col N="2616" /> they are in the front line.  Like so many ranks of infantry in the 18th or 19th centuries coming up to the front after reloading they just happen to be in the line with their demand at the very moment when the Government have come to the conclusion that they cannot meet any more demands of these dimensions and were driven to invoke, as they perfectly legally invoked, the clause in the arbitration agreement which permits this House to overrule the arbitrator's award.</P>
    <P>Naturally, the teachers are outraged that this should be done to them.  It is only an accident of chronology that they should be the ones to suffer first, but certainly they will not be the last, and they will have company in their outrage. What fall-out that will have for the Government, you, Sir, can predict as easily as I.  There is no point in being in Government if we are to be always worrying about the next election, and some Government sooner or later will have to take the plunge and do unpopular things, one after the other, if we are to get back into some sort of shape where we can relieve the burdens which we are now piling on to our children's, if not on to our grandchildren's, shoulders apart from our own.</P>
    <P>You see, Sir, the outrage about the rationalisation which the Ministers for Health and Education respectively are trying to bring into the hospital and training college scene.  I will say nothing about the way these matters were handled.  I do not mean to disparage the motives or the points of view of any of the people who have written to me about one or other of these topics.  All I am saying is that these are unpopular, disobliging measures which I am quite certain both Ministers would be politically glad to have been able to avoid, but which they have faced up to carrying through; and we can hear the upror that there is about them.  If you quantify what is going to be saved by withholding the teachers' award, by phasing out Carysfort and by closing down the handful of not very big hospitals which are in the plans of the Minister for Health, you are talking about a sum of money which is only scratching at the <Col N="2617" /> surface of the boulder in the way of economic progress.  A small chip has been knocked off that boulder, and think of the agony, the political bloodletting which even the removal of that chip has caused.</P>
    <P>This Government could easily go out over an accumulation of these things, and if the other side get in they could easily go out over it, if they ever have the guts to do the sort of things which are being done here now.  However, only by this means will economic salvation be possible for everybody, including the teachers and the staff and students of Carysfort.  It is only by economies that the students of Carysfort, who now feel outraged about having their institution closed down, can be given some better hope of future employment than they now have.  I am sorry that they too are in the firing line.  I am sorry that the staffs of hospitals, who I know have worked devotedly down the years, feel that they are in the firing line and that the small towns in which the hospitals are situated and where they have come to be regarded as something like a local factory are in the firing line.  They are only the first casualties in what is going to be a long and difficult war which could damage all of us.  But unless that war is fought and won we can be fiddling and tinkering here with budgets well into the next century, for as long as this State exists &mdash; and it may not exist all that much longer if we cannot get new ideas &mdash; and we will not make any significant improvement.</P>
    <P>The correspondent who was being quoted here triumphantly by the Opposition in the week following 2 February wrote another article on 9 February in which he praised, rather grimly, the Government for the cuts that I have just been describing.  He said that they were rather clumsily handled and that was because the Government had not much practice in doing what they are now doing, namely, making a few decisions; no more committees, no more commissions, we have had enough consultations, we are just going to make decisions.  That is what every Government will have to do from now on, and I do not care which <Col N="2618" /> parties provide or support them, if this State is to survive.</P>
    <P>I could scarcely believe my eyes when I read in the papers the day after Deputy Haughey spoke here that he had said &mdash; I think it was even given the status of a saying of the week somewhere &mdash; that &ldquo;what we needed to get away from here was not civil war politics but Victorian economics and financial precepts&rdquo;.  If Mr. Gladstone could be recreated and brought back to earth and given a look at what this State has been doing with itself for the last 17 years, since I first came into Leinster House and before that, would he recognise any similarity between the philosophy underlying our activities and those which guided him? What would Mr. Gladstone have said about a State which annually runs a collossal deficit on current account and has been doing so increasingly since 1972?</P>
    <P>I will go further and leave Mr. Gladstone and his whiskers out of it.  What would Deputy Haughey when he was Minister for Finance have said about that?  Deputy Haughey was Minister for Finance for a couple of years up to 1970. He never produced a budget here which provided for a current account deficit, and he would not have been let do so by his party as they then were, even if he had wished to do so.  We do not need to go back to Mr. Gladstone for the days of a bit of rectitude in these matters.  We do not have to go back beyond 1972.</P>
    <P>What would Mr. Disraeli have thought of a country like this with £20 billion of a national debt?  Is that Victorian?  Where are the heavy tasselled plush curtains and horsehair sofas behind the philosophy which ran up that kind of public debt here over the last half generation?</P>
    <P>Where is the Victorian philosophy in the near-doubling of the numbers of the Civil Service in the last 30 years?  These 30 years started out with the old post office pen rusting on the blotting paper and ended up with micro-chips.  These 30 years have seen service employment shed, halved, decimated in every other area which was private, but not in the State which, until the Minister, Deputy Boland, got his axe to it, kept expanding <Col N="2619" /> its workforce as though it was a galactic explosion somewhere out in the universe. It appeared to be expanding at a colossal speed in all directions simultaneously for no visible reason.  There were all kinds of office aids, calculating aids and computerisations available to the public service in the eighties which should have made additional recruitment redundant.  I do not mean that people should have been made redundant, but according as people retired the slack could have been taken up by all these glittering machines.  Of course, they have the glittering machines anyway, because the poor old State can pay for them.  There is no shortage of glittering equipment; but the people working the equipment have not reduced in number, at least until Deputy Boland got to work, for which no doubt we will pay a political price &mdash; I have no doubt that there are people in my constituency who voted for me last time who will not do so next time because of the Government's approach to the Civil Service &mdash; I cannot see anything too muttonchop-whiskery about that development.</P>
    <P>What is Victorian about the shape of our health services?  The institutions themselves, in some cases, may be Victorian all right, but the central feature of our health service here is the presence of a large number of relatively inefficient hospitals providing nothing except ease of access for visits for relations at the expense of better services in fewer locations, at an immense public cost.  What is Victorian about that?  I cannot see that any niggling Victorian miser has been at work there.  There is no Scrooge in a stovepipe hat behind the design of our present health services.</P>
    <P>What about the wild reckless waste around us every day of the week &mdash; as though the State were an ill-designed robot filled with some kind of fluid, leaking at every step as it clanks across the floor?</P>
    <P>I use this only as a symbol for other things &mdash; I am perfectly certain that there are white elephants to be accounted for on all sides; we have a culpable part in the history of the thing, too &mdash; but about the Knock Airport syndrome?  Was that <Col N="2620" /> Victorian?  What about the huge overruns on projects like NET and public building? What about the fact that there is no proper financial management, no proper criterion of value for money in the individual Departments?  The accounting officer has remained, as he was before 1922, secretary of the Department.  Once upon a time he might have been able to keep an eye, in the humble days of the twenties, on whether too many public servants were going away with the Minister to a conference or something of that kind.  It is now completely beyond such a man, who is burdened by all kinds of other business to keep an eye on whether the offices are unnecessarily ordering new equipment or unnecessarily expanding into a new building.  Where is the Victorianism there?</P>
    <P>What about the local government councillors paid for &mdash; in spite of all the bleating of Ministers for the Environment, largely or mostly if not always &mdash; out of the public purse on their expeditions to international conferences on this or that subject at which the Irish contingent not infrequently outnumbers the rest of the world put together.  It was possible for one of my colleagues to report to me on his return from one such conference that the centre of Oslo, the night before the conference was to open, presented the aspect of O'Connell Street on the night before an All-Ireland Final.  That is not my image &mdash; I do not want to be accused of colurful speech in this regard &mdash; that is the image of one of my colleagues, sitting at table with me in the restaurant, describing where he had just come from.  On my oath, he so described the centre of Oslo on the evening before a conference on high rise buildings or something of that kind.  There was a genial Irish presence, courtesy of the Irish taxpayer.</P>
    <P>What about the Talbot deal and these election-time strokes?  Is there any chance that the dear Queen might have authorised such a thing, or any of her Ministers from first to last &mdash; Lord Melbourne, Lord Palmerston, Lord Sailsbury?  Deputy Haughey and his team will need to think up a few more homely <Col N="2621" /> epithets before they will make an accurate point along those lines again.</P>
    <P>We are told by the same Deputy that forestry and fisheries need to be expanded and I completely agree with him.  It has been sticking out a mile that the Irish climate is suitable for forestry, uniquely so in western Europe.  The EC have a shortfall of native grown timber and will have an increasing shortfall.  We obviously have opportunities.  The same goes for our seas and for fisheries, both sea and inland; there is no question about it.  But there is nothing new about that. People have been talking about forestry and fisheries since the time of perhaps Thomas Davis, but certainly since the time of Arthur Griffith.  The reason for these things not getting off the ground is that the State designed itself as being the prime mover.  We had no fishery tradition and virtually no forestry tradition, and the State certainly has a certain role in getting the thing going.  As I said before, the State is the old sow to whom everybody comes crying when anything needs to be done.  Since these are both potentially prosperous areas, what is to stop the State from trying to make sure that while it is not over-exposed or asked to be constantly putting up money and perhaps throwing it away, private capital is mobilised into those areas?</P>
    <P>I seem to have come up here against something which is hard to understand in the Fianna Fáil approach.  Although in one breath they talk about how profit must not be a dirty word and people must be allowed to make money, in the next breath they appear to speak as though the State must keep its monopolistic involvement in certain areas.  I am going to bore the ears off Members by reading some motions on the Order Paper for a different purpose, but there is a motion on the Order Paper at this moment from Deputy Daly in regard to State involvement in forestry and the necessity to keep private capital out of it.  I hope I am not paraphrasing him unfairly.  He does not put it in quite those words, but if I turn out to have been unfair to him, I shall apologise.  It can be read as meaning that, <Col N="2622" /> and I read him as meaning that.  Where is the reason for that or the justification?</P>
    <P>Look at CIE.  Everybody complains about CIE and public patience with it is exhausted.  However, if anybody mentions de-nationalising CIE, even experimentally or in strips, even in little sectors or segments as I have often done here, there are cries of protest from my own dear colleagues in the Labour Party first but from everybody else as well.  Nobody wants to grasp that political nettle. Nobody wants to take on 27 or 28 unions, or whatever number it is, which represent the relatively small, by world standards, staff of CIE.  Does the House realise that for the pleasure of having CIE, every adult in this country is subscribing £1 per week?  If one were to say every man, women and child, it would be obviously something less.  In round figures, whether employed or unemployed, every adult is paying £1 in taxation every week of the year.  It has to be paid for him by someone else if he is not able to pay it himself. That is his contribution to the CIE deficit.</P>
    <P>That deficit must be got off the taxpayers' backs.  There is no justification for it.  There are certain dimensions of the public transport system which private enterprise will not want to take on; I recognise that.  I realise their social importance and I accept that the State run transport company must keep them going or ought to keep as many going as possible.  However, the vast bulk of the CIE operation could be privatised.  I do not say that it should be done overnight in one sweep, but it should be done experimentally, a little at a time and see how it does.  Let us see if there is a public demand for more, or if there is a fair balance between the profit made by the man taking on the sector of transport and the service to the public.</P>
    <P>Perhaps this is not the best test, but it is not the worst &mdash; to look down the Order Paper and relate Fianna Fáil's appearances on the Order Paper with the cries for lower taxation.  It would make a cat laugh to see the discordance in philosophy, if I may call it that.  I am taking no account of the motions which have already been debated because these are <Col N="2623" /> off the Order Paper, for example, last week when the Fianna Fáil Party, in an excess of sloothering which must have almost overtaken their own record, put down a motion which did not actually commit them to paying the 10 per cent themselves but allowed the teachers to believe that it did.  The Government were being called upon to &ldquo;settle on the basis of paying the full 10 per cent.&rdquo;  If words mean anything any longer, that presumably means that Fianna Fáil would acquiesce our raising another £110 million of taxation or our borrowing another £110 million abroad.  The taxation might be met, let us say, by re-imposing the I per cent income levy which the Minister removed some two weeks ago.  Do they advocate that?  Some of these motions are a little stale and I apologise for boring the House with them, but this represents Fianna Fáils input into Private Members' Time.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCarthy wants Dáil Eíreann to call on the Government to provide a replacement industry at the Weatherglaze factories in Cahir and Dublin.

Deputies Hugh Byrne, John Browne, Seán Bryrne, Willie O'Dea and John Wilson want us to call on the Government to retain passenger and freight services on the Rosslare Harbour-Limerick and the Rosslare Harbour-Dublin railway lines.  A whole raft of Deputies have the following motion down:</P>
      <P>That, in view of the very serious difficulties confronting traders and business people in the border counties, because of the economic and fiscal policies pursued by the Government which result in many millions of pounds of consumer expenditure being diverted to the six counties with disastrous consequences on business and employment in the border areas, Dáil Éireann calls on the Government to reduce substantially the rate of VAT and excise duties immediately, in order to alleviate this situation.</P>
      <P>I do not want to appear to be lacking in sympathy with the motives behind these calls but I am drawing attention to the consequences of listening to them. Deputy Ned O'Keeffe wants us to call on the Government to introduce a special financial rescue package to assist family farms which are in severe financial difficulty and which have been the backbone of Irish society for generations.  He also wants the Dáil to call on the Government to make financial incentives available to the Irish pig industry similar to those which have been made available in France.</P>

    <P>Deputy Noonan <i>(Limerick West)</i> wants the Dáil to call on the Government to provide, as a matter or urgency, out of Exchequer funds money for the further continuation of the AI and lime subsidy schemes, following the termination of the EC schemes, because of serious repercussions and so on.  Deputy O'Hanlon wants us to reverse the decision to close the maternity unit in Monaghan Hospital. Deputies Brendan Daly and Pat &ldquo;Cope&rdquo; Gallagher want us to deplore the failure of the Government to provide the revenue, resources and manpower to the regional fisheries boards to fulfil their <Col N="2625" /> statutory responsibilities to inland fisheries conservation and development. Deputy Seán McCarthy wants the Dáil to call on the Government to grant a double payment at Christmas to all long term unemployed persons and to the families of those on short term unemployment benefits.  A raft of Deputies want us to promote the Border region for industrial development, naturally with money.  Another raft of Deputies want the Dáil to call on the Government, in view of the trading disadvantage experienced by manufacturers of concrete products in the Border areas, to direct the IDA to grant-aid concrete product manufacturers in the Republic.  No problem; the IDA have bags of money. There is no difficulty at all about getting them to shell out money.  It is their money; they make it themselves on the side.</P>
    <P>Deputy Daly wants the Dáil to call on the Government to &ldquo;prepare and implement a comprehensive plan for the full scale development of Irish forests and reject any proposal for the exploitation of this national resource by private, commercial or financial institutions&rdquo;.  Is that a misprint?  Could that be Deputy Mervyn Taylor or one of his colleagues?  No, it is tabled by Deputy Daly who comes from County Clare, where I presume the profit motive is as respectable as it is anywhere else in the country or, if it is not, it is the first I have heard of it and I know quite a few Clare people.  Is Deputy Daly telling us that he would regard it as contrary to Fianna Fáil policy for private interests to go into forestry?  Where are we going in this country?</P>

      <P>I will not weary the House any more.  I appreciate that in the heat of the moment a party may consider a topical issue and a Deputy may ask to get a few pounds for this or that project resulting in a motion being put on the Order Paper.  But the cumulative effect of that, as far as representing to the people what the philosophy of the main Opposition is, is deadly.  I am short of sympathy for the idea of subsidising a fleadh ceoil at public expense, but I am not short of sympathy for most of the motions I have mentioned.  I can see the human problems <Col N="2627" /> lurking behind them and Deputies opposite are correct in sticking up for their own people and doing their best for them, but there is a grotesque discordance between the cumulative effect of these demands on the one hand, and the cries and whingeing about cut-backs in State expenditure and high taxation on the other.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Kennedy in replying to the Minister's statement said that &ldquo;a budget can and should be an element of economic policy&rdquo;.  Nobody will disagree with that but I put the emphasis on the word &ldquo;an&rdquo;.  Our problem is that we rely too much on budgetary mechanisms, and that a sort of artificial hyped-up expectation emerges in the weeks before a budget about the Minister and his plans.  Naturally, we have to copy our dear neighbours across the water in even the smallest respects, and Ministers here do not disdain being photographed with a little box &mdash; a little &ldquo;battered dispatch box&rdquo; as the English call it &mdash; on the table before they come to the House to deliver the budget secrets.  Without meaning to be profane or blasphemous I should like to state that we tend to look on that box as a type of secular tabernacle out of which when opened some salvation will emerge.  I hope that figure of speech will not appear out of place or offensive, but we tend to encourage ourselves, and the media encourage us to look at a budget in that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is time we understood that there is a limit to what a budget can do.  The budget operates within constraints.  There are a lot of images of speech one could provide for the budget but it is constrained with <Col N="2628" /> the situation which preceded it.  What has preceded budgets here in recent years is that before the Minister takes out his pencil to do any sums he knows that roughly 35p in every pound he takes in the following year will go out the window in the servicing of our national debt.  That sum represents something like the entire take from PAYE, if not more.  Members should think of the agony of the PAYE sector, of the complaints they make to their TDs and everybody else about the fact that so little is left of their pay.  Every ha'penny of the PAYE take goes out on paying interest on the debts we ran up previously.  In recent years the debt has run up for current and not capital purposes.</P>
    <P>The next thing that constrains the budget is that the State has this immense army of State servants, equivalent to several military divisions, indeed Army Corps, and all the housing, heating, equipment, leave and pension provisions that go with them.  I am not saying that it is an extravagant army by comparison, million for million of the population, with what we find in other European countries. As a matter of fact, it is not extravagant, on that standard; but it is extravagant in relation to what we can afford to pay for.  The people of Luxembourg, Belgium and Holland, with far higher industrial and agricultural productivity than us, may be able to afford a well-upholstered public service bearing a high ratio to the total working population, but we cannot afford it.  I do not mean to say something offensive to the public service.  I have never meant that although I have often been interpreted in that sense.  I want to disclaim that absolutely.  I have the highest regard for individual members of the public service. What I am saying is that there are more of them than we can pay decently.  If there were fewer of them we could afford to pay them better.  That is something that is not said often.  Undoubtedly some individuals in the public service ought to be paid more.</P>
    <P>These are the constraints within which a Minister for Finance must operate.  He is in a similar position to the asthmatic <Col N="2629" /> who takes part in a series of swimming competitions.  He may change his swimming style and opt for the breast stroke, the side stroke, the back stroke, the crawl or the over arm paddle, but the change will not make much difference to his performance in competing with someone who does not suffer from this unfortunate affliction because, regardless of how he swims, not enough oxygen will be delivered to his muscles.  That is the kind of problem the management of this State has had to deal with for years.  We are not getting enough financial leeway or possibilities.  Far too many of our possibilities are already pre-empted.  The money must go to keeping our public service afloat and to keeping our public debt serviced.  There is so little left for anything else that it is no wonder the Minister must try to make a budget paragraph out of some pittance given to some little enterprise here or there.</P>
    <P>What is needed is a mechanism which is different from a budgetary mechanism and which is not so much a mechanism as an approach.  If Deputy Molloy's party are first in evolving such an approach, good luck to them.  That would be an approach which would concentrate on a level far deeper than any level that could be reached by a budget.  It would be to the budgetary mechanism what a deep plough is to a harrow.  It would be an approach that would try to reach levels of this country's existence which ultimately will determine its performance.  I am talking about the kind of approach that cannot be reached merely by bleating about the provision of a few pounds here or there or about some tax incentive.</P>
    <P>What is central is the whole question of our approach to the world, our knowledge of the world and of the necessity to sell our produce on world markets.  The State cannot help unless and until it sweats down the burdens which prevent it from offering more than a token gesture while at the same time imposing a level of taxation which damages industry and agriculture.  Attitudes must be changed partly by education, as I have said here so often before.</P>
    <P>If Deputy Haughey were to say this I <Col N="2630" /> would agree with him: Irish children grow up conditioned by attitudes to the world which emerged here in the society of the 19th century and at a time when the only secondary schooling available could be availed of only by the middle class.  That has left people in Ireland conditioned towards white collar jobs, preferably within the Civil Service.  It left us with the kind of situation we had two years ago when 14,000 school leavers submitted to examination and were solemnly examined by the Civil Service Commissioners for posts as Post Office clerks.  The public service must be filled; but in that instance the number of applicants represented one third of the entire school-leaving cohort in that year.  I just happened to hear about it because it was mentioned before the Committee on Public Expenditure. Perhaps the situation in respect of the filling of other posts, junior executive posts and so on, was similar.  However, the point is that there was the ludicrous procedure of examining 14,000 applicants with only six appointments being made.  That reflects an attitude which is not the kind of attitude on which industrial, agricultural or commercial success is built.</P>
    <P>I would be in favour, not of making this an examinable subject, but of trying to inject into our educational process at some stage, say, for 14 year olds upwards, an understanding of basic economics, an understanding of basic marketing problems and techniques, of basic industrial and agricultural techniques, of the facts of mass production and economies of scale, and all those other factors which affect our prosperity.  I would be in favour of trying to orient children more towards factors that will provide prosperity for them and eventually for their families, rather than gearing them for positions that will merely be a burden on the productive sector.  I do not mean that that is morally culpable.  I am talking about the financial effects of it.</P>
    <P>While I am on the subject of education, something I have advocated here often is relevant in this context, that is, that something must be done urgently to improve the linguistic capabilities of our <Col N="2631" /> school children and of people involved in education.  The immense market of the Chinese People's Republic is now beginning to open up.  By the end of the century that will be a market of 1,200 million people and they will have three times the purchasing power individually than is the case now.  This represents a golden opportunity for countries like ours that are not burdened with an imperial past. From that point of view even the Japanese are starting from behind and yet the Japanese are in the grip of China fever. A smile crosses our faces when the word, &ldquo;Chinaman&rdquo; is mentioned, but, to their credit, CTT have understood and realised the importance of this immense market. Unfortunately, this has not percolated to where there is a necessity for it &mdash; into the educational establishments and the Department &mdash; in such a way that would ensure some core of people who would be able to deal with the Chinese.</P>
    <P>While there may be a couple of rookeries in the most academic and remote parts of the arts faculties of UCD or Trinity in which someone or other is learning a little Chinese or Japanese, and even then the learning would be confined to literature and poetry, there is no teaching of these languages for commercial purposes. Indeed, there is barely any teaching of continental European languages.  Last year only 1.3 per cent of Irish school-leavers presented themselves for examination in German, despite the fact that Germany is by far our biggest trading partner in the Common Market, is the most powerful economy within reach of us, is sympathetic and friendly towards us and will provide an environment in which there will be huge numbers of job opportunities for Irish people in the years ahead.  The Minister, for whom I have deep respect, presides over a Victorian Department, a Department that must be taken by the scruff of the neck and dealt with.  I trust she will not resent my making the suggestion behind her back and without notice that if Carysfort Training College must be discontinued in its present function because there will not be a need in the future for the same <Col N="2632" /> number of teachers, a reasoning I agree with, it should be converted into a college of language training &mdash; I do not mean merely for academic, aesthetic or artistic purposes, but unashamedly and totally for commercial purposes so as to train a generation of people for the opportunities that lie ahead.  Those who could afford to pay for that education should pay, while those who could not afford it but who had a gift in that direction should be given generous assistance by way of scholarships.  We should have a language school, unembarrassed by academic pretentions, but merely to ensure that a wide band of young people will be given the opportunity to acquire languages.  One in every ten or 11 is gifted in that direction, and we must help them to use that talent so that we may be provided with a core of people who can mediate our message, commercially and otherwise, to the outside world and bring back from that outside world what they have learned there. That is all part of what I have said here often, about doing away with the fetish of emigration, and ensuring that we think more in terms of migration, and of cyclically achieving experience of the outer world by way of contact with it.</P>
    <P>We must think, too, in more radical terms about local government reform. The present local government structure is an expensive and scandalous waste of time.  I shall not be invidious by mentioning individual instances, but I regard the system as delivering to the people nothing worthwhile.  A radical reform of local government should be such as to deliver on the creation in individual areas of the country of a process whereby private capital would be matched &mdash; not exceeded or pumped up by &mdash; £ for £ of State investment.  That would create the co-operative structure which would give people in those localities the sense of being able to command their own futures, judge their own case and monitor their success.</P>
    <P>I felt I could applaud Deputy Haughey on one point in his speech, when he spoke of the reservoir of ideas in the country. He was quite right to point that out.  &ldquo;My colleagues and I&rdquo;, he said, &ldquo;have become <Col N="2633" /> increasingly conscious of the fact that in practically every parish in Ireland there is an individual or a group with an idea for development&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>If that is so, and I accept it is likely to be so, the way to get that idea off the ground is to create under the name of local government some structure or framework of a co-operative kind to which people locally will contribute, not merely their votes but their money &mdash; invest their time and effort in local enterprises including the promotion and realisation of the kind of ideas Deputy Haughey has in mind.</P>
    <P>The last of these themes I want to deal with is the need to do something about the larger scale reform of our political structures.  I will not dwell on it because it is not central to the budget, but it is relevant to it to the extent that many people have a low opinion of political life and that gives them the excuse to discount or dismiss or belittle or ignore messages which politicians try to transmit to them.  If we try to preach wage restraint we are instantly met with the cry, &ldquo;What about your own pensions, your own pay, your own 19 per cent&rdquo;?  Long experience of this has taught me that it is a waste of time trying to argue with people about these things, or trying to justify the parts of this structure which are justifiable &mdash; some are and some are not.</P>
    <P>We owe it to ourselves and the profession of politics to try to look at the thing from top to bottom and to reform it.  I do not mean an element of it, such as pensions and salaries.  They are not simple matters and it is not right to run along with the crowd because the crowd very often have not understood the basis on which calculations are made.  There is the 19 per cent, for instance, which represented the accumulation of three rounds, the first two of which had been foregone voluntarily, so that when the 19 per cent came &mdash; without retrospection, let me add &mdash; it looked like people handing it out to themselves.  It looked bad. Perhaps it should not have been done at the very outset of this Government's term, it should have been done at some other time or in some other way.  In <Col N="2634" /> future, Governments will be very slow to forego pay rounds to TDs and Senators which are due.</P>
    <P>Whatever the rights and wrongs of that, people will not buy the system we have.  They do not believe in it, and it gives them a stick to beat us with.  Above all, it gives them a reason for discounting what we say to them.  We will have to bring some reason into the system of payment of salaries and pensions, I hope in such a way that nobody will be at a loss, but in a way which the people can see as reasonable.  Perhaps we ought to have something common in other walks of life, an incremental salary scale for Deputies.  Perhaps this suggestion is not feasible, but it is important that the public would understand the point.  They would understand that a Deputy who has served here for 20 years has probably foregone opportunities in his business or profession. It might be fair to see that reflected in a somewhat higher rate of pay than in the case of a man who came in only at the last election.  I do not absolutely advocate such a system, but it would be one way to do it which the public would accept more easily than they are willing to accept the present system.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the Seanad is in need of reform, though the matter does not surface so often.  I do not think that at the moment the Seanad does the type of job which the large sum of money spent on it ought to call for.  The system we have of local government and councillors is defective in many ways and collectively brings the whole system into disrepute, between the skites and section 4 resolutions and all the rest of it.  Those things only help to convince people that those in public life are out merely to look after themselves and their immediate electoral or other interests, and not to do anything for the development of the country at large.</P>
    <P>We must do things like these if we are to give ourselves relief from financial asthma in the long run, and from the endless cycle of depressions which settle on this House with budgets year in, year out, whichever Government is in.</P>
    <P>I have just time to protest about one <Col N="2635" /> thing in the budget.  I feel it must be due to an oversight.  I cannot believe that the Minister for Finance really intended to take from payments of deposit interest 35p in the £, non-refundable, even in the case of people who are not in the tax net at all, even after counting the deposit interest.  I will not believe that is his intention. Whip or no Whip, I would find it very hard to support any such measure if it surfaces in that form in the Finance Bill.  I am not threatening anything, I am not trying to make trouble &mdash; perhaps I have not understood what the Minister's intention is &mdash; but if his intention is that people not now liable for tax at the standard rate &mdash; people whose total income is below the threshold at which taxation starts and who, merely because their income takes the form of deposit interest, must now pay at the standard rate &mdash; I could not accept the justice of that. Deputy Faulkner adverted to it briefly and I fully agree with him.</P>
    <P>To do that would be to treat a bank deposit as though it was an excisable commodity. It is like applying the law of excise in the area of income tax.  The law of excise does not distinguish between the means of people who buy a bottle of whiskey, or make a bet, or allow themselves the other things on which excise is chargeable.  I would resist very much the idea that it should be brought into this area, at any rate so far as it concerns people in this category.</P>
    <P>I do not complain about the application of this generally, I would not even complain about its application to people in that area provided there was to be a mechanism for an immediate, speedy refund to people who would not be in the income tax category at all.  There is every justification for the system of taxing bank deposit interest at source.  That point was clearly made by the economics commentator I cited earlier from <i>The Sunday Tribune</i>.  He pointed out that a comparison of takings from deposit interest with the amount of money actually in bank deposits last year, would lead one to believe there is widespread evasion.  If <Col N="2636" /> so, I would support the Minister's intention to check it, and if this is the best way to do it I will support him; but it must not be at the cost of taking money away from people who are in the poorer section who otherwise would not be liable for tax.  I sincerely hope it is an oversight due to haste or to a drafting difficulty, and that we will see a different shape on that proposal when it emerges in the Finance Bill.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not my intention to range widely over the whole economic spectrum of national life, although there is a temptation. The budget is neither fish nor flesh It addresses none of the major problems confronting the country.  It offers no hope for unemployment.  Indeed, since the budget the numbers of unemployed have risen to exceed 240,000 for the first time. Inroads to the unemployment problem will not be made this year.  The Government anticipate that the numbers out of work this year will average at 240,000, <Col N="2637" /> an increase of 9,000 on the 1985 jobless level.  Things are getting so bad that the Department of Social Welfare are having to seek new premises to accommodate huge numbers of people who have no choice but to sign on for unemployment benefit.  In Galway a new large office had to be obtained to accommodate the number of women signing on because otherwise they would have been left queueing in the street.  The old employment office at the Claddagh, which served the needs of the area since the foundation of the State, is no longer big enough and another office is about to be acquired by the Department to accommodate the extraordinary numbers of people out of work.</P>
    <P>While not holding out any hope to the unemployed, neither does the budget take substantial action to correct the continuing crisis in public finances.  The budget deficit will still represent £7.40 out of every £100 of national expenditure this year even if the Government's budgetary estimate turns out to be correct. Exchequer borrowing will remain at over £2,000 million.  Total borrowing by the public sector will be equivalent to £1 out of every £7 spent by the community this year.  After three years of Coalition Government we have been brought to a point where one out of every five members of the labour force are out of work and the Government continue to borrow annually an amount equal to one-seventh of the total spending in the whole economy.</P>
    <P>How has this appalling impasse come about?  What has brought us to this economic catastrophe?  The answer is that this Coalition, embracing diametrically opposed views, have tried to serve two masters.  Policies lurch left, right, then left again and the Government do not appear to know their own mind. There is not a sense of unity or purpose. The Government do not appear to know where they are going and they are travelling more in hope than in expectation.  In view of these internal stresses and strains in the Cabinet, is it any wonder if a weak and unstable consensus emerges on economic policy?  By trying to serve too <Col N="2638" /> many masters the Government have ended up serving no one.  It is this lack of common purpose which gives this budget, like its predecessors, a half-hearted appearance.  It addresses the crisis in the public finances, makes marginal improvements, gives a nod in favour of taxpayers and then takes the benefit back again with the other hand, all in a half-hearted way.  These signs betray a Government exhausted by internal disagreements on economic policy.</P>
    <P>This is a tired Government as shown by their inability to cut spending in spite of the fact that a reduction in current expenditure remains one of their central policy objectives.  Yet again this year the volume of current public spending will increase.  The increase is not due to factors outside the Government's control, such as rising international rates or adverse movements of exchange rates. The increase in current Government spending is as a result of factors within the control and responsibility of the Government.  The result of continuing laxity in expenditure is another increase in the burden borne by income taxpayers. In the fortnight that has elapsed since the budget was introduced, it has gradually emerged that the tax concessions supposedly granted in the budget are cosmetic. The speed of the Minister's hand deceived the public eye, but not for long.</P>
    <P>I will give an example which illustrates the Minister's artfulness in full.  The Minister said the budget would restructure taxation of financial institutions and income from financial assets in order to remove major anomalies and inequities within the system, while raising sufficient additional revenue to reduce personal income tax by a total of £121 million, or over twice the amount which would be required for indexation.  That statement is the essence of the budget and it requires careful examination.  Where is the £121 million which the Minister says he has given to income taxpayers?  An examination of the figures shows that this supposed concession disappears into thin air when subjected to careful examination.</P>
    <P>Last year the Exchequer raised a total of £2,177 million from income tax and <Col N="2639" /> the 1 per cent income levy.  The White Paper on receipts and expenditure published on 25 January estimates the yield from various taxes in 1986 if the 1985 tax bands and allowances remain in force during 1986.  It shows the position that would have obtained had there not been concessions, an allowance for inflation, or an increase in tax bands and allowances and had there not been a reduction in tax rates.  On that basis the White Paper shows that £2,385 million would have been raised in income tax and the 1 per cent income levy during 1986.  Yet in the budget, the combined yield from income tax and the 1 per cent income levy in 1986 is now estimated by the Government at £2,390 million, that is, £213 million or 9.8 per cent more than the Government raised through income tax and the income tax levy in 1985 and £5 million more than would have been raised if there had been no change in the income tax code in the 1986 budget.</P>
    <P>The Minister may argue that he abolished the 1 per cent income levy, but he simply failed to renew what was always considered a temporary levy, a levy which required to be reintroduced annually. The Minister may argue that the composition of the income tax take has changed, that ordinary people benefit and that it is an accident that the taxation of financial institutions is included in the income tax take.  Despite the Government's best efforts to disguise the fact, financial institutions will not pay the £75 million tax on deposit interests, but ordinary people who pay PAYE on their earnings.  The grim reality is that there is not taxation of the financial institutions in this budget.  The additional taxation has been loaded on to people who save.</P>
    <P>The people will pay tax on deposit interest, not the banks, the building societies, the ACC, the ICC, the Trustees Savings Banks or the Post Office.  There may well be a case for the introduction of such measures for levelling the playing field between competing financial institutions who wish to attract deposits, but there is not a case for pretending that the tax will be borne by those institutions <Col N="2640" /> rather than the general saving public. This attempt by the Government to turn away from the consequences of their actions could lead to serious social and physical hazards for our old people, particularly those who reside alone in outlying areas.</P>
    <P>In recent years we have witnessed with mounting horror increasingly frequent and brutal attacks on old people in the west, many of them in my constituency. The clear and singular motive for these attacks was the robbing of any cash which these old people might have kept at home.  At the best of times older people are suspicious of financial institutions and they do not like others to know their business.  When these attacks commenced, great efforts were made by many in the community to encourage older people to lodge their money in a safe place, the local bank, building society or post office, for self-protection. At that time a facility was allowed whereby a single person could earn £70 in deposit interest from a bank tax free each year and a married couple with a joint account could earn £140 in interest annually, also tax free.  This facility was later reduced to £50 and £100 respectively and now the budget proposes to abolish these tax free concessions and to levy tax at 35 per cent on any deposit interest earned.</P>
    <P>The retention tax as proposed will be levied regardless of whether the older person is liable for income tax on his or her other income.  There are no means whereby an old person who has insufficient income to pay income tax can reclaim the 35 per cent retention tax.  The tax is unfair, inequitable and discriminates against the poor.  It stands in sharp contrast to the treatment accorded to companies who are allowed to offset retention tax against their bills for corporation tax.  Moreover, it could have extremely adverse social consequences in isolated areas and will act as a further deterrent to old people lodging their money with financial institutions.</P>
    <P>Increased sums of money kept in the <Col N="2641" /> home could occasion another major outbreak of those violent and appalling robberies we have seen in the recent past.  It is not enough for the Minister to argue that there are still State saving schemes available into which people can place their money and receive deposit interest tax free.  It is all very well for those who can afford to wait but all these schemes make it difficult for people to get at their money in a hurry without sacrificing interest. They suit a certain type of saver but they do not suit those who want to draw on their savings regularly.  For reasons of fairness and decency and to ease the fears of older people, I urge the Minister to look again at this section of the budget. It would not be beyond the competence of his Department to devise a scheme whereby those aged 65 and over could place up to £25,000 on deposit in their local post office without suffering the 35 per cent tax on the meagre interest they would earn.</P>
    <P>I want to quote the following passage from the Budget Statement made by the Minister last year under the heading &ldquo;Savings Relief for Older People&rdquo;:</P>
    <P>I am introducing a change in the tax relief for certain deposit interest to encourage older citizens to put their savings in safe keeping.  For taxpayers who qualify for the age allowance, that is, taxpayers over 65 years of age, the present ceilings for tax relief on deposit interest are being doubled.  This new arrangement will apply in respect of interest otherwise assessable for 1985-86.</P>
    <P>In this year's budget the Minister has gone completely against what he saw as necessary and desirable last year.  Many will wonder why the Minister and the Government have singled out the elderly for this attack.  The fairest thing would be to allow a refund of the 35 per cent interest tax where depositors had no tax liability, particularly in the case of the elderly.</P>
    <P>The construction industry has been deliberately targeted by the Government. Certainly few sectors could claim to have been as severely affected by <Col N="2642" /> Coalition policies as this one.  Employment and production have been in serious decline and the withdrawal of certain investment incentives and the addition of extra taxation on output such as the 100 per cent increase in VAT, has contributed to and greatly accelerated the decline resulting in a loss of employment for up to 50 per cent of the construction industry workforce.  It is a terrible indictment of the Government's policies. Thousands of construction workers are now on building sites all over the United States and other countries with the resulting break-up of family life.  In relation to new housing, there has been a decline of about 15 per cent in new work in 1985, the biggest drop in new house construction that I have witnessed in my 21 years in the House.  This stark statistic puts into context the Government's claim that the introduction of the £5,000 grant to local authority tenants surrendering their homes on the purchase of a private house was a major boost to the house construction industry.  For the last five or six months we have had speech after speech by the Minister for Finance and the Minister for the Environment &mdash; the Taoiseach even got in on the act &mdash; claiming that the grant was a major boost to the industry.  This is a false claim and should not be repeated.</P>
    <P>The Government are paying £5,000 to tenants who have bought existing houses, in some cases houses which had previously been the property of local authorities and often the local authorities to whom the buyers were surrendering a house.  In many cases the grant is being paid to tenants who are buying second-hand houses from owners who are unable to meet mortgage repayments due to unemployment and so on and who are themselves being rehoused in local authority houses.  This is the dog chasing his tail and shows the ineptitude of the Government and their policies.  In reply to a recent Dáil question I was given figures by the Minister which proved beyond doubt that more of these £5,000 grants have gone to people who bought secondhand houses than to those who bought new houses.  It is not correct for <Col N="2643" /> the Government to claim that the introduction of the grant has resulted in a major boost to the house construction industry.  Statistics which I have already quoted show that there has been the biggest decline in the construction of new houses which we have experienced for over two decades and maybe longer, as I have not checked the figures further back.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer briefly to the possibility for private sector investment in road construction. As I have already stated, the construction industry has been deliberately run down by the Government in the belief that a high level of public capital investment should not be sustained.  I have argued on several occasions in the House over the past three years that private funds could be attracted into capital projects if the incentives for such investments were created by the Government, but my pleas have fallen on deaf ears.  However, I live in hope and maybe even at this late stage the Government might agree to adopt the policies which will obviously be those of the next Government anyway.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer specifically to the possibilities for private sector investment in road improvement.  The private sector is primarily interested in generating additional construction activity which will use as much as possible of the current unused resources of the private sector which include design, construction, operation of infrastructure facilities and maintenance of these facilities.  Even in today's depressed economic circumstances, there are investment projects with a profit potential where the State should allow maximum possible involvement by the private sector.  I have in mind new road projects where the private sector would be involved in acquiring, designing, constructing, operating and maintaining new road projects on a particular corridor route.  The Public Capital Programme currently costs about £1,700 million per annum and much of this programme is devoted to the provision of vital infrastructure which is essential for the efficient functioning of the economy. <Col N="2644" /> This essential investment should be carried out at a minimum cost to the taxpayer. The primary objective of the Government should be to ensure that the infrastructure is provided.  This does not mean that the Government have to own every infrastructure facility but they must ensure that infrastructure and services are provided at the cost, quality and efficiency required by the community.  In the past, successive Governments tended to examine one option only.  The provision of facilities such as roads has tended historically to be restricted to 100 per cent ownership by the State.  I believe that by laying down criteria which clearly specify the levels of performance required, the State could achieve major infrastructure facilities through private investment without abrogating their responsibilities to the community.</P>
    <P>From my contacts with industry I believe progress in this area can be achieved only where the private sector involvement is comprehensive, involving a package of private sector resources and not just confined to a financial operation which would amount only to the effective purchase of a toll franchise.  The failure of this Government to attract private sector participation in road infrastructure is precisely because that involvement has been confined to a financial operation only.</P>
    <P>I would like to ask the Minister to extend the provisions of the inner city renewal scheme to Galway city.  Otherwise this scheme will have a detrimental effect on the future growth of that city. Galway was one of the earliest settlements and being strategically located has been a major centre for trade and commerce over the past few centuries. Much of the centre of the old city consists of old stone warehouses now fallen into disuse and many city centre sites are lying derelict.  Cumbersome CPO procedures and extravagant compensation expectations have contributed to this continuing dereliction which could possibly be dealt with if the Government were to implement the main recommendations of the recently published building land report. However, I see great difficulties if Galway is to be excluded from the inner <Col N="2645" /> city renewal scheme.  Many city areas will remain in a derelict state because available investment resources will be attracted to the higher return available in other areas which are included in this scheme, such as Dublin, Cork and Limerick.</P>
    <P>I am not making a special plea for Galway.  I am trying to emphasise that the introduction of this renewal scheme and its extension to other cities, excluding Galway, will have a very serious effect on the renewal plans for Galway city because the limited investment funds available will naturally be attracted to where the greater return is.  If there is a better return available in Dublin, Cork or Limerick, those funds will be attracted into those areas and away from Galway. Rather than making a special case for Galway, I am asking that the same facilities be entended to Galway.  Otherwise it will be left in a detrimental position.  As the only native Galwegian sitting in the Opposition benches, I am making a special appeal to the Government to have Galway included in the inner city renewal scheme when the Bill comes before the House.</P>
    <P>I want to refer now to the home improvement and new house grant schemes.  The new measures stipulate that house grants will be paid only where registered builders carry out the work. This is a move to deal with the black economy operators and as such as welcome. However, some consideration will have to be given to cases where the applicant carries out work himself and to remote areas and islands where there are no registered builders, and never will be. I am sure that, when introducing these measures, the Minister was not seeking to control the operation of the black economy on Inishboffin for instance. Unless some exceptions are made, there is a danger that housing in the remoter areas will fall into disrepair because, as of now, all grant assistance for house repairs has effectively been withdrawn from those areas.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to review the operation of the registered builders clause in the circumstances I mentioned.  It must <Col N="2646" /> be remembered that many of the new houses seen in places like Connemara were built by returned emigrants, people who went abroad specifically to save the £15,000 or so needed to build their own homes.  These enterprising people are now being denied Government grants.</P>
    <P>In the recent debate on the teachers' arbitration award, the Progressive Democrats voted with the Government against the payment of the full award.  I want to say briefly on behalf of our party that the Progressive Democrats recognise the integrity of the arbitrator's award to teachers.  It was not a binding award; it was merely a recommendation from the arbitrator to the Government.</P>

      <P>The steady development of the Irish economy which was so evident since the last fifties has now been halted and we are in a period of decline with the resultant despondency, despair, frustration and inevitable increase in emigration. The country is sadly lacking in leadership.  The Government have no clear economic development programme.  The Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance speak with forked tongues condemning excessive borrowing and current budget deficits while, at the same time, borrowing to limits we never even dreamed of, and the current budget deficit increases more and more each year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The policies pursued by this Government have failed to create jobs.  There are now 240,000 unemployed and the figure is rising.  More and more shops, warehouses, factories and offices are closing under the ever increasing burden <Col N="2647" /> of taxation.  The Government continue with their foolish policies and no change in direction is evident.  No amount of propaganda, headline manipulation or expensive public relations efforts will distract from the real truth.  This country is in serious trouble and national morale is at an all-time low.</P>
    <P>The work ethic so vital for future development has been seriously undermined. The Coalition economy does not reward effort to excellence and all around us cynicism is replacing patriotism.  I believe the spirit of enterprise must be reawakened. Conditions must be created to allow free enterprise to flourish.  The entrepreneurs in our society should be freed from the bondage of taxation and allowed to profit from the success of their initiatives.  There are too many in Government who are adept at distributing existing wealth created by other people, but blind to the need to create the climate where the creation of new wealth will flourish.  Only in such a society can we expect to create jobs for all our young people and enough wealth to sustain and develop a level of service and a standard of living to which our people aspire.</P>
    <P>I call on this Government to set free the spirit of enterprise thoughout the land and if, with their contradictory ideologies, they cannot do this, they should move away and let a new Government take over the task.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to talk about tax raising or expenditure measures.  I want to speak about the procedure of the Dáil in debating the Estimates and the budget, and the financial legislation procedures and instruments which I consider are outmoded because they do not allow us to control the finances of the State in a way <Col N="2648" /> a modern parliament should.  The gross expenditure outflows from the State coffers show that the Estimate for 1986 is £9,473 million and the public capital programme is £1,681 million.  The sum for non-programme outlays is £70 million. If we add the three together we get a grant total of £11,224 million of direct State expenditure.  What real say does this House have either in controlling or directing that expenditure to areas where there is a cost benefit to society who own those resources?  The money belongs to the people and in raising that money it is the duty of this House to ensure it is spent in the most cost effective way and to control and account for the expenditure. I maintain we do not do that.  All the procedures are outmoded and need modernisation.  The checks and balances that have been introduced constitutionally and legally are in need of an overhaul.</P>
    <P>I wish to outline the number of financial provisions that are gone through annually in raising the £11 billion to which I have referred.  A Book of Estimates is published annually which gives the departmental expenses that each Minister will spend in the coming year and after the budget there is a revised Book of Estimates.  There is a public capital programme booklet which outlines the intentions of the Government with regard to expenditure of £1,681 million on infrastructure and on other important State assets.  There is also a White Paper dealing with estimates of receipts and expenditure at existing tax rates.  It is a document that is rarely, if ever, referred to by the Opposition spokesman on finance or by anyone else and it is of questionable value to any Member of the House.</P>
    <P>We also have the Budget Statement and the various accompanying documents. We have the Financial Resolutions that must be passed by the House by midnight on budget day.  We have the annual Finance Bill and, having passed the Estimates and the revised Book of Estimates, we then have an Appropriation Bill to allow the moneys already passed to be appropriated.  There is no <Col N="2649" /> reason an Estimate for a Department cannot be classified as an Appropriation-in-Aid for that Department.</P>
    <P>There is also a statement of authorised issues which justifies to the House issues made by the Minister through the Central Fund (Permanent Provisions) Act, 1965. He accounts to the House for issues he has made that have not been sanctioned by the House but which are subsequently sanctioned in the Estimates and in the Appropriation Bill.  It is hardly necessary to have this type of procedure.  All of this is governed by the Central Fund (Permanent Provisions) Act, 1965.  Later we have a Central Fund Abstract Account, the Appropriation Account, finance accounts and we have a further document entitled &ldquo;National Accounts &mdash; Classification of Budgets&rdquo;.  There is a new booklet entitled the &ldquo;Comprehensive Programmes Book&rdquo; and there is also a publication entitled &ldquo;Economic Background to the Budget&rdquo;.  In addition, there are pre-budget tables.  All of those documents are meant to help the House to deal with the £11 billion but I doubt if there are more than one or two Members who know anything about them.  Any enterprise that ran its affairs in a businesslike way would not allow such a volume of documentation on the controlling of expenditure.</P>
    <P>Very few Members know or have been encouraged to find out precisely what these documents mean, what are their sources and their authority.  The Constitution does not even allow the Seanad to raise finances.  It states that the Dáil must be the source of all money Bills.  However, the Constitution and this House are being by-passed year in and year out by letters of comfort and many other instruments.</P>
    <P>We had a meeting of the Public Accounts Committee this morning where it transpired that the National Petroleum Corporation of Ireland were given the power to borrow $540 million without a mention to this House or to any committee of the House.  That company was set up with an authorised share capital of £100 with £2 issued to nominees of the <Col N="2650" /> Minister for Finance.  The whole procedure set out in the Constitution has been by-passed and the authority of this House to raise money from the taxpayers and to spend it in the interests of the country is being by-passed.  This is not merely due to a lack of understanding of the financial procedures involved but to other deliberate procedures.  We must look at the whole accounting operation to see what needs to be done to bring it into line with the requirements of a modern State.</P>
    <P>When the Comptroller and Auditor General examines the accounts he reports to the House.  The House sends that report back to the Public Accounts Committee which sits with the Comptroller and Auditor General to examine the accounting officers of the various Departments. The Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General was set up in Victorian times and it was reaffirmed in our Constitution. He is a constitutional officer: he is not answerable to the Government or to anyone but to the Dáil.  Yet his functions and powers have never been reviewed.  Two or three years ago in Great Britain they passed the National Audit Office Act which reviewed the whole procedure for accounting for public expenditure.  It gave their Comptroller and Auditor General powers to examine not only the book entries but also to see if the money was spent in an effective and efficient way.  That follows from powers given to the Canadian Auditor General after a review many years ago.  Every parliament has a Public Accounts Committee and a Comptroller and Auditor General.  We have fallen behind other modern parliaments in our method of accounting for spending.  The Public Accounts Committee of the Canadian Parliament, which is set up on the same basis as this Parliament, is perhaps the most advanced in calling to account the agents of the State for the vast sums of money that they spend. Their Auditor General, as he is known in Canada, has been given the powers to carry out efficiency examinations within the area of Government spending and where he considers there are inefficiencies, he reports these to the Public <Col N="2651" /> Accounts Committee, who, in turn, are in a position to go into the detail.</P>
    <P>The Public Accounts Committee of this House is not so authorised.  By our budget we are raising huge sums of money annually.  We can all agree or disagree with what it is spent on, but we have no control on how it is spent.  The controls and checks are not there; there is a very serious deficiency.  The powers of the Comptroller and Auditor General badly need to be updated.  We need a national audit office and powers to be extended to the Comptroller and Auditor General to examine the efficiency of Government spending as well as the appropriateness of it under the headings for which it has been voted.</P>
    <P>As things stand, the Comptroller and Auditor General cannot even audit the budget expenditure which we have already approved.  As well as his constitutional duty to examine the Appropriation Accounts and to report thereon he has also been assigned other duties by this House and is required to examine the accounts of semi-State bodies, for instance.  He has a very limited staff and there are huge burdens placed upon him. All he can do at best is make spot checks in Government Departments and report on that basis the deficiencies he turns up not the lack of efficiency of effectiveness, but deficiencies in keeping within the subheads voted by this House.  Even on his spot checks he has come up with some whoppers, enormously inappropriate activities within the Departments which have not been approved by this House, some of which may well be desirable but which are unauthorised.  In other cases he has found some questions of deliberate fraud.  Most of the public money is spent properly &mdash; of that I have no doubt &mdash; however, no company, corporation or body, spending the sort of money which the State spends would be so careless about its check on how those sums have been spent.</P>
    <P>If we were to look more closely at value for money spent, we might find, for instance, that we do not have to raise the huge amount of taxes which we have to <Col N="2652" /> raise annually to fund our budget.  We might find that we do not have to raise £104 million customs duty; excise duties £1.378 million; capital taxes £35 million; stamp duties £167 million; income tax £2,356 million, income levy £34 million, corporation tax £250 million, value-added tax £1,562 million, agricultural levies £13 million, motor vehicle duties £131 million and youth employment levy £87 million.  We might find that if we were properly controlling our expenditure we could quite easily have savings which would reduce one or more of those items and allow us to cut back on the enormous amount of taxes which we are imposing on people.</P>
    <P>Let us take the refund which will be given to the PAYE workers next April on the Estimates in the budget; the figure is something like £200 million.  As a percentage of the £11,224 million which we are going to spend, it is not great, it is about 2 per cent.  If we were to make even a 2 per cent saving on our annual expenditure by way of more effectiveness and efficiency we could give back twice as much to the PAYE sector.  I have no doubt &mdash; and neither should other Members have &mdash; that within the public service there are not the same controls on spending money as in the private sector.  Put another way, which of us would spend other people's money as well as we would spend our own?  If we were spending our own money we would be more careful, more effective, more cautious and certainly we would ensure that we got better value for our spending. The money being spent is our money, Ireland's money.  We are the shareholders of Ireland Incorporated.  We should have the power &mdash; we certainly have the duty &mdash; to hold the people who spend that money accountable for it. Even the slightest of efficiences, savings which can be brought about by a reorganisation of the Comptroller and Auditor General's Office and the updating of his powers and those of the Public Accounts Committee would result in very substantial savings.  That is long overdue and it should be addressed by this House.</P>
    <P>Earlier I quoted the figure given for <Col N="2653" /> supply services as £9,473 million gross.  It is never presented to this House as a gross figure, but as a net figure.  In the budget tables that figure is shown as £9,473 million less £1,431 million, which equals £8,042 million.  The difference is a famous thing called Appropriations-in-Aid.  For 1986 these amount to £1,431 million. That is more than half of everything that we take in income tax, more than we take in excise duties and about equal to what we will take in value-added tax in the coming year.  Yet, who in this House knows what Appropriations-in-Aid are and how they are accounted for?  They are not accounted for, they are netted off against departmental spending.  They are accounted for in total but there is no control over these figures and it is not even shown on the credit side of the tabular statement on budget day, rather is it deducted on the debit side, which has the same effect.  The actual Government departmental spending should be shown gross.  I do not know why it is not so shown and I have discussed this matter with the Taoiseach, among others.  It is an anomaly which has been there over the years.  The actual supply services figure should be given as the actual spending figure, £9,473 million.  The Appropriations-in-Aid should be shown on the credit side of the statement, ranking beside VAT, corporation tax and income tax, so we can see there is a source of income to various Departments under this famous heading of Appropriations-in-Aid in-Aid which is collected over a wide variety of items.  All Departments probably have Appropriations-in-Aid income, for example, from the sale of furniture or whatever, which the Departments are allowed to use themselves. Other technical properties which may not be immediately evident have been discussed by the Committee of Public Accounts of which I am a member.</P>
    <P>As excess Vote is rarely allowed.  It is frowned on.  It can give rise to personal liability on the part of the accounting officer who approves it and is, therefore, always avoided.  If an excess Vote is not brought before this House and sanctioned by this House &mdash; or even if it <Col N="2654" /> is and the Minister for Finance decides not to implement it &mdash; the person who has incurred that excess Vote is personally liable.  The excess Vote can be reduced by Appropriations-in-Aid; in other words, moneys which have not been voted by this House can be spent by Government Departments through this device should they choose to use it.  That provision should not be there.  Appropriations-in-Aid should be on the credit side of the tabular statement and we should be able to examine all of these Appropriations-in-Aid to see precisely what that £1,431 million income is made up of and whether we are satisfied with the manner in which this income is disposed.</P>
    <P>The procedures used now for the budget for raising the State's finances and for legislating for these finances are outmoded and need to be up-dated and reexamined thoroughly.  I do not think anybody who has looked at the procedures in this House could disagree with that.  I want to make one or two other points in relation to the content of the budget.</P>

      <P>I agree with the comments made here with regard to the charge on bank interest.  The tax being raised on bank interest, irrespective of the ability of people to pay or the liability which may or may not arise for the taxpayer, is a new departure in tax principle. The principle that has always applied in <Col N="2655" /> this country is that tax on income be related to the ability of the person to pay.  This is a departure.  It is what is called a poll tax in technical tax language, and it is difficult to justify except that it means there will be a significant inflow of funds to the Exchequer of the order of £75 million which I suppose must be raised to meet Government spending.  We may not like to do this and we may seek some way to avoid doing it, but, if that is to happen, the Government will have to meet the shortfall in some other way.</P>
      <P>I suppose Deputy Kelly did not realise he was doing it but, having read out a number of motions on the Order Paper which would commit the Government to spending if they were met, he went on to say we should not introduce this interest tax and was, therefore, guilty of the same offence, in other words, committing the Government to loss of revenue or to spending which they could not afford.  If the Government are to modify the tax on interest provisions &mdash; they should do so &mdash; then they must make up the shortfall in some other way.  The problem is that when that day comes, if it comes, any steps taken to do that will be further decided in the House, but the Minister should not be too concerned about backtracking a little on this.</P>
      <P>When the Finance Bill comes in he should look at the question of interest, and he should be more discriminating in his application of tax on interest provisions. Many old people in particular live off the interest on their investments and would not be liable to tax under the exemption provisions and under the normal tax free allowance provisions, and it would be unfair to take 35 per cent of their interest in tax.  I do not think the Minister wishes or intends to do that.  It should be corrected and if necessary we will have to raise the funds in some other way.  That might be catered for in the Finance Bill when published.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Molloy said the £5,000 grant and so on which the Government introduced last year did not result in a greater sale of new houses, that people were going for second-hand houses.  That may <Col N="2656" /> or may not be so, and I presume Deputy Molloy has researched it, but one of the most difficult problems we have faced in Dublin city in my time as a public representative &mdash; I was first elected to Dublin Corporation in 1979 &mdash; was housing. One of this Government's great successes has been their housing policy and provisions.  I am not referring just to the Housing Finance Agency.  The Government have shown commitment to building local authority houses and the £5,000 grant has helped greatly.</P>
    <P>If people are buying secondhand houses having been tenants for three years of a local authority, they are moving on, buying their own houses and returning the houses they are moving out of to the local authority who can, in turn, let them to other applicants on the list. This has had an enormous effect on the housing list.  The pressure on that list has eased greatly.  Anybody accustomed to dealing with housing problems on behalf of his constituents can say that without doubt houses are available even to parents with one child and parents expecting their first child because they qualify as a family of three.</P>
    <P>This has saved the State finance in that the State does not have to fund the building of a local authority house which can cost anything from £40,000 to £50,000 because of the standards used and the type of house which is built to last so that it can be let and relet if necessary.  It has had a significant effect not just on State finances but has resulted in large numbers of houses being made available to local authorities for letting.  I congratulate the Government on that.  It is worthy and I would like to see it continued.</P>

Níl réiteach na ceiste sin sa cháinaisnéis seo.</P>
      <P>This budget is without confidence, without hope, direction or leadership and has not addressed the single most important item facing all of us, namely, unemployment. The official level of unemployment is now almost 240,000 and rising, despite efforts by Government Members to indicate that the tide has turned.  People thought the budget would address the problems facing the nation and that there would be an acknowledment that Government policies pursued over the past three years had failed.  The budget has failed to meet the challenge of injecting confidence into the economy.  Boosting output and growth is a precondition for job creation and dealing with the national debt.  The budget did not give any hope to industry or businesses who were looking to the Government to lift their morale and lift the productive sector off the floor.</P>
      <P>The Minister's exercise in tinkering with the nation's finances was a bit like watching a game of musical chairs. Analysis by independent experts would seem to indicate that the slightly deflationary aspect of the budget is likely to reduce growth in 1986.  The Government are unwilling to invest in the economic reconstruction of our country. Instead they will increase the tax take by 9.6 per cent to more than £6 billion.  The public expenditure cuts of £55 million and the £25 million cut in capital expenditure will undoubtedly have an adverse effect on unemployment.</P>
      <P>The incentives to employment in the services sector through the reduction of VAT on meals and a range of labour-intensive services are to be welcomed and I acknowledge that as an employment creating measure.  How realistic is it to tax fish and chips or, as they are referred to in the Dublin area, the one and one ?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The hike in PRSI costs is likely to have an adverse effect on employment by increasing costs to employers.  All these points have been referred to by my colleagues during this debate.  I wish to refer specifically to the cost of money to <Col N="2658" /> industry and expecially to small firms. This is central to the creation of a climate for investment and enterprise.  The sharp 3 per cent increase in interest rates recently has very serious implications for industrial endeavour.  It brings the cost of overdrafts and term loans to small industry and farmers to 17.5 per cent. The cost of money to Government Departments, local authorities and blue chip companies has increased to 15.5 per cent.  This means that the rate of interest to corporate borrowers has risen by 4 per cent since the beginning of this year. Over a full 12 months the increase would add £15 million to the costs of the small firms sector.</P>
    <P>Soaring interest rates may cost Irish industry as a whole as much as £80 million. Our industry is now perched precariously between falling prices on our main export market due to the weakness of sterling and real interest rates of over 11 per cent.  Twelve months ago there was an outcry when Ireland's real interest rate rose to over 8 per cent.  At that time it compared with 5.1 per cent in the UK, 4.5 per cent in the USA and 3.7 per cent in Germany.  From the point of view of industrial development and job creation the latest hike in interest rates will gravely affect the profitability and viability of new enterprises while endangering those firms already in financial difficulty.</P>
    <P>I suggest that an alternative strategy must be devised to lower interest rates for the productive and employment creating sectors.  Banks, businessmen and economists agree that the upward trend in the cost of money during the past five years has had alarming implications for Irish industrial development.  These high rates of interest are hampering the development of small indigenous manufacturing industry.  Recently, the IDA acknowledged to me, when I made some inquiries, that a good deal of discussion is going on with foreign companies but, in their own words, &ldquo;nothing is happening at home&rdquo;.  That is a sad situation.  I hope the Minister and the Government will address the problem and salvage our economy when the Finance Bill is introduced. I am not sure what Minister will <Col N="2659" /> be introducing it because of the various soundings we have heard from the media.</P>
    <P>Small industry is vital for the Irish economy, accounting for some 90 per cent of manufacturing output.  The economic strategy of the White Paper on Industrial Policy published by the Government in 1984 mentions that the economy depends on an efficient and thriving small industries nucleus around which strong home based industries will develop.  I think all of us in the Dáil would broadly support a strategy based on our natural resources and indigenous firms. It is a great source of concern to all of us that this strategy is now endangered by very high interest rates, handicapping small industries and start-up enterprises.</P>
    <P>There is an urgent need to relieve the pressure on domestic rates and to stimulate economic activity, especially investment. This is particularly so in view of the financial structure of many of our companies.  It has been clear for quite some time that small and medium-sized manufacturing firms have financing problems. They suffer from a lack of equity and have inadequate profits.  The NESC have highlighted an unhealthy dependence on debt finance on the part of Irish firms.</P>
    <P>Soaring interest rates have increased the cost of finance to industry for productive investment.  In turn, the low level of equity participation has reinforced the reliance of Irish manufacturing firms on debt finance.  This has led to a truly tragic situation for many firms.  They are caught in a vicious spiral of low profits, high borrowings, high risks and low investments leading to lower profits and so on.  It is tragic to reflect on the number of enterprises, individuals and firms which have been crucified by the high rates of interest to the detriment of the community as a whole.  There is evidence that this blight is affecting some of the firms established under IDA enterprise development programmes which are geared for high growth, high technology sectors of the future emphasising research and development and innovation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2660" /> There is evidence that the high technology aims of a number of these firms may be in danger due to their financial position. It has emerged that because the level of bank debt in these companies is far in excess of what is appropriate at their initial stages of development many of the firms are forced to engage in low technology manufacturing and assembly to generate sufficient cashflow and service bank debt.  Many firms are not in a position to avail of the development in technology that we have spearheaded here.  As a result, research and development, the original aim of many of these companies, as well as productive investment have suffered.  There is four times as much debt as equity in enterprise development programme companies.  A more appropriate capital structure for these ventures would be to have four times as much equity as debt.</P>
    <P>Those financial trends, high interest rates and an over-reliance by Irish firms on bank borrowings, if allowed to go unchecked will almost certainly have disastrous consequences for future industrial development.  The Government's emphasis on equity participation was briefly referred to in the main features of the budget but the Government must have the courage of their convictions and act more quickly to remove the barriers impeding increased equity participation in industrial development.  I made that suggestion in the course of the debate on the Bill dealing with designated trust funds and I hope the Government, having acknowledged that this ought to be done, will do so in the forthcoming Finance Bill.  I await that Bill with bated breath.</P>
    <P>The Government might also address themselves to the recommendations of the Industrial Credit Corporation and the National Economic and Social Council. A concerted effort must be made to reduce the interest rates on finance for productive investment.  The high cost of money must not be allowed to obscure the fact that fundamentally Irish industry is in a healthy state.  Firms employing more than 100 people represent 94 per cent of all Irish manufacturing companies. The evidence points to such firms <Col N="2661" /> being more profitable than bigger ones and having a better financial structure. High interest rates must not be allowed to choke off the potential of these firms.</P>
    <P>For more than 25 years industry has been the main growth dynamic within the Irish economy.  The expansion of industry has created demands for new services and resulted in tens of thousands of additional jobs in the economy.  The new jobs generated in the sixties and seventies were sufficient to cope with the drift from agriculture and a growing labour force.  In 1960 investment in the economy was at the rate of 14 per cent.  That increased to 22 per cent in 1970 and to 30 per cent in 1980.  However, in recent years investment levels have fallen and now account for only 23 per cent of national output. Last year investment in manufacturing industry was almost 20 per cent below the level of five years earlier.  Higher manufacturing investment will lead to a faster growth in output and a wide range of spin-off activities in the economy creating many thousands of new jobs.  Those jobs will not only be in the manufacturing sector but also in sub-contracting, banking, insurance, maintenance, transport, distribution and many other areas.  The list is endless.  However, industrialists must be convinced that investment will yield a higher rate of return.</P>
    <P>For decades successive Governments have sought to influence these decisions by offering favourable fiscal and financial incentives to accelerate investment.  The budget proposals will have a significant impact on the amount of investment available to industry and must be examined in that context.  The proposal to reduce capital allowances for IDA grant-aided equipment will withdraw £18 million from the manufacturing industry in the full year of operation.  The proposal to impose a special 12 per cent duty on section 84 loan interest will cost industry an estimated £12 million in a full year. The main firms affected by this will be agricultural co-ops and foreign-owned industries.  The latter are the only ones the IDA are dealing with in an effort to create more jobs.  The duty reduces considerably the value of what has been <Col N="2662" /> an important incentive for Irish industry. Those proposals if enacted will have the effect of reducing the incentives to invest in manufacturing industry by about £30 million per annum.</P>
    <P>As a result of the budget, grants allocated to the IDA will be reduced by £3 million.  In real terms that will mean that they are now 10 per cent below the level of three years ago.  The new 35 per cent reduction tax on financial institutions will have a negative impact on the business sector.  In this way a further £30 million will be withdrawn from the cash flow of industrial and commercial firms in 1986 thus greatly reducing the working capital available to sustain employment.</P>
    <P>It is extraordinary that one of the reasons given for introducing one of these measures is to make industries more labour intensive.  What could be further from the truth?  What are the Government thinking about when they make such a statement?  Irish industry is not capital intensive relative to other countries but it must have the financial ability to purchase the most modern equipment. Large numbers of people operating obsolete plant cannot form the basis of a competitive industrial sector.  Experience in all industrialised countries demonstrates clearly the strong positive relationship between the growth of manufacturing output and the increase in total employment levels in the economy.</P>
    <P>The emphasis should be on accelerating investment to increase output and create more jobs.  Every £ invested by the State by way of grant or fiscal incentive is matched by an input by industry of £3 or £4.  Investment in plant and machinery alone must increase by at least 20 per cent per annum, that is, 10 per cent to replace obsolete equipment and a further 10 per cent towards necessary expansion. Recent investment rates fell well below this requirement.  In recent years the annual level of industrial investment has been less than half the rate it needed to sustain the industrial expansion of 10 per cent per annum that is required.  The top priority for Government and industry must be to stimulate a much more rapid increase in private investment activity. <Col N="2663" /> This budget is a move in the opposite direction.</P>
    <P>It is a stark fact that our industrial sector is only half the size it needs to be if we are to aspire realistically to closing the gap between European living standards and to providing jobs for our young people.  The only way to create real jobs &mdash; and I emphasise the word, &ldquo;real&rdquo; because we are all too well aware of the amount of money being spent on a multiplicity of agencies and on the overlapping of all this training and retraining with no sustainable jobs at the end &mdash; is to provide conditions which will stimulate higher investment leading to increased output.  The Government accepted this on a Private Members' motion here recently.</P>
    <P>One of the most important influences on industry is the declining price of oil and also the weakening in the value of sterling and of the dollar against the currencies of the EMS, including the punt. It is estimated that should the decline in crude oil prices be maintained, inflation will be cut by 1.5 per cent more than the projection.  This would mean that inflation in Germany will fall from 1.8 per cent to almost zero.  The average rate of inflation in the Community this year could fall to 2.5 per cent but the projected inflation rate for Ireland, as referred to by the Minister in his Budget Statement, is far too high in view of the strengthening of the Irish punt in recent weeks.  It is essential that, in order to maintain competitiveness, the Irish inflation rate should be below that of our main trading partners.</P>
    <P>The climate for private investment has been depressed in recent years because the returns available from risk-free investment in Government stocks were far higher.  For example, last year more than £1,000 million was invested by private individuals and institutions in new Government gilts and less than one twentieth of that amount in new equity investment in manufacturing industry.  It is essential that this 20:1 imbalance against investment in productive risk taking investment be removed if we are to make <Col N="2664" /> any impact on our unemployment problem.</P>
    <P>The climate for personal enterprise and initiative has been adversely affected also by the high rates of personal income tax on relatively modest salaries.  Industry, as I have said previously, has had difficulty in persuading people to work overtime, even on urgent export orders, and to accept more responsibility at higher salaries because the increase in net pay after tax is whittled away.  That is a disincentive. The personal tax adjustments announced in the budget are welcome. They are a step in the right direction.  At least they give the impression that the adjustments will be beneficial to the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>I go along with those commentators who, to put it mildly, expressed doubts about the net results of the changes. However, there is a long way to go towards creating the atmosphere in which we will have the acceptance and the encouragement that are necessary among our people <i>vis-à-vis</i> taxation.  That is why this subject must be addressed more firmly from now on if the effect that we all so dearly wish for is to be achieved. There is no doubt that Irish industry has the capacity to expand much more rapidly, but it must have favourable operating conditions.  I repeat what I said earlier &mdash; the budget will not bring about an improvement in the overall climate for enterprise.</P>
    <P>This year's budget represents a continuation of existing Government policies, policies which have been pursued in the past three years but which have not worked.  One would have expected the Government to have realised that before now.  They were presented with the opportunity to commence a programme for economic recovery but sadly they missed that opportunity.  I am talking of the opportunity to make an attempt at a new direction which would offer hope to people who are deeply depressed and dispirited.</P>
    <P>During the year economic growth was almost at a standstill, while unemployment continued on its upward spiral to reach its present dizzy height as firm after <Col N="2665" /> firm closed and liquidations became increasingly the order of the day, a trend which has continued up to the present. People lost their jobs but, in addition, they lost confidence in their own country, not to mention their loss of confidence in the Government.  We all recall the statement of the Minister for Finance at the time of last year's budget when he said that at the beginning of 1985 the economy was well placed for the sustained expansion envisaged in the plan.  He was referring to that famous or otherwise document, <i>Building on Reality</i> which has become more and more discredited, just as it was discredited within one month of its publication.  In that document there was the observation that in the final analysis, the success of any economic policy can be judged only by its impact on economic activity within the State, account being taken of the extent to which benefits are captured through numbers employed, levels of income, taxes and profits.  These standards which the Government set for themselves have proved a total failure.  All we have achieved is the present disastrous economic and social situation.</P>
    <P>There are many areas of total failure on the part of the Government.  The single most important item in their litany of failures is our unemployment rate of 18 per cent, the worst on record in the EC.</P>
    <P>Need I remind the House of the public relations exercise of the Government last October on the introduction of what was described as a package of measures to combat unemployment and to consolidate the improving employment figures? In this whole area of employment &mdash; and emigration is now back with us &mdash; the Government have been totally dishonest. We can recall &mdash; in case some of us do not, I wish to remind all and sundry &mdash; the Taoiseach on coming to office saying he would always tell the people the truth. We heard a lot then about credibility, honesty and truthfulness.  What have we had?  We have heard a series of misleading statements about unemployment and emigration so often, so long and so loud, <Col N="2666" /> that the truth has been totally removed from the Government's vocabulary.</P>
    <P>I will refer to other areas in which I had expected the Government to display some interest or to give some attention to.  Take the construction industry, which has the ability to create the jobs far quicker and at less cost than many other areas.  There is considerable scope for Government action to increase employment in the construction industry if they had a policy or the political will to stimulate that industry.  Is it not ironical, and this is a fact that cannot be distorted by any media or handlers, that the decline in the construction industry is synonomous with Coalition Government?  Whatever the cause, the construction industry always have feared the prospect of Coalition Government, and they had every reason for doing so.  This Coalition again have spread depression in the construction industry.  Like the workers in that industry, I can see the demoralising effect this Government have had on this industry.</P>
    <P>In their document <i>Building on Reality,</i> the Government forecast a 7 per cent growth rate in that industry between 1985 and 1987.  We all know that target is no longer achievable on the basis of current Government policies, attitudes and decisions. Unemployment of operatives in that industry has now reached 48,400.  To that we must add the many more in the downstream service industries associated with construction, and therefore it is reasonable to say the figure of unemployed in the construction industry is nearly 100,000.</P>
    <P>We had expected some forward thinking in the budget which would help employment.  Instead, we have a reduction in the capital programme, which must be condemned without qualification. The Government should be giving additional funds to that programme.  I will give instances of a few areas in which there should be additional funding.  Let us take infrastructure.  With justification, much has been said about how far behind we are in the need to improve infrastructure if there is to be economic growth. <Col N="2667" /> There is the national gas grid, the construction of sporting centres and the provision of sporting facilities which were proposed by the National Planning Board in their report.  That board also referred to accelerated refurbishment of public buildings and so on.</P>
    <P>I will refer to agriculture for a few moments.  Irrespective of the massive growth we need in agriculture, there has not been any improvement in that respect in this budget.  The Budget Statement of the Minister for Finance devoted only four lines to the agricultural industry. Many times we have heard of the ability of the agricultural sector, given the required encouragement and incentives, to create jobs, particularly in food processing. We know the effects that would have on the balance of payments.  The production of vegetables and other such foods would reduce our high imbalance of imports.  It is unacceptable that firms such as Érin Foods of Mallow should have had to close down.  I could list others.  When we should be encouraging growth in this industry, we have been sadly neglecting it and this has been fully reflected in the attitudes displayed in the many meetings of farmers with the Minister for Agriculture.</P>
    <P>Time does not permit me to develop further on the proposed report of the group of Ministers of State set up three years ago to promote programmes and plans to contribute to a correction in our imbalance of imports by the promotion exports of produce for which our climate is so suitable.  I would have thought we would have had the results of that study before now.</P>
    <P>I will refer to the infamous retention tax.  All of us were encouraged to save our money from an early age.  Various schemes were introduced to encourage people to save, and prizes were won by schools for their savings ability.  Now the Minister is taxing children's savings.  The retention tax is a monumental financial and social blunder.  To date we encouraged people who previously kept their savings at home to keep them in banks <Col N="2668" /> and financial institutions.  Now the Minister proposes to tax the savings of these people who are vulnerable to attack. Where is the credibility about which we heard so much in the 1982 general election? This Government and this Minister encouraged people, particularly senior citizens, to save their money in banks and financial institutions as a safeguard for themselves and their nest eggs.  Now the Government are imposing a retention tax of 35 per cent on their savings.  If the Government intend to ignore what we say about it, I hope their own backbenchers will make their feelings forcibly known as they did after the local elections last June, which resulted in the famous package of increased grants to the construction industry, in order to get action. We will continue to remind the Government of the effects of this retention tax on young and not so young savers and on voluntary organisations.</P>
    <P>I have received a letter from the Arthritis Foundation of Ireland and I can apply the relevant sections to the many voluntary organisations and charities around the country, including the Aid Cancer Treatment Organisation in Cork who recently collected £300,000.  That money is in the bank while awaiting a decision by the Minister for Health to give us £40,000 to put up a building, and it will now be the subject of a 35 per cent clawback by the Government.  The letter pointed out that retention tax will bring many charities and voluntary organisations into the tax net.  It was their policy to ensure that funds were available prior to commitment to expenditure on research and the provision of treatment facilities.  During the period between the collection of funds and payment of the grants and so on, they had always considered it their duty to their supporters to utilise the funds in the best possible way.  From time to time substantial such funds are on deposit in banks.  Up to now interest on these funds was an additional income to enable groups to further the aims of their charity.  This tax will curtail severely the activities of these organisations and will reduce the services being provided to more than 500,000 people <Col N="2669" /> suffering from various illnesses.  The Government should be ashamed of themselves.</P>
    <P>Certain savings should not be liable for tax when allowances are apportioned, under the tax code.  These savings should include savings of dependant spouses, old age pensioners, redundant workers and so on.  I know of a case where a person discontinued work for health reasons and has an income of £7,450 from interest on a deposit account.  This is a married man with a tax allowance of £3,800, a mortgage interest allowance of £2,250, life insurance allowance of £172, VHI allowance of £310 bringing this total allowances to £6,532.  Subtracted from his interest on his deposit that amounts to £918, taxable at 35 per cent, giving a tax liability of £321.30 so that his net income is £7,128.70p.  He has a number of school going children.  When this retention tax comes into effect this man will be taxed on his interest of £7,450 at 35 per cent which will give him a tax liability of £2,607.50p.  His net income out of interest on £7,450 will be £4,842.50p on which he must keep his wife and family and pay his mortgage, insurance and so on.  I hope the Minister and his colleagues will look at these four categories who have to pay retention tax: young people with small savings, the not so young whom we encouraged to save, depositors who are not liable for tax and charitable organisations, with a view to doing something for them.</P>
    <P>In the short time left it is reasonable to talk about my native heath.  We are waiting with bated breath for the Government to encourage, co-ordinate and assist those people in Cork who want to re-open the dockyard.  At present the <i>M V Leinster,</i> which was built at Verolme, is in dry dock in Liverpool for a refit costing £250,000.  That will involve six weeks' work approximately for 120 workers around the clock, which will be followed by a similar refit on the <i>M V Connacht.</i> As efforts are being made to re-open the dockyard, I am surprised that the B &amp; I could not wait for another while when they might have been able to send that work to the dockyard in Cork.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2670" /> The ESB are shipping thousands of tonnes of coal to Moneypoint on foreign vessels.  Irish Shipping were liquidated by the Government and Alcan are bringing bauxite into Aughinish on foreign vessels. It is ironical that Englishmen and others are repairing our ships and that Liberians and Panamanians are transporting our cargoes while Irish people are stranded in foreign ports like Marseilles.  The Deputies from Cork who support the Government should encourage them to do something positive and practical for this region.</P>
    <P>In that regard I must refer to the enormous publicity given to the visit by the Taoiseach to Cork in regard to the rescue package proposed for the area.  The television cameras were there to record the visit and the announcement that a sum of £15 million would be made available.  If the Government and the Deputies who support them think the people of west Cork are impressed by this, they should think again.  If one reads the small print, it is obvious that they did not get the sum of £15 million last Friday, as it is to be spread over four years.  That is an even bigger insult to west Cork.  Where has the other £20 million gone?  A sum of £35 million was made available and, even with a commitment of £15 million over the next four years, a sum of £20 million is still unaccounted for.  Will it be used to balance the books?  It would have been much better to give a commitment in regard to industrial development which needs a helping hand in that region. There are sites there which could be utilised by the IDA as it is a 60 per cent disadvantaged area.  The Government should add another £500,000 which would create jobs.  It is a Kathleen Mavourneen system.</P>
    <P>There have been closures and liquidations all over the country.  Cork had the dubious distinction of suffering from the very beginning and, where they lead, others follow.  However, we did not wish to give a lead in closures and liquidations. The whole country is now in the same grip of closures which are the hallmark of the Government.  The Minister for <Col N="2671" /> Health and the Minister for Education did not improve matters by closing many institutions.</P>
    <P>We welcome the grant of £50,000 for Cork Opera House and a similar grant for the enterprise board.  A number of other grants were also given to the Gaeltacht in Rath Cairn and for the welfare of emigrants abroad.  I support and welcome these grants, but if the Government allocated the grants to the Cork Opera House and the enterprise board as a sop to Cork, they are on a loser because any Minister making an Estimate for a Department would include those figures and it is not necessary to mention them in a budget speech.  The attitude in Cork is that it is an attempt to curry favour with the voters.</P>
    <P>I am glad there is a Cork Deputy listening to me on the other side of the House as he can confirm this over the weekend. The people have had enough of the Government.  There is much speculation today about changing their team, but all the people want now is for the Government to go to the country as we are in an economic mess.  Leave now and give the people an opportunity to replace an unsatisfactory administration which has brought us to this level of hopelessness by their policies and lack of leadership and commitment.</P>

      <P>The strength of the Permanent Defence Force is determined from time to time in the light of military requirements and does not differentiate between male and female members.  Because of the non-combatant role of female personnel, enlistment for general service has had to be confined to male personnel in recent times.</P>
      <P>None of the female personnel in the Permanent Defence Force is attached to the Naval Service as it is inappropriate for non-combatants to be assigned for sea service.  Naval Service vessels are not constructed with accommodation facilities solely for use of females and the provision of such accommodation would involve major structural alterations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot give a definitive answer because it depends on the size of ship for which the plans are being prepared.  If we were building an aircraft carrier we would be able to accommodate females on a ship of that size, but that is very unlikely.  It we build further ships they will almost certainly be the same size as our present fleet, and it would be extremely difficult to design into those ships accommodation for female personnel. As I indicated to the Deputy, I am sure the feminist movement would not want to be associated with what would be essentially an exercise in tokenism which is what it would be.  We could not have accommodation for more than one or two females.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Defence if he will make a statement on the operations of the Civil Defence forces, indicating the numbers of <Col N="2678" /> members, the budget for each of the last three years for which figures are available; if he has plans to raise the public profile of the Civil Defence forces; and whether any further civil defence handbooks are in preparation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Operations involving Civil Defence personnel may be classified under two headings &mdash; accident or emergency call-outs and training exercises.  Primary responsibility for call-outs rest with the Controller, that is the county or city manager, and exact figures in this category are not available.  Obviously, the frequency of call-outs depends on several local factors and some areas would have substantially more call-outs than others. However, from inquiries made it would appear that in any given year about a third of all operations are calls-outs and two-thirds are training exercises.</P>
      <P>As an aid to training and to maintain the interest of the Civil Defence volunteer personnel, competitions are held each year for the rescue, auxiliary fire service, casualty and welfare services at county, regional and national levels.</P>
      <P>National exercises for the warden service, national fallout exercises, are likewise held each year.  The object of these exercises is to test the main features of the system organised to handle a radioactive fallout situation.  The exercises rehearse members of the Civil Defence Warden Service in their wartime duties.  In addition to the Civil Defence volunteer elements, warden service, scientific intelligence officers and message centre staff, the Army Observer Corps, Garda Síochána, Radio Telefís Éireann, the Meterological Service and Irish Lights participate in the national fallout exercises. Local exercises are also held within counties and regions.</P>
      <P>The Civil Defence rolls of local authorities show the total number of active members in the country in 1982, 1983 and 1984 as 19,844, 20,639 and 21,414, respectively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The organisation is financed in the main by a specific provision under subhead G in the Defence Vote.  The allocations were £1,365,000, £1,500,000 and <Col N="2679" /> £1,720,000 in 1983, 1984 and 1985, respectively. Contributions by the local authorities in each of those years ranged from about £300,000 to £400,000.  On this basis, total spending on Civil Defence was in excess of £2 million in 1985.</P>
    <P>With regard to raising the public profile of the Civil Defence organisation, I might refer to some of the various ways by which Civil Defence was promoted in 1985.  The most noteworthy of these was the national fallout exercise &ldquo;Network '85&rdquo; in March during which I gave a televised address to the public.  The Minister of State hosted and attended the national competition finals which received widespread media attention.  Volunteers gave significant assistance with events such as the &ldquo;Triathlon&rdquo; in Sligo in June, the Scout Jamboree in Galway in August and the Nissan International Classic Cycle Race in September.  The publicity attendant on these and similar events helped to promote the image of Civil Defence.</P>
    <P>Other activities such as involvement in search and rescue operations, assistance at accidents and the holding of weekend training camps all helped to promote Civil Defence as an active and effective nationwide organisation.  The Deputy will appreciate from what I have said that I see the promotion of Civil Defence as a significant element in almost all the activities of the organisation.  I propose to continue to promote Civil Defence in all these ways.</P>
    <P>I should also mention that early in 1985 a major issue of equipment for Civil Defence &mdash; comprising six ambulances, five landrovers, ten lighting and rescue sets and a fire appliance &mdash; was made to the local authorities.  Additionally, a further four fire appliances and three personnel and equipment vehicles, together with a substantial stock of radiac dose rate meters, will be issued to local authorities in the near future.  The Deputy may be aware that the issue of a new uniform for volunteers commenced in 1984 and is still continuing.  This has contributed greatly to the morale and image of the volunteers.</P>
    <P>An up-dated householders handbook <Col N="2680" /> to replace the publication known as Bás Beatha is at an advanced stage of preparation. The handbook will advise on the measures to be taken by householders for their protection against the effects of nuclear fallout.  The target date for the completion of the handbook is September 1986.</P>
    <P>A series of pamphlets aimed at school children aged 12 to 16 years for inclusion in schools civics programmes should be available for the next school year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister state what method will be used for distribution of the new handbook which comes out in September 1986?  Is he satisfied that the moneys being provided for Civil Defence are adequate for the reasonable needs of the organisation?  After making allowance for inflation, it appears that the money being spent on the Civil Defence organisation is probably decreasing in real terms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I should imagine that the distribution of the handbook would be as was the case before, namely, to every household.  I presume the same method will be followed on this occasion.  The amount of money is adequate.  Obviously I should like to be able to allocate more to Civil Defence but within the allocation I am satisfied that the service will be able to continue with their training operations and to do all the things we have come to depend on the organisation to do.  There are many experienced people there and the need for large capital expenditure for training many new people does not arise. There is much routine on-going training. There is not a high turnover in the Civil Defence organisation which is a tribute to the dedication of the volunteers in it.  I am satisfied that the money is reasonably adequate for the purposes required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister state who is responsible for training the people in the Civil Defence so far as nuclear fall out is concerned?  Is that done through the Army?  What is the brief of the Civil Defence and their inter-relationships <Col N="2681" /> with the Army and with the Garda Síochána in the event of nuclear fallout?  Who carries the authority and what is the liaison between the various groupings?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>At this stage the training is done by the Civil Defence themselves. Of course there is an Army input in the entire scheme via the observer corps.  The Deputy may be aware that two years ago I directed the up-grading of the observer corps from the previous point where to all intents and purposes the corps was non-operational.  It has been expanded significantly, involving FCA personnel throughout the country and in turn, they are in liaison with the Civil Defence authorities.  There is a comprehensive scheme of liaison between the Civil Defence, the military authorities and the Garda Síochána.</P>

      <P>I do not have a note of the number of vehicles acquired in 1985. I can tell the Deputy that 199 vehicles were disposed of, so presumably the replacements were of that order of magnitude. Disposals in 1986 are expected to be of the order of 100 to 130, so presumably the replacements will be roughly of that order of magnitude.  Replacements could possibly be less because some of the vehicles being disposed of are very old and the use made of them is quite insignificant.  It would not be the case of replacing on a one-to-one basis.  On the question of the standard of the fleet, of course the fleet is maintained to the normal standard of roadworthiness.</P>

Eight Cessna single engined aircraft are used for military duties, nine Siai Marchetti SF 260W single engined aircraft are used for pilot training, six Fouga Magister CM 170 twin-engined jet aircraft are used for pilot training and the British Aerospace HS 125 is used for ministerial transport.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>This delay is a great disappointment to me and to the personnel of the Air Corps.  It is due to the failure of the contractors to supply the very advanced avionics specified by the Air Corps.  It involved novel miniaturisation of some of the computer facilities on board.  The development and design of these features has given rise to difficulties because what has been prescribed is, in effect, novel.  It is hoped that the design difficulties have now been overcome and we are hopeful that the two Naval helicopters will be delivered in March and the remaining three before the end of the year.  I emphasise that this is what we hope.  We have specified avionic requirements up to the threshold of that art and in fulfilling our requirements there have been considerable and genuine technical difficulties.</P>

      <P>Having regard to the <Col N="2686" /> knowledge available, I imagine they are more likely to renew it than to terminate it.  That is a fairly modest way to put it. There is money due by some countries to the UN for the cost of the UNIFIL operation and of course the Department of Foreign Affairs are pursuing this matter through United Nations channels and are also pursuing the UN for arrears due to this country from them.  There has been no adverse effect on the overseas allowances by virtue of that financial position. In fact, when I visited Lebanon last October I was pleased to be able to announce a 15 per cent increase in overseas allowances backdated over some months.  I agree that experience in UNIFIL has been of considerable benefit to our Defence Forces.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that about 240,000 people are unemployed, would the Minister agree that this is a subject worthy of examination in order to ascertain the pros and cons of either voluntary or compulsory national service?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>It might well be a subject for consideration but I would be hesitant to accept the inherent point in the Deputy's question that we could deal with our unemployment problem through compulsory military service.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>That was the clear import of the Deputy's question.  It would be totally at odds with the tradition of military service in this country which was on a voluntary basis even during the Emergency.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that there are certain security dangers in making service in the Defence Forces open to all and sundry.  It can give rise to security dangers.  Given that there are so many people with nothing to do, would the Minister agree that it might be a worthwhile exercise to consider them for voluntary or compulsory national service?  It is at least a subject worthy of examination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is talking about voluntary national service.  I have to speak of a voluntary military service.  There is a form of national service available for unemployed people through the special employment scheme.  That is a form of national service, if you like.  I do not think it would be appropriate to use the Defence Forces.  It would not be the security considerations which would concern me because I have no doubt about the loyalty of the vast majority of our citizens, but it would be the policy element of compelling unemployed people to render military service when they might not want to do so.  That would <Col N="2688" /> not be in keeping with our traditions of voluntary service or for freedom for the citizen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The point could easily apply to all citizens, employed and unemployed. Should we consider the pros and cons of national service?  The Minister is giving an opinion but he has not, from his answer, examined the matter. Does he consider it worthy of examination?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The point the Deputy makes is interesting and has wide connotations. We can hardly get into a debate on the pros and cons of it here.  I would welcome a contribution from Deputy Mitchell when the Estimate for the Department comes up.  Such debate might well be got under way and that would be an ideal opportunity to start it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is missing the point.  Very many good people who are unemployed would like to be in a position to give some contribution to the State, and not a mandatory contribution. Can the Minister create a further opportunity for them to do that by extending recruitment within the FCA and making more funds and opportunities available in the FCA?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot say off the top of my head what the position is regarding vacancies in the FCA.  I answered the question on those lines for the Deputy in the last session here and as far as I can recall the information I had at that time was that, while there were waiting lists for some units, most units were in a position to take whoever applied to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2689" /> Obviously, they would like to be able to take everybody in all units but, as the Deputy has admitted in his question, there are financial implications which in the heel of the hunt have to be met by the taxpayer.</P>

    <P>15.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanByrne" hpid="Mr. S. Byrne Mr. S. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Public Service if he will give a report on the various negotiations held since Christmas with the public sector unions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>In the period after Christmas I had some 21 meetings with the following public service groups: Local Government and Health Services Staff Panel, Civil Service General Staff Panel, Civil Service (Higher) Staff Panel, and Teachers.  The Minister for Education also participated in these discussions.</P>
      <P>I met representatives of the Local Government and Health Services Staff Panel eight times between 6 and 17 of January, the Civil Service General Staff Panel five times between 8 and 20 of January, the Civil Service (Higher) Staff Panel four times between 9 and 20 of January and the teachers' unions four times between 2 and 15 of January.  The negotiations eventually resulted in a package of proposals covering the 25th round and other pay related matters. Details of the package are as follows:</P>
      <P>(1) 25th Round Agreement</P>
      <P>The overall length of the proposed agreement is 18 months with a pay pause of four months from 1 January 1986.  The proposed general pay increase involves a 3 per cent increase on 1 May 1986, 2 per cent on 1 January 1987 and a further 2 per cent on 1 May 1987.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2691" /> (2) Special Pay increases</P>
    <P>(a) Existing findings on special increases will be implemented in three phases over the period from 1 December 1986 to 1 July 1988.  (b) Other cases may be implemented in three phases over the period from 1 December 1987 to 1 July 1989.</P>
    <P>(3) Superannuation Lump Sums</P>
    <P>In the case of existing adjudication findings, superannuation lump sums would be paid as if the findings had been implemented on the dates recommended.</P>
    <P>
    </P>
    <P>The package of draft proposals has already been formally offered to three of the above groups of public servants and also to the main Garda associations. These terms were never formally offered to the teacher unions, because the teacher unions broke off negotiations on 15 January, with the result that I was unable to make an improved offer to them.  Since then the Government have decided &mdash; and the Dail has voted to support that decision &mdash; that the same terms as have been offered to the other groups should be offered to the teachers.</P>
    <P>The staff representatives in the other areas have agreed to consider, in accordance with their union or association procedures, the draft proposals for pay agreements covering the 25th round and other pay related matters.  These proposals incorporate an undertaking by both sides to engage in meaningful discussions to be concluded by 1 August 1986, on changes in the conciliation and arbitration in the schemes.  Subsequent to the conclusion of the negotiations a chairman was appointed to both the Local Government and Health Services Arbitration Board and the Civil Service Arbitration Board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been no reply as yet from any of the panels who undertook to put the draft agreement to the constituent unions or associations for consideration.  In other words, the Local Government and Health Services Panel, the Civil Service General Staff Panel and the Civil Service (Higher) Staff Panel have not yet come back with a reply.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I assume that no negotiations on the conciliation and arbitration scheme will be undertaken until they formally accept the proposals? If they reject them, there is to be no consultation.  Is that the position?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Negotiations on the terms of the conciliation and arbitration scheme are a matter which the Government have been very anxious to have for the past two years.  As I mentioned in the last part of my reply, the unions undertook to have those negotiations concerning possible changes in the scheme concluded by 1 August next.  I have not since pressed the panels to have those discussions until such time as they come back with the reply on the general package, but if I thought that the panels felt they were in a position to begin those negotiations now, I would be very pleased to enter into them in the next few weeks.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister mentioned that he had reappointed the arbitrator to the Local Government and Health Services Arbitration Board on the basis that none of the groups had formally accepted the offer put to them.  Why has the Minister not appointed the arbitrator to the other conciliation and arbitration boards?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The arbitrator has been appointed in the Local Government and Health Services scheme by agreement between the union side and the Local <Col N="2693" /> Government Staff Negotiation Board. That is because the staff panel agreed to take away the terms of the package which had been offered and to put it to their constituent unions or associations for a decision in the appropriate way.  On foot of their agreeing to do that, the decision was taken that an arbitrator would be reappointed in that case.  That applies similarly in the case of the Civil Service Staff Panel and Civil Service (Higher) Staff Panel.  In the case of both of those schemes the Government have agreed to the appointment of an arbitrator on foot of the same undertaking.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Since none of the groups within the public service has accepted the offer put to them by the Government, the Minister has told us today that he has reappointed the arbitrator to the Local Government and Health Services Arbitration Board and for the association of higher civil servants.  Why has he not reappointed the arbitrator for the other sections since they are also considering the proposals in the same way?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Government policy in relation to the embargo is set out in the White Paper <i>Serving the Country Better.</i> In brief it states that subject to the continuation of policy in relation to reducing the size of the Civil Service the present one in three embargo will be replaced by a system under which the appropriate overall staffing level to be reached by each Department a year hence will be determined by the Government.  This system will apply from 1986.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Some months ago during Question Time the Minister mentioned that he was asking each Department to come up with targets and proposals for filling staff vacancies in 1986 and that he would examine the proposals when they were returned to the Department of the Public Service.  Will he inform the House as to whether they have come back with proposals on the embargo?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>What was suggested was that instead of the one in three embargo operating as previously, the measure which would produce an equivalent effect would be introduced.  That measure would be a system whereby the staffing target for each Department in one year's time would now be set and the Department would be obliged to achieve that staffing level by whatever means they felt appropriate and the targets for each Department would be arrived at by the Government following consultation between the DPS and each of the Departments concerned.  That process is in train at the moment and I hope that it will be possible, in the course of the next few weeks, to decide on the appropriate staffing levels for each of the Departments concerned.  Those then would be the appropriate levels which the Departments would be expected to have reached by the end of December of this year.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister explain the difference between the embargo as it operated prior to this system and this system?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The embargo previously operated on the basis that only every third vacancy as it fell due could be filled. In this case the new system will have an equivalent effect to that of the embargo, but would be operated on the basis of setting targets for each Department and requiring the Departments to reach those staffing targets by the end of the particular year.  The staffing targets will be set taking into account the volume of work, the effect of the embargo on the particular Department so far, the projected work of the Department over the course of the year and the type of work being carried out.  Not wishing to raise the ire of the Deputy, let me say that this matter is dealt with more fully in a later question.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister give us an indication if it is the intention of the Government to deal with these <i>en bloc</i> or as individual Departments on an ongoing basis?  Will there be one decision by the Government and will any explanation be given in that review of the Departments whose development potential is at present being hampered by lack of staff? Will any consideration be given by his Department and the Government to provide the staff in areas where this can have a beneficial effect on development in various sectors and on job creation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Consultations with the individual Departments will have to take place individually, but the collective sum of those targets will have to produce the same overall result on Civil Service numbers as would have happened had the previous embargo continued to operate.  It may well be that there will be the necessity <Col N="2696" /> to make adjustments as between the desired staffing level of a Department and the way in which that level might fit in with the overall target for the size of the Civil Service by the end of this year. Initial discussions have been taking place with individual Departments.  They are in negotiation, shall we say, with my Department at present.  The result of those negotiations will be to produce a set of staffing targets for each Department, the overall effect of which would be to reach the embargo equivalent at the end of each year.</P>

      <P>The Minister has not mentioned the part of my question dealing with development within the Departments. Will there be any consideration of this, or will priority be given to where the provision of staff would help to create further employment opportunities?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>As I mentioned earlier, an effort has been made to take all factors into account, such as the previous effect of the embargo on one Department <i>visà-vis</i> another, whether the workloads of the Departments have increased or decreased, the projected work, whether the work is revenue generating or not and whether, as the Deputy suggests, the work might have an employment generating content.  An effort is being made to recognise all those factors.  It would, of course, be fair to say that, as the Deputy may recall, most individual Departments are quite convinced that their work is of paramount importance in the sphere of Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The reply in relation to points (a) (1) and (2) of the question is <Col N="2699" /> in the form of a tabular statement which I propose to circulate in the Official Report.  The table is attached.</P>
      <P>In relation to point (a) (3) of the question, under existing arrangements Departments are required to refer applications for job-sharing to my Department before refusal.  Therefore, it would be incorrect to regard applications which have been refused in individual Departments as finally decided until such time as the approval of my Department has been obtained.</P>
      <P>Under the arrangements referred to, however, one case involving two administrative officers in the Department of Finance has been referred to my Department.  The issues involved are being considered in detail in conjunction with the Department of Finance, with a view to seeing what can be done to facilitate the staff concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to point (b) of the question, problems have arisen regarding the inclusion of the diplomatic grades in the Department of Foreign Affairs and the <Col N="2700" /> administrative officer grade in the Department of Finance in the job-sharing scheme.  My Department are in consultation with the Departments concerned with a view to establishing what can be done to overcome the problems.</P>
    <P>As to point (c) the job-sharing scheme as announced by my Department is open to all grades in all Departments and, in this context, I am anxious to ensure that Departments make every effort to facilitate all applicants for job-sharing.  The unnecessary exclusion of certain grades from job-sharing would obviously not conform to either the objectives or the spirit of the scheme.  Nevertheless, in any scheme of this type problems of an exceptional nature may arise which require special consideration.  The intention would be that as far as possible no person would be precluded from working on a job-sharing basis if that person so wished and that no grade should be excluded from the scheme unless there are compelling reasons for doing so.</P>

      <P>In reply to a number of questions from me and also in the national plan, the Minister mentioned the introduction of a job-sharing career break scheme in the Civil Service, the object of which is to increase employment possibilities in the public service. On other occasions the Minister spoke of the helpful attitude of the Departments, the most recent occasion being in a Dáil debate on 4 December last.  In the case of the two administrative officers who applied for job sharing on 16 November 1984 the Department of the Public Service have been involved since 14 February 1985.  As tomorrow in 14 February 1986 I must point out to the Minister that there is little point in his Department getting involved if they have not done very much about the case one year later. Will the Minister give an indication to the House whether the two administrative officers being blocked by the Department of Finance, with or without the assistance of the Department of the Public Service have a justifiable case.  They are females. Will the Minister undertake to direct the Department of Finance to allow those women career breaks?</P>

      <P>As we said in the White Paper, the pattern of simplifying grades will be carried out progressively, but it is acknowledged that that will take some time.  While 700 grades is an enormous number, it has to be recognised that a great number of these are one person grades and relate specifically to specialised jobs.  For instance, there are in relation to the three largest grades, apart from general service grades, 1,200 prison officers, 795 agricultural officers and 712 tax officers.  There are large numbers in a relatively small number of grades and an enormous number of grades which contain one or two persons.</P>

In this context I would refer the Deputy to my reply to his Parliamentary Question for priority answer on Thursday 12 December 1985 which gave details of awards made but not paid.  As the Deputy is aware, I have recently concluded a series of negotiations with certain public service groups which resulted in a package of proposals covering the 25th round and other pay related matters. The unions concerned have agreed to consider, in accordance with their union procedures, the package of proposals. <Col N="2707" /> Pending the outcome of such consideration the Deputy will appreciate that it would be inappropriate for me to express any views on this matter.</P>

      <P>No.  I dealt with a similar question in the House some time ago. Two of the anomalies have already been remedied.  Three are of direct concern to the Minister for Social Welfare and are under examination in that Department. A Bill, being sponsored by the Minister for Justice to amend the law of domicile, is currently awaiting Second Stage in the Dáil.  The Minister for Finance is examining the Exchequer implications in relation to delayed payments and legislation is being prepared by the Minister for the Environment which will include provision to enable local authorities to deal with the type of cases the Ombudsman referred to as antiquated law.  The two anomalies that have already been remedied were dealt with by section 4 of last year's Finance Act which removed the tax anomaly which deprived some single parents of the single parent tax allowance. In relation to the anomaly concerning the valuation of property, the dates have been changed to facilitate the appeals procedure and a circular was <Col N="2709" /> issued by the Department of the Environment to each rating authority requesting them to notify individually occupiers of property affected by revaluations.  There has been some progress.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Public Service whether fees are refunded to civil servants pursuing educational courses of relevance to their work; whether there are any cases where such fees have not been or are not being so refunded; if so, the reasons for this; and if he will make a statement on the matter in view of the contents of Chapter 4 in the Government White Paper, <i>Serving the Country Better.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Fees are refunded for certain educational courses under arrangements agreed with staff.  The operation of these arrangements has been delegated to Departments and it is a matter for each Department to decide on individual cases where claims for refunds are made.  Departments in considering applications take into account the relevance of courses to work needs and the financial implications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2712" /> Cases arise, on occasion, where a refund is not allowed &mdash; for instance where a Department consider that a course is not sufficiently relevant.  It occasionally happens that a request has to be refused because of scarcity of funds in a particular year.  The majority of requests for refunds are, however, given a positive response.</P>
    <P>Chapter 4 of the White Paper deals with encouraging initiative and I strongly support the acquisition by public servants of relevant educational qualifications. The agreed arrangements for recoupment of fees help greatly to encourage officers to study relevant courses in their own time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>It is my understanding that there are difficulties in a number of Departments in the matter of having fees refunded.  I accept the Minister's support for the scheme, but perhaps he would send a memo to some of the Departments reminding them that it is with much difficulty that many civil servants avail of part time education.  Since most of the courses they attend are in the area of public administration their study is of benefit to the State, so the least that could be done is that the fees be refunded fairly promptly. I accept that the Department of the Public Service are not the ones at fault but there are a number of Departments involved.  These have delayed payments on the basis of a lack of funds.  Surely in the case of a Department with a budget of hundreds of millions of pounds, a fee of £1,000 would not break them.  The Minister's officials will know exactly the Departments I am referring to.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for the Public Service if there are special arrangements for the full time paid release of civil servants to complete university courses in public administration; if <Col N="2713" /> so, whether the staffing situation in Government Departments has led to any problems in staff being released for this purpose; and if so, whether he will make a statement on the matter in view of the contents of Chapter 4 in the Government White Paper, <i>Serving the Country Better.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Special arrangements are in existence for the full time paid release of civil servants to complete the final year of the Bachelor of Public Administration course at University College, Dublin.</P>
      <P>In general, Departments have been able to release staff for attendance.  However, on occasion, Departments have not been able to release individual officials due either to the staffing situation or the key role occupied by a particular person. I am committed to support arrangements for release for this course but it must be faced that from time to time a small number of officials will not be able to secure release.  The demands of the work must come first, but in general it is possible to meet these while giving release to most of those applying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that in their White Paper the Department of the Public Service are trying to encourage people to avail of these courses.  The details are set out at Chapter 4.  The course leading to a B.Sc. in public administration is the one that is most relevant to civil servants.  I understand that last year 15 people sought release from the public service to complete that course but that five of those experienced difficulty in that regard.  My information is, too, that last year three people in the Department of Health were refused release to take the course on the grounds of the staff situation.  I understand that the Minister for Health refused a request from the Taoiseach for the release of the people concerned.  Two people from the Department of Justice are being allowed sufficient time only to attend the lectures and they are required to make up for this time when they return to their offices. The crucial point is that without being released the people in question cannot complete the course after studying part <Col N="2714" /> time for three of four years on the understanding that they would be released for this purpose.  Therefore, would the Minister endeavour to have the matter remedied?</P>
      <P>I am making the request in the light of his earlier reply to me when he said that he was taking the opportunity to put on record his appreciation of the co-operation received from the Departments in the promotion and implementation of the schemes in the Civil Service and the plans to extend that scheme to the public sector.  The Minister went on to say that the success of the scheme is dependent largely on the goodwill and commitment of those responsible and he expressed his gratitude to the staff involved.  It seems to me that there are a number of people, not in the Department of the Public Service but in other Departments, who are either envious or are simply being uncooperative in regard to these schemes.  On the last occasion on which I highlighted this matter in the House I received a letter from the Secretary of one of the Departments, but I do not consider it my function to begin writing to Secretaries of Departments ticking them off, so perhaps the Minister might do so.  In a number of cases the Departments are being particularly unhelpful in trying to improve the public service.</P>

However, trainees, with the exception of a small number replaced recently, have received a day's induction course from the Civil Service Commission.  Departmental induction training has been given to many trainees and is being organised for the reminder. Also, trainees are eligible for inclusion in existing courses in the clerical area being run by departmental training officers.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the training gained in this way will be of considerable help to trainees seeking subsequent employment.</P>
      <P>Vacancies in the Civil Service are not being filled by temporary clerical trainees. In the circumstances a reply to the remaining parts of the question does not arise.</P>

      <P>I understand that during the year of training the trainees do two days induction training plus a half day doing career guidance at the end of the training period.  I understand the training is minimal.  The unions sought an induction training period of ten days with informal training in subjects like letter writing, dealing with the public telephone and so on.  Does the Minister think that those in the various Departments on training get only two and a half days actual training?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The temporary clerical trainees receive training every day.  The whole purpose of the scheme is that by their participation they learn by doing. Consequently, they receive training of a particular type every day.  There is some formal on-the-job training through the induction courses and it is hoped that later in the year there may be some offthe-job training as well.  The most important part of the scheme is that the trainees will be inculcated in discipline, including accuracy, punctuality and higher output, and they will become acclimatised to office environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said when I launched the scheme originally, one of the great difficulties many young people have is that when they attend for interview they are told that though their academic qualifications may be very good and though they may <Col N="2717" /> be suitable in every other way, they lack experience of office procedures.  This scheme gives 1,000 young people the benefit of a year's experience in office routines and procedures in the Civil Service which will stand them in very great stead when subsequently they attend for interviews in a commercial environment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister saying there is no connection between the facts that 1,100 clerical posts were lost in the Civil Service due to the embargo and that 1,000 trainees were taken on to do similar type of work?  Is there no coincidence there?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is doing me too great a credit when he speaks about 1,100 jobs.  There were 450 posts in the entire Civil Service suppressed last year through the embargo.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>This is probably the last question I will have an opportunity to ask Deputy Boland in his present capacity. What is the difference between the Civil Service training scheme and the work experience course in the National Manpower Service?  Why are those people simply not recruited from the National Manpower Service who are the State recruiting agency for training programmes? Why have an alternative one if there is not a sinister motive for it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The difference is that under the temporary clerical trainee scheme the trainees are recruited by me and trained by the Civil Service in a real Civil Service setting for a year.  The capacity exists to give these people training in the extensive system of the Civil Service not just in Dublin.  One-third of the training is done outside Dublin because of deliberate Government policy.  I reject the suggestion that the names should be recruited through Manpower. It is very important that people coming into the Civil Service, whether permanent or as trainees, should be recruited through the impartial machinery of the Civil Service Commission.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I will dwell a little on the main features of the budget, with emphasis on taxation, particularly personal taxation.  I have no doubt that, with unemployment, that is the single most important matter in the minds of most people.  Nobody believes that the overall burden of taxation could be reduced significantly by some kind of magic.  So, in making a positive move in the direction of reducing personal taxation levels, payment had to be made for it by indirect tax.  Given the choice and the constraints of the national finances, that was the correct way to do it and was largely in keeping with what people are telling all of us.  In that sense this is a <Col N="2757" /> budget which had its ear to the ground as to what people in the countryside are saying.</P>
      <P>Some criticism has been directed at the budget in that it did not put sufficient emphasis on employment.  People who say that must not have read it.  While the budget cannot tackle unemployment on its own, there were some items in the budget aimed at stimulating employment. The selective cuts in VAT can be seen as a significant stimulation to employment creation particularly in the tourism industry.  A number of measures are being introduced to promote investment in job creating industry.  A special tax relief is being introduced on research and development programmes.  It is strange that people say that the budget is not directed towards job creation because these are specific measures to encourage investment in employment creating industry.  The centrepiece of our current industrial policy embodies the need to encourage Irish and foreign companies to undertake research and development here.  Without research and development we will only be a nation of assemblers and not real manufacturers.  I commend that measure.</P>
      <P>There are also other measures.  Capital gains tax is often an emotive subject and there is a general failure to distinguish between capital gains tax on long or medium term investment in jobs and the kind of capital gains tax which should be applied to quick windfall or speculative gains.  The budget targets concessions in this area and reduces the rate of capital gains tax for that purpose from 40 per cent to 35 per cent.  I hope successive Governments will continue down that track.  If one looks at other countries one sees a clear connection between the way capital gains tax operates in industrial investment and the degree of industrial investment that occurs.  In France the rate of capital gains tax in comparable area is 15 per cent, in the UK it is 30 per cent, in Germany it is nil, in Japan it is nil, and in the US it was reduced in 1978 to 20 per cent from just over 40 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The effect of the reduction in the US is probably the most significant case.  In <Col N="2758" /> the period from 1979 to date the upsurge of venture capital investment in the US is probably the most significant feature of American industrial expansion and job creation.  A person who invests money in a venture capital fund expects to realise profits in the future usually within about five years.  If, having risked one's money and made a profit, a large percentage is taken off that profit one is less likely to invest in risky investments.  It is clear that the Germans and Japanese who are amongst the most successful in solving unemployment and promoting growth have no capital gains tax on that type of investment.  The US followed suit in 1978 with significant dramatic results.  I urge the Minister and his successor to continue that policy.  The Minister should by all means exact capital gains tax at substantial rates on speculative or windfall gains but not on the kind of medium to long term investments in industrial promotion and job creation which we so badly need. I welcome that constructive measure in the budget.</P>
    <P>There is an item in the budget which will be spelled out in the Finance Bill to benefit investors in Irish companies. There has been a problem in that many business people here will say that if one were a foreigner one would get more favourable treatment from our tax and company system.  That is an absurdity when we talk so much about building up indigenous industry.  This is a move to correct that.  These are very specific targeted measures to aid investment in industry and I welcome them.</P>
    <P>In general I welcome the measure in relation to deposit interest.  It is in keeping with the recommendations of the Commission on Taxation.  We are constantly pilloried for disregarding recommendations of that Commission and now that we have taken this recommendation on board we are criticised.  There is no doubt that it must be a progressive measure to put the financial institutions on an equal footing competing for funds.  In doing that it is important that we would not do something which would be unjust to some groups.  There is that danger in relation to three categories of people. <Col N="2759" /> Both Deputy John Kelly and Deputy Lyons spoke about it already today. People who do not have a taxable income should not be required to pay any tax.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">

    <Speaker pid="HughCoveney" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>Secondly, there are charities and a whole group of people involved in social work or sporting and recreational facilities.  Some of these people have money on deposit while they are collecting funds and it would be wrong to tax the interest on those funds. There is also a problem relating to children. If a parent puts £100 into a bank for a child when he is born I understand the child is not permitted to remove that money until he is seven.  In some cases the groups could remove their money and consider putting it where this tax would not affect it, but children will not have that choice.  The Minister should look again at how some exceptions could be made to deal with these cases.  At the moment there are some alternatives but they would not be suitable to every case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The savings certificate scheme and index linked savings bonds as well as deposits with credit unions are exempted from this tax so that some people would have the option to invest in those areas. From speaking to people I have found that many are living on the interest earned on bank deposits and that these alternative sources to which they could apply their funds do not generally provide for removing money on a weekly basis. Something must be done in that regard because, very often, they are the people in greatest need.  Many of those in the Cork area who got redundancy money invested it in a deposit account and are living on the income from it.  Therefore, one cannot justify taking 35 per cent off that income because, in many instances, it is marginal.  I hope the Minister will recognise that there is a general consensus in the House regarding this issue. I heard him say outside the House that administratively it would be extremely difficult because of the huge number of deposit accounts.  Nevertheless that is not <Col N="2760" /> a sufficient argument and justice must be done in relation to this issue.</P>
    <P>The rates of building societies, generally speaking, after deduction of income tax, have been superior, even after tax, to those of the bank rates before tax.  I wonder why people deposit their money in banks when they could get a better rate of interest in building societies.  It may relate to the extra flexibility which one has with funds in a bank and a natural inclination to regard it as more secure, although there is no substance in that argument.</P>
    <P>Despite the difficult financial situation and the fact that one would always like to do more, the Minister can hold his head up and say that social welfare payments have been indexed to inflation, or even slightly better, depending on the rate this year.  Of course people will say payments are still too low and that those living on social welfare are on the margins of a viable living style.  Nonetheless, increased social welfare payments are against the trend throughout Europe. Over the past three or four years some countries who could perhaps afford it better than we can have not increased payments and the Government should be commended for seeing that as a priority even in difficult financial circumstances.</P>
    <P>I have mixed views about reading out on budget day a list of sums of money payable to very good causes.  That demeans the budget because one is talking about billions of pounds and to read out a litany of relatively small sums of money is a bit pointless.  The items are good in themselves but I do not think the budget speech is necessarily the best place in which to announce them.  I am glad the Cork Opera House and the enterprise board each got a grant of £50,000. Deputy Lyons thought this was a means of buying votes in Cork but, if he spoke to the board and the staff of the Opera House, he would realise that the grant has ensured the viability of the Opera House for the foreseeable future.  It is unfair to suggest that it is simply a vote catching exercise.  The same is true of the Cork Enterprise Board.  They have just <Col N="2761" /> been established and grew out of the experience of a year of celebrating Cork 800 and a belief that people can do better for themselves by getting up and doing something rather than calling in the Government to do it for them.  It is also a notable partnership between the statutory bodies and the private sector.  It is very encouraging that the Government saw fit to give them a grant.</P>
    <P>The grant of £150,000 to women in a business enterprise programme is very interesting.  It is innovative because, in the United States, President Reagan set up a commission to study the subject of enterprise.  One of the most interesting features to emerge from that study was that women are substantially more enterprising than men if given the opportunity. The main problem was that they had not been given the opportunity and I am sure the same applies in this country.  There are very few women in top management or entrepreneurial positions here and this kind of grant to study and encourage such development is worthy of support because there is tremendous potential in the ability of women to create and promote business activity.  Sometimes in Ireland it is regarded as a male domain, which is nonsense, because if you look at the results of the leaving certificate year in year out, it is clear that girls consistently outpoint boys.  They start off with added advantages at that stage but somehow or other very little of that talent is channelled to job creation and business activity with job creation potential.  I welcome that signal from the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>The state of the economy is still relatively stagnant.  Despite the fact that there are good signs here and there, our finances are still in a very tight fiscal bind. That has been the case for some years and will continue like that for the remainder of the decade.  Some of the reasons for that are historical but of all the taxation gathered in, broadly divided, one third goes to service the national debt, one third pays the salaries of the public service and one third is left for everything <Col N="2762" /> else.  While we are bound up in that triangle we cannot get the economy moving.</P>
    <P>People attack the Minister for Finance for being obsessed with figures and monetarism but the same will be true of any Minister for Finance in the foreseeable future.  Their critics ignore the fact that our finances are and will continue to be in a difficult and precarious situation supported by levels of foreign borrowing which will not be sustainable for much longer and require firm action.  There is a necessity to control and reduce Government expenditure.</P>
    <P>The new party, the Progressive Democrats, are holding meetings around the country and getting an enormous response.  Their leader has been saying over and over again that there is no option but to take tough decisions and he is gaining in popularity.  I find it ironical that he is saying the same thing as our Ministers are saying, and gaining in popularity but I suppose if you are in government you must do what you say you will do.  There is no easy way to make cuts. There is no point in saying you would not have made the same cuts as the Minister. You have to say exactly what cuts you would make.  It is ironical that the Government are doing what the Progressive Democrats are advocating, yet they are losing in the opinion polls while the Progressive Democrats are gaining.  I presume that is a part of the price one must pay when one is in power.</P>
    <P>We must be more adept when it comes to making decisions because, as a newspaper pointed out in their leader last Sunday, it is much more important to do something than to get the cosmetics right, although in political terms the cosmetics make as much impact as the actual decision. We have to tell the people that we will cut taxation and public expenditure, but if we reduce taxation by 10 per cent the people will have to bear with us and do with fewer public services which would be linked to those tax cuts.  If taxation concessions are given in a budget and they are followed by a series of cuts, very often people do not link one with the other.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2763" /> It is the business of politicians not only to do what is best for the country, but also to carry the country with them and convince them that this is the best course of action.  I believe this is the best course of action, but we have not been successful in selling that message to the people.  I hope this message gets across particularly to the young people who must wonder what kind of a country this is.  We would all love to invest in an enormous growth package if we had the money, but it would not be right if, to do so, we had to sell their future as well as that of their children by borrowing, even if we were able to do it.</P>
    <P>Unemployment is the problem of the age, not just in Ireland but all over the world.  In a period of six years the numbers of unemployed have trebled.  In October 1979 there were 83,000 unemployed and now, six years later, that figure stands at 240,000.  This increase took place when Fianna Fáil and Coalition Governments were in power.  If there is one thing which should unite this House it is the realisation that this problem will not just go away and that minor adjustments in policy will not correct it.  This is a problem which whoever is in power will have to grind at slowly and with great difficulty.</P>
    <P>If we look at the causes of unemployment we will see how particularly difficult the problem is for us.  Basically there are four causes, two of them outside our control and two which are peculiar to us.  The first reason is the international recession, which is no longer the primary cause because the situation has eased, if not reversed.  The second is the changing pattern of economic activity and the substitution of machines for people, which seems to be a pre-requisite for survival in the competitive manufacturing and business world.  The third cause is the costs and competitiveness of our own economy, and the fourth is the growth in the labour force.  That is almost unique to us.</P>
    <P>The best estimates of labour force growth were that between 1984 and 1991 there would be an extra 100,000 people on the jobs market.  In other words, by <Col N="2764" /> 1991 we need to create another 100,000 jobs in order to remain at the present intolerable level.  If we were to reduce unemployment to, say, 100,000 and replace lost jobs, we would require another 200,000 jobs.  This means we would need to create 300,000 new jobs or 43,000 per annum.  Even at the best of times, we never approached that the kind of figure.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether people realise the magnitude of the problem or if they are afraid to mention it, but I do not believe that sweeping this problem under the carpet will solve anything.  We should not be unduly dismayed because the problem is more difficult and greater than problems we have had to overcome before.  First we have to understand the facts.  We need to create 40,000 plus jobs each year until 1991 if we are to stem the increase in unemployment and begin to get the figures down to an acceptable level.  To do that we must move on every front.  We should do conventional things better and look at unconventional and innovative ways to achieve our objective. If necessary, we need to mix ideologies. We need the State, the private sector and combinations of both, but we do not need a long debate on ideology.  It is clear that no matter what part of the world we look at, no single ideology had provided an answer to unemployment.</P>
    <P>We have a great opportunity facing us now because this county, by its nature, lends itself to a mixture of private and public enterprise and we should encourage that at every level.  With regard to the measures needed to combat unemployment, we must get the financial base right.  We must continue to work on reducing wasteful Government expenditure and reducing borrowing and taxation. That is a difficult combination but it must be an absolute priority if we are to make any real impact on unemployment.</P>
    <P>We have made tremendous strides with regard to inflation.  Not many years ago prices were increasing at 20 per cent or more but now the rate is 5 per cent. However, there is no room for complacency because most of the member states of the EC have a rate of 3 per cent.  We <Col N="2765" /> must not allow ourselves to be priced out of markets.  That means that we must have wage restraint and moderation, although those are not the only factors.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lyons referred to interest rates.  There are international factors over which we have no control in relation to interest rates but we have control over domestic factors.  One of the major features of the international scene today is that interest rates greatly exceed the rate of inflation in most countries.  The reason is that Governments generally have been taking too much money out of the system and are forcing up the price of money. The question of reducing interest rates is tied up inextricably with the need to get our overall finances right and to reduce the amount necessary to run the country. At the moment Government spending represents about two-thirds of our output.  The Government have been sucking up too much money.  All Governments have been doing that in the past ten or 15 years, not just here but in other countries.  There is now the realisation that that is squeezing the private sector and others who want to borrow funds but who cannot do so.  The Government are forcing up interest rates and making it uneconomic for people to borrow and to invest in job creation.</P>
    <P>People may weary of listening to the need for Irish industry to improve their competitiveness.  However, we are in a competitive world.  Our industry grew out of a protected environment and perhaps it was needed in its time to protect fledgling industries.  It has taken us a long time to realise that the world does not owe us anything.  We must be able to compete from the point of view of price, quality and delivery dates.  We must do everything possible to remain competitive because only in that way will we be able to create more employment.  The Government should continue to concentrate on increasing incentives to invest, particularly in indigenous manufacturing industry.  Some of the budget measures in this regard are to be welcomed.  We must continue on that line.  We cannot turn around in next year's budget and concentrate on something else.  We are <Col N="2766" /> headed down that road and we must progress in that direction.</P>
    <P>We must find means of encouraging the private services sector to grow.  It has been shown elsewhere that the modern trend is that manufacturing jobs have tended to reduce in more developed economies while private sector services jobs have tended to grow.  We have a taxation system and financial inducements that almost oppose that trend because we single out manufacturing consistently for preferential treatment.  That is justified in some respects but at times we ignore the job creating potential of the private services sector.  For that reason I was glad to see in the budget specific measures for reductions in VAT rates on certain elements of the services sector, particularly tourism.</P>
    <P>There is a necessity to consider if certain disincentives to employment can be maintained indefinitely in the face of the appalling unemployment figures.  The PRSI tax is a payroll tax.  In essence, the more people a firm employ the more they pay.  This discriminates against any form of labour intensive industry.  I wonder if we should not consider an alternative to that, although I accept that would be a radical move.  If we could relate PRSI to turnover rather than to the numbers employed it would no longer be a disincentive to employment; in fact, it might be the reverse.  In that event if a company employed more people they would pay less per head in respect of PRSI.  I have not thought this out in detail and I am sure there would be problems but I think it is a matter that should be considered. We talk a lot about giving absolute priority to the creation of employment but yet we have a tax system that is diametrically pushing in the opposite direction. The difference between the gross and net pay of most employees is a provocation, to say the least.  Therefore, any move to narrow that gap must be welcome. While the measures in the budget are only a start, at least they are a move in the right direction.</P>
    <P>Legislation to protect employees with regard to unfair dismissal and redundancy was introduced at a different time <Col N="2767" /> and in a different era.  Most people thought it was just and progressive but when I speak to young people today they question the value of such legislation if it prevents employers from taking on more people.  What good is it to an unemployed person to know that we have on the Statute Book legislation dealing with unfair dismissal?  I am not suggesting we should dismantle the legislation that has been sought for generations but we should look again at the effect of that legislation on the minds and the mentality of employers who see it as a threat.  The normal reaction of an employer who may be considering employing a person is that it is not worth the hassle involved if he has to let him go.  Quite often that employer will decide to work overtime and to work harder.  In Germany they are perhaps ahead of us with regard to legislation for the protection of employees.  However, they have a system that ensures that an employee will enjoy protection for 18 months after commencement of his work. Thus, the employer is encouraged to take on a person in the knowledge that there will not be an enormous hassle if he has to let him go.  At least after 18 months he should know whether he wants to take him on the permanent payroll.  Then, of course, he is entitled to all the normal protections.  If we say our priority is to do something about the unemployed rather than to increase the protection for those who are fortunate enough to be employed, we have to look at those measures.</P>
    <P>There are other disincentives to employment unrelated to that topic.  One of the most notable is the impact of employers' liability insurance on companies. What is happening to insurance premiums is absolutely staggering but there is no use in bashing insurance companies. I am sure the competitive system between insurance companies works reasonably well and that there is not a cartel as such.  Nevertheless the increase in premiums has become a major burden on companies and nowadays they cannot operate without employers' liability insurance.  Much of the problem arises <Col N="2768" /> from the legal system and the cost and method of setting claims.  I am pleased that the Government have taken the decision to eliminate the jury system in certain cases but there are some other fundamental inefficiences in the legal system which must be tackled as well. In any High Court case both sides are required to have four legal representatives in the court &mdash; a solicitor, two seniors and a junior.  There may also be many professional witnesses and so on. The county simple cannot afford that. In Britain I understand they have moved from two seniors to one senior.  The Government and the Minister for Justice must apply themselves to tackling that problem.  Many Deputies have spoken about it.  The necessity for so many legal representatives on both sides seems to be exacerabating greatly the costs associated with these cases.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the subject of food processing. I refer especially to the record of a small country in Europe about one third the size of Ireland, namely, the Netherlands. This small country is the second largest producer of all the produce of the soil, after the United States.  It is ahead of Brazil, Argentina and Russia.  This tiny country which has many disadvantages is nevertheless the second largest producer of the produce of the land.  We should look at that because we are importing more food than oil.  Last year £850 million was spent on food imports.  There are many changes mooted today and I hope one of them will be the creation of a ministry of food production.  This hot potato resides in many different Departments and as a result we have been unsuccessful over generations in developing the potential of the food processing business. We cannot afford to continue along that line.</P>
    <P>Another area of great potential is tourism. The tax measures in the budgets of this year and last year have recognised the potential of this service industry to develop and grow in the years ahead.  It is a great potential job creator.  We have to face up to the problem of getting here and Governments will have to address the problem of the expense of travelling <Col N="2769" /> to Ireland.  It is in some ways an advantage to be an island but in other respects it is not.</P>
    <P>There is a lot of debate, much of it emotional and ideological, about the private versus the public sector and privatisation seems to be talked about more and more.  We should not waste our energy on the ideological arguments since there are other ways of achieving progress.  In the United Kingdom the success of manager-worker buy-outs of industries has been noteworthy, particularly in the case of the National Freight Corporation.  We should look at the possibility of identifying a suitable semi-State company and having a carefully detailed study of the possibilities of selling that company to those who work in it.  It is a technical subject but there are innovative ways of doing it.  The workers do not have to put up large sums of money.  There are methods of IOUs and bank facilities which can be used to bring about this possibility.  We cannot continue to sustain heavy losses in one semi-State sector after another and we must therefore look, in the interest of the taxpayer who pays for everything, to see where there are more efficient ways to do it.  The only way at present seems to privatise or publicise, but there are other ways.  We should examine them and not be diverted by the ideological luxuries of left and right.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer briefly to the decentralisation of power.  We must face up to restoring the fact as well as the name of local government.  The present arrangements are such that local government is a misnomer.  Local government, properly structured, with the power to raise finance and the responsibility for dealing with it, would have the potential to create jobs.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lyons mentioned the construction industry.  I work in that industry and share some of his concerns about it. There is a difference of view about the construction industry.  There is a suggestion at times that it is almost an end in itself, whereas in reality it is simply a reflection of the state of the economy and therefore I do not think that it is easy to <Col N="2770" /> stimulate it automatically with large sums of money.</P>
    <P>In relation to the promotion of this country abroad we need to take a fresh look at agencies like the IDA, Bord Fáilte and CTT and in particular to consider internationalising the boards of those companies to some extent, because their primary functions in promoting the country arise outside the country.  Very often, particularly in the US, the presence of one or two prominent Irish Americans would be a significant advantage to the country.  A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, how much time have I?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I want to say something about the spark which might set the economy alight.  I have talked to people in business, to workers, to bankers and others and asked them the same question: what did they think should be done to lift this economy?  Most people come back with the same answer: why not get oil and gas ashore?  This country commenced the search for oil not in 1971 when the first gas field was declared commercial but way back in 1959.  We are now in 1986 and we have not a single commercial oil discovery.  We have one commercial gas discovery which we are using up very quickly.  That is not satisfactory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not geology that is the problem but, for whatever reason, if the large companies in particular are not here &mdash; I am talking about the large multinationals &mdash; then something is wrong.  The terms lack preciseness and the market is saying loud and clear that the terms are not sufficiently attractive.  The Government have a duty to manage this resource for the benefit of the country, not to give it away, but to get the best possible advantage for the taxpayer and the people, to <Col N="2771" /> get oil discovered and developed for the benefit of the whole community.  Very often the preoccupation is with ideology rather than practicality.  The question of State participation is in the lap of the gods.  There are formulate.  People can draw their own conclusions, but people who are making business decisions need to know where they stand, and they do not know.</P>
    <P>I will conclude by saying that much has to be done.  The thrust of the budget is in the right direction and we must go forward from here.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to have this opportunity to speak on the 1986 budget. I note that the Minister for Finance is not in the House to hear the comments of all the Deputies who wish to contribute.  Let me start by saying that this Coalition have failed the young people and the business and farming people and the Taoiseach has failed his own political party.  Therefore, I suggest that he make the honourable decision to resign and call a general election&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>This budget has done little or nothing to give our people anything to trust, hope or believe in.  It is now obvious that the people want a change of Government.  It is wrong for any Government to stay in office when the people have lost confidence in them.  There must be confidence, hope, trust and belief behind any successful business and the Government must be in business if their policies are to be successful.  The longer such a Government as this stay in office the more harm they will do to the economy. Today our people are becoming more and more cautious of investing their money at home in their own country.</P>

      <P>I have got the question and I will answer it.  The procedure that is being adopted is a procedure that has been adopted on many previous occasions when there was a change in the personnel of the Government.  It is done by way of announcement by the Taoiseach. There is no motion before the House.  There is no response or speech from any other person.  Even since I assumed office in the Chair this precedent has been followed and I was following long established precedents.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the Chair for permitting me to raise this issue on the Adjournment.  With the permission of the Chair I should like to share my time with Deputies McCarthy and Griffin, who are from the same constituency. Unfortunately, Deputy Seán Treacy was not available to share the time.  The Plunder and Pollack tannery in Carrick-on-Suir up to 1980 employed almost 300 people with branches in Portlaw and Dungarvan in the constituency of the Minister of State.  It created valuable employment in Carrick-on-Suir but in mid-1980 there was a loss of 170 jobs. The industry was worth £1.3 million to the local economy in wages annually.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to tell the House that 34 <Col N="2782" /> per cent of the population are unemployed while the national average is 18 per cent.  The male unemployment amounts to 40 per cent which is shocking for any town of its size.  Over the years Plunder and Pollack developed markets throughout the world for their products and at the time they closed down in mid1985 they had guaranteed orders that would carry them on for at least two years.  The workforce had a great track record as far as attendance and skill was concerned.  The town has also suffered greatly from the closure of other industries but I will not deal with them today.</P>
    <P>I should like to thank the Minister of State, and Minister Bruton, for devoting a lot of time to this matter and appeal to them to speed up the opening of the new industry in the town.  The factory was taken over six or eight months ago and the people in the area are very worried as to when it will open.  I appeal to the Minister of State to do his utmost to see to it that the factory is opened very soon.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMcCarthy" hpid="Dr. McCarthy Dr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support the words of Deputy Byrne and thank him for giving me an opportunity to say something in support of the workers in the town of Carrick-on-Suir.  In the town unemployment is rife.  Carrick-on-Suir has had a bad history in the last couple of years in regard to employment. Recently an IDA developed factory, Rexnord, closed and that was followed by Plunder and Pollack being put into receivership.  As a result there are almost 700 people unemployed in the town, giving an unemployment average of almost 34 per cent or double the national average.  Of the number unemployed almost 50 per cent are males.  One can see from those figures that most of the male population of the town do not have jobs.  That is unfortunate.  The tradition in the tannery works was handed down from father to son and the workforce was very responsible.  Labour relations were exceptionally good and there was never a major strike.  Recently the Irish Leather group of companies were purchased by a private individual whom I met within the <Col N="2783" /> last ten days.  I emphasised to him the need to get some type of development going in the town.  I know he has already put into operation plans for Dungarvan and Portlaw, but I would appeal to him and to the Minister to consider Carrick-on-Suir in the light of an area in which development can proceed on a profitable basis.  It may be that there will be a decision not to continue with the type of work that was carried on there before, but I trust that, in their discussions with the new owner, the Department will develop some special form of grant aid through the IDA so that employment in the plant can be re-established.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanGriffin" hpid="Mr. Griffin Mr. Griffin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Griffin</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleagues, Deputy Byrne and Deputy McCarthy for allowing me some of their time on this question and I join with them in urging the Minister to take an interest in Carrick-on-Suir.  My colleagues from South Tipperary and I are at one in this matter.  No one is trying to gain any political advantage from the misfortunes of the people of Carrick-on-Suir.</P>
      <P>As has been outlined by my colleagues, the level of unemployment in the town may be a national record.  Unfortunately this is the most blighted part, in terms of employment, in the South Tipperary constituency and that is why, in a united voice, we are asking the Minister to do something for the workers of Carrick-on-Suir.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Irish Leathers was purchased on 11 November by the International Hide and Skin Company.  This move was welcomed widely by the people of the town in the belief that their tannery in which they had a justifiable pride would continue in existence.  However, in the six months that have elapsed since then there have been no indications that the plant would be reopened as a full bovine tannery as was the case before.  I understand that the International Hide and Skin Company are making an application for grant assistance to the IDA.  I urge the Minister to grant this assistance immediately so that the plant may reopen.  There are very good reasons for reopening it.  It is the <Col N="2784" /> only full bovine tannery facility remaining in Ireland so that if it remains closed the country will be totally dependent on imports from other EC countries and perhaps from countries outside the Community. With hide prices falling and energy costs generally on a downward trend, it should be very attractive financially to continue the leather finishing process. In the past the plant at Carrick-on-Suir was very viable.  Despite keen competition from foreign markets there was a consistent demand for the home product mainly due to its high standard.</P>
    <P>Another factor is that in Carrick-on-Suir and the surrounding areas there is a fully trained workforce.  That workforce could be recruited at short notice.  Its average age is 30 to 35 years.</P>
    <P>Industrial relations at the tanning plant were very satisfactory.  There has never been a major strike in its long history.  I understand from the trade unions and the workers that they welcome the new ownership and will co-operate with the new owner in every way possible.  Their one concern is that the tannery be reopened so as to provide much needed employment in the area.</P>
    <P>The demand for leather currently is good and that trend is continuing upwards.  Before the closure of the plant, market prices were substantially export orientated.  I understand that at the time the plant closed 80 per cent of the orders were for foreign markets.  The people of Carrick-on-Suir take great pride in their range of customers which include the British and the Polish Ministeries of Defence both of which down through the years depended on the standard product from Carrick-on-Suir.  The continuous placing of orders by these outlets with the plant was an indication of the high quality of the finished product.</P>
    <P>Other industries in the town have suffered in the recent past.  Though it was anticipated that Rexnord would expand, it closed and there was the closure also of Powers, a local bottling company.  This left no major male employment outlet in the town.  I understand that there are branches of the International Hide and Skin group in the constituency of the <Col N="2785" /> Minister of State but I would emphasise to the Minister the plight of Carrick-on-Suir which is half way between the major towns of Waterford and Clonmel.  In the case of the plant in question much of the workforce was drawn from Carrick-on-Suir. I trust that we will be able to convey to the people of the town this evening some hope and some bright prospects for the continuation of a full bovine tannery in the town.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. E. Collins) Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. E. Collins)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. E. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me say straight away that I have every sympathy with the concern expressed by Deputy Byrne and also by Deputy McCarthy and Deputy Griffin about the former Irish Leathers factory in Carrick-on-Suir.  It is always sad when an industrial project closes down, especially when it is a traditional area of production. I realise fully, as the State agencies realised, the strategic importance of that industry to the economy.</P>
      <P>Before commenting in detail on Carrick-on-Suir, however, I think it worth while to give a very brief history of the events leading up to the closure of a number of Irish Leathers' plants.</P>
      <P>The Irish Leathers group were a strong cornerstone of indigenous Irish industry for many years with plants in Dungarvan, Portlaw, Carrick-on-Suir and Carlow. Unfortunately, however, the group began to incur losses from 1978 and it was apparent that there was a number of weaknesses in the group which militated against successful trading.  Fóir Teoranta put in a lot of finance but, sadly, losses continued and they had no choice but to appoint a receiver in June 1985.  By that time Irish Leathers had been the subject of the highest moneys ever invested by Fóir Teoranta in a company in difficulties &mdash; more than £8 million.  The effort was not successful and that 370 workers in the different plants lost their jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my role of Minister of State responsible for the sectoral aspects of Irish industry, I urged that every effort should be made to have this traditional industry revived as soon as possible and in a form <Col N="2786" /> which would assure us of long term viability.</P>
    <P>In 1985, International Hide and Skin, a large hide and skin merchanting group, purchased the Irish Leathers assets from the receiver.  Since the purchase of the assets, International Hide and Skin have been involved in a detailed assessment of the viability of each of the plants involved. The new owners have spent a substantial sum in refurbishment while a considerable amount of time has also been spent examining plant and process lay out and the most modern equipment that needs to be installed.  There is a need to update the machinery and the processing facilities generally.</P>
    <P>The Minister met a deputation comprised of local interests in Carrick-on-Suir last Friday.  Deputy Byrne was a member of the deputation.  He will be aware that the Minister indicated that the IDA were considering a proposal from the new owners of Irish Leathers but that the matter was complex and he was not in a position to give any details without breaching the confidentiality of the matter. The Deputies will accept that, as do I. The Minister indicated that the viability of all plants within the Irish Leathers group, including Carrick-on-Suir, was being assessed and that the IDA would give full consideration to proposals put forward.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to say that the IDA are on the verge of concluding a restructuring package with the company which, if accepted, will lay down a path for the orderly and viable revival of this stategically important indigenous Irish industry.  This is the turning point and I hope it will result in the successful revival of this tanning industry which is important not only to Waterford but to the country as a nation.</P>
    <P>I know Deputies will appreciate that it is in nobody's interests to try to anticipate the outcome of the grant application proposals as premature statements could very easily jeoparadise negotiations between the promoters and the IDA.  I need hardly tell the House that I have, perhaps, an even greater interest in the matter than the Deputies because of the <Col N="2787" /> Dungarvan and Portlaw connection, but I intend to await the full deliberations of the IDA before making any statements, because of confidentiality.  Having said that, I am very hopeful of a satisfactory outcome to the negotiations and I look forward to seeing a restructured group which will regain the former glories of the Irish Leather industry.</P>
    <P>I understand there will be need for a phased development of the group's activities. I do not wish to go beyond that point now because it will be the promoter's decision as to the time scale.  It will be necessary to accept the IDA package and then the promoter can go about his own business.  I know he is committed to the industry, in which he has an excellent record.  He is going about this in a sensible way that will ensure viability in the long run.</P>
    <P>I note the points made by the Deputies in regard to unemployment generally in Carrick-on-Suir.  They will agree that the Minister, Deputy Bruton, gave the deputation a sympathetic hearing &mdash; I have seen the notes of the meeting.  He indicated that the IDA will consider the position generally with a view to considering the possibilities that exist for new industry.  I will be examining those possibilities.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Griffin said, Rexnord closed in Carrick-on-Suir.  I was most unhappy about the proposed replacement industry from within Rexnord.  For <Col N="2788" /> reasons known to the Deputies, the industry did not go to Carrick-on-Suir. Deputies know of my uneasiness and displeasure about the reasons why it was not possible to persuade the group to bring another company to Carrick-on-Suir. We all appreciate that there is a need for good industrial relations and for understanding between trade unions, employees and employers: good industrial relations are a <i>sine qua non</i> of industrial progress.  We face intense competition abroad.  We have an obligations to ensure that good industrial relations will be maintained and that nothing will be done to jeoparadise the prospects for industrial establishment.  I say this in a general sense because it refers to the whole country.  Good industrial relations and a flexible attitude to the needs of industry are required at a time when technology has changed things so rapidly and when the needs of industry are changing rapidly.</P>
    <P>Deputies can be fully assured that I will keep a note of what they have said in relation to unemployment in Carrick-on-Suir and that my Department will continue to bring the importance of Carrick-on-Suir to the notice of promoters so that they will visit the town with a view to establishing industries there.</P>

      <P>The superannuation Vote for which my Department is responsible relates to the Civil Service only.  The number of retired civil servants in receipt of pensions from this Vote is approximately 8,000.  Pensions are also paid from this Vote to the spouses of approximately 3,300 deceased civil servants.  The current annual cost of these pensions is about £41.33 million.  As regard amendments to the scheme, the Deputy will have noted the pension concessions referred to in the recent Budget Statement by the Minister for Finance.  These concessions which apply to the public service as a whole are as follows:</P>
      <P>Firstly, the Government have decided, in the context of the recent pay discussions with public service staff interests, that as and from 1 July of this year public service pensioners will benefit from special pay increases with effect from the same dates as these increases apply to serving staff.  The previous practice was to adjust pensions once a year only, to take account of increases arising during the preceding 12 month period.  The new arrangement, known as pension parity, was first introduced by the Government in 1983 in relation to general pay increases.  The latest Government decision means that, for the future, pension parity will apply to all pay increases affecting public servants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly, the Government has increased the rates of pension payable under public service widow's and children's <i>ex gratia</i> pension schemes.  In the public service generally, contributory widows' and children's pension schemes were introduced, from 1968 onwards. The <i>ex gratia</i> schemes provide benefits to <Col N="2720" /> the widows and children of staff who were excluded from the contributory schemes because they had retired or died before such schemes were introduced.  Since 1979, the rates of pension payable under the <i>ex gratia</i> schemes have been fixed at ?ths of the rates payable under the corresponding contributory schemes. These will now be increased to 11/12ths of the contributory rates with effect from 1 January 1986 and to 100 per cent of the contributory rates with effect from 1 January 1987.</P>

      <P>The Government have decided that the law will be changed to provide that established civil servants up to and including clerical officer level may in future be dismissed by the secretary of a Department or other nominated officer. This decision is among the subjects which were discussed recently with civil service staff interests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2721" /> As explained in the White Paper, the change arises from the fact that at present established civil servants hold their jobs under a legal provision which requires a Government decision to dismiss them &mdash; even in cases as clear-out as abandonment of post.  However, many civil servants, those up to and including clerical officer level are, in practice, in the same position as employees in other organisations, even to being free to engage in politics.  For them, the law will be changed to provide that they will have contracts of employment and may be dismissed by the secretary of a Department or other nominated officer.

      <P>The cost to the Exchequer of non-capital expenditure on public service pay, excluding pensions, in 1986 is estimated at £2,477 million.  This figure covers the pay of civil servants (non-industrial and industrial), Garda, Defence Forces, teachers and health employees together with amounts for pay included in grants to non-commercial State sponsored bodies, universities and colleges.  It includes all Exchequer pay costs such as basic pay, employers PRSI contributions, overtime and allowances. There are approximately 190,000 employees in the areas I have mentioned.</P>
      <P>It should be noted that the Exchequer pay bill includes only part of the pay cost of employees of grant-aided bodies. Furthermore, it includes the cost of fees to general practitioners in the general medical service who are not public service employees.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Public Service (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that the question refers to the Exchequer pay and pension bill, i.e. the cost to the Exchequer of the pay and pensions of civil servants, Defence Forces, Garda, teachers &mdash; both primary and post-primary &mdash; and all employees in the health area, together with amounts for pay in grants to non-commercial State-sponsored bodies, universities and colleges.</P>
      <P>The allocations in the national plan for the Exchequer pay and pensions bill for the years 1985 and 1986 were £2,400 million and £2,525 million respectively.  Subsequently to the publication of the national plan, the Government decided to implement the arbitrator's finding on the Civil Service 24th round claim as widely as possible throughout the public service. This resulted in an estimated excess of £84 million on the plan provision for 1985 &mdash; the provisional outturn for the Exchequer pay and pensions bill in 1985 is estimated at £2,484 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recently concluded negotiations with certain public service groups which have resulted in an offer of a package of proposals covering the 25th round and other pay related matters.  The 1986 cost of the package, assuming its eventual application to all groups in the Exchequer pay and pensions bill, together with the cost of special pay increases previously committed, is £68 million.  Furthermore, when account is taken of both the concessions on pensions and the substantial adjustments to the published expenditure allocations which were announced in the budget, the Exchequer pay and pensions bill for 1986 is increased from £2,600 million in the published estimates to <Col N="2723" /> £2,652 million.  This represents an increase of £127 million over the plan provisions for 1986.  The total increase over the national plan allocation for 1985 and 1986 is, therefore, £211 million.</P>

      <P>I was not informed by the UK authorities of the incident on 5 February when a quantity of plutonium gas escaped in the building at the Sellafield nuclear reprocessing plant.  When I became aware of the incident I immediately instructed my officials to convey my serious concern to the UK authorities and to seek an urgent meeting with them. The meeting of officials will take place tomorrow.  My officials will seek details of the incident and its implications and will seek similar information about the incident on 24 January when 458 kilograms of uranium was discharged into the Irish Sea.  They will also press for a satisfactory procedure for timely notification of incidents.  I have also asked my officials to reiterate the Government's view that discharges of radioactive waste from Sellafield must be minimised and must be eliminated as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Following the outcome of this meeting I will decide what further action should be taken.  If necessary I will seek a meeting with the appropriate Minister of the British Government.</P>

      <P>In the case of my Department, it is not possible in the time available to provide the type of information concerning official travel requested by the Deputy.  However, foreign travel by my Department arises mainly in relation to the attendance of officials at training courses and seminars, the evaluation of computer based systems and equipment and attendance at EC meetings.  The cost of such travel by my Department in 1985 was approximately £99,000 and a provision of £134,000 is included in the 1986 Estimates.</P>

The present position in relation to the planning of this project is that bills of quantities have been submitted to the Department by the North-Western Health Board and the project will proceed to tender stage, and construction will commence, as soon as capital funds can be made available for this purpose.  I am at present reviewing the situation with a view to getting the earliest possible start on the project.</P>

The person concerned exhausted her entitlement to 390 days unemployment benefit on 15 April 1985 and she was paid unemployment assistance from 16 April 1985 to 3 December 1985.  Arising from her failure, without just cause, to avail herself of a reasonable opportunity to receive training provided by AnCO, her claim was disallowed from 4 December 1985 to 15 January 1986.  On expiry of the disallowance period her claim, following review, was again disallowed from 16 January 1986 on the grounds that she was not genuinely seeking work.

      <P>The person concerned has been in continuous receipt of unemployment assistance since 9 January 1985 at the appropriate rate of unemployment assistance which includes an increase in respect of an adult dependant and one child dependant.  Where, however, a person has means, the appropriate maximum weekly rate of unemployment assistance payable is reduced by the amount of means assessed and this applied in this case.  Following reinvestigation of the unemployment assistance claim of the person concerned his means, with effect from 13 February 1986, were assessed at £33 weekly, derived from the benefit from his wife's earnings.  He is, accordingly, entitled to unemployment assistance at £34.05 weekly, being the appropriate maximum rate payable in his case of £67.05 less means of £33.

      <P>The person concerned claimed disablement benefit on 16 December 1985 in respect of an accident at work on 20 August 1984.  Under section 43 of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1981, one of the qualifying conditions for disablement benefit is that the employment concerned be insurable for occupational injury benefits.  The social insurance contributions which the person concerned had paid as a company director since 1979 were at class K.  This covers the health contribution, the youth employment levy and the temporary income levy only and does not contain any element for social welfare benefits. The disablement benefit claim was disallowed accordingly.  An appeal has now been lodged against the decision.  There are no proposals to amend the statutory provisions concerned.</P>

Pay-related benefit is calculated on the basis of reckonable earnings during the relevant income tax year.  The relevant income tax year in this case was the period 6 April 1983 to 5 April 1984 and inquiries had to be made to establish <Col N="2744" /> his earnings during this period.  The inquiries were recently completed and based on these earnings he is entitled to pay-related benefit of £5.24 weekly from 27 December 1985.  Arrangements have been made to pay all arrears of pay-related benefit due to him this week and further combined weekly payments of unemployment benefit and pay-related benefit, amounting to £44.74, will continue to be made as they become due.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 85 to 92, inclusive, together.  The two irregularities referred to in the reply to Question No. 151 of 28 January took place in the period April 1982 to July 1983 and involved amounts of some £59,000 and £48,000. They related exclusively to transactions between the firms concerned and my Department.  The question of advising farmers' representatives does not arise in such circumstances.  No losses are known to have been suffered by suppliers or farmers as a consequence of the irregularities and no other irregularities concerning weights came to notice in these cases either before or after the beef was moved into intervention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2748" /> In accordance with standard practice, the cases were investigated by my Department in consultation with the State's legal advisers and, in one case, the Garda Síochána.  The Commission of the European Communities was also involved.  Satisfactory settlements were reached in both cases and the question of further legal action did not arise.</P>
    <P>Because of temporary suspensions of trading and various total and partial changes of ownership precise information on the number of firms which sold beef into intervention during the period covered by Question No. 151 and have since ceased trading or changed ownership is not readily available.  So far as my Department are aware, however, at least one of the two firms referred to in the reply to that question would fall within that category.</P>

      <P>As indicated in my reply to Dáil Question No. 115 of 20 November 1985 the person concerned was paid his full statutory redundancy lump sum from the Redundancy and Employers' Insolvency Fund on 21 October 1985.</P>
      <P>On 6 January 1986 an application was received by my Department from the receiver of the company for payment from the fund under the Protection of Employees (Employers' Insolvency) Act, 1984, of the entitlements of a number of employees, including the person concerned, in respect of arrears of wages, holiday pay and minimum notice. Payment of the total amount due was made to the receiver on 31 January 1986 for disbursement to the individual employees.  If the person concerned has not received payment of the amount due to him, he should now approach the receiver in the matter.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Labour the number of foreign trips undertaken by him, his Minister of State and his staff in 1985; the destination, purpose and cost of each trip; and if he can estimate the cost of official trips in 1986.</P>

      <P>There would be a disproportionate expenditure of public resources involved in compiling the information in the wide ranging detail sought by the Deputy.  I do not consider the cost would be justified. However, the total expenditure on foreign travel charged to the Labour Vote in 1985 was £181,421.  A sum of £73,706 was recouped from the EC during 1985 in respect of such travel.  The provision for foreign travel in 1986 is £190,000</P>
