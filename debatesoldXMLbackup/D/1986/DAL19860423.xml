      <P>You will recall, a Cheann Comhairle, that yesterday morning, I raised with the Taoiseach the parliamentary programme until the summer recess.  Let me return to that matter and ask the Taoiseach if, in view of the many reports in the media this morning, it is the intention of the Government to bring forward legislation in this term to amend the Constitution.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the Taoiseach is anxious to reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>If legislation had been promised then it is in order and, of course, I will allow it.  I am not aware that any such legislation has been promised and if we were to follow every report in the newspapers we would never get to the business of the day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I submit to you that it is a matter of significance and importance. There has been an Oireachtas Committee on this matter which has made a report and which has made certain recommendations. There have been various statements from time to time by the Taoiseach and by Government Ministers.  The indications are that some such proposal is at least being contemplated by the Government. The Taoiseach's reaction to my question indicates that he is anxious to say something about it.  Perhaps you would be kind enough to give him permission to do so because of the importance of the matter and the almost universal reports in the media this morning to the effect that this is what is in the Government's mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The position appears to be as Deputy Haughey has outlined, that there is speculation.  But that does not bring it within the ambit of legislation which has been promised.  I keep saying that if we are to follow every hare that is raised in the newspapers and in the media then we would never get to the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know that it is entirely appropriate to refer to the distinguished journalists who have published the reports this morning as hare <Col N="1447" /> raisers.  But the comprehensiveness of these will justify you, Sir, on this occasion, particularly as it follows a solemn report by an Oireachtas Committee, in allowing a question of such import.  I submit that it would not be totally disrupting parliamentary procedure or shattering precedent or anything of that kind if you graciously permitted the Taoiseach to reply to my question.  It is dealing with the business of Parliament from now until the summer recess.  You permitted the Taoiseach to answer me yesterday on this question of the parliamentary programme that is engaged in by the Government.  I suggest that on that precedent you might permit the Taoiseach to answer this one specific question arising out of the parliamentary programme between now and the summer recess.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Deputy raised this matter yesterday he said that his question related to matters on the Order Paper or legislation which had been promised and the record will bear that out precisely.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday morning I specifically asked so that we could all come to some decision about the ordering of business from now until the end of term.  I asked the Taoiseach what was his intention with regard to the legislative programme.  I repeat that question now. I would just ask him to include this one specific item.  It is important.  If we are going to have legislation to amend the Constitution, that has a very serious impact on our parliamentary programme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I think, Sir, you are straining things beyond reason to prevent the Taoiseach answering this question which is of great importance and seriously affects the work we are going to do before the summer recess.  I am quite certain the Taoiseach wants to answer the question.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>In page 8, paragraph (c) (ii), line 29, after &ldquo;relate&rdquo;, to insert &ldquo;, or a previous financial year,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to secure that, in the pursuance of the principle of prudence in accounting, account shall be taken not just of liabilities and losses which are likely to arise in respect of the financial year under account but also those liabilities or losses which relate to previous financial years.  This approach accords with accepted accounting practices and with Article 31 of the directive.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;accounting principles <Col N="1454" /> that one applies in these cases.  The statement of standard accounting practices identifies the four fundamental accounting concepts which are recorded here: a going concern, consistency, accruals and prudency.  These are the accounting principles that we are accustomed to.  However, a fifth accounting principle is outlined here.</P>
      <P>The new accounting principle is that when determining the aggregate amount of a format item, whether an asset or liability, each individual component of that item should be considered separately. This is new.  Spelled out here as well in some detail is the question about the prudency basis on which accounting practice will be complied with henceforth. There seems to be some contradiction in this section and I would like to refer the Minister to it.</P>

      <P>I would like to draw the Minister's attention to section 5 (c) (i) which states that only profits realised at the balance sheet date shall be included in the profit and loss account.  Should that more properly have read &ldquo;only profits earned at the balance sheet date&rdquo;?  Subsection (d) of the same section provides that all income and charges relating to the financial year to which the accounts relate shall be taken into account without regard to the date of receipt of payment. Therefore, there seems to be a contradiction and I take it that subsection (d) is the correct position.  In paragraph (i) should &ldquo;earned&rdquo; replace &ldquo;realised&rdquo;?  Does the <Col N="1455" /> Minister agree that this would be a better interpretation of the section?</P>

      <P>At the end of the period under consideration the auditor establishes the realised profits or losses at the balance sheet date and these will be included in the profit and loss account. In doing so, he has an obligation to take a number of things into account including what is apparent from the examination of the accounts for the period and, as is pointed out in subsection (c) (ii), all liabilities and losses which have arisen or are likely to arise in respect of the financial year to which the accounts relate shall be taken into account, including those liabilities and losses which only become apparent between the balance sheet date and the date on which the accounts are signed in pursuance of section 156 of the Principal Act.  Subsection (d) takes accruals into account, that is ordinary accounting practice and there is nothing extraordinary about it.  We have also agreed in the amendment to take into account the historical aspect of the accounts, in other words that the auditor would have to take into account any losses which occurred in previous years but had not been taken into account in previous audits.  We are ensuring that there will be a true picture of the profit and loss account and balance sheet and that there will be a global perspective in this section.</P>

      <P>There is another general accounting principle outlined here and I refer to it as the new fifth principle.  I take it that subsection (e) outlines the basis for that new principle and that there are now five new accounting principles established in this section as against the four already understood to be there in the statement of standard accounting practices, going concerns, accruals, consistency and prudence.  Subsection (e) is outlining the new fifth general accounting principle and must be complied with, that immaterial items do not have to be shown separately.  Is that the position?</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>No, we are saying that any particular item of an asset or liability that falls to be taken into account shall be taken separately.  In other words, a prudent principle of accounting will have to be used in determining the value of any asset or liability.  Of course, the method of evaluation of assets and liabilities falls to be dealt with in different ways and we are ensuring that each item is assessed properly even though separate items would be valued, so to speak, in accordance with standard practice of accounting.</P>

It is between those two dates that certain matters may come to light in the normal course of events, which is not unusual. They would be considered by the directors and the accounts signed in pursuance of section 156 of the Principal Act.

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course the accounting procedure would have to take into account the rate of exchange as at the balance sheet date and if there were any major movements the auditor would bring this to the notice of the directors of the company and there would be an agreement in relation to the valuation of foreign currency items.

      <P>We agree to this section which is an important one in so far as any departure from the five accounting principles outlined in section 5 will have to be recorded in the notes to the account. Certainly, the notes will be quite substantial if one has to comply with all the variations outlined in the legislation.  I take it that quite some detail will have to be recorded in the notes.  I do not have any difficulty in accepting the section but, as it is such an important one, I was anxious to record my views on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I can accept what the Deputy has said.  In fact, the provision gives effect to Article 31 (2) of the Directive. Indeed, the departure from accounting principles as set out in section 5 will only be exercised in exceptional cases. We do not envisage many of those cases but if there are departure they must be fully explained in notes to the accounts. For the benefit of the Deputy I should like to give some examples.  If a board of directors wish to change from historic to a current cost basis of valuation there will have to be substantial notes giving reasons for this attaching to the accounts filed in the Companies Registration Office under the Bill.  One might be changing accounting standards in respect of a particular item in the accounts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy made reference to currency problems and that may result in a difference, but it will have to be explained in the notes.  Changes in the accounting treatment of post balance sheet events can always be matter of substance.  For instance, on the question of treatment of valuation of property, if there is a change in that in the post balance sheet period prior to the signing of the accounts, it will have to be explained in the notes to the account.  If there is a fundamental change in the nature of the company's business which will mean a departure from the principles as outlined in section 5, there will be a need for a comprehensive note attaching to the accounts.  This provision is to copperfasten the principles laid down in section 5 which imposes on companies, as the Deputy said, an onerous <Col N="1459" /> responsibility to ensure that any departures from principles are fully explained.</P>

      <P>In page 9, subsection (1) (b), line 14, to delete &ldquo;or report such as aforesaid&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;report, or statement, annexed to the annual return,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the amendment is to secure that information provided by way of statements to the accounts will, like the accounts themselves, be provided in the Irish or English language.  This is a catch-all amendment to ensure that, where the balance sheet, profit and loss accounts, report or statement are lodged in a language other than the Irish or the English language, there should be annexed to the foreign language version a translation in the English and the Irish language of the balance sheet, profit and loss accounts, report or statement.  This is to ensure that any report or statement will be annexed to an annual return.  For instance, in the case of an auditor's report or a director's report where statements may attach in a foreign language we want to ensure that a translation of that statement is attached to the submissions to the Companies Registration Office.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>This may seem to be a minor point but it may lead to some confusion in the office of the registrar.  I should like to know if the registrar at this time has the competency within his staff to deal with returns made in languages other then English and Irish because the translation submitted might suit the purposes of the filing agency but might not be a true and correct interpretation of what the original document states.  If the Minister gives an indication to provide that expertise, if it does not exist, that is fine.  Will the Minister tell the House the form of certification that will be required in support of the translation?  Are there set procedures for this or can the translation be done casually by any person with a knowledge of the alternative language used?</P>

      <P>The Minister will appreciate that I am concerned because of the disclosure elements and the fact that, in accordance with the directive, we will be getting much more involved with the language of other member states.  I am particularly anxious about the Irish language involvement in so far as the Registrar's Office is concerned.  I should like the Minister to assure us that facilities are available in the Registrar's Office for all those companies wishing to file accounts in the Irish language only, that they will be given the opportunity of doing so without interpretations and translations being sought from them in a language other than the first language of this country.  That does not apply at present.

    </Speaker>
    <P>I note that there is no provision in the Bill for office holders, such as the secretary of a public limited company.  Unlike the United Kingdom legislation which laid down specific qualifications required of the secretary of a public limited company, it is not stated in this section or else where in the Bill who should be qualified to hold the office of secretary.  I can understand that, in the case of a private company, the office of secretary may well be held by the wife of the proprietor or some such person, but in the case of a public limited company, it is quite possible that an imbecile could be registered as secretary.  Yet the secretary of a public limited company is required, by legislation, to discharge these duties as laid down in subsection (1) (a) (ii).  The United Kingdom legislation laid down a schedule of persons qualified to act as secretaries of public limited companies. I would suggest that the Minister consider introducing an amendment to ensure similar provisions obtain here.  Indeed I should like such provision to apply not only to public limited companies but also to State boards.  After all if we give people this responsibility then we should specify exactly who is entitled to discharge that responsibility.  It is possible to have a poor unfortunate appointed to <Col N="1463" /> a board acting as secretary and taking upon himself these responsibilities.</P>
    <P>I know that the Minister has been advised that we may not need such restrictions for secretaries of public limited companies.  I do not see why we should not have such restrictions.  We have closely followed the English legislation since 1948.  Indeed our 1963 Act was almost a replica of the 1948 United Kingdom Act and probably is the largest Act on our Statute Book.  It specifies the qualifications required of such persons as auditors of companies.  For instance, in the case of the ICI, had somebody been charged specifically with the responsibility of registering certain documentation or with keeping true copies, that company might not have got themselves into the mess they did.  It might have been possible for the State to ascertain at an earlier stage the true position by asking the person whose duty it was to discharge those responsibilities, a qualified, identifiable person, if he had discharged those responsibilities.  In the case of public limited companies and State boards I would ask the Minister to examine the relevant section of the United Kingdom Act relating to those qualifications necessary for persons holding the office of secretary with a view to introducing an amendment to this Bill on Report Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Companies Acts devolve quite an amount of responsibility on both the directors and secretary of any company.  Indeed any person asked to undertake the duties and responsibilities of a director or secretary should be aware of the onus placed on them.  I take the point being made by Deputy G. Mitchell. However, it is not appropriate to this Bill which specifically gives national effect to a directive, a Bill laying down the mechanisms by which documents being submitted to the Companies Office should be certified.  We are saying here that each copy shall be certified by a director and the secretary of the company to be a true copy of the balance sheet, profit and loss account or report.  The Deputy has referred to the qualifications he feels to <Col N="1464" /> be necessary on the part of a secretary or other officer of a company.</P>

Would it not be more accurate <Col N="1465" /> to say that they could be drawn up in accordance with sections 3, 4, 5 and 6? Why does the Minister not include section 6 as well seeing that a company can depart from the accounting principles in certain circumstances as long as they so state?  Would that subsection not now preclude certain companies from utilising the provisions of section 6 in certain circumstances? Section 7 deals with the publication of accounts in some form or other by all public and private limited companies. This was the nub of considerable discussion on an earlier section dealing with the question of banks and what they must publish.  It is set down clearly that under the Principal Act financial institutions will have to file profit and loss accounts and balance sheets.

      <P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P>In page 9, subsection (2) (a), line 45, to delete &ldquo;£1,250,000&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;£125,000&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This section is the nub of the Bill. Whether the Bill will be of any benefit at all with depend on the Minister's reaction <Col N="1466" /> to this series of amendments.  If the section as it stands is accepted, the Bill will give major exemptions to the very companies the Bill is designed to get disclosures from.  The purpose of the amendment is to bring more companies into the scope of the section.  The Bill prescribes three criteria in relation to size, and some are excluded from the requirement to disclose information provided for under sections 11 and 12.  The first three amendments relate to small companies and the second three to medium sized companies.  The second subsection of section 8 states:</P>
    <P>The qualifying conditions for a company to be treated as a small company in respect of any financial year are as follows:</P>
    <P>(a) its balance sheet total for that year shall not exceed £1,250,000,</P>
    <P>(b)  the amount of its turnover for that year shall not exceed £2,500,000, and</P>
    <P>(c)  the average number of persons employed by the company in that year shall not exceed 50.</P>
    <P>The first amendment proposes to reduce the figure of £1,250,000 to £125,000, in other words, to one-tenth of the figure now in the section.  The second qualification in the subsection is in regard to the amount of turnover, the figure being £2,500,000.  My proposal would reduce that to £250,000.  The third qualification is in regard to the number of persons employed, on average, and my proposal would reduce the figure of 50 to five employees.</P>
    <P>On Second Stage I referred to the IDA annual report for 1984 which indicated that 80 per cent of all manufacturing companies employed fewer than 50 people. There are thousands of small companies who employ two or three people.  Under this clause in subsection (2), 80 per cent of the employees and companies would come within the category of &ldquo;small companies&rdquo;. In 1984 the IDA grant-aided 2,600 small companies, employing approximately 29,500 persons and their <Col N="1467" /> annual report for that year stated that those companies had each fixed assets of less than £500,000.  Therefore, none of these small IDA-aided companies had fixed assets of more than £500,000, but under the Bill the provision is for fixed assets of nearly three times that amount.</P>
    <P>This means that a particularly high proportion of Irish companies could be described as small and the IDA state that all the emphasis in the past couple of years has been to grant-aid small companies with two, three, four or five employees and they have advanced public money to such companies &mdash; in 1984 £18 million of public money was put into such small industries by the IDA.</P>
    <P>When public money is channelled into companies there should be full public disclosure of the financial implications.  It is even more important that there should be a requirement in the Bill for information disclosure in such circumstances, and there should not be any exemptions. Under this section none of these companies will come within the scope of the Bill except in some limited instances and, therefore, there will not be full disclosure of information.  Already, public companies are required to give full disclosure, and my proposals in these amendments would make private limited companies subject to the same conditions.  This section excludes at least 80 per cent of companies from giving this information.</P>

      <P>Taken from the top, companies which would qualify as large companies, required to adhere to the terms of this Bill with regard to disclosure of accounts, balance sheets and so forth, according to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions estimate amount to only 268 public and private companies, with a turnover in excess of £10 million.</P>

      <P>Approximately 137 of those employ more than 250 employees.  That is another criterion for <Col N="1468" /> a large company.  Fewer than 150 Irish companies, the Congress estimate, would be compelled under this Bill to give full disclosure of information and publish full accounts.  Of those 150, approximately 40 per cent are public companies which already give that information.  The Bill will require full disclosure of information and accounts in the case of approximately, or fewer than, 100 companies. Those are all that this large, complicated, highly technical Bill will affect.  Deputy Flynn is very upset about the pressure on them to give such information.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will find that it is true.  Nobody knows for certain, because companies which are examining this Bill and are already required to disclose information are already preparing the ground to become small or medium sized companies simply by use of the existing Companies Acts, by establishing one, two or three companies to share employees, assets and turnover as they wish, for the purpose of disclosure of accounts.  This Bill is showing them how to do that, exactly the type of company which they should establish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have been hearing from the Government for three years about reform of company legislation in this field, to prevent the fly-by-night type of company operation.  I had expected that this Bill would be designed to catch such operators, who were not alone not disclosing information or paying due taxes to the Revenue Commissioners, but were not even paying over the taxes and PRSI contributions which they were deducting from their employees.  There was a case in the city last year which I had to watch through the whole of 1985 <Col N="1469" /> of a very well known firm sited in Dorset Street &mdash; the Crystal Glass Company. The firm have been in that location for many years.  As I passed by regularly, I saw ever-decreasing amounts of glassware in the window and gradually the place was being run down.  I discovered, on making inquiries, that this had been happening for a period of six or eight months, that a new company had been established in Crumlin under some other name and that all the transport from the Crystal Glass Company had already been transferred to the new company.</P>

      <P>I am sorry about that.  However, companies can operate in this way for a small financial outlay, setting up any number of companies that they wish.  I would prefer if there were no exemptions whatsoever in the Bill but under these amendments I am allowing exemptions of companies with five employees or fewer &mdash; a very substantial number of companies &mdash; with a turnover of £250,000 and assets of £125,000.  If the Bill is allowed to go through in its present form, very few companies will come under its terms and it will be seen as the actual purpose of the Bill to bring in a Bill following the EC directive but exempting the vast majority of companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next three amendments deal with medium sized companies which also have substantial exemptions, but somewhat less than the smaller companies.  In amendment No. 11 I am moving that the <Col N="1470" /> assets of a medium sized company be reduced from £5 million to £500,000.  In amendment No. 12 it is proposed that the £10 million turnover be reduced to £1 million.  Amendment No. 13 proposes to amend the number of employees needed to qualify as a medium sized company from 250 to 25.  A firm employing 250 people would be reckoned as a very major company in this country, although by EC standards and those of European industrial countries they would not count. If the IDA could bring in a company which would employ 250 that would be splashed all over the newspapers.  This Bill exempts such companies from giving full disclosure of information or from publishing full accounts.</P>
    <P>In the Irish situation, a firm employing 25 people is a medium sized company. There are a substantial number of such companies throughout the country, good, thriving businesses.  If the small industries scheme of the IDA caused companies to increase employment from three to 25 people that would be spreading the good news.  It would be marvellous to have 10,000 small industries established employing 25 people.  That would total 250,000.  Twenty-five is a substantial number but 250 is outrageous. It would appear from this section that the very purpose of the Bill is to ensure that the vast majority of private limited companies will not have to make full disclosure of their accounts and will be able to avail of all of these exemptions.  Therefore, unless the Bill is amended it will be a joke.  It must be brought within the context of private limited companies. Consequently, we propose these six amendments, three in relation to small companies and three in relation to medium sized companies.</P>

      <P>I take the line that we could consider Deputy Mac Giolla's amendments at a future date after we have had experience of the legislation in operation.  I consider it reasonable to set the thresholds as proposed in the Bill and then, if we find at some later date that it would be desirable to reduce those levels, <Col N="1471" /> the matter could be dealt with at that stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The way those who espouse the Marxist philosophy go about achieving their objective is to endeavour to make most of the private business in the country so difficult to manage that the stage is reached where the State have virtually total control.  If private companies are undermined, the public will not take the risk of engaging in private business.  This would have the effect of bringing about a much higher unemployment rate and that, in turn, undermines the system.  There are people who have a vested interest in bringing about that situation.  We have enough legislation on hand already that contributes to unemployment without adding to that problem and making it impossible for private limited companies to trade as private limited companies.  We should not forget that we are talking about private companies and that the people involved are not prepared to conduct their affairs in public, or in such a way that everyone else knows their position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Mac Giolla is probably right when he says that perhaps 80 per cent of companies employ fewer than 50 people, but small companies are the backbone of our economy.  We have made matters difficult enough already in many ways for small companies by way of our legislation. Many companies could employ more people but they decide not to do so because of the problems that might involve.  The stage has been reached where, if an employer finds an employee <Col N="1472" /> with his hand in the till, the employee cannot be sacked without the employer ultimately having to face a Labour Court hearing and paying substantial compensation. If we were to legislate to compel very small companies to disclose all their business, not only to employees but to competitors, we would be making it impossible for people to engage in private business.  The vast majority of the companies we are talking of are proprietary companies or what are known as proprietary limited companies in other countries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Usually these companies operate on the basis of proprietors' guarantees to the banks.  They are not operating on shareholdings that have been raised on the stock market.  It is going a bit far to extend some of the arguments to companies with 25 employees because in that respect we would be talking of about 80 per cent of private companies.  Even as the section stands, we are providing for a lot of business for accountants and lawyers but we would be increasing that business if the amendments were to be accepted. Acceptance of the amendments would result in people in those professions spending a lot of time advising companies on how to avoid the provisions as proposed in the amendments.  Whatever about the larger companies, the smaller companies would not be in a position to pay for these services and this would make it impossible for them to continue in business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, if after we have had experience of the legislation in operation, we <Col N="1473" /> find that in one or two areas the thresholds ought to be reduced, we could deal with that matter then but the thresholds as proposed in the Bill seem to strike the right balance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot accept the amendments.  What is being suggested in those amendments is that we reduce the thresholds for small and medium sized companies by a factor of ten and that we include companies with balance sheets not exceeding £125,000 or turnover not exceeding £250,000 and who are employing not more than five people.  This would be placing an intolerable burden on very small companies and would not be a positive factor in the operation of the legislation. We have tried, and succeeded to a large extent, in keeping a balance in this Bill in the matter of the definition of small and medium sized companies.  It is important that we maintain a balance. Both small and medium sized companies will be required to submit substantial information to the Companies Registration Office.</P>
      <P>I reject Deputy Mac Giolla's sarcastic approach to these provisions.  Information will have to be submitted to the Companies Registration Office for more than 70,000 registered companies.  Small companies will be required to submit balance sheets.  In the case of medium sized companies, profit and loss accounts, auditors' and directors' reports will also be required while in the case of the larger companies there is the additional requirement of the submission of details of turnover. The submission to the Companies Registration Office of this information will be of benefit to all who are trading. It will be of benefit to traders dealing with other traders in enabling them to form a good picture of a company's standing and creditworthiness.  What we are requiring in this instance is in keeping with the directive and with the industrial policy objectives of the Government. The information which will be required will be onerous in relation to small, medium and large companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must have regard also to the legislation in this area in respect of similar <Col N="1474" /> enterprises in other member states.  The limits proposed by Deputy Mac Giolla are far below those that apply in most of the other member states and are very much below those required in the UK and Northern Ireland in particular.  It is important to remember that in the context of our industrial policy and of what the IDA need to do to attract industry. Consequently, we have been very careful in our approach to this legislation.  The requirements of this section are fair from the point of view of the information being required of all profit making limited companies. Charitable companies are to be the exception.  The information we are requiring from our trading companies is sufficient for the purposes of the directive and is sufficient for what I would see as the need of traders and industry.</P>
    <P>There is another dimension to this matter which needs attention and that is the objectives of industrial policy.  Quite frankly, if we were to accede to the Deputy's amendments, in effect we would be placing Irish firms at a severe disadvantage. Far from creating jobs it could lead to a loss of jobs.  If that is the Deputy's intention in moving the amendments, I decry it.  I decry that type of approach which could do damage to the fabric of the industrial structure and which could do needless harm to the industrial objectives of the IDA and the Government.  I will not stand up in this House and take any position which would endanger Irish industry or the industrial promotion policies of the Government and the IDA.  I will not be put into a position of undoing the good work that has been done by various successive Governments in relation to the attraction of foreign industry to this country.  It is hardly what we want at this juncture in our industrial development. Therefore, I cannot accede to the amendments.  I am sorry the Deputy has moved them.  I would suggest to him that the amendments, if accepted, would put Irish industry at a severe disadvantage and would damage the cause of Irish industrial policy as promoted by the IDA and the Government.  I would temper what I have said because we have achieved a balance.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1475" /> I will repeat, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, all limited trading companies will have to submit documents to the Companies Registration Office which will give sufficient information for traders so that they will have a picture of the company they are dealing with.  That is the central target of this directive and this legislation. It is difficult for creditors when they are suddenly faced with a loss because a company fails.  We are trying to go down a road which will give sufficient information in respect of all limited trading companies to people who are trading with them, especially the ordinary, unsecured creditors who are at a disadvantage and who do not have security, who do not have a lien on property and who do not have mortgages or debentures.  They are actually out there selling goods to other companies not knowing if they are going to be paid.</P>
    <P>At this time they do not have access to the financial positions of these companies.  What we are achieving in this Bill, in my considered opinion, is giving them a good picture of the companies they are dealing with.  I will not introduce into this House an unnecessarily cumbersome system, especially in relation to small companies.  In summary I want to say that what we are achieving in this Bill is a fair measure of revelation in regard to a company's financial position.  We are at the same time ensuring, especially in the context of what our European partners are doing, that we are not putting creditors at a disadvantage.  We are doing this within the confines and context of the directive which governs this Bill. What we have done, if we take the <i>via media</i>, is taken a reasonable role and we have achieved what I consider to be a balanced position and one which will not damage Irish industry as would these amendments if they were accepted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State has made a very strong case that the Bill is demanding full disclosure of information and that even with these exemptions there would still be ample information disclosed under this Bill for <Col N="1476" /> other traders.  There are people other than traders who are interested in and have an interest in these companies.  No one has a greater interest in the companies than the people employed in them. The Minister has not spoken of their need.</P>
      <P>The exemption for small companies is that they do not have to publish profit and loss accounts.  Publish does not mean just for all the public, it means that not one employee is entitled to know what the profit and loss account of the company is.  That is what publishing means. In fact, the employees are not entitled to this information.  Surely, the Minister is not saying, particularly at this time when there is all this great talk of participation and the need for participation of workers &mdash; the new Minister for Finance wants workers to be shareholders in industries &mdash; that they are not even entitled under this Bill to normal information of what is happening.  If anything has hit home to people in the last four to six years it was the fact that when industry after industry closed down the first employees knew about it was when they went in one morning to be told that the company was closing down.  There was no previous information of any kind given to them. In fact, the press knew before many of the employees did.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For that reason, workers in firms became more and more interested in what management were doing, whether the business was a success or failure and whether it was making a profit or a loss. As they saw other places closing down, they said to themselves, &ldquo;How about us? How are we fixed?&rdquo; Some of these employees would have been 30 to 40 years working in a business and have a great interest in it.  They knew a lot about it and they knew all about what is being made and where it is being sold.  They like to know whether it is going well or badly or whether a profit is being made They like to know whether the people at the top are creaming off from the company and putting it aside into houses or villas in Spain, as has been publicised in newspapers all over the country, and whether they are also creaming off their <Col N="1477" /> own deduction of PRSI and PAYE etc. These workers have no access to information. They just have to sit, have their deductions made and wait for the day when the gates are closed.  They get nothing. Some people get redundancy of £2,000 or £3,000 which will have to last for the rest of their lives.  They will get this lump sum after working for 20, 30 or 40 years in the company.</P>
    <P>The Government say workers are entitled to information and that there is a need for more participation in the workforce and management.  Surely that should be allowed in this Bill.  Despite what the Minister says, small companies will have to publish a balance sheet which will not even give full disclosure of information. They will not have to publish a profit and loss account.  There is no point in the Minister saying this Bill is doing something marvellous when it is not.</P>
    <P>The Minister said amendments like this would endanger companies, would endanger people's jobs and would be damaging to Irish industry.  These are all great sounding phrases.  He did not give one instance of how this could be so, of what jobs would be endangered, how they would be endangered, what damage would be done to Irish industry or how it would be done.  Under the present system jobs are being endangered daily.  People are getting out of the country with case loads of loot and leaving their employees behind them with no information.  I would like to ask the Minister how disclosure of information by what are called small and medium sized companies, but which I think are big substantial companies, would endanger jobs.  The Minister said most EC countries would not have this information from the small companies referred to in the amendment. I do not know whether that is true. Our industry has a much lower level of employees, assets and turnover than the vast majority of companies in the more highly industrialised and developed companies in Europe.  We need a different system to cover the type of company and the number of employees we have if it is to have any effect.  How many companies <Col N="1478" /> will be covered for full disclosure of information in balance sheets, profit and loss accounts, and so on as outlined in this Bill?</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>If somebody publishes a balance sheet he states whether the company made a profit or a loss and what the amount of that profit or loss is.  That figure is disclosed in the balance sheet.  What it does not show is the breakdown of the profit or loss, the overheads, the administrative cost, the turnover or the trading cost.  This is where Deputy Mac Giolla is in error.  If we look at the 80 per cent of the companies which he says have fewer than 50 employees we will find that most of the owners of those companies live in small housing estates represented by Deputies like myself and Deputy Mac Giolla.  They are not millionairies who own villas in Spain and who are flitting out of the country with suitcases full of money.  They are people who are breaking their backs morning, noon and night trying to make a profit. In the early years they usually make losses and in the intervening years they occasionally make losses.  They almost always have cash flow problems which would be added to by disclosure of information because it would be available to their opposition.</P>
      <P>I have no objection to public limited companies or private limited companies on a certain level making available this information.  On Deputy Mac Giolla's own admission 80 per cent of companies have fewer than 50 employees.  He wants to bring in 80 per cent of companies by reducing from 250 to 25 the number of employees in a company before they must disclose this information.  Like many of his colleagues in Eastern Europe, Deputy Mac Giolla does not like to hear anybody else putting forward a point of view.  I was elected to this House and I intend to put forward that point of view no matter what harassment I get from Deputy Mac Giolla.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not hold any brief for people who are flitting the country with suitcases full of money.  It is easy to recognise those people.  It is like a comment from page 3 <Col N="1479" /> of the <i>Star</i> newspaper to come in here and titillate the records of the House by speculating or casting people of this kind as typical of the businessmen in this country. They are not.  The typical profile of a businessman in this country is a man who is not earning a very large salary, who lives in a small housing estate and who breaks his back seven days a week trying to make ends meet.  Even then he does not always succeed.  This is the man who does not have redundancy or social welfare benefits.  The picture which is being painted is very unfair.  We have to be fair to everybody.</P>
    <P>Employees should be given the maximum beneficial assistance.  We are not giving the maximum beneficial assistance when we say we will go the whole hog and scrap all the rules.  We get to the stage where the whole basis of employment is undermined and, therefore, employees themselves are undermined.  In order to make a profit people must be businesslike. One of the essential ingredients of a business is not to disclose all of one's cards at the same time, particularly to one's opposite number.  If we find, when this legislation is in operation, that some of these thresholds need to be reduced, or others need to be increased, it might be possible in hindsight to adjust the legislation.  We do not want to introduce legislation which will further undermine employment potential.  We have too much of that type legislation on the Statute Book already.</P>

      <P>The Minister knows my attitude on this matter and no doubt Deputy Mac Giolla does too.  My biggest regret is that these limits are not much bigger and for a very good reason.  I understood that what we were trying to do was to attract business and companies, whether Irish or foreign.  Unfortunately, the provisions as laid out in the Minister's Bill cannot be adjusted upwards at this time in that they are mandatory because of the EC directive.  I do not know what Deputy Mac Giolla is talking about as it <Col N="1480" /> was people who follow his socialist philosophy and ideology who framed this legislation and directive.  They have done nothing at all to protect what has been a very valuable asset.  Anything that would hinder private company development would not be in the national interest.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately these things are not negotiable now but they will be in the very near future.  Under the directive these limits can be adjusted at least every five years.  I would like the Minister to tell us when the next change is due.  I would also like him to indicate if he and his Government would be supportive of the idea of adjusting them upwards to the limit allowed in any adjustment to the directive.  When this directive was first published in 1978 the figures were somewhat lower.  We have had one adjusting period already and we should now seek an early adjustment of the figures to take account of the economic and monetary trends in the Community, instead of going the way Deputy Mac Giolla would like where every newsagent and corner shop would have to go to considerable expense in preparing and filing accounts. I would like to see less disclosure of information being mandatory on businesses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not accept Deputy Mac Giolla's argument so far as trade unions are concerned. It does not hold water.  I know the trade unions have been pressing for greater transparency in company accounts, particularly so far as external companies are concerned.  If trade unions require information that business people would like to regard as private and essential for the protection of their own assets &mdash; I am not talking about fixed assets &mdash; that is one thing, but information should not be available to the whole of industry and to the competitors of companies who are trying to maintain their market share and their solvency.  It is not in their best interests to have that important information available to all and sundry because it would be used by the predators in industry who are always there looking for confidential information to help them to pinch the markets of companies set up in good faith and who worked hard during the years.  Deputy Mac Giolla should <Col N="1481" /> admit it is not proper to seek such a concession.  Disclosure of such information could be a disadvantage to existing business.</P>
    <P>The trade unions can use the free collective bargaining system to seek what information they want from any individual company.  That can be done in the bargaining process and that is what happens. I agree it is the right of employees to have certain information made available to them, but it is not a matter for company law to put it into statute to make such information available.  It is a matter for the industrial relations process and this is conducted in the bargaining basis process on an individual company basis between the trade unions and the employers.  Certainly it is not a matter for company law and it is not a matter that should be incorporated in the kind of law we are talking about here.  I fail to see the rationale of Deputy Mac Giolla's argument.</P>
    <P>Listening to the Deputy one would think that the vast majority of companies will have an easy way out of making any disclosures.  That is not the case.  Regrettably this legislation will mandate every company, large and small, to disclose certain information.  The figures set out are very small in modern terms.  We are talking about a balance sheet total of £1.25 million and a turnover of £2.5 million and in today's terms those figures are very small.  To get an exemption it will be necessary to apply two of the three conditions and they will have to apply in a consecutive way over the trading activities for two years.  Thus, it is obvious that few companies, if any, will be able to avail of exemption and there will be major disclosures for all small companies, which will be a pity.  It will make life that much more difficult for companies so far as accounting practices are concerned and they will incur major expenditure in gearing their accounting arrangements to meet the demands of this legislation.  It will have a considerable impact on business and on financial reporting, much more far-reaching than Deputy Mac Giolla suggests.  He has been putting out this scare story for the past <Col N="1482" /> few months and it is time it was nailed. He is saying that companies are trying to avoid disclosure.  With all respect to the Minister, it should be stated by him that all companies will have to prepare accounts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not seem to have got through to Deputy Mac Giolla.  I fail to understand why he does not accept that all companies will have to prepare a balance sheet and that there will be publication of information.  Regrettably, much of that information will be sensitive and it will be of considerable importance to the predators and competitors.  The result will be that business will have to train new staff.  Nobody has yet evaluated what will be the impact on business.</P>
      <P>Article 53 of the EC directive states that every five years the Council, acting on a proposal from the Commission, will examine and revise the amounts so far as the limits are concerned.  I hope the Minister will make representations to the Commission to ensure that they do so. There is no doubt that the limits are minimal in today's world of business and we should take full advantage of them.</P>
      <P>We need to have a balance between the interests of the users of the accounts and the need to avoid imposing burdens on small industry.  This legislation will inflict a burden on small industry and will involve them in considerable extra expense.  I hope the Minister will utilise his powers under this legislation to give them as much facility in delaying implementation of the legislation as is possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must be careful we do not scare off small business people and entrepreneurs. Every day we hear Ministers asking small business people to set up their own enterprises and telling them they will have all kinds of assistance.  If this legislation is implemented, certainly they will need assistance in one area, namely, in the costs of administration.  This is often the one thing that deters people from risking their investment.  I hope the paperwork <Col N="1483" /> will be limited further so far as this requirement is concerned.</P>
    <P>On Second Stage I said that perhaps the time was now suitable and appropriate to recommend a further type of incorporation with regard to small business people that would satisfy Deputy Mitchell and myself.  Regrettably it would not have the good wishes of Deputy Mac Giolla, but so be it.  I am talking about the small family owned business or the enterprise employing a few people.  The people involved in such enterprises do not want to get involved in the nitty-gritty of all this new administration and the costs attached to it.  The Minister responded to my suggestion when he was replying to the debate and he said he was keeping the matter in mind and would give it further consideration.  I am asking that a new form of incorporation be tried for small companies and businesses so that they will have the minimum of filing requirements.  I was anxious that all that would be required was a solvency certificate signed by the auditor to be available each year rather than the detailed accounts that will be required from small companies under this legislation.</P>
    <P>This was considered in Britain a few years ago but the idea died from lack of interest at that time.  The position might be somewhat different there but not, perhaps in regard to the situation that exists in the registration office in the Department of Trade in Great Britain where, it is interesting to note, in 1984 49 per cent of the companies defaulted in filing their accounts, and 43 per cent of all companies in making their annual returns.  I do not know what the situation is here but I sincerely hope it is better than that because, if not, all this talk is a waste of time.  We can put all the legislation we like on the Statute Book but unless we have policing and suitable staff management and computerisation in the Companies Registration Office we are not going to achieve anything in so far as the implementation of that legislation is concerned.</P>
    <P>On Second Stage I said that this <Col N="1484" /> arrangement would bring about a situation where very small companies would have simplified documentation leading to much better and more comprehensive registering and filing.  The Minister was loth to take it on board.  He did not want to make documentation attached to companies so simple and the classifications so wide that interlopers and cowboys would abuse the provisions.  We do not want that.  But I would have thought it was not beyond the powers of comprehension of the Minister to devise documentation, and restrictions on those entitled to it, which would allow that new form of incorporation and guarantee that the interlopers and cowboys would not be able to utilise this legislation.</P>
    <P>The Minister was also anxious about the motivation or the status of the owner in any possible new types of incorporation. He said legislation would have to be drafted very carefully to avoid abuse. I agree with him.  He seemed to be taking it on board.  Then he dashed cold water on it and finally ended up saying he would keep it in mind for other days.  I think I detected a note of support in the thrust of his remarks and that what he was saying was that he accepted the need for an amendment and tightening up of the existing legislation so far as small companies are concerned and that he would consider it further.</P>
    <P>I am putting it to the Minister of State that now is the time to consider the formulation of new incorporation status for very small companies.  I fail to see why a husband and wife company or a tiny company involving a family or just a few employees should be labelled as a small company in terms of this legislation and have to comply with the legislative processes with which, for example, the Smurfit organisation would have to comply.  This is the legislation that is going to be applied to all and sundry.  I do not see why we cannot have a different type of law to cater for what I would regard as a family concern &mdash; what could be loosely termed proprietary companies. We could have new law to deal with shareholder-managed or proprietary companies whereby they would have to <Col N="1485" /> file an annual declaration of solvency signed by an auditor.  Apart from that I do not think any greater difficulty should be placed in their way.</P>
    <P>With that in view, I would recommend that a new simplified form of incorporation should be established for shareholder-managed companies, and that existing private companies would be entitled and eligible to re-register under that new form of incorporation when making their annual return, and that private companies which failed to re-register &mdash; and this is an important aspect of my recommendation &mdash; would lose their limited liability status while they remained in default.  That would be a big thing because limited liability status has served Irish business well since the 19th century. It was set up at that time to protect business and to allow business to develop, to differentiate between the owners of the company and those who controlled its activities, that is, the directors.  That is the whole basis for limited liability in the first instance.</P>
    <P>It is time to consider an alteration in that.  Limited liability status is an essential ingredient of the whole business.  I would like to see it applied to proprietary companies.  I would also see it as possible that such companies would be able to give floating charges over their assets. We have to recognise that, unfortunately, nowadays limited liability is often undermined by insurance companies and banks seeking personal guarantees by directors.  That strikes at the very heart of the old limited liability status that served this country so well.  Banks and other institutions are seeking personal guarantees against directors and it minimises the whole limited liability status that we were used to.  I ask the Minister again to reconsider it and to give an undertaking to have another look at a new form of incorporation for tiny companies that operate here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>We seem to have strayed off the amendment which was dealing with thresholds.  However, I will take Deputy Flynn's contribution as being relevant to the section itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1486" /> There are a number of points I want to make here.  As far as I am concerned, we have achieved a balance in the information that would be required to be lodged in the Companies Registration Office by all limited companies under the Bill. Indeed, the small companies, as defined by the Bill, will have to submit a balance sheet and that balance sheet will give quite a clear picture of the financial health of the company and may be used by the employees and by other traders and creditors and so on to see the financial standing of the company.  So I have to reject the thrust of Deputy Mac Giolla's arguments belittling the effects of this Bill. As Deputy Flynn rightly recognises, this Bill will have a serious impact on all companies in relation to the requirements to submit financial information to the Companies Registration Office.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mac Giolla raised the question of information to employees.  The balance sheet and the documents accompanying it will be of interest to the employees and will be available to them. The Deputy also referred to the Vredeling Directive.  That is not under my aegis. It would be a matter for the Minister for Labour.  It is social legislation so I would not wish to become involved in it.  In relation to the matter of information, the ongoing industrial relations negotiations between trade unions and management should elicit the necessary information required by employees of the company as to the welfare of a company from the point of view of negotiations.  The requirement on all companies especially on small companies, to submit this financial information would be sufficient to give a very good picture of their position.</P>
    <P>In relation to thresholds, we have adopted what is necessary for the Irish economy in its present state of development where the object of industrial policy is to attract new industry.  In this context it is important that we should not adopt thresholds which would put this country at a comparative disadvantage in relation to other countries when potential investors are looking at what is required to be submitted to the Companies Registration Office under this legislation.  We would <Col N="1487" /> be very foolish to adopt thresholds that would put off potential investors.  We do not wish to lose one job because of this directive.  For that reason, like other countries, particularly the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Luxembourg and Belgium, we have adopted the highest thresholds.  That is a reasonable attitude to take from the point of view of encouraging investment and employment here. The effects of Deputy Mac Giolla's amendments would be to discourage investment and would jeopardise the potential for new job creation here.</P>
    <P>If we were to adopt thresholds which were lower than those in other countries, existing competitors in other member states, and outside the EC, would have access to information which could seriously damage some of our companies in the market place.  I will not be part to allowing that situation to arise for any ideological reasoning&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to be reasonable.  I will not take any action which will jeopardise employment or investment here.  In this Bill I will not put Irish companies in a position where competitors in other countries would have an advantage over them.  That would be to the detriment of those companies, and I will not allow it, but I will work within the directive as I am required to do.  What has been suggested by Deputy Mac Giolla is nothing but an instrument of damage to the Irish economy, to industry and to employment.  It is not acceptable to me or to my Government. I firmly believe that what we are doing is reasonable and will be of benefit to traders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Flynn raised the question of the next review of the thresholds.  The next review falls to be considered in 1988. It may have escaped Members' attention that the revision of the thresholds refers only to monetary, not employment, thresholds.  I am pleased Deputy Flynn recognised that my Government will be <Col N="1488" /> negotiating this matter in 1988 and I can assure him that I will continue to protect the interests of Irish industry and commerce.</P>

      <P>I believe the provisions in this Bill, as supported by Deputy Flynn's party, are reasonable and are necessary to protect Irish industry, commerce and employment while at the same time allowing sufficient information to be given to people who are trading here and, from a strategic, industrial and commercial point of view, we must not put this country and our economic units at a comparative disadvantage with our main competitors.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a couple of points I want to make.  First, I want to draw attention to Deputy Gay Mitchell's false accounting.  He made the point that I said 80 per cent of companies would not be covered by the full disclosure directive. He said by my amendments I was removing 80 per cent of companies from the exemptions.  That, of course, is not true.  In my amendments we are reducing the thresholds, not deleting them entirely.  Even with our thresholds of five employees, 250,000 turnover and £125,000 assets, between 25 and 30 per <Col N="1489" /> cent, or 75,000 companies, would be in that category.</P>
      <P>I want to emphasise the position of the trade union movement.  The Marxists in the Irish Congress of Trade Unionists, as Deputy Gay Mitchell would call them, or in the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union, take a much stronger position than we are taking.  I will quote from the Irish Congress of Trade Unions' memorandum on the Companies (Amendment) Bill, 1985, issued in September 1985.  On section 2 (2), scope of application to small and medium sized companies, they said:</P>
      <P>Congress recommends that the exemptions for small and medium-sized companies be deleted from the Bill.  All companies, regardless of size, should be required to publish full financial information.  In the context of Ireland, where the vast majority of private companies are categorised as `small', it is essential to adapt the directive to reflect this.</P>
      <P>That was the position of the ICTU.</P>
      <P>The ITGWU in their memorandum to the Minister on the EC fourth directive and the reform of Irish company law on page 6 say: &ldquo;For this reason, the ITGWU is strongly opposed to the inclusion in Irish law of the option which would permit small and medium-sized companies to prepare and publish abridged accounts only.&rdquo;  They are totally against that option.  That is the position of the largest trade union in this country and of the ICTU who reflect the opinion of the vast majority of the trade unions here.  They want this section deleted entirely.  They want no exemptions granted.  In amendments which we have put forward we are reducing the thresholds but still allowing exemptions for what are regarded in Ireland as small companies.  These thresholds would not cover every corner newsagent in the country, referred to by Deputy Flynn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of the fact that Deputy Mitchell, Deputy Flynn and the Minister continued to emphasise that all companies <Col N="1490" /> would have to make major disclosures of information and that Deputy Mitchell made the point that they would still be disclosing their profit and loss.  I must draw attention to the exclusion in section 10 (2) of the Bill on page 12 where it is provided that:</P>
    <P>(2) A company treated as a small company pursuant to section 8 (1) of this Act may, in lieu of complying with the requirements in that behalf in section 7 of this Act, annex to the annual return in relation to the company referred to in that section a copy of the balance sheet of the company drawn up in accordance with subsection (1) of this section in respect of the period to which the return refers and, notwithstanding the said section 7, the company shall not be required to annex to the return of a copy of the profit and loss account of the company or the report of the directors accompanying the balance sheet of the company.</P>
    <P>I want to place all that on the record because of Deputy Mitchell's reference to disclosure of the profit and loss account and the emphasis by Deputy Flynn and the Minister on the major disclosure of information which will be required from these companies.  No major disclosure of information is required from them.  That is what we are objecting to in these amendments.  We believe that the record of companies here is so bad that this type of directive should apply to practically all of them.</P>
    <P>Had the Government brought forward the new legislation on company law which we were told was ready three years ago by a previous Minister, Deputy Cluskey, who when leaving office had the heads ready, had these come forward, had company law been amended or had we even seen that it was being amended to prevent a whole series of anomalies in it, then possibly this would not be as bad as it is, because of a point I made at the outset, which the Minister did not refer to &mdash; the possibility under current company law of companies breaking themselves down to the level of thresholds which the Minister is talking about to ensure that they would <Col N="1491" /> not have to disclose information.  That is a very serious anomaly in our company law which allows companies to evade a whole series of things, and it will allow them to drive a coach and four through the Minister's Bill here today.  That is another reason why the thresholds must be lowered to the very minimum limit to ensure that this way out cannot be availed of.</P>
    <P>I do not want to keep on repeating this, but again I must ask the Minister a question to which he did not reply.  I asked him to refer to the possibility of companies under company law evading this legislation as they have evaded much other legislation by breaking themselves up into two, three or four different companies as they can do under present company law.</P>
    <P>The other question I asked him to which he did not reply is whether he or his Department can give an estimate of the number of private limited companies who are now required to give full disclosure of information with no exemptions under this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Every Government of the day must take into account the diverse opinions of interested groupings. The position about full disclosures suggested by Deputy Mac Giolla would be diametrically opposed by the CII, for instance, and by representatives of industry and commerce in general.  In this Bill we are trying to enact what we are satisfied is reasonable, taking into account the present development of the Irish economy and the fact that we are a very open, competitive economy and are not disposed towards putting our economic units at any economic disadvantage either within or without our country or within or without the EC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to what Deputy Mac Giolla has stated on profits, it is correct that small companies do not have to publish their profit and loss accounts but, of course, an ongoing look at the balance sheet will <Col N="1492" /> reveal the accumulated profits or losses in any event, so there should be no major difficulty there and, on a continuing basis, the submission of the balance sheet will make the company quite transparent anyway.  There is a fair argument in relation to competition that certain information should not be given in relation to small and medium companies which would be of benefit to large companies or their competitors, and we are trying to achieve that.  We are giving sufficient detail in the requirements that must be deposited in the Companies Registration Office.  The Deputy did not seem to wish to take on board the fact that all of the trading limited companies in this country will have to file these financial documents with the Companies Registration Office.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to speculate on the division between small, medium and large.  I have seen some figures and I can say that would fall into place quite quickly.  A comprehensive amount of information will have to be given in respect of all companies to the Companies Registration Office under this Bill.  I am satisfied that there are benefits in so doing, especially for traders, to ensure that companies are being run properly and are seen to be run properly.  That is the objective of the directive.  We are adhering to the directive but in so doing we are taking into account our present state of development.</P>

      <P>Sir, before you put it let me say it is not normal for a member of the Opposition to come to the rescue of a Minister, but I think Deputy Mac Giolla is being unfair in pressing this matter. He refuses to accept that every company registered will have to disclose certain information.  It will be considerably more than that disclosed at present.  He is right in saying that a small company will not have to publish a profit and loss account or a directors' report but every company, <Col N="1493" /> especially small companies, will have to publish a balance sheet and give certain information in the notes to the account. The Minister should have pointed out the kind of information which will be available under the notes to the accounts. They will have to set down the accounting policies of the company and analyse the share capital.  They will have to set out the provision which has been made by the company in regard to all questions of taxation and will have to give detailed information of the particulars of indebtedness. They will also have to give a breakdown of the translation of the foreign currencies which might be involved in the transactions of the business and give comparative figures.  I regret that all this has to be done.  The Minister should recognise that companies will now have to give an enormous amount of information which can be of great assistance to competitors and creditors in the industrial sense which will lead to a dislocation of business.  I regret that it must be so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a number of questions to put to the Minister on subsections (9), (11) and (12).  Subsection (9) deals with the number of employees of companies and how that is established.  That matter is also referred to in the Schedule. Will the Minister give a clear indication as to how the number of employees of a company seeking registration under the Bill is established?  There is some confusion in the subsection and in the Schedule. Subsection (11) deals with the powers to be given to the Minister to substitute different amounts in so far as subsections (2) and (3) are concerned.  It provides that the Minister can by order, without having to go before the House and introduce an amendment to the legislation, change the limitations at will.  I should like to know if that is incorporated in the directive.  If not, why did the Minister take the opportunity of incorporating in the Bill a provision that he would have to lay an order before the House if he wished to adjust downwards rather than doing it by the stroke of the pen?</P>

      <P>In relation to the mechanism referred to in subsection (9) for determining the average number of employees of a company, I should like to tell the Deputy that the method is set out in paragraph 42 of the Schedule.  The procedure involves adding up the numbers employed each week, or part of the week, and dividing them by 52 or a lesser figure if the financial year is less than a full year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>What about temporary employees?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>They will be averaged <Col N="1495" /> out and the figure worked out mathematically:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the definition of a temporary employee, as understood in the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, apply in establishing the total number of employees under the Bill?  A certain number of hours are laid out in statute as to what qualifies a person for temporary employment status.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an employee under a contract of service to the company.  The definition of an employee is clearly laid out.  The calculation is quite simple, one divides the number and the time they were with the company by the annual period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand how simple the division is but I am trying to clear up another matter.  If a company has 60 employees, which is just above the limit of 50 for getting exemption, and many of those employees are engaged in seasonal employment, doing fewer than the 15 hours per week which the Social Welfare Acts set down as the minimum requirement for temporary employment status, will they be accumulated and added in? They could put a company that would otherwise get small company status into the medium company status and that would mean a change in administration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Temporary or seasonal employees would have to be included in the computation for calculating the number of employees of the company. Subsection (11) enables the Minister to alter the threshold levels specified in subsections (2) and (3).  The directive provides for a review of the thresholds for balance sheet total and turnover and the rate of exchange used to translate into national currency the amount expressed in the directive in units of account. Indeed, there was one such review in October 1984.  Directive 84/569 of the EC issued on 27 November 1984 provided for an increase in the balance sheet total and turnover amount of 55 per cent and 60 <Col N="1496" /> per cent respectively to allow for average EC inflation since 1978.  The rate of exchange for the years was also changed in July 1978 and again on the date of the adoption of the directive, 25 July 1983. The changes overall allow Ireland to increase the figures in Irish currency by approximately 70 per cent to 75 per cent. Inflation in Ireland for the same period was 103 per cent.  While the figure in respect of employment in the directive was not subject to a review at EC level at present it is considered prudent to include it in the powers being given to the Minister in case the position alters at some date.  Earlier I said that the directive allows for a five years revision of the monetary figures.  What we are doing in this section is allowing the Minister to have an enabling mechanism to review, if he wishes, at any date the numbers which will define a small or medium company. Of course, it will enable any Minister to have a look at it if he feels it is necessary.</P>
      <P>The Deputy mentioned the question of an order.  An order must be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  It cannot be made and not laid before the Houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the Minister for the information he has given. I understand that when the review comes along every five years, or by order of the Commission, the limitations can be increased to take note of inflation or whatever, but I am anxious to know if subsection (11) gives the Minister the power at any time to reduce the thresholds as indicated in the Bill between now and the next review date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, once we are working within the parameters of the directive we can amend the threshold.  We are also taking into account the independent power of the Minister to change the employment threshold.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the limits as laid down in the legislation depend on the disposition of a Minister at any time?  Is that latitude given to the Minister in the directive? What section of the directive states <Col N="1497" /> that the Minister can take that power?  If that power is not in the directive, I do not see why the Minister is taking it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The directive allows us to adopt either the maximum or have less than the maximum threshold levels. Today we are adopting the maximum threshold levels and if a Minister in the future wishes to reduce the threshold he may do so.  Today we are adopting a threshold which is unlikely to be changed before the review at EC level.</P>

      <P>It is right to point out that the memorandum of association sets out the objects of the company when it was established.  The main object was to provide a prestigious National Concert Hall for the promotion of concerts and the recital of musical works of an artistic, educational and cultural value.  It does not make any specific reference as to type.  It is right that many of these people on the board are experts in this particular area.  The board represents a very wide range of talents, experience and expertise. I am very confident that over the next five years they will continue to guide the National Concert Hall to even greater heights than it has achieved already under the outgoing board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as the breakdown is concerned, over the entire period the real domination has been by classical concerts. Over the entire period there were 845 concerts of a classical nature, which would include orchestras, choirs, chamber ensembles, opera singers and so on. Of the non-classical type concerts &mdash; which I suppose would include jazz, Irish, pop, folk, concerts of that nature &mdash; there were 161; that is in the entire period up to 31 March.  The relevant figures for 1985 were 194 and 36 respectively.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister of State accept that when the Arts Council carried out a survey three years ago, to assess the musical preferences of Irish society, the overwhelming preference at that time was for Irish traditional music?  I might ask the Minister which member of the present board represents that particular element of Irish musical society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of that survey and, from my own observations, I would agree with it but, as I have said, there <Col N="1499" /> is no member representing that specific area.  There is a strong representation, if you like, of people who are experts in the classical area.  They themselves, because of their approach, would be capable of representing any section.  It is a fact that the Arts Council are represented by their chairman on the board of the National Concert Hall.  In turn, traditional music is very well represented at present by Mr. Munnelly and previously by the late Brendan Breathnach and the Arts Council.</P>

Apropos the earlier question, I would point out that there was nobody on the previous board either representing traditional music.

      <P>Does the Minister not think that to say the least, that was injudicious, that in a case where a very successful board had done a very good job, it was unwise to make such a sweeping change?  Is he not aware that his action in <Col N="1501" /> this regard has raised very serious doubts about the authenticity of his feelings for and his approach to the work of this institution?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite the contrary.  I am well aware that the appointments made by the Taoiseach have been very well received both in the public press and elsewhere. I am a great believer that, in the change over of boards, there should be a considerable change effected.  The previous board have done so well in establishing the National Concert Hall there should be no difficulty with the new board as far as continuity is concerned.  I think three out of 12 is a reasonable number, probably more than is usual in these kinds of transitions, if I may say so.  I believe they will do an excellent job.  It is a tremendous array of talent, expertise and experience, with a well balanced approach, and I would have no doubt that the National Concert Hall will flourish under them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Cooney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2, 6, 34, 76, 78, 79 and 80 together.</P>
      <P>My Department have received a letter from the Dyslexia Association of Ireland welcoming the Department's recent circular letter on the special arrangement to be made at the certificate examinations for candidates suffering from disabilities, but seeking clarification of some of the proposals, in particular the proposal to endorse certificates in certain cases.  I am aware that the association convened a special meeting to discuss the latter issue but I do not have a report of the meeting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should explain that the basic principle involved is that the integrity and acceptability of the certificates we award must be protected in the interests of all the candidates.  It is the practice of the Department, as set out in the circular letter referred to, to give special consideration to examination candidates suffering from a disability.  In cases where the award of a certificate in such cases might be misleading to a prospective employer or educational institution, then it becomes necessary to add an appropriate endorsement.  This would not be necessary in the case of a disability such as blindness or paraplegia which would be obvious to all.  Where allowance is made in the marking for a disability such <Col N="1504" /> as a specific learning disability which would not be immediately apparent, then it behoves the Department to add an appropriate endorsement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder if the Minister and the Department understand the point these parents make and made to me personally &mdash; I am sure, other Deputies have been approached.  Would the Minister not consider a point that is a cause of anguish to them, that children who have this disability, if they achieve this leaving certificate, will have the certificate devalued, apparently giving an attachment to it which will tell employers not to bother about it, that it is not worth the paper it is written on?  Would the Minister reassure the House, before I ask him other questions, that that positively is not the Department's intention?  If it is not the Department's intention, I wonder what the Department mean by giving a reply which uses the expression &ldquo;a certificate which might be misleading to an employer&rdquo;.  That would imply that the issue of a certificate with certain grades and certain subjects would tell an employer that the grades were something beyond the capacity of the candidate, in reality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like the Deputy to know that the reply to the question is as approved by me.  In the case of these children with these specific learning disabilities there is a special procedure for marking their examinations as a consequence of their disabilities.  If that special procedure were not available the results from these pupils, probably in many cases, would be considerably below a true reflection of their intellectual capacity. Nevertheless, there is a special procedure made available for them to assist them towards getting the Department's certificate. Those certificates in many cases are relied on by employers having regard to their face value, and the Department have to ensure that employers generally can be satisfied and happy with the integrity of the certificates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of the unfortunate children concerned, if the endorsement were not <Col N="1505" /> on the certificate and the certificate showed, for example, a high rate of achievement in the examination and was accepted at face value from somebody who did not suffer from any apparent disability, and the employer engaged somebody in good faith on the basis of an unendorsed certificate and then found that the candidate's capacity to perform was not reflected on the certificate, the employer would immediately have serious doubts about the integrity of the Department's certificate.  I appreciate there is a dilemma here and that in the resolution of it, like all dilemmas, somebody may be dissatisfied.  I repeat my point that it is very important that the official State certification should have its own integrity and should not be unwittingly the cause of misleading prospective employers.  The endorsement is not to downgrade the students concerned but merely to certify the realities of their particular situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I will put two questions to the Minister, which I will roll together. Would the Minister tell us exactly what this special consideration consists of?  I put it to the Minister that that special consideration is not substantial enough to warrant an endorsement of this kind. Would the Minister explain how it is that this is necessary at all if, as he has told the House, the whole purpose of the thing is to reflect in the certificate the true intellectual capacity of the child?  If the certificate is an effort to show the child's true intellectual capacity it cannot possibly mislead employers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The objective of it is to show the true intellectual capacity bearing in mind that there is a learning disability. The employer is entitled to be made aware of that and he can very quickly ascertain and get to know the true intellectual capacity of the applicant.  There would not be any question of anybody being misled.  The certificate is the proof of the true intellectual capacity of the child, but it also indicates that there is a handicap present.  In the case of specific learning difficulties, the level of difficulty <Col N="1506" /> can be certified by way of appropriate medical or psychological certification to the Department, and appropriate special arrangements are made.  They vary from case to case.  For instance, the candidate can be allowed to dictate his answers on a tape recorder and may be given the questions on tape.  That is one instance. Special consideration is given in the marking of these papers.  They are usually marked by an experienced examiner, normally an inspector, who would have been made aware in advance, on the basis of an application from the school, of the disability of the pupil concerned.</P>

      <P>I know a bit about this disability.  Does the Minister not recognise that in making this concession in regard to marking he is endeavouring to deal with a technical type of situation, but he is undoing that effort to deal with this problem by the endorsement?  Would he consider that aspect seriously?  His good intentions or the good intentions of the Department to deal with this special type of situation are being undone by the endorsement on the leaving certificate; and does he not think that he is making far too much of the aspect of it to which he referred, that employers might be misled if the endorsement was not there? Would he therefore consider if that is not a real difficulty in this regard?  In most cases the candidates to be interviewed would bring the particular circumstances to the attention of the employers in their own interest.  May I join with Deputy Kelly and others in asking the Minister to have a serious rethink on this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that I gave this matter much consideration before approving the new procedures. I was well aware of the emotive nature of the considerations involved and that we would be open to the charge made here that we are prejudicing these students and undoing the special arrangements made for them.  I do not think so. The special arrangements will be reflected in the end result.  There is logic in that.  These pupils have special learning disabilities.  If we had not the special <Col N="1507" /> arrangements for examining them, in most cases they would not be able to obtain any certificate at all.  Having made the special arrangements for examination, it is only equitable, so far as the validity of the State certification is concerned, that it would reflect the fact that special arrangements had to be made for these people.  That need not prejudice them in their employment opportunities because if the inherent dyslexic incapacity is there, an employer who wants to engage them will engage them, but he will not be able to say that he was misled by the certification or documentation produced.</P>
      <P>With regard to the certificate itself, it is important that on its face it should be a document which can be relied on.  That has been a consideration of which I have had to take account on the one side.  I had also to look at the other side to see if these pupils were being prejudiced in any way.  Quite honestly, I cannot see that they are being prejudiced.  What is being said on the certificate is not anything about them that would not subsequently become available or known to people who might have to rely on the certificate concerned but who, if they subsequently became so aware, might begin to cast doubts on the bona fides of the Department's approach.</P>

      <P>What the Minister says would be valid in a situation in which there was competition by firms to get people into jobs.  The reverse is the case. There are literally thousands of applications for every job.  In the process of selecting possible interviewees, employers automatically, I think, will eliminate those whose certificates refer to special consideration.  Before these people get to the point of being interviewed they will have been discriminated against in a way which they cannot fight or against which they cannot protest.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly, I should be happy to arrange a meeting between that association and my officials if the association feel they would like to discuss the matter further.  As I have said, there is an essential dilemma here which falls to somebody to resolve.  I feel that I have resolved it in the most equitable way possible, bearing in mind all the considerations to which I have adverted in the course of the earlier supplementary questions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I point out that I put down Priority Question No. 34, which the Chair included with the other two questions?  This again highlights the unfairness of the present system, in that the normal question for oral answer can take precedence over the priority question. Therefore, the word &ldquo;priority&rdquo; has no meaning.</P>
      <P>With regard to Priority Question No. 34, why was this circular issued in the first place?  Why this new move within the Department?  I am aware that the circular was issued in 1985, but it is affecting State examinations for the first time in 1986.  Who initiated the demand and what was the need for this circular?</P>
      <P>Would the Minister not accept that the student in question &mdash; and I am aware that this endorsement deals with any other learning or psychological disability also &mdash; has enough disadvantages in life without having to cope for the rest of his or her career with a specially endorsed, marked certification of examination results?  As an educationist, I think it is unfair and discriminatory to the student involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a certain lack of logic there.  In the case of a blind candidate, for instance, it would be quite <Col N="1509" /> clear to an employer or to anybody perusing the certificate that it was received under a special arrangement.  In the case of the dyslexic student, there is no obvious disability but nevertheless a disability is there.  The certificate equalises matters in regard to other students.  It recognises the unfortunate reality that that pupil suffers from this particular defect.</P>
      <P>The matter has been under consideration in our Department for some time. We were unhappy about the status of certificates issued to such students without having this endorsement.  After much debate and consideration internally, I came to the conclusion, bearing all relative factors in mind, that the endorsement was the most equitable thing which could be done because of all the factors concerned, that it would not prejudice the student concerned.  The certificate does not draw attention to something which is not there and is not giving to the student a disability which does not exist. No amount of whitewashed paper will remove the burden that that places on the unfortunate student.  I have to be sure that the State certification is valid.</P>

The present decision is the culmination of an internal policy review, no more than that. I shall, of course, meet the members of the association and arrange with my officials to discuss the matter in detail with them.  I shall consult them myself if that would be of any assistance.

      <P>A leaflet giving general information about the various schemes under which aid is provided to students in third level colleges is already available from my Department.  The body responsible for the administration of each scheme of aid advertises such scheme annually in the public press and makes copies of the scheme available free of charge to interested parties.  These present arrangements have proved adequate for their purpose but if the Deputy has had any particular difficulty in obtaining information I would invite him to communicate with me.</P>

Putting all the information together could prove difficult because there could be a whole range of scholarships and prizes of one kind or another offered by the universities, for instance.  The production of a comprehensive booklet might prove expensive, but I shall give the matter consideration.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister of State aware that there is no room on the site, when a new school is completed, for further prefabs?  Apart from one prefab which was provided in 1985, all existing prefabs have been there since 1973. There is no permanent accommodation for rental in or adjacent to the school.  It is imperative that due consideration be given to the request made by the VEC and by others in relation to Killybegs. Secondly, were statistics provided by the Department of Education given due consideration when provision was made in Kellybegs for a 300 pupil school?  The projections are that by 1987 there will be 374 pupils there.</P>

I want to say to Deputy Coughlan that the planning section of the Department are actively considering the application for an enlargement of that new school.  In that context, it is not always as simple as it might seem as to whether it should be an extension of the existing contract or the tendering of a new one.  I would hope to be in a position to give a decision with regard to the application for an enlargement in a short time.  I agree that an early decision in this matter is very desirable.</P>

      <P>I do not think the Minister's reply is satisfactory because while I will give him the case there are a considerable number of cases which have come to my attention over a number of years.  Could I ask the Minister what is the correct procedure for a school if a child is disruptive and the teacher will not allow the child to be in the class because he is disrupting the teaching of others? The explanation of the school is that they must maintain discipline.  Therefore, they removed the child who was not allowed to return to class.  What is the correct procedure in that case?  Is the school supposed to refer the child to a particular special school?  Are they supposed to provide a separate and special education for that child?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of procedures which follow such an incident. Obviously, if the child is disruptive it is neither in the child's interest nor that of his fellow pupils that he would continue to disrupt the school.  A new environment and a new school may be the proper place for that child.  The application of common sense between parents, the board of management and adjoining boards of management and possibly the utilisation of the special initiatives which are under way in some parts of the city for disruptive children could lead to a solution of the problem. I cannot say to the Deputy what the solution to the problem is without knowing the full facts.  That is why I was careful to ask the Deputy on a number of occasions that if he has a particular problem to come to me and between us we will try to find a solution to it.</P>

The committee have examined the submission, have visited Thomond College and have met with the college authorities. On receipt and examination of the committee's report, a decision will be taken. As I do not wish to pre-empt the findings of the committee on this matter I regret that I am unable to give any more detailed information to the Deputy.</P>

      <P>When I set down this question earlier in the year I asked the Minister of State to consider the Howth-Baldoyle area for the siting of this complex.  The reason I asked the Minister of State to do so was that water sports could be included in such a centre.  Has the Minister of State made any progress on that?  Could I also ask the Minister of State how committed the Government are to investing money in sport?  The contracts appear to be very slow in moving. Could I ask the Minister to comment on the fact that the Government are not doing enough to invest money in sport?</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dún Laoghaire):</i> The details of investment in sport is a separate question but I can say that sport cannot get enough money provided it is spent in the right direction and used wisely.  The same applies to the location of a sports centre or centres.  It would be wise of us to wait for the committee's report.  The broad outlines of the brief given to this committee are the possible locations, area required for indoor and outdoor sport facilities, multi-purpose and otherwise, to be provided over five year and ten year spans on a priority basis and the estimate of costings.  The committee have been working extremely hard.  Many requests and submissions have come in asking that the centre be located in one place or the other.  Naturally, everybody wants facilities for his own area.  That is quite understandable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would hope, when the decision is taken having examined the committee's report, that we will be seen to locate it in <Col N="1523" /> the right place or, again depending on the committee's report, we will see what type of facilities should be located in one area or should be spread over a number of areas depending on the suitability of the facilities available in other areas.  I would hope that the national lottery would be a means of funding sport on a proper basis with a regular income so that one could plan well in advance.  I look forward to being able to participate in that.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of schemes under which grants and scholarships are made available to eligible students from the lower income families to assist them in pursuing courses of third level education.  The higher education grants scheme is the appropriate scheme in the case of eligible students who enter on university courses.</P>
      <P>As promised in paragraph 5.23 of the Government's national plan <i>Building on Reality 1985-1987</i>, the financial provisions of the higher educational grant and related schemes were updated in 1985 as follows: (a) the income eligibility limits for grants were increased by 11 per cent; (b) a tapering of eligibility limits was introduced so as to provide for the partial payment of fees, and (c) the maintenance elements of grants were increased by 16 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The income eligibility limits and maintenance element of grants will be increased in line with inflation in 1986 also.  The lecture fee element of grants will be increased for the academic year 1986-87 in line with the increases in fees in that academic year.  The middle level <Col N="1525" /> technician training programme, supported by the European Social Fund, provides for 12,000 places in regional technical colleges and colleges of technology. Those participating in this programme are not required to pay fees and the maintenance allowances payable are £464 per annum for those living at home while engaged in training or £1,160 per annum for those living away from home.</P>

That is allowing for the fact that the student would get the full amount of grant and maintenance. The gap between the grant or maintenance and the cost is such that they cannot even think of going for third level education.</P>

It is very difficult to say that there is such a thing as an average cost for a student because so much depends on the individual.

It is generally agreed that within existing resources there would be difficulty in changing the present system of capitation grants.  The problems of certain inner-city schools are recognised and special additional grants have been made to the patrons of schools in Dublin, Cork and Limerick so as to enable them to supplement the local contribution to schools which have been designated as serving disadvantaged areas.  The total provision for the schools in disadvantaged areas has been increased by 50 per cent and is £.75 million in the current year.

      <P>The increase will be at least in line with inflation.  In the case of higher education grant schemes, when an increase in fees occurs the lecture fee element is increased accordingly.  In so far as 1986-87 is concerned, one would have to wait to see what the increase in the lecture fee element will be, if it is not announced already.  I do not have it here. The grants will be increased in accordance with the increase in lecture fees.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister accept that the notice given to the schools in the circular issued to them was very short?  Will he consider giving a further extension or will he issue a new circular? At Question Time about six weeks ago I tabled a question to the Minister to which <Col N="1530" /> I did not receive a satisfactory answer.  I asked what resources and plans, if any, the Department have formulated to enable schools to pursue these initiatives satisfactorily.  With regard to schools that put forward their applications and which were deemed to be in order, I wish to know the number of extra teachers the Department will allocate to the schools interested in initiating the transition year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the first part of the Deputy's supplementary, to some extent the timetable was as a result of the date of the publication of the document from the Curriculum and Examinations Board on the transition year.  That was published in January and the circular letter was issued on 31 January asking for programmes to be in by 1 March.  I take the point made by the Deputy that the time was possibly a little short and I will examine the matter to see if the time can be extended.  However, having regard to the fairly lengthy examination that has to take place on the proposal and bearing in mind that this is a new development, it might not be feasible this year to extend the closing date.  We may stick with what we have this year and by next year we will have learned quite a lot.  I am advised that extra teachers will not be needed. Should there be a demand for extra teachers that will not arise until the third year the scheme is in operation.  This year will not mean there will be extra pupils in the total number in a school because the pupils are in a transition year class.  When the pupils go into sixth year, instead of having left school in the fifth year if the transition year had not been interposed in the meantime, then there will be extra pupils in the school but that bulge will not emerge for another few years.  There will be no difficulty with regard to resources in the current year.</P>

      <P>I am asking a question. I wish to know from the Minister what plans he and his Department have made with regard to teachers.  What plans have been made with regard to the allocation of special duties to a teacher in a school to supervise and arrange the plans for the transition year?  I wish to know what plans the Department have made to allocate funds for the smooth running of the transition year.  In view of the poor arrangements that have been made, is the Minister satisfied that a sufficient number of schools will be able to take up what I consider would be a very worthy initiative if it were properly arranged, researched and resourced?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I was hoping the Deputy's compliment with regard to the initiative could have been left without being lessened by a complaint about the mechanisms for introducing it.  I think the Deputy exaggerates the resources problem. There will not be extra pupils in a school as a result of this proposal.  Some of the pupils in a particular year will go into a transition year class and it will be a matter for the school to rearrange its quota of <Col N="1532" /> teachers to deal with the new transition year.  We must bear in mind that the schools who have applied to participate in the transition year are schools that are satisfied they have the competence to provide the transition year.  In addition, they will have the assistance of the Department in working out the composition of the transition year.  Part of our assessment at the moment is reviewing replies from the schools concerned to a fairly comprehensive list of questions concerning their proposals.  Between the resources and expertise of the Department and of the schools we hope for this year to get this worthwhile initiative under way.  We do not anticipate any difficulty with resources because the number of students being dealt with in a school by the quota of teachers allocated to that school will be the same as last year.  It is a matter for the school concerned to rearrange the allocation of teaching duties for the transition year. I assume that schools will not apply to participate in the transition year unless they are prepared to make such reallocation and redeployment of their resources. Every assistance from the Department will be available to them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">

      <P>Naturally schools applied when the circular was issued to them because they were anxious to do it for their students.  If difficulties arise in isolated or in several schools in relation to the successful implementation and operation of the transition year with regard to the allocation of teachers or resources, will the Minister allocate the resources necessary?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The percentage fee increases for third level courses in VEC colleges in 1986-87 as compared with 1985-86 are as follows: Certificate courses, 11.3 per cent; Diploma courses, 19.9 per cent; Degree courses (excluding architecture and engineering), 18.3 per cent; Architecture and engineering degree courses, 17.6 per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Inflation this year will be nil, or so the teachers have been told. Therefore increases in fees of 11.3 per cent, 19.9 per cent and 18.3 per cent in third level colleges are beyond the capability of any student or parent to meet.  Would the Minister agree that this is pricing such colleges out of the reach of the average student?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not agree with the Deputy in her last conclusion.  Nor would I agree that these percentage increases are excessive because they cannot be looked at in isolation purely as percentage increases; we have to look at the base on which these percentage increases are founded and these fees are increases on what was a very low base indeed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has said he does not find such rises excessive. Bearing in mind that RTCs do not, to date, have the facilities which are available in traditional universities, how does the Minister expect the young people to get the technological and scientific education necessary for them, and to which the Government have such commitment, if they cannot enter the colleges because of the high levels of fees? Is the Minister aware that while there are ESF grants for two years of those courses there are none going on to certification or to degree?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>What I said was that these percentage increases cannot be looked at in isolation as percentage increases <i>per se.</i> They have to be related to the base to which they refer.  The point I was making to the Deputy is that the base of these fees was traditionally very low and even with these increases added the fees are still substantially less than equivalent fees in universities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that, but that is not the point of my question.  My point was to ask the Minister how he can stand over increases from 11 per cent to 20 per cent in one year on third level fees.  It is a very simple question.  How can that be to the advantage of the student?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The fees have to be based on a realistic figure that is just and realistic in relation to the income of the vocational educational committee concerned and in relation to all the other demands on the Irish taxpayer.  It is my opinion that the percentage increases put forward, having regard to the low base on which these percentage increases are based, are fair and reasonable bearing in mind also the wide range of substantial grants available to the majority of students attending these colleges.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister keeps referring to the low base.  Would he not <Col N="1535" /> accept that over the last three years that low base has been eroded and in fact wiped out by this Government who have each year pushed huge fee increases on RTCs and VECs?  No matter how the Minister tries to deny that, it is a fact. Fee rises from 11 per cent to 20 per cent just cannot be right.  It is closing the door to many who could otherwise go into third level education.</P>

      <P>I put it to the Minister that it is weird, to say the least, that the Government would take a major decision to nationalise Dublin Gas without having any estimate in front of them of the total cost to the taxpayer.  In other words, is he giving a blank cheque to the receiver to carry out nationalisation?  If he had no estimated figures before he took the decision to nationalise this company, is he now saying nobody knows what it will cost?</P>

He said his actions and the actions of the Government, as set out in a statement attributed to him on 11 April, were clear-cut.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I must reject the allegation which Deputy Reynolds is repeating frequently today in relation to deceit or otherwise in information issued on 11 April.  I recall that information for the benefit of Deputies present.  In view of the financial difficulties in the Dublin Gas Company a receiver has been appointed by Bord Gáis Éireann with the approval of the Government.  The receiver will be issuing his own statement but his object will be to maintain the business as a going concern.  Every effort will be made to ensure that the arrangements for distributing natural gas to domestic and industrial consumers in Dublin are well ordered and efficient.  The State is determined to protect its investment and interests in Dublin Gas.  It is evident that public ownership is the only effective means of ensuring this and in due course I intend to take the appropriate steps to bring the operation of gas distribution in Dublin into public ownership.  That is the statement I made, and I stand over it.</P>

      <P>In page 11, subsection (1), line 47, to delete &ldquo;and roman&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;or roman&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to secure that items listed in the formats to which either an alphabetic or roman designation has been given will be disclosed in the abbreviated accounts of a &ldquo;small&rdquo; company, and not just those items to which both designations have been given. An example would be the item &ldquo;Net current assets&rdquo; in format 1 which is given only the alphabetic designation &ldquo;D&rdquo;. This approach accords with Article 11 of the directive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of amendment No. 15 is identical to that already described under subsection (1) of section 10, i.e., to <Col N="1569" /> secure that items listed in the formats to which either an alphabetic or roman notation has been given will be disclosed, and not just those items to which both designations have been given.

      <P>I move amendment No. 14<i>a:</i></P>
      <P>In page 12, subsection (2), line 26, after &ldquo;Act,&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;but subject to section 3 (1) (b) of this Act,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The effect of this amendment is to require the balance sheet published by a medium sized company to give a true and fair view.  This is what the reference to section 3(1)(b) means in the amendment.  At present the balance sheet required to be published by small companies under section 10(2) must give a true and fair view, but it is not clear in section 11(2) that the balance sheet published by a medium sized company should also give this view.  In practice, this could lead to medium sized companies having to publish slightly different information from that which small companies are required to.  The amendment rectifies this anomaly.  The amendment does not alter the position that medium sized companies will have to publish more extensive information in the balance sheet than will small companies to whom section 10(2) applies.  The need for this change was brought to my attention lately by the accountancy bodies who suggested a change for clarity and consistency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>This section suggests that medium sized companies' profit and loss accounts and balance sheets of smaller companies must show a true and fair view and comply with the true and fair principles. The balance sheets which medium sized companies must file have no such requirement.  Is this altered by this <Col N="1570" /> amendment?  If that be so in the case of the balance sheet of the medium sized companies then, in effect, a small company must publish more information than the statutory minimum information medium sized companies have to publish. I do not know if the Minister intends to alter that, but I hope if it is not altered by his amendment he will consider the matter further on Report Stage.  There would be an imbalance there which I think was not intended in the directive. The way it is phrased here would lead one to feel that medium sized companies are getting an advantage over small companies. It should be the other way around.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>On the contrary, the purpose of the amendment is to ensure that medium sized companies publish the same information as small companies, so an advantage is not being given to medium sized companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a point of sensitivity there as far as auditors are concerned related to the significance of the date on which the title of assets passes from one to the other.  Is that included in this section?  If a small company presented a full balance sheet to their shareholders and published the abridged balance sheet, there would be two different sets of accounts and both would be under an obligation to give a true and fair view.  If the true and fair view results in both balance sheets being the same, then the concession is given with one hand and taken away with the other.  I do not think that is the intention.  In maintaining a true and fair view an anomaly could exist in that small companies may have to give information medium sized companies do not have to give.  That would be regrettable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied that it does.  The amount of information to be given by a small company is quite defined. In relation to a medium sized company this amendment ensures that the information is on a par with that required from small companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The example that might come up of this dual matter under the existing Bill where the anomaly exists is that neither small nor medium sized companies have to show any analysis of stocks according to this Bill, but in the standard statement of accounting practice this is required and it is necessary to satisfy the true and fair view.  Therefore, there is a lesser requirement now in the Bill as against the statement of standard practice.  If that is so the small company will have to publish the analysis but the medium sized company will not have to publish the analysis.  That anomaly, if allowed to continue in the Bill, will defeat the purpose of the exemptions that can be granted to small companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Because of this amendment the medium sized company will now have to give this analysis the Deputy referred to.  In both cases the principles of a true and fair view continue to exist. Whether the balance sheet is in a full analysed format or an abbreviated format which is allowed, the same information will have to be given by a small company and a medium sized company.</P>

      <P>Any document under this Bill which must be filed in the Companies Registration Office, whether profit and loss account, balance sheet, auditor's report, directors' report or notice of accounts, must give a full and fair view of the company's position.  That runs right through the Bill and whether documents are submitted in an abridged form or explanations are given in the <Col N="1572" /> notes rather than in the accounts or whatever, the concept of a true and fair view must run right through.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied that a full and fair view can be accommodated without allowing the anomaly to continue? With the publishing of the abridged accounts and the full accounts submitted to the shareholders, can the anomaly be squeezed out by this amendment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>There was never any question of moving away from the true and fair view.  The only matter raised was whether or not the accounts can be an abridged version.  With the amendment we are ensuring that the amount of information to be submitted to the Companies Registration Office by both small and medium sized companies will be on the same basis, on a par.</P>

      <P>Section 11 really applies to exemptions for medium sized companies from the provisions of section 3 to section 7 and the same can apply in regard to the exemptions for small companies in section 10.  It is a pity that Deputy Mac Giolla is not here to say that there are variations in different company sizes and that when one takes the two sets of thresholds in the previous sections into consideration and adds the exemption it is <Col N="1573" /> obvious that this Bill is going to mandate every company in the country one way or another to give an enormous amount of disclosure of information.  I hope the Minister has succeeded in riding out the anomalous situation that exists in this section.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>This section is considerably important.  It provides for considerable disclosure of the operations of companies. I take it this is in addition to the information which would normally be sought under section 158 of the Principal Act.  It is necessary to consider certain elements of this section to see exactly what is intended by the promoters of the directive.  Perhaps they have gone much too far here in offering an open invitation to the creditors of industry.  They are going to put industry at a great disadvantage. Consider the items that must be made known by those who have to comply with section 13.  They have to give a full and fair report of all the developments of the company and its subsidiaries. They also have to give all the important events which might be attached to that company and, worst of all, an indication of the future developments of the company.  If an ordinary company are considering developing their business in a year or two years' time and are making financial arrangements to allow them to do this, their opposition and competitors are fully aware in advance of the business intentions and financial arrangements which the company have in mind.  I regard that as an enormous disclosure for any business to sustain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under this legislation they also have to tell the general public what they propose to do in so far as research and development programmes are concerned.  That is <Col N="1574" /> not just an indication to competitors of what they will face in the market place; it is also an indication to business interests at home and abroad and to those in competition with them that such information is easy to obtain.  This information is valuable. Indeed, the most valuable resource a company have is their information resource which should have been protected. The predators in the business world should not have been facilitated by this section which lays naked the whole operation, financial arrangements and intentions of a particular company in so far as improving their business is concerned.</P>
    <P>If is one thing to give a review of how your business and subsidiaries have been doing for the past few years, but quite another to indicate in advance to your competitors what you propose to do in a year's time.  I draw particular attention to this.  There is no way of getting round it because the Minister is so determined that a true and fair view must apply to every aspect of the legislation.  I regret that the Minister could not find a formula of words which would have allowed existing business to carry on their research and development programmes and future intentions without laying bare their total commitment in that regard.  I would go so far as to say that I could not imagine even Deputy Mac Giolla seeing the rationale behind this section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is over-emphasising this matter as any company should be obliged to give shareholders a true and fair view of their activities. However, this section is a reflection of article 46 of the directive and it is incumbent on us to include it in our legislation. The position is that the directors' report on a small company is not lodged in the Companies Registration Office but we are talking about medium and large sized companies.  In relation to a small company the report of the directors will also have to be made to shareholders and that distinction is in the Bill.  We require that the directors' report should give a fairer view of the development of the company, especially in relation to important events over the period under review, an indication of likely future developments and of the activities in the company's subsidiaries in the field of research and development. These are of relevance to shareholders and I do not think it would endanger the company as Deputy Flynn stated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no objection to information of this kind being made available to shareholders.  In fact, it would be a very strange practice if shareholders did not have the information as it would be very hard for them to make proper corporate decisions unless this kind of information was available to them because they are directly involved and primarily concerned as to how research is going and what new business the company will be involved in.  However, it is a slightly different matter to have such information made available to one's competitors. If the Minister had put down this section I would have opposed it and called for a division.  The only reason I am not doing so is that article 46 of the directive almost word for word mandates the Minister to include it in this legislation. I should like to ask the Minister if there is any legislative process that I can use to remove the intent of that section from the legislation now, on Report Stage, or in some other way.  Am I refused the power to do so because of <Col N="1576" /> article 46?  Does that article condemn business to adopt this section?</P>

      <P>It is incumbent on the Government to translate article 46 into national law.  I do not like to use the word &ldquo;condemn&rdquo;.  I have read many company reports, some of which were clear and others which were not, but shareholders are entitled to know what is happening in a company&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>They are entitled to be informed of major trends and in some cases there may be a predominance of shareholders who wish to keep information from the minority shareholders which is not desirable.  Perhaps this section will ensure that there is more freedom of information available to all shareholders.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that.  The companies we are talking about here, ones that would be involved in research and developing programmes, would more than likely be medium sized.  They will be put under considerable stress by this. This section has caused such ripples in the business sector that solicitors' offices around this city are working into the late hours creating the avenues necessary to get out from under it.  I wholeheartedly support their hard work in reconstituting themselves as branches, or taking unlimited status, or getting themselves established and incorporated under different arrangements so that they will not have their research and development programmes made available to their competitors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure the Minister of State in his <Col N="1577" /> business dealings would have recognised how damaging it would be to one's company to know that what one was hoping to achieve by way of a new product was hindered because one had to give indications in advance that one was intent on developing a new product line, that one had a development programme coming to fruition and that one would be making the necessary financial arrangements to do this.  A person who has spent no money on research and development may decide to pick up that project which will be available to him or her without any outlay.  That person may decide to use the brains and money of another company to accommodate himself.  That is where the predatory effect I was referring to comes in.  I regret that article 46 had to be taken on board in its entirety.</P>
    <P>I had hoped the Minister would have taken on board the maximum exemptions in the fourth directive.  As far as this section is concerned, the disclosure of such things as turnover, research and development and the breaking down of markets and classes of business a company is involved in is, in effect, anti-business. I regard this section as anti-business and anti-industrial development. It will have a marked effect not just on business development but on the efforts to attract investment into the country.  It may lead to a cessation of research and development programmes that are under way and being promoted actively by the Minister's colleagues in Government.  They made a major statement recently to the effect that they propose to provide extra funding for research and development programmes here.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil have issued a science and technology document which will be activated as soon as we get an opportunity. The section before us runs contrary to the whole thrust of industrial development we have been trying to generate for the past few years.  I regret the provision is in the Bill and that I cannot table an amendment to set it aside in its entirety. I know the Minister would like to agree with that but, unfortunately, he will be forced through the lobby in support of <Col N="1578" /> something he wishes in his heart was not in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The kind of information I see being involved in this would be of interest to competitors only.  If the country recognised that what is now being proposed seeks to give full and total disclosure of confidential and strategic information on the intentions of a company in financial gearing and its research and development programmes, there would be a major outcry against it.  Nobody will thank us if we cause unemployment and liquidations by passing something that was rammed down our throats by the EC Commission. This should have been fought by the Government before it got to the floor of the House.  On behalf of the business community I should like to enter the strongest reservation about the section which seeks total disclosure of the intentions of businesses.  It is regrettable and I hope there is a way in which the Minister can minimise its impact.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Flynn has raised what seem to be legitimate fears about the section and the Minister of State has not replied adequately to the points raised by him.  I have not got all the answers to this question but I am sure the Minister has because this matter was discussed at many levels throughout the EC.  I am sure Deputy Flynn is not the first to raise this matter because it has been dealt with by countries with more industrial and company experience than we have.  Those countries are wide awake to the problems of rivals.  I am sure the appropriate replies to questions raised by Deputy Flynn are available to the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure, as Deputy Flynn said, that the section does not require full and detailed explanations of all proposals for research and development in a company or its subsidiaries.  The Minister should tell us the type of information that is required.  Paragraph (d) refers to an indication of the activities, if any, of the company and its subsidiaries in the field of research and development.  I understand that to be a generalised comment to the effect that a company is carrying <Col N="1579" /> out research and development on the effects of air pollution on buildings although a specific research was being carried out on the effect of CO2 on limestone. If a full and detailed account of the activities of a company in the field of research and development and future developments of the company is required then the fears expressed by Deputy Flynn are legitimate.  I am sure those fears have been expressed at Commission level and in countries where this directive has been adopted.  The directive should have been adopted here five years ago which means that we are behind other countries.  The answers to the questions posed by Deputy Flynn must be available and I am sure the Minister has them.  I hope the Minister will give a detailed reply to the points raised by Deputy Flynn.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that Deputy Flynn accused the Government of being anti-business in the section and said that the section is anti-industry.  He made a lot of play about the damage the provision will do.  I should like to remind him that a Fianna Fáil administration agreed to the directive in 1978 and if he jogs his mind back the facts may become more apparent to him.  We are converting European law into national law in the Bill.  Paragraphs (c) and (d), the two vital provisions under consideration, commence with the words &ldquo;an indication&rdquo;. What is required is an indication of likely future developments in the company and its subsidiaries.  I would not consider that an onerous task or one that would expose the company to a competitive challenge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to research and development, again the initial words are: &ldquo;an indication of the activities&rdquo;.  This should not cause companies any trouble.  It is merely to give an indication of what are the intentions of the company.  I do not think any company secrets need be given away.  Neither do I think any information of vital interest to the company or to the competitors of a company need be given. The words have been carefully chosen in the directive as well as in the law.  It is nice to see the new found friendship <Col N="1580" /> between Deputies Flynn and Mac Giolla. I can allay their fears about the security of a company with regard to the information it would have to include in the directors' report.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not pursue the matter any further.  The Minister is quite right when he says that in Article 46, subsection (2), it is made quite clear that the report is merely to seek an indication. When that was being thrashed out it took some years before that word was permitted, for the very good reason Deputy Mac Giolla and I have been advancing, that there were those who thought it should be the other way round.  I am happy to see that the Minister has taken it on board.  Even as it is, it could be maintained that indicators are very informative in many cases.</P>
      <P>We have broken our necks in this area at being good Europeans.  I want to tell the House that all the other European jurisdictions are not such good Europeans. They have taken the greatest pains not to comply with the spirit, the intent or the wording of that directive.  It was very easy for the United Kingdom Government to do so because an awful lot of the provisions in this directive were less stringent than some of the legislation already in place there.  That applies to some other European countries as well, but not so with beloved Ireland.</P>
      <P>Germany, Greece, Luxembourg and France have not yet completed their business in so far as the implementation of this directive is concerned in national legislation.  They have implemented some elements to try to get over the hump, to give the impression they are doing something.  The Germans in particular &mdash; because the vast majority of companies registered in that country take the form of limited partnerships &mdash; did not want that provision included at all. One can say to them: well done.  They have been promised a new directive all to themselves that will deal with limited partnerships which means they will not be involved in the disclosures outlined in this directive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>France has a limited arrangement &mdash;<Col N="1581" /> we should have taken good note of what the French were doing in this regard &mdash; because the French did not want to take it on board in its entirety either.  The same goes for Luxembourg.  The implementation of their national legislation is now regarded as dubious.  But not good old Ireland.  We will do nothing dubious to protect our industrial base.  We are taking on board holus-bolus everything included in the directive.</P>
    <P>When a question of national interest is concerned the day-to-day arrangements in other countries in these matters might not always suit our situation.  That is one of the disadvantages of being in the EC. I accept that.  They have the collective muscle to push through certain legislation that does not affect them in any ulterior way but that could be damaging to the position that has obtained here over the years in so far as limited liability status is concerned.  We were a good bit behind our European partners in this regard but certainly we will be ahead of them once this business is finished.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I take issue with the Deputy, not in any partisan way.  We do have a directive that is being implemented. I am aware of the GmbHs in Germany.  We are watching the position very carefully.  I understand that the Commission are preparing a directive to bring the GmbHs within the scope of this directive.  That is as it should be.  Italy and Greece are the two remaining defaulting countries.  The directive is being implemented and, where it is not being implemented, the Commission are taking the relevant countries to court.  We have not been to the forefront in the implementation of this legislation.  We have examined it very closely.  We have conformed to it in the best interests of our economy and industry as far as we can see.  The Deputy states that we are good Europeans.  We are not; we are Europeans.  We are partaking in a political structure, in a community, that requires legislation to be unified in large measure by directives. That is what we are doing, no more and no less.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it they must comply with the overriding principle of the fair and true view but that they have discretion in certain matters and can move away from consistency in so far as the accounting principles are concerned as long as they put a note to that effect on the accounts.  I take it that is included in so far as they are concerned as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is quite simple.  They must ensure that the provisions of this Bill, once enacted, are conformed to by the companies for whom they are acting as auditors.  The central theme of the Bill, to give a true and fair view of a company, pertains.  Where there is any deviation from the formats in the Bill, it must be explained quite clearly by way of notes.  There is no latitude given to auditors to move away from the provisions of the Bill or from its central thrust.  In fact, it is the duty of auditors to ensure that the provisions of the Bill are complied with in all aspects and that there is no deviation allowed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>All they have to do is show consistency in so far as the directors' report is concerned.  Once they are satisfied that is the case, they are unhooked from liability in the matter.  Is that not correct?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I would suggest that there are a number of areas in which auditors have serious responsibilities. One is in relation to the accuracy of the accounts, the value of the items within the accounts, the compilation of <Col N="1583" /> accounts, the view that true and proper books have been maintained, whether a company are a going concern, whether there are other qualifications which they would be obliged to put into their report. But, in relation to this Bill, it is quite clearly their responsibility to ensure that a true and fair view of the company is given and that, where a company deviate from the responsibilities set out in this Bill, that should be quite clearly noted. Clearly the obligation is on auditors to ensure compliance with the provisions of this Bill.  There is no question about that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I interpret the Minister correctly now as saying the auditor has to sign a statement accompanying the reports to be filed in the Companies Registration Office that he is satisfied the directors' report is consistent with the accounts?  Does he physically have to sign that auditor's statement?  I would think that is a very important aspect and I should like to think it would be incorporated with the accounts, that the auditor was making himself liable, individually or collectively in so far as the directors' report and company accounts are concerned. That is what is important.</P>

      <P>I had hoped the Minister might indicate the type of information that need not be given.  This might be of value to those studying the intent of the legislators as distinct from words in the legislation, which I have no doubt will be the cause of litigation hereafter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>This provision in section 16 (1) requires that companies which at the end of their financial year have subsidiary or associated companies shall provide certain details in relation to such holdings in the notes to their accounts, as required by article 43.1.(2) of the directive.  For the purpose of this subsection, the term &ldquo;subsidiary&rdquo; has the meaning set down in section 155 of the Companies Act, 1963 and the term &ldquo;associated&rdquo; company has the meaning specified in paragraph (b) of this subsection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of each such subsidiary or associated company, the information specified in paragraphs (i) to (iv) of this subsection is required to be provided by <Col N="1585" /> way of notes to the accounts.  The information is, name, address and business of the subsidiary or associated company, percentage of the shares held, identifying each class of shares held, capital and reserves, and profit or loss for the latest financial year of the subsidiary or associated company.</P>
    <P>It should be noted that section 158 of the Companies Act, 1963 already contains a comparable disclosure requirement, though the proposal contained in this Bill differs from current requirements in three important respects.  First, the information in question is being required by way of notes to the accounts, whereas it was previously provided in the directors' report.  This change is required by article 43 of the Fourth Directive.</P>
    <P>Second, the information which must now be disclosed is more comprehensive than that required under section 158 (4) and (5) of the 1963 Act which was limited to the name, place of incorporation and nature of business of each such subsidiary or associated company.  Third, the definition of an associated company contained in the 1963 Act, while based on holdings in excess of 20 per cent, related such holdings to shares carrying voting rights whereas the definition used in this subsection uses the additional criterion, set out in the directive, of holding in excess of 20 per cent of the nominal share capital of another body corporate.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) (a) provides that information required by paragraphs (iii) and (iv) of subsection (1) on the capital and reserves and profit or loss of a subsidiary need not be given in the parent company's accounts if:</P>
    <P>(i)  the parent company is itself a subsidiary of another body corporate in the State, or</P>
    <P>(ii)  if the accounts of the subsidiary in question are already included in group accounts, or</P>
    <P>(iii)  the investment of the company in the shares of the subsidiary are included in the parent's accounts on the equity method basis of valuation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1586" /> The reasons for the exemptions are as follows in each of the cases listed:</P>
    <P>(i)  The information would be partial only.  It is the holdings of the ultimate parent at the top of the tree which we are interested in.</P>
    <P>(ii)  If the subsidiary is included in group accounts, its relevant capital and reserves and profit or loss will already be included in the picture given by the group accounts.</P>
    <P>(iii)  If the equity method of valuation is used, the information on capital and reserves and profit or loss is effectively included in the accounts prepared by the parent.</P>
    <P>The equity method of valuation is a method of accounting under which an investment in a company is shown in the investors' consolidated balance sheet as the cost of the investment, and the investing company or group's share of the post-acquisition retained profits and reserves of the company, less any amount written off, and under which the investing company accounts separately in its profit and loss account for its share of the profits before tax, and extraordinary items of the company concerned.</P>
    <P>The equity method is a recognised standard method of accounting.  It is defined in Statement of Standard Accounting Practice No. 14 (Group Accounts).  It can be used in respect of subsidiaries or associated companies. Article 61 of the directive refers to this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister has put the information on the record.  Article 61 of the directive sets out the position in member states in relation to the implication for the dominant groups mentioned in another article dealing with the total amount of finance, the numbers employed and turnover.  It includes a range of other matters.  I take it that this is looked after in this section and that the section therefore complies with the EC law.

      <P>The UK in 1981 in their measure to implement the directive, the Companies Act, 1981, Part II, section 9 and 10, deal with the exclusions, and section 10, particularly, deals with group exemptions.  I do not see any corresponding provision in our Bill to accommodate groups.  If a group of companies here did not have more than 50 employees or assets in excess of £2.5 million, is it not true to say that there is no provision to allow such a group to be treated as a small company, and is that not inconsistent with UK and EC law?  It should be clearly stated by the Minister if companies in the example I have given can avail of the exemptions applicable to the statement on consolidated groups of companies.</P>

      <P>That is very important. Article 43 deals with so many major items in so far as financial arrangements of companies are concerned that it is important that this be known.  It concerns salaries, pensions, numbers of employees, amounts owned by the company, the financial commitment of the company, the turnover of the company and the evaluation methods applied, the amounts of advances and credits granted to members.

      <P>I move amendment No. 17:</P>
      <P>In page 16, before section 17, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>17.&mdash;(1)  Where a private company is a subsidiary of another body corporate formed and registered in a Member State of the European Communities, or would be a subsidiary of that other body corporate if that other body corporate were a company, the company shall, as respects any particular financial year of the company, stand exempted from the provisions of section 7 (other than subsection (1) (b) of this Act if, but only if, the following conditions are fulfilled:</P>
      <P>(a)  every person who is a shareholder of the company on the date of the holding of the next annual general meeting of the company after the end of that financial year, shall declare his consent to the exemption.</P>
      <P>(b)  there is in force in respect of the whole of that financial year an irrevocable guarantee by the other body corporate of the liabilities of the company referred to in section 5 (c) of this Act in respect of that financial year and the company has notified in writing every person referred to in paragraph (a) of this subsection of the guarantee,</P>
      <P>(c)  the annual accounts of the company for that financial year are consolidated in the group accounts prepared by the body corporate and the exemption of the company under this section is disclosed in a note to the group accounts,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(d)  a notice stating that the company has availed of the exemption under this section in respect of that financial year and a copy of the guarantee and notification referred to in paragraph (b) of this subsection, together with a declaration by the company in writing that paragraph <Col N="1591" /> (a) of this subsection has been complied with in relation to the exemption, is annexed to the annual return for that financial year made by the company under the Principal Act to the registrar of companies,</P>
    <P>(e)  the group accounts of the other body corporate are drawn up as far as possible in accordance with the requirements of the Fourth Council Directive, and</P>
    <P>(f)  the group accounts of the other body corporate are annexed to the annual return aforesaid and are audited in accordance with Article 51.1 of the said Fourth Council Directive.</P>
    <P>(2)  The Minister may make such orders (if any) as may be necessary for the purpose of enabling this section to have full effect.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to secure a more definite procedure for the granting of exemptions to subsidiaries of EC parent companies while, at the same time, strengthening the terms under which such exemptions would be granted. In the first place it is proposed to amend the first paragraph of this section so as to remove the Minister from the role of final arbiter in this area.  Instead, a straightforward legislative arrangement is proposed whereby the exemption will become automatically available once the qualifying conditions set down in the section are complied with.  This approach will remove the concerns which Deputies have expressed regarding the Minister's involvement in deciding whether exemptions should be granted and the dangers of inconsistencies which might arise in the future in the granting of such exemptions.</P>
    <P>It is also, proposed in the first paragraph of this section to apply a minor qualification to the proposed exemption from section 7 of the Bill regarding the filing of accounts.  This, in effect, retains the impact of section 7 (1) (b) of the Bill so as to secure that, to the extent that accounts and documents are required to <Col N="1592" /> be provided in the Companies Registration Office under section 17 &mdash; that is group accounts, notification of guarantee, etc &mdash; such accounts and documents will have to be translated if necessary and be available in the Irish or English language.  This, as the House knows, is a standard provision of company law.</P>
    <P>With regard to the conditions which must be complied with in order to qualify for exemption, a series of revisions is proposed with the aim of achieving a more precise and more complete treatment of exempted cases.  A general feature of these revised considerations is the fact that compliance with them is being made a prerequisite to qualification for exemption.</P>
    <P>In paragraph (a) of this section it is proposed that consent to the exemption be declared by every person who is a shareholder in the exempted &mdash; that is the subsidiary &mdash; company at the date of the company's AGM.  This will achieve a desirable clarification regarding the nature of the consent required.</P>
    <P>In paragraph (b) of this section it is proposed to introduce, for the purpose of strengthening, the terms attaching to the guarantee required of the parent company.  The guarantee in question is now required to be irrevocable.  This prevents parent companies from backing out of their responsibilities after an exemption takes place.  In addition to this paragraph, it is required that every person who is a shareholder in the exempted company at the time of that company's AGM be notified in writing of the guarantee entered into by the parent company.</P>
    <P>A minor modification is proposed in paragraph (c) of this section in order to reflect the fact that the annual accounts of the company are consolidated in the group accounts prepared by the parent firm and the exemption of the company disclosed in a note to the group accounts. This has the effect of requiring compliance with the conditions of the provisions set down in section 17 as a prerequisite to exemption, rather than the formal, less satisfactory approach which was based on <Col N="1593" /> an acceptance of a commitment on the part of the company to meet the conditions.</P>
    <P>In paragraph (d) of this section a more comprehensive series of declarations is required to be lodged at the Companies Registration Office by companies availing of this section.  The declarations in question include: (a) a notice declaring that the company are availing of the exemption under section 17 in respect of the particular financial year concerned, (b) a copy of the guarantee entered into by the exempted company's parent company, (c) a copy of the notification issued by the parent company to the shareholders of the exempted company in relation to the guarantee, (d) a declaration by the exempted company that all their shareholders have consented to the exemption in accordance with paragraph (a) of section 17.</P>
    <P>It is considered that by means of these more specific and comprehensive measures both companies seeking exemption under section 17 and members of the public wishing to deal with such companies will have a much clearer appreciation of their respective positions in cases where section 17 exemptions are availed of.  In addition to the above measures it is proposed, in a new subsection (2) to this section, to permit the Minister to make such orders, if any, as may prove necessary for the purpose of enabling the section to have full effect.  The need for this provision arises, for example, because of the need for certain limited technical arrangements concerning the acquisition and disposal of subsidiary companies which may arise in the future.</P>

I take it that this section relates directly to article 57 of the directive and that the criteria set down in article 57 are being taken on board by way of this section and so far as exemption is concerned.

      <P>I am satisfied that if the criteria as set out in article 57 have been complied with, the claim for exemption should have been automatic and that the section should not seek to allow the Minister to say either yes or no.  I trust that his reworded amendment will make it possible for the company to claim the exemption without seeking the permission of the Minister.  That was a fundamental weakness in the original text.  I should like the Minister to comment on that and to tell us also whether it will be an annual exemption that will apply or whether an exemption once claimed, noted in the accounts and accepted, obviously in good faith, will stand until such time as it is deemed not to be required or will the company have to make an annual requisition for the purpose of claiming the exemption?  So far as the guarantees are concerned, I take it they are still in place in the new section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>We were concerned that a guarantee could have been put in place for a day and withdrawn subsequently but now the word &ldquo;irrevocable&rdquo; is included. However, I should like the Minister to tell us how he visualises the provision in this regard being put in place.  I had hoped that it might have been considered necessary to file the guarantee in the Companies Registration Office when the application of exemption was being stated in the accounts, in other words, that there would be some form of statutory declaration that there was in place a guarantee that would cover the liabilities and possible debts of subsidiaries and that they would have been guaranteed by the <Col N="1596" /> home based activist, in the EC or elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has raised a number of points.  We were trying to find a way of giving effect to the directive's thrust and one way was by way of ministerial surveillance, as it were.  On re-examination we considered that a statutory exemption without ministerial conformation would be more appropriate.  I should say, first, that all of the shareholders of a subsidiary company must agree to this exemption and must renew it at each annual meeting.  Secondly, there must be in effect an irrevocable guarantee for the financial period up to the following annual general meeting.  The word &ldquo;irrevocable&rdquo; is the operative word here.</P>
      <P>Paragraph (d) proposes that there be annexed to the annual return to the Registrar of Companies a notice stating that the exemption had been availed for the financial year in question.  In other words, the irrevocable guarantee must also be lodged with the Companies Registration Office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister would go a little further so far as the guaranteeing of the debts is concerned.  Has he anything in mind as to the kind of debts he thinks should be guaranteed?  It happens often that bank debts continue for years. These debts can be restructured also.  It might prove to be an impossible imposition to have the guarantee run to the full extent of the original debt when the debt was being reduced during a number of years.  Apart from the debts that have to be guaranteed, should the position arise that the company wished to withdraw from the guarantee there seems to be no provision in the Minister's amendment to ensure that one must be given the right to extricate oneself from a guarantee. The inclusion of the word &ldquo;irrevocable&rdquo; will make it impossible for the person who guaranteed the debt in the first place to extricate himself even if the guarantee is no longer necessary so far as the debt is concerned.  In what kind of formal manner may the debt be withdrawn?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1597" /> There is another element in so far as debts are concerned.  I presume that we are talking here of debts at the balance sheet date because a company could have future debts and those might have escalated from the debts at the date of the balance sheet.  What then would be the position?  Is there a mechanism by which the irrevocable guarantee might be expanded to take on board increased debt subsequent to the date of the balance sheet?  Obviously there would be the loophole that a balance sheet debt could be organised to be at the lowest figure possible but then suddenly would be shown to expand without there being any guarantee to cover it.  That is something we would want to be very careful about. I would also like to know the mechanism for the removal of the guarantee should the subsidiary be sold.  It might not then be necessary for the original home based entity to continue the guarantee.  It would be an additional burden and certainly they would not want it once a subsidiary was disposed of.  When a subsidiary is disposed of, does the guarantee die immediately?</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the liabilities covered by the irrevocable guarantee referred to by Deputy Flynn I refer him to the new section 17 (1) (b) which states quite clearly:</P>
      <P>there is in force in respect of the whole of that financial year an irrevocable guarantee by the other body corporate of the liabilities of the company referred to in section 5(c) on this Act...</P>
      <P>Section 5 (c), as amended, states quite clearly:</P>
      <P>all liabilities and losses which have arisen or are likely to arise in respect of the financial year to which the accounts relate, or a previous financial year, shall be taken into account, including those liabilities and losses which only become apparent between the balance sheet date and the date on which the accounts are signed in pursuance of section 156 of the Principal Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1598" /> The irrevocable guarantee will exist from the date of an annual general meeting until the next balance sheet date.  All the liabilities that have arisen or will arise will be encompassed in the irrevocable guarantee.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>If there is going to be a change away from the parent company by a subsidiary, the Minister may make an order to cover that.  As the guarantee is irrevocable, it would not mean that the guarantee can be lifted.  This can only come about in a situation where a company makes it clear to the subsidiary and its shareholders that it wishes to withdraw its guarantee.  Of course, the guarantee would be alive up to the balance sheet date at the annual general meeting.  It cannot be gotten out of up to that date.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>But it must be renewed the following year?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>In that case, is it not possible that the parent company would give the guarantee each year if the subsidiary was in good standing and in a prosperous position?  If they saw trouble looming in the subsidiary where they might have to implement such a guarantee, they might not renew the guarantee the following year because of possible liabilities occurring.  This would then mean that the subsidiary would have to publish accounts but it would also mean that the parent company would not have any liability for the debts of the subsidiary.  The parent company are in <Col N="1599" /> the ideal position of being able to continue to give the guarantee while things are going well but can stop giving the guarantee when things are going badly. They will have full access to financial information which will not be available to others, in particular the workforce in the subsidiary.  They can stop giving the guarantee at a time when they see trouble brewing.</P>
      <P>In other words, this portion of the section is exempting a very wide range of companies &mdash; all of which since 1960 will have received grant aid and a large number of pre-1960 companies will be subsidiaries of British companies who are here since the State was founded &mdash; from presenting accounts so long as the parent company give this guarantee and so long as the shareholders want to be exempt. Naturally all the shareholders would want to be exempt.  The point I am making is that surely there is no guarantee because the parent company will be the first to see trouble.  Therefore, they will not renew their guarantee.  At the very time you need the guarantee, it is gone and not there at all.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">

      <P>Yes.  It stands up at the time of the annual general meeting and for all the liabilities standing at that time the guarantee holds.  It is not a get out mechanism.  It holds for the liabilities at that annual general meeting irrespective of being raised on day two. All the liabilities due on day one are governed by the irrevocable guarantee. If there is a change, the guarantee would have been operative at the annual general meeting date.  All of the liabilities as outlined in section 5 (c) would be covered by that guarantee.  It does not lapse in the sense of lapsing.  It is an irrevocable guarantee at that date.  The liabilities in the balance sheet as at that annual general <Col N="1600" /> meeting and as described in section 5(c) are covered by the irrevocable guarantee.</P>

      <P>That is what I am trying to say.  A parent company could provide what they regard as an irrevocable guarantee but which might not be worth the paper it is written on.  Is there any mechanism whereby the Minister of State would consider some kind of instrument which would put the guarantee in place and have a financial cover commitment that can be seen?

I would have thought that it would be a suitable way to have the guarantee visible and also to be able to establish the extent of the guarantee.  There are bound to be ways out of this in so far as parent companies who know that the company is getting into difficulties extricate themselves from the guarantee.  Unless they are statutorily bound by an instrument of putting the <Col N="1601" /> guarantee in place it will not be satisfactory. It should be in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> until such time as it is withdrawn in the same manner.  In other words, people would then know that this guarantee is being withdrawn.  Under the Act if I have put the irrevocable guarantee in place I can seek the relief of the Minister from his own Bill to allow me to extricate myself from the guarantee.  He may deem it necessary to adjust the level of the guarantee or to relieve me entirely from it in special circumstances if I can point out that the accumulated liabilities and debts for the financial year are reduced or are non-existent.</P>

      <P>I am not encouraging the guarantors to come into this system. They may do so if they so wish for their own commercial reasons.  In regard to what the Deputy has said, the guarantee will be in the companies office and open to public scrutiny.  It will be an irrevocable guarantee covering the liabilities as outlined in section 5 (c).  It is an on-going guarantee that the company cannot get out of.  If the company wish to raise it, it does not mean that they are getting out from under.  The guarantee will have been operable as at the date of the annual <Col N="1602" /> general meeting and the accounts will be considered at that annual general meeting. If the companies wish to have their accounts published and the guarantee raised they may do so but they will have to cover the liabilities up to and as at the date of the annual general meeting and the published annual accounts.  It is quite a stringent method.</P>
      <P>In subsection (2) we have taken powers that we may make orders, as necessary, for the purpose of enabling the section to have full effect.  If it comes to our notice that something is amiss we can make an order specifying different types of guarantees if necessary.  We do not feel the need to do so at present.  The parent company can take upon itself to give an irrevocable guarantee in respect of a subsidiary company in Ireland, assuming it is an EC-based company.  It is an irrevocable guarantee.  It will be there at the time of the annual general meeting.  If the companies wish to change it they will still be liable for the liabilities as at the annual general meeting specified at which the accounts and the balance sheet are presented.  There is no getting out from under this section.  It is not intended.  We have added subsection (2) to enable the Minister to take action if he feels there is need to strengthen the position in respect of any company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">

      <P>It is to strengthen the hand of the Minister in relation to any of the guarantees in existence.  It is to ensure that he can make whatever orders are necessary to underpin or make certain that the guarantees are effective and that no Irish company is put out on a limb because of any bogeyman operating a guarantee.  We will not allow that.</P>

      <P>The Fourth Directive applies only to the individual accounts <Col N="1603" /> and not to group accounts.  I take it that we are awaiting the Seventh Directive before we get into that guarantee.  Let us be clear about it.  The guarantee will not apply to the groups that have the exemption under the old Principal Act because they are not covered by this directive. The guarantees will be applicable only to individual accounts.  Is that right?</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister went further than the directive in so far as the guarantee is concerned.  He must be getting very worried that the guarantees will not be honoured.  That is the reason for the inclusion of the irrevocable wording.  The directive stated that the guarantee should only go to the commitments entered into by the dependent company.  The Minister is going a good bit further than that.  I would not be surprised if some of the parent companies were not somewhat taken aback by the viciousness of the words.  The Minister went further than he had intended in the original text.</P>

      <P>If we are going to have this system where an Irish company is operating and creditors are dealing freely in the context of knowing that what they are doing is guaranteed to be paid then we have to make the guarantee effective. The only way we can do that is to make it irrevocable.  It is not necessarily a vehicle that I am looking towards.  It is allowed <Col N="1604" /> by the directive and I am allowing EC parent companies to avail of it if they feel it will be of some advantage to them.  This will be only on condition that they will guarantee the liability of the company in Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>This section probably affects this country more than most other countries.  From the establishment of the State a considerable number of those companies existing here were just branches of British companies.  By adding the words &ldquo;Ireland Limited&rdquo; they established themselves as subsidiaries of British companies.  Apart from the excellent semi-State companies established in the period 1920 to 1940, the main industrial development was from the subsidiaries of British companies.  Even companies that were based here at the time proceeded to locate their parent company in Britain. The parent company of Guinness was in Dublin but in the thirties it was moved to London and the Dublin operation became a subsidiary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From 1960 onwards the IDA offered inducements and incentives to foreign companies to locate here and there was a huge increase in subsidiary companies of the multinationals.  In proportion to <Col N="1605" /> the total number of companies in the country we have a very high number of EC subsidiary companies and by exempting them we will be affected to a greater extent than any other EC country.  Estimates of the numbers employed in these companies vary between 30,000 and 40,000.  The estimate given by the ICTU was of 450 such companies established from 1960 to 1980 but that did not include the companies established before 1960. The ITGWU considered this matter and they came to the conclusion that the number of jobs in companies of EC member states from 1960 to date was 36,500 or 45 per cent of the total foreign companies here.  They estimated that there were at least 6,000 people in jobs of other subsidiary companies before 1960, making a total of 42,000.  Many of these workers are employed in the bigger and the more profitable companies and the businesses concerned will be exempt from disclosing any financial information. Our experience has been that many such companies have closed down overnight on a direction from the parent company, whether in Europe, Britain or the United States.  Information is not available here regarding the progress of such subsidiary companies.</P>
    <P>The exemption is very surprising in view of the large profits of the subsidiaries that are exported.  Neither the Government nor the Central Bank are able to give specific figures of the profits.  They can give a total figure of the amount going out of the country but they cannot say how much relates to the profits of specific companies.  That information is not available to the Government or to the workforce.</P>
    <P>I understand that the specific exemption here is temporary pending implementation of the Seventh Directive.  If it is a temporary exemption and if it will be so regarded in the EC directive, why is it not stated in the Bill?  If the Seventh Directive is passed, will the Minister come back to us to have this section deleted?  Perhaps the Minister will elaborate on this point.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>We are putting in this <Col N="1606" /> exemption.  My understanding is that it is mentioned in the Council directive dealing with consolidated accounts, namely, the Seventh Directive which will be in operation until 1995.  There is no need to mention whether it is temporary or permanent.  The section will stay in force until it is amended.  When the matter is discussed in 1995 or thereafter it will be reconsidered in the light of the Seventh Directive.</P>
      <P>I am not quite sure if the Deputy is for or against section 17.  From the point of view of a person trading with a company concerning which there is a continuing guarantee on its liabilities, if I were a trader I would be very happy to trade with a company that had an irrevocable guarantee covering its liabilities.  Exemption will be allowed under article 57 under very straightforward conditions and we are availing of that article.  This will be welcomed by companies abroad who wish to have their Irish operations kept private but the concomitant necessity would arise that their liabilities as outlined in section 5 (c) would have to be fully covered by an irrevocable guarantee.  I feel that the section will not be widely used because it is a fairly stringent section.  Nevertheless, I feel that traders would probably be happy dealing with such companies.</P>

      <P>Section 19 deals with situations where a company publishes its full accounts whether by filing these accounts with the Companies Registration Office or otherwise.  The term &ldquo;published&rdquo; is defined in subsection (4) of this section as covering a wide variety of means by which public attention may be drawn to the accounts.  The term &ldquo;full accounts&rdquo; is also defined in subsection (4) of this section and embraces accounts prepared under section 3 of the Bill, that is, those which meet the full disclosure requirements in the Bill and those under sections 10 and 12, that is, the modified accounts permitted for small and medium sized companies.  Where publication of full accounts takes place it is required that they be accompanied by any report of the auditors prepared under subsection (3) of section 18 in relation to those accounts, that is, the auditors' commentary on the entitlement of the company to prepare the modified small and medium sized company accounts and the correctness thereof, and the normal true and fair view report under section 163 of the 1963 Act. However, where the auditors of the company have refused to provide a directive <Col N="1608" /> with a statement confirming their entitlement to prepare the modified accounts the fact of such refusal shall be indicated. The purpose of this provision is to alert the public to the true status of accounts published by the company.  It is to make doubly sure that we know what we are talking about.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>That is subsection (2). This deals with the publication of abbreviated accounts by a company.  The term &ldquo;abbreviated accounts&rdquo;, defined in subsection (4) of the section, embraces summary accounts, extracts from the full accounts and so on.  Where publication of such abbreviated information takes place it is necessary to alert the public as to the exact status of the information provided and for this reason such abbreviated publications are required to be accompanied by a statement indicating the following: (a) that the accounts published are not those which are required to be annexed to the annual return and lodged with the company's registration office; (b) where the accounts are required to be filed in the company's registration office have in fact been filed; (c) whether the auditors have made a report on the account of the company under section 163 of the Companies Act, 1963 in respect of the financial year with which the abbreviated accounts were to deal; (d) whether the report of the auditor under section 163 of the Companies Act, 1963 contained any qualifications as to the matters mentioned in the Seventh Schedule of that Act, that is, (1) where the auditors had access to that information necessary to allow them to conduct the audit; (2) where the auditors were satisfied that proper books of account were maintained by the company; (3) whether the company's balance sheet and profit and loss account are in agreement with the company's books of account and, (4) whether the auditors are satisfied that <Col N="1609" /> the company's accounts provide the requisite information and give a true and fair view of the company's position.

      <P>It has nothing to do with that.  If one goes back to the central thrust of this Bill section 6 dominates section 5.  In other words, section 5 is subject to section 6.  The concept of accounting principles and fair and true view of the company is the dominant theme.  This is not quite relevant.  But where the directors wish to depart from those principles they must give their reasons and the effects on the balance sheet and profit and loss accounts and they must be stated in relation to the accounts for the financial year concerned. That is a different issue altogether and that is clearly the responsibility of the directors of the company who go that route.

      <P>The purpose of this provision is to substitute the requirements of this Bill relating to accounts and audit for those contained in the Companies Act, 1963, and referred to in section 377 of the 1963 Act and the Ninth Schedule thereto.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 377 of the Companies Act, 1963, deals with certain trading organisations which would not normally come <Col N="1611" /> within the scope of that Act and applies to such bodies certain provisions of the 1963 Act set out in the Ninth Schedule. These organisations are referred to as unregistered companies and include companies incorporated by special Act of Parliament, companies incorporated by Royal Charter and companies incorporated by Letters Patent.  Specifically excluded from section 377 are bodies corporate incorporated by or registered under any public general statute, and this would exclude bodies such as building societies and industrial and provident societies and State enterprises set up under public general statute.</P>
    <P>Section 377 also excludes any bodies corporate not formed for acquisition of gain, or which are prevented from distributing their income or property among their members.  Effectively, therefore, unregistered companies are trading organisations not set up under the Companies Act or other general Acts of Parliament but in respect of whom it was felt that some of the more important safeguard provisions of the Companies Act should apply.  The chief example of such companies are the Bank of Ireland and Dublin Gas Company Limited.  Many of the other unregistered bodies are either defunct or not trading, so that the application of section 377 is limited.</P>

The fair and just thing would have been to label one or two, or some particular officers and have them responsible, but in this legislation we are naming the company and every officer of the company.  The Minister will have to decide precisely what he means by &ldquo;an officer of a company&rdquo;. If this term is included in the 1963 Act and applies to specific named personages, then I will reconsider the matter.

      <P>This amendment proposes that offences and penalties shall not apply in the case of officers of the company, that is, directors and secretary. I cannot accept this proposal.  It is standard practice throughout the Companies Acts to apply offences and penalties to &ldquo;officers in default&rdquo; and indeed section 383 of the 1963 Act actually defines the term &ldquo;officer in default&rdquo;.  If there are worries about persons being proceeded against unfairly, there are <Col N="1613" /> defences provided in section 22 (2) (a) and (b) of the Bill and in section 383 of the 1963 Act.  Basically a person must be knowingly, wilfully or recklessly in default.</P>
      <P>Deputy Flynn, Deputy Mac Giolla and Deputies on all sides of the House are concerned about cowboy companies, about companies folding up and not paying their debts, but we have to face the fact that they are officers in a company and they are in responsible positions. These officers include a secretary and directors of a company.  If we are to have an effective system of company law administration, we will have to accept the need for responsibility being assumed by officers of companies.  Otherwise the regime will have no meaning and we will continue to have defaulting companies and people knowingly, wilfully or recklessly being in default of their statutory duties.  I cannot condone that decision. What we are doing in this Bill is trying to ensure that officers of a company&mdash;the secretary and directors&mdash;will realise they have responsibilities under this legislation and if they are wilfully in default, there will be a penalty to pay.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>In the Principal Act of 1963 &ldquo;officer&rdquo; is defined as follows: &ldquo;officer in relation to a body corporate includes a director or secretary&rdquo;.  I would be happy to know that if a director or a secretary was culpable in these matters he would stand liable, but I am afraid that is not exactly what the Minister has done here. His wording is &ldquo;and every officer of the company&rdquo;.  I take it that would include others beyond a named director or a named secretary of the company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister had made the penalty clause here applicable in the same way as it is applied in the Principal Act it would have been very easy to take it on board and I would think it reasonable.  The Minister made reference to fraudulent directors. Let me be clear on my behalf and that of the party I represent that we have been awaiting far too long the introduction of legislation on the question of insolvency and fraudulent trading and fraudulent <Col N="1614" /> directors.  In blunt language I want them run out of town.  There is no room in my prospectus for them or for that kind of operation.  I see it as domestic insolvency legislation long overdue, long promised and I wish that the Minister would bring it in.</P>
    <P>We are not talking about fraudulent directors here.  We are talking about a director's liability in the formulation, production and presentation of accounts. I would have preferred if the Minister had incorporated the liability attached to the individuals culpable in the matter of false information as being officers to mean a director or the secretary of the company.  I would think it very harsh for individuals who might be downstream of that level of activity in the company to find themselves jointly and severally made liable in the event of litigation for falsification of accounts.  Would the Minister not consider that the wording as it is there encompasses more than was intended in the Principal Act?</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>

      <P>You may.  I am anxious to ensure that officers of companies know that they are liable for non administration and their own irresponsible actions.  It is time that directors and officers of companies were aware of their responsibilities and I am not going to let them get out from under this or any other legislation.  I am surprised that there is opposition to the wording.  I do not believe it is deviating much from the 1963 Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is.  The word &ldquo;every&rdquo; is <Col N="1615" /> deviating considerably from it.  Let me ask the Minister of State a question.  Is an auditor not an officer of the company? Is the auditor who takes the director's report and accounts and signs his name to them and gives them a certificate deemed to be liable if it is found out subsequently that there is falsification of the record?  The auditor should stand much more liable than the clerical officer who might be deemed as the person to deliver the accounts to the filing officer in the Companies Registration Office. The Minister has gone too far with the words &ldquo;every officer&rdquo;.  Why not just leave it &ldquo;the company&rdquo;?  Why not put in just &ldquo;the directors and the secretary of the company&rdquo;?  Why beat about the bush with this antiquated terminology of &ldquo;officer&rdquo; and &ldquo;every officer&rdquo;?</P>
      <P>The Minister has not really satisfied me on that.  He has been very accommodating in some aspects of this.  Section 383 of the Principal Act states: ...officer who is in default...&rdquo; and I am prepared to accept that, and an officer in default means the secretary of the company in all practical terms.  Every officer could mean the accountant in the company, the financial controller or a whole range of people who might be suddenly brought before a court.  I do not think their reputation could stand up to that.  The directors might, after they had finished their business, falsify the matter and in the end the auditor must come along and give his certificate.  Is he an officer, and does he stand indicated if things do go wrong?  Will the Minister reconsider between now and Report Stage that the terminology might be too expansive there?</P>

      <P>I do not believe I have deviated primarily from the Companies Act, 1963.  Let me quote two subsections of that Act and if the Deputy wishes to follow me he will see what I mean. Section 128 (3) of that Act provides:</P>

    <P>If a company fails to comply with this section, the company and every officer of the company who is in default shall be liable to a fine not exceeding £100.</P>

      <P>Section 22 (2) commences: &ldquo;If any person, being a director of a company, fails to take all reasonable steps ...&rdquo; Directors are singled out there.  Can situations arise where directors, often sleeping directors, might not be fully cognisant of what is happening on a day to day basis in the presentation of accounts?  When these accounts are <Col N="1617" /> put before them at annual general meetings, or whatever, it is often on a nod and wink basis, as the Minister knows, from the chairman and the secretary in whom they have faith and who are carrying out the business on their behalf. The section refers to &ldquo;all reasonable steps...&rdquo;.  What would the Minister regard as reasonable steps?  Would it be being present at the AGM or seeking clarification through the auditor?</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 22 (2) provides:</P>
      <P>(a) in any proceedings against a person in respect of an offence under this subsection, it shall be a defence to prove that he had reasonable grounds to believe and did believe that a competent and reliable person was charged with the duty of ensuring that the provisions of the said section 3 or section 4 (other than subsections (3) and (13)), as may be appropriate, were complied with and that the latter person was in a position to discharge that duty, and</P>
      <P>(b) a person shall not be liable to be sentenced to imprisonment for such an offence unless, in the opinion of the court, the offence was committed wilfully.</P>

      <P Just="Center">NEW SECTION.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 22:</P>
      <P>In page 20, before section 23, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;23.&mdash; Section 222 of the Principal Act shall not apply to proceedings before the Employment Appeals Tribunal.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1618" /> Section 222 of the Companies Act, 1963, provides that when a company is wound up or a provisional liquidator has been appointed no action or proceeding can be taken against the company without the consent of the High Court. The reason for this provision is to allow the winding up of the company to proceed in an orderly manner.  It has been represented to me that section 222, however, has an untoward effect on the operation of the Employment Appeals Tribunal, where a company is or becomes insolvent. In such a case a person seeking redress at the tribunal can be required to seek the consent of the High Court to allow the proceedings to go ahead, and this has happened in several instances. Furthermore, in the case of former employees of insolvent companies, such employees have to obtain awards from the tribunal in order to apply for payments from the employers' insolvency fund.</P>
    <P>Section 222 was not intended to place obstacles in the way of the operation of employee legislation which, in fact, it pre-dated.  The proposed amendment will remedy the situation by removing the requirement to seek the consent of the court.  I do not think that, in practice, this will affect liquidations adversely since I am informed that the High Court is disposed to give its consent in such cases as come before it.  We are trying to make things clearer and easier and not to have unnecessary recourse to the High Court in relation to appeals under the Employment Appeals Tribunal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister saved three votes to date by having been generous following the Second Reading of the Bill which was a good way of dealing with it. I was conscious of what I was doing at the time of seeking amendments for different reasons and the Minister and the Minister of State did the right thing by amending sections rather than refusing to take amendments from me later on.  The idea is to put in a marker on the Second Reading which, if worthy, the Minister will include as his own amendment which is the right way of doing it.  However, the Minister was not prepared to relent on <Col N="1620" /> section 23.  I see no reason for this section because it gives the Minister all embracing powers to alter any section of the legislation at will without recourse to anybody. I do not think the Minister is entitled to that power and he has not given any good reason for requiring such power.  I would be very reluctant to give it to him for the reasons stated here over the past few hours.</P>
      <P>The Ministers, Deputy Bruton and Deputy Collins, are quite amenable to taking the full options available under the Fourth Directive on board with a view to helping Irish business but, as far as I am concerned, that directive is very damaging to Irish business even in the easiest form available to us under its options. It will have a very inhibiting effect on investment enticement into the economy and could, in effect, lead to disruption of business and lost job opportunities. However, I am satisfied that the heart of the Minister of State is in the right place, but if Deputy Tomás Mac Giolla should ever become Minister, I would not be satisfied that his heart would be in the right place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said Deputy Mac Giolla's attitude was an instrument of damage to Irish industry.  That is a pretty harsh remark about poor old Deputy Mac Giolla but I am quite satisfied that if Deputy Mac Giolla had his way he would have turned this legislation upside down and committed a foul against industry which would have left thousands unemployed. Because that situation exists a Minister, to satisfy his ideological requirements at a later date, might use this catch all section which allows him to alter the provisions of the Act, every single aspect of it in so far as it relates to the formats of the balance sheet and the profit and loss account, notes to the accounts and all the disclosure of information that we have been trying so painstakingly to cloud today by making it possible for individuals in industry to survive in the competitive area without disclosing to all and sundry their research and development programmes, their financial dealings and their development arrangements for the future.  We tried to <Col N="1621" /> minimise the effect of those sections on Irish industry.  I am satisfied that if people of another ideology were in charge of the country they would immediately use the powers in the section to alter all those provisions.  In that event all the good work of Minister Collins would be set at nought.  Certainly, Deputy Flynn's attitude would be thrown head over heels out the door.  I do not think that would be in the best interests of the Irish economy.</P>
    <P>I do not know why the Minister seeks this all-sweeping power.  What does he want it for?  Why is he not prepared to come back to the legislature to make changes that would affect the lives of all people working for the 76,000 companies registered here?  It is not simply a matter of a few alterations in a minor piece of legislation.  Anything done under this legislation affects the lives of everybody working here, the economy and the investment climate and conditions we are trying to create to entice new jobs.  If the Minister takes on this he can, at the stroke of a pen, change the whole thrust of the legislation.  That is not acceptable to me.  If the Minister wishes to alter the fundamentals of the legislation he should be required to come back to Dáil Éireann and Members should be given an opportunity to discuss them.</P>
    <P>I thought the Minister would have taken on board the restriction contained in section 8 (12), He was prepared to adopt a different method of changing it in that section but section 23 gives him the catch-all to alter everything.  It is not possible for me in that event to allow the section to stand.  Any Minister can change the whole thing at will.  Does the Minister envisage additional disclosure requirements being required especially in the case of small companies as defined in the Bill?  Is it his intention, or the intention of anybody else, to use this escape clause at a later date to alter the legislation? The powers in the section are superfluous, are too wide ranging and need to be altered.  The only way I can alter them is to oppose the section and put the Minister on notice that he is not acting in the best interests of the economy and industrial concerns here.</P>

      <P>I agree with Deputy Flynn.  Certainly, were I the Minister in charge I would love to have a section like this in an Act.  However, I think Deputy Flynn is over worried because I am sure that the Minister, having the same ideological views as Deputy Flynn, wishes to have these powers for the reverse reasons.  He does not wish to have them to make things harder for companies but, in the case of companies that may be having some problems, he wants power under the section to release them from their burdens and relax things for them. I am sure he wants to make it much easier for such companies to find their way through the problems that may arise because of the provisions in the Bill.  That is the purpose of the ministerial order and I an sure Deputy Flynn recognises that.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Flynn that it is unusual to have a section concerning a ministerial order in a Bill without a subsection, similar to subsection (12) of section 8, to the effect that an order should be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after it is made.  It is normal in the case of ministerial orders to have such a subsection. Such a provision should be included in the section under discussion so that the Minister will have to bring such orders before the Houses of the Oireachtas to have them approved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies are assuming that the Minister is taking on to himself powers to change the provision at the stroke of a pen but that is not so.  Any order made under any section of the Bill must comply with the Principal Act of 1963.  Section 396 of that Act states that <Col N="1623" /> every order made under that Act shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after it is made and if a resolution annulling the order is passed by either House within the next 21 days on which that House has sat after the order is laid before it the order shall be annulled accordingly but without prejudice to the validity of anything previously done thereunder.  If Deputies feel that for clarity sake a subsection should be added and if this would relieve their worries I would be happy to add it.  However, I must point out that as the 1963 Act is the Principal Act it follows that all orders made must follow the procedure laid down in the 1963 Act and must be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I would regard that as a matter of argument.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a matter of argument but a matter of law.  On Report Stage I am prepared to add a subsection repeating what is necessary under the 1963 Act and which will mean that every order will have to be brought before the House for confirmation.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this provision is to retain for the Minister the power to introduce such modifications to the format and contents of the accounts required under the Bill as may prove necessary in the light of experience gained in the operation of the Bill's requirements or as a result of development in accounting practice.</P>
      <P>In addition, it may prove necessary at some later stage to prescribe special formats of accounts for particular classes of company.  This is envisaged in the directive in article 2 where members states may require specially adapted formats in the case of companies in a particular economic sector, and in article 5, in the case of investment companies or financial holding companies as defined in that article.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may further be necessary to amend the provisions in relation to current cost accounting in the Schedule to the Bill, either as a result of the review of the <Col N="1624" /> relevant accounting standard, SSAP 16, at present being undertaken by the accountancy bodies, or as a result of a review of the provisions in the directive concerning current cost accounting.  Article 33.5 of the directive provides for such a review.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the directive, on which much of the Bill is based, provides in article 52 for a contact committee to meet regularly to discuss practical problems arising in implementing the accounting concepts and terms in the directive, and to propose amendments, if necessary. Such amendments, which might be of an arcane and highly technical nature, hardly justify a special Act of Parliament and should be dealt with by ministerial order.  That is the primary reason why this method is used.  It is not intended that the Minister will make an order setting the Act aside.  That is not legally possible because we are bound by the Principal Act of 1963.  However, if it satisfies Deputies I will be happy to bring in a new subsection (2) which will be similar to section 396 (1) of the Companies Act, 1963 which provides that all orders be brought before both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>

I am pleased to note that he accepts there is some validity in that it may very well be a cause of argument if it is not included.  I take his point from article 52 of the directive that the Commission may at any time decide to alter their attitude to any particular provision. I would invite the Minister also to rush to them immediately in the hope that they would alter their attitude on thresholds for exemptions and also on the thresholds in so far as the turnover of <Col N="1625" /> assets and numbers is concerned &mdash; whatever about the numbers, certainly in so far as the turnover is concerned.

      <P>I want to get as far distant as I can from Deputy Mac Giolla's attitude in his attempt to corral everybody from the newsagent's shop to the sweet-shop to the Smurfit organisation under the one umbrella and disclose everything. I know well that it is at present working against the interests of Irish industry in that all the legal eagles in this city are over-worked devising ways and means to get out from under the provisions of some of these all-catching sections which would render life virtually impossible for investment growth and job creation.</P>
      <P>I am pleased the Minister has indicated that he will reconsider the position and that he will go as far as inserting a subsection under the terms laid down in section 396 of the Principal Act under which orders would have to be laid before the Oireachtas, and powers to revoke or amend orders would also have to be laid before the Houses and could be considered within the stipulated period of 21 days.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 25:</P>
      <P>In page 20, subsection (4), lines 39 to 43, to delete &ldquo;on such day or days as, by order or orders made by the Minister under this section, may be fixed therefor either generally or with reference to any particular purpose or provision and different days may be so fixed for different purposes and different provisions&rdquo;, and substitute &ldquo;for accounting period commencing on or after the 1st of January, 1987&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I should like the section to be amended so that we could talk about the implementation date.  This is critical in so far as the whole operation of this Bill is concerned. I am anxious that a certain period of time should be allowed to businesses before it becomes legally binding on them to implement all of the provisions of this Bill.</P>
      <P>While I raised the matter on Second Stage and felt that the Minister, Deputy J. Bruton, was going down the road with me, subsequently I am not so sure he intends going as far as is necessary in the interests of business, particularly in the interests of the accountancy firms who must deal with the new arrangements. Business itself is under some pressure.  It should be remembered that there is a certain element of expense involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1627" /> While it might not affect large companies to any great degree, in that they have the expertise, experience and computerisation in place, that would not be the case in so far as small companies are concerned.</P>
    <P>It should be remembered also that there are changed formats, new means of calculating assets, new situations for accounting.  All of this means that companies are seeking considerable advice from their auditors and accountants as to how they will comply with these provisions. If one is to believe the Minister, it would appear he will be rather rigid in the implementation of the provisions of this Bill, that he is making arrangements with the Companies Registration Office to gear up to giving effect to this legislation. If that is the case, then what was in the past a kind of <i>laissez-faire</i> attitude towards the filing of accounts will not henceforth obtain.  The attitude to date has been: who would check up on them anyway?  That is the position that obtains in the Companies Registration Office at present&mdash;it does not matter a whit whether one has accounts filed or not.  If the Minister is to be taken at face value then there will be some slight change of attitude in so far as the filing of accounts is concerned and companies need time to effect this transition.</P>
    <P>In the directive itself it was recommended that some 18 months might be available for that purpose, that is, in article 55.  Indeed, it could have been extended to eight years for certain types of companies.  I know the Minister will say that the 18 months should have applied from the date of implementation as decided on by the Commission and that 18 months have long gone past.  That is beside the point.  We must seek the derogation that will be available to us.  I understand from contacts in Brussels that, if the Minister were to seek this derogation and apply article 55 in its widest possible interpretation, more than likely he would get a good hearing.  It takes some time to implement these measures and, while the implementation date is past as regards the 18 months to <Col N="1628" /> which the directive applies, the Minister should be generous in this regard.</P>
    <P>Eighteen months would allow companies time to change their status.  While that might appear to be an escape route for companies who wanted to get unlimited status, have themselves broken up, or incorporate in some other way&mdash; which would not require their implementing the provisions of this legislation at all&mdash;companies who wish to take that route should be given sufficient time. Many of the high-tech companies, particularly in chemicals and pharmaceuticals, are very anxious to take on the branch option.  I know very well that the Minister's advisers know what is going on in this city at present in so far as the option under section 354 of the Principal Act is concerned.  They are taking on that option.  Others will be finding the means which allow them to take other options. In fairness the Minister must give them time to do that.</P>
    <P>I am asking that the implementation date should be no sooner than 1 January 1988.  I say that for a very good reason. We understand from section 4 that comparative information has to be provided, that it is not merely a question of the first set of accounts.  One has to gear up and get the first set of accounts in position this year.  Then, next year, one can use the 1986 set for comparative purposes. With the two years' accounts in place companies would be able to claim any exemptions available under the provisions of the Act.  They would have some experience of dealing with the accounts, would have complied with the two year period necessary to avail of the exemptions and would be in a position to take on board the requirements of the legislation.  It will be expensive.  There are new disclosures, new formats to be considered and business will need time for this purpose.  It will be expensive and time-consuming on the business community. There are many pressures on businesses and we must recognise that.  it would be unnecessary and unfair of us here in the comfort of the Chamber of Dáil Éireann to say that we will implement this and that companies will have <Col N="1629" /> adapted their accounts to the new legislation by 1 January next.  That is not a realistic start, and unless the Minister is prepared to do away with comparisons he will have to get a derogation from the Fourth Directive to allow him to postpone the implementation of the Bill until 1 January 1988.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy suggested that if I were to speak to some person in a big building in Brussels I might get a favourable ear.  It is news to me that that could happen.  I would remind the House that we are before the European Court of Justice for failing to implement this directive.  The Deputy and I must have been speaking to different people in different offices in Brussels if he thinks we would be allowed to postpone implementation of the Bill until 1988, because our case is due to be heard next June and the court may direct us to implement the directives by a certain date, sooner rather than later.</P>
      <P>I understand the difficulty which some firms are facing in relation to adaptation to the new accounting régime, but the date of operation is normally written into legislation.  I cannot give the undertaking requested to delay operation of the Bill until January 1988.  That would show us to be in bad faith with Europe, but what is more important is that we will be under a direction from the Court of Justice to implement the Bill before then.</P>
      <P>It was stated that the Bill could be brought into operation by next summer. By the time it has passed through this House and the Seanad and is signed by the President I would imagine it will be summer and I can see no justification for delaying its implementation longer.  I will consider the period after the passage of the Bill, but this directive should have been implemented and translated into our national law long ago.  Therefore, I am not in a position to delay its implementation and I cannot accede to the Deputy's request.  I will allow what I consider to be a reasonable interval for companies and their auditors and accountants to understand the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>If I could convince the Minister that the notion he is propounding could cause jobs to be lost and some company closures, would that convince him that there is a need for a longer gestation period?  Being before the European Court of Justice is a different matter from the actual putting in place of this legislation.  I appreciate that we were tardy about introducing national legislation in this respect, but we are in the process of doing so and I do not think the court would be offended if we took a few extra months to bring it to completion.  I could not see any difficulty about getting an adjournment of the case in view of the fact that the Legislature is dealing with the matter.</P>
      <P>If we implement the Bill before January 1988 the Minister will be applying retrospective legislation.  In 1986, if a company had made its arrangements in accordance with their normal accounting practice and if these are not in accordance with the principles of the legislation next year, they would have to adapt to a new set of formulae and make retrospective changes in the accounts they had finalised for this year.  Auditors and accountants would have to revamp all this year's accounts and restructure the accounts unnecessarily.  A company would have to say to its accountants that they would be starting a new system in January 1987 in order to comply with the new regulations and they would find it enormously difficult. I do not think the House should willingly give the authority to the Minister to adopt such an attitude because of the hardship it could cause many small companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not talking now about the unregistered companies and those with royal mandates and special Acts of Parliament setting them up which, in effect, can look over their shoulders to the legislation to provide whatever money is required if all fails in the end.  I am talking now about the 67,000 companies approximately which are involved in a small way.  If these companies have a very small staff and poor equipment there is a certain element of training to be undertaken by the staff to accustom them to the new <Col N="1631" /> formats and the new demands.  It is most unreasonable not to allow at least one dry year before the full thrust of the legislation bears down on them.  It is not too much to ask that the remainder of this year would be available to companies to gear up and have a dry run at the new formula.  Otherwise, it is being made more difficult for the registrar of the Companies Registration Office to deal effectively with the legislation.  He is not yet ready.  His operation, according to recent reports, is only beginning to become computerised.  If the figures for the United Kingdom are anything to go on, half of the companies are not filing their accounts anyway.</P>
    <P>We must not get into mistakes, and it is being made very difficult for small companies to avoid mistakes.  One can imagine the paraphernalia, the correspondence between the registrar and the accounting officers of some of those companies because of the mistakes which will be made, the grey areas on which they will want advice, the specialist advice they will need on their specialist products and of the differentiation between their turnover and the analysis by way of market and geography.  This is an enormous change from the accustomed practice and the Minister recognises that.  This is the biggest piece of legislation in the way of company law which has been introduced since 1963.  In fact, it goes much further back, to the very first limited liability status legislation in the 1890s.  For that reason, and because of the impact which it will have and the expense involved, I am trying to impress on the Minister not to let his actions account for one job loss.  I do not want the Minister, when he is in Opposition over here berating me over there&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I do not want the outcome to be that we shall be at loggerheads over this legislation.  Why not give extra time? There is confusion in the registrar's office.  Some people will have great difficulty and, finally, we shall have some liquidations, companies going to the wall, jobs lost and mothers crying.  I interpret what the Minister is saying with regard to the implementation date as being 1 January 1987.  By the time the legislation goes to the Seanad a couple of months will have passed, the President will then sign it and there will be orders to be made under section 8(12) and, no doubt, under section 23 when the Minister thinks about it and we shall end up with a whole new formula.  People are entitled at least to time so that the legislation can settle in properly without any confusion.  It has caused enough difficulty to businesses as it is.  The difficulties in the business world are obviated by certain changes of attitude which have been undertaken, all quite legally.  The big guns, the EC, parent companies, subsidiaries, conglomerates and unregistered companies, have no difficulty in accommodating the Minister immediately.  They have the equipment and personnel to do this.  The only type of company which can be hurt by the absence of a gestation period of at least 18 months from the beginning of June next are the small companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This legislation was foisted on our people by the EC.  We would never in our wildest dreams introduce legislation, the portent of which would be the implementation of the matters to which the Minister has been referring.  It is unnecessary to require that kind of disclosure. It is not in the best interests of employer or employee.  If that is the position, why do we not take the full extent of time which should be given to our companies to accustom and acclimatise themselves to the new provisions?  That is the basic argument.  We would not have been arguing for the last number of <Col N="1633" /> months but for the fact that we had no alternative to bringing in this legislation. A corollary of that must be that we should take the best chance possible to make it as easy and as inexpensive as we can for our companies to implement that legislation. I am earnestly asking the Minister to change his attitude.  I feel that it will not be easy to convince him, but in the interest of small companies I am asking him to put aside any possibility of loss of jobs or of business, to relent in this matter, allowing 1 January 1988 as implementation date.</P>

      <P>I am sorry that I cannot accede to that request.  This directive should have been translated into national law in 1980 and should have been made effective by 1981.  We are now in 1986. We are now before the European Court of Justice.  We cannot delay further.  This directive has been translated into national law in the vast majority of the other member states of the Community. It is not possible to give the undertaking requested by the Deputy. The gloom and doom which the Deputy has spelled out for companies is not a reality.  The directive has been in the hands of professional accountants for six years and the accountancy profession have been producing glossy books explaining the implementation of the Bill.  There have been seminars and information has been given.</P>

Companies have been made aware of the requirements of the directive and the contents of the Bill. No grave problems will be caused to companies. The Bill, when it becomes law will not be retrospective or cause a great regurgitation, reassimiliation or resynthesis of accounts.  At most, all that will be necessary will be comparative figures, <Col N="1634" /> which will not be difficult for small, medium sized or large companies.</P>

      <P>When we adjourned last evening I had just received the script that had been circulated by the Minister for Energy.  Since then I have had an opportunity to study that script and I am extremely disappointed with its contents. There are several examples that can be taken from it to illustrate that it does not meet the central thrust of our motion which is to inquire as to why the fall in fuel prices has not been reflected in a decrease in prices to ESB consumers, both domestic and industrial.  For example, the Minister said that in common with every other business the ESB have been affected by the worldwide recession, that during a period of several years of falling demand, the company have had to contend with rising imported fuel costs, that they have coped well with the consequences of the recession but have not emerged totally unscathed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We in Fianna Fáil recognise that the <Col N="1636" /> ESB have had a tough job to survive economically and have had to contend with a world recession which resulted from rising fuel prices.  The ESB overcame their problems by raising their income to a level that was greater than their expenditure and they did that by increasing charges to consumers, both domestic and industrial.  Our motion seeks to ensure that those consumers who have had to bear the brunt of a movement in fuel prices in one direction will be compensated in a commensurate way when these fuel prices move in the other direction.  That is the argument we are putting forward.  It is the objective we are trying to achieve but there is no answer or explanation in the Minister's 18 page script as to why the decrease in fuel prices is not being passed on to the consumer. There is a kind of outline history of the ESB and of the effects of the recession on ESB charges but there is no logical answer or explanation as to why the company's prices have not moved in tandem with fuel prices as those prices have moved downwards.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil motion highlights one specific aspect of a general problem. Lower oil prices mean lower inflation and we hope higher economic growth for oil importing nations of the industrial world, of which we are one.  This will give rise to an increase in real purchasing power in the economy.  It is the function of the Government and the function particularly of the Department of Energy to ensure that the effects of lower inflation are passed on quickly and fully to consumers so as to ensure that an increase in real purchasing power will ensure.  Real purchasing power will increase in our economy this year for two reasons: first, because the Government pay contracts were entered into before it became apparent that inflation this year would fall to as low a figure as 2 per cent or perhaps even to a zero figure and, secondly, the Minister for Finance indexed tax bands and allowances, basing that indexation on an inflation rate of 4½ per cent.  The revised forecast for inflation is 3 per cent and if that turns out to be correct it is a factor that should add <Col N="1637" /> also to real purchasing power but in order to gain the benefits of any such increase we must ensure that these effects quickly percolate down to the consumer.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that in money terms, income this year after tax will increase by about 6 per cent.  That means that with an inflation rate of 3 per cent, real purchasing power should increase by 3 per cent.  As inflation falls the danger is that the effects of that fall will be postponed in terms of reaching the consumer because of the actions of intermediaries. The tendency of those intermediaries will be to confiscate for themselves part of the gains from the falling inflation.  This is the case particularly of monopolies and the ESB are a monopoly supplier of electricity.</P>
    <P>From the point of view of industrial development and of employment creation we need increased economic activity and that will come through increased purchasing power both from the point of view of profit margins increasing for industry and from the point of view also of increased purchasing power in the hands of the consumer.  Whether that increase in economic activity will lead to a significant amount of employment creation is a matter for another debate. It would be more appropriate to a debate on the Finance Bill but suffice it to say that an essential prerequisite of employment creation will be an increased amount of economic activity.  It is a matter for economic planners as to how that increased economic activity will be translated directly into extra employment. That question, too, is one for another Minister and for another time but what we are trying to ensure in this motion is that the effects percolate down to the consumer and that the impact is experienced throughout the economy as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>Though this is not directly relevant to this motion, it is deplorable in this context that the Government should have abolished recently the National Prices Commission.  The whole area of price control seems to have been put into some sort of twilight zone.</P>

      <P>The underlying assumption seems to be that a mechanism of price control is necessary only in a period of rising inflation but it is equally necessary, if not more so, in many cases when inflation is falling.</P>
      <P>The Minister seemed to assume last night that our motion was concerned exclusively with industrial consumers of electricity but Deputies Flynn and Walsh made it clear from those benches that, regardless of how the Minister wishes to read our motion, it is intended to deal with all consumers, domestic and industrial. The script issued by the Minister does not meet the points raised in the motion.  We are very anxious that the beneficial effects of falling inflation are passed on to the consumer so that economic activity can be generated and that there can be an improvement also from the social point of view.  People have suffered directly because of the recession. Many people who are poor now would not be poor had they not lost their jobs or had their income not been eroded by the increase in fuel prices, an increase that arose out of a world energy situation. This happened both directly and indirectly. We are trying to achieve a position wherby the consumer gains when fuel prices move downwards just as they lost out when fuel prices moved upwards. That is simply what we are about in this motion.  I urge the Minister to rethink his position and to accept the motion.</P>

      <P>There is something very cynical in the motion this evening coming as it does from a party whose policies in the post-1977 period were directly responsible for much of the increased cost of electricity over the past few years. <Col N="1639" /> Do not forget that after 1977 the Fianna Fáil Government deliberately and cynically used the ESB as a job creation agency and forced the ESB to take on people who were surplus to their needs.  They did so in a way which was unplanned and unthought out and in a way which has resulted not just in the ESB having had to face up to harsh reorganisational activities over the past couple of years but has also added significantly to the cost of electricity.</P>
      <P>I must say it takes a bit of nerve and a lot of neck to come in here and be critical of high prices for which the policies of a previous Government, as part of their vote buying campaign, were directly responsible.  What is also very difficult to take in the motion this evening is the opportunistic nature of the assault launched last evening by the Opposition.  It is to argue that an improvement&mdash;it is a welcome improvement and hopefully it is one which will continue&mdash;in one aspect of the overall cost of electricity can lead in one fell swoop to swingeing cuts all round.  Such an approach is not just simplistic and opportunistic&mdash;we can expect that&mdash;but also, more dangerously, it falsely raises hopes which cannot be met in any realistic way and are dangerous even in the act of their being fanned.</P>
      <P>Let us look briefly at the facts.  The Minister last evening outlined them very clearly and cogently unlike Deputy O'Dea.  The Minister very clearly laid out the realities and constraints under which the ESB have to operate at present whichever Government are in power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">

    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>The ESB had a loss of £27 million for the year ending 31 March 1985.  This brought the cumulative deficit of the board to £64 million.  Are the ESB supposed to ignore these facts just because the price of oil has dropped, even if the drop is substantial?  Are they supposed to ignore these facts just because the price of one of the components of the overall price of electricity <Col N="1640" /> had this drop?  Of course, they cannot. The ESB have a responsibility to themselves and to the nation to maintain their financial viability.  Maybe in the present mood of Fianna Fáil financial profligacy, their spending like drunken sailors, the promises made last weekend, this does not matter very much.  It is all back to the spirit of 1977.  Indeed, that was a great year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Deputy worried about last weekend?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not worried at all about last week, this week or next week. The only small problem is that, if the ESB are not to be financially viable, the only option open to the board is to resort to the taxpayer to meet the shortfall. Again, that might not worry Fianna Fáil, although I am sure it worries some of the more responsible members of the party and I am certain it would worry Deputy O'Dea who has always been responsible in financial matters.</P>
      <P>It has never happened in the history of the ESB that they have had to resort to the Exchequer in this way.  The ESB, our oldest State body, have always set an example.  If the Fianna Fáil motion were passed tonight, which it will not be, what would happen could well become a real threat in this area.  No responsible Government would even contemplate allowing this to happen.  If, in some unlikely event, the party opposite were in Government, if there were similar circumstances and if this motion was brought before them, I doubt that in all seriousness they would contemplate it for one sober moment.  It is simply a motion which is irresponsible in every way and which, if passed, could add further to the heavy burden already being carried by the taxpayer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other important factor in all of this is the mix of energy sources used by the ESB.  If we were talking about an energy system which had only one energy source or depended predominantly on one source, as the ESB did in their early years, first on hydro and then on a mix of hydro and turf, the proposal being <Col N="1641" /> made by the Opposition would, of course, make sense.  If the drop in oil prices of the kind we are now experiencing had taken place in 1976 when 67 per cent of the energy was generated by oil, then the motion would make sense.  If we were talking about 1978 when the figure was 67 per cent or 1979 when it reached an all-time high of 73 per cent, then the motion would make sense.  But we are talking about 1986 and 1986 will be very much like 1984 or 1985 when the figure for oil was 20 per cent.</P>
    <P>The overall amount of energy generated by oil this year will be in the region of 20 per cent.  That is what we are talking about and that is the scope within which we can play around in this debate on this subject.  Surely, any prudent, sensible person would say that within the first constraint of the ESB remaining viable the national interest, and that is what this debate is all about, is best served by giving preference in the small scope we have to industrial users.  Our priorities have to be jobs, industrial costs and industrial competitiveness.  If the reductions continue, as I am sure they will, we will see from the policy adopted by the Government within the scope available to them tangible results and we will see improvements in jobs, lower costs and increased competition.</P>
    <P>One of the points made by the Minister and, indeed, a principle underlying the policy of the ESB is that in order to ensure continuity and certainty of supply there must be no over-dependence on any one single source and there must be within the system the capacity to adapt easily should one source dry up or become over-expensive.  We must never again find ourselves in a situation like the one we were in 1979 when 73 per cent of our energy came from one single source.  The policy to be followed, the policy which is being followed and the policy which makes it difficult to have the swingeing cuts proposed by the Opposition must depend upon a good mix of supply.  For that reason, in spite of well-grounded environmental reservations, I am pleased that Moneypoint is coming on stream with the guarantee that the <Col N="1642" /> supplies of coal will be continuous, that they will come at a reasonable price and that we will have a certainty of supply.</P>
    <P>In the present climate I am particularly pleased that the situation rules out and rules out indefinitely the nuclear option. It is interesting to remember that in 1970 a decision in principle was taken to build a nuclear station at Carnsore.  At that stage it was believed that the station would come into operation in 1980.  There were delays and difficulties which proved to be fortunate.  Bit by bit the starting date for the project was put back until eventually 1990 was mentioned as the starting date for the generation of nuclear energy at Carnsore.  It is important to remember that it was difficulties and problems of an operational and a financial nature and not Government policy which caused these delays.  The decision to go ahead with a nuclear station remained firm Government policy in the latter years of the seventies.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note, and I do so in the absence of any member of his party, that Deputy Desmond O'Malley, who was then Minister for Energy and the man responsible for this area, when speaking at a meeting of his then party, Fianna Fáil, described nuclear energy in <i>The Irish Press</i> of 30 January 1978 as:</P>
    <P>the only source of energy that could make a significant contribution to the country's electricity needs for some time to come.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that when members of the Fine Gael and Labour Parties at that time doubted this proposition, when they raised questions about the safety of nuclear energy, about the accident-prone nature of nuclear power stations and about problems of wastage and when they proposed a public inquiry prior to the siting of any nuclear power station or the adoption of nuclear power, the then Government brusquely and firmly refused this inquiry.  They said that the facts were clear and that there was no need for one.  This is stated in the Official Report, volume 303, column 1722.  I am sorry that the person on the opposite benches is Deputy Gerry Brady <Col N="1643" /> who has been consistently and wholeheartedly sincere on matters of the environment.  The policy of the then Government brings into question the sincerity of the new-found concern for the problems caused by nuclear fuels so evident on the upper reaches of the Opposition Front Benches at present.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to not how definite the whole tone of the Government's Green Paper of July 1978 was.  There were no real problems of accident risk or of waste disposal.</P>

      <P>It is interesting to note in hindsight that it was the events which followed the fall of the Shah of Iran and the rocketing oil prices and world recession which were responsible for the deferment of the nuclear programme and not the wisdom of the party opposite who were then in Government and who were enthusiastically supporting the introduction of a nuclear plant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present mix of coal, oil, gas, hydro and peat will happily ensure that the nuclear option is one which we will never have to face.  For that we owe more to the Ayatollah of Iran than to the ayotallahs on the Front Bench of the Government at that time.  The case made by the Minister for Energy last night is one of common sense and one which shows up the weakness of the case put by the Opposition, the failure to research the question properly and to realise that we are talking about 20 per cent of the overall supply of energy.  Those are the figures within which we can operate.  Nobody will doubt that within the constraints of keeping the <Col N="1644" /> ESB financially viable priorities must be given to the industrial consumer.  If there is scope for the domestic user, as there will be in September, progress will follow from there.  The Minister has his priorities right and I support his amendment with enthusiasm.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankPrendergast" hpid="Mr. Prendergast Mr. Prendergast">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Prendergast</NameTxt>
      <P>The opposition motion suggests that benefits from reduced oil prices have not been passed on to the electricity consumer.  This is patently not the case.  The Minister for Energy in his statement of 11 March and in his speech last night made it clear that not only the benefits from low oil prices but those accruing to the ESB from improvements in interest and exchange rates as well as from the commencement of coal fire generation have been passed to the electricity consumer.  The Jakobson report has been mentioned during the course of this debate and in particular the findings that industrial electricity prices were higher than the average European prices.  The recent reductions announced by the Minister, taking into account the earlier reductions of January 1985, have of course contributed to bringing industrial prices down and bringing them closer to the European average.  In this context I would like to remind the House that many of the European electricity utilities which are very heavily or wholly dependent on nuclear energy or coal do not have the diverse fuel mix of the ESB and have not been in a position to maximise potential benefits from reduced oil prices. Irish electricity prices have been reduced at a time when electricity prices in, for example, the UK and France, have had to be maintained.  It may well be that we have come even closer to average European prices than might appear from the actual percentage reductions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to point to the enormous benefits which the ESB have contributed to the economy over the years and to the need to maintain them in a healthy and viable position as our oldest semi-State body.  I do so as chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Commercial Semi-State Bodies.  We had a very interesting exchange of views with the chief <Col N="1645" /> executive of the board of the ESB two weeks ago and therefore some of the things which I am speaking about are particularly fresh in my mind.  Mention has been made of the level of fuel used by the ESB and to the fact that the level of oil used is now down to some 20 per cent of all fuel used.  We have been able to deduce from this that the effect of oil price changes are not now so significant for the ESB as they might have been in the past when oil accounted for 70 per cent of all fuel used by them.  The diversity of their fuel use profile is both strategically and economically sound, strategically because of the isolation of the system and the need to ensure the security of the supply of fuel and economically because of the considerable spin-off effects they have had throughout the economy.</P>
    <P>To take one example, one has only to consider the substantial contribution which the ESB have made to the development of Bord na Móna.  Construction and development of the turf burning stations by the ESB enabled Bord na Móna to bring vast areas of bogland into productive and profitable use, thus giving employment in areas of the country where few other opportunities for gainful employment existed.  The ESB, in using over 35 per cent of the machine turf and almost 70 per cent of the milled peat sold by Bord na Móna, are providing over half of that board's sales revenue from peat products.  There are many other diverse ways which the ESB are contributing to the nation as a whole through their use of goods and services.  As a large purchaser of indigenous fuels they support large sectors of the economy.  In this area alone they expended £200 million in 1984-85. On various other goods and services, including their capital works they expended £120 million in the same year. More than 50 per cent of the materials used in their capital works are purchased within this country.  Their payroll costs in 1984-85 alone amounted to £203 million. They earn foreign currency through their foreign consultancy assignments. Through apprenticeship training they have contributed to raising the nation's <Col N="1646" /> stock of skilled personnel.  It requires little imagination to realise that substantial areas of this nation's economy are dependent on and benefiting from ESB activities.  All of this points to the need to ensure the continued financial integrity and viability of the ESB rather than risk dissipating them in ill-conceived and precipitous price cutting which would be in nobody's interest in the long term.  All of us are anxious to ensure that the optimum benefits from oil prices will go to the ordinary housewife in the kitchen, as I said to the Chairman of the ESB and his colleagues two weeks ago.</P>
    <P>As the Minister for Energy and the leader of our party indicated here last night, the ESB are fully aware of their responsibility to maintain electricity prices at the lowest level possible.  In this regard the board have been engaged, since they published their strategic plan in 1984, in a sustained effort to slim down the organisation and to reduce costs in all areas of operation.  For several years past the ESB have consistently achieved their objective of containing price rises below the level of inflation.  However, it became clear that, if any significant realignment of their industrial electricity prices with those of other European countries was to be achieved, more radical action was required.</P>
    <P>Again, I emphasise that the ESB, in common with any other enterprise, must at least recover their costs: otherwise they will go into debt.  Furthermore, they are statutorily required to set their prices at a level sufficient to enable them to break even.  Clearly the price rises granted in recent years did not enable them to do that despite what was said earlier in the debate about consumers having borne the full cost of fuel price increases in the past.  As the Minister for Energy and the leader of my party indicated yesterday, the ESB are fully aware of their responsibility to maintain electricity prices at the lowest level possible.</P>
    <P>The move by the ESB into the generation of electricity from coal is another example of the board's attempt to ensure that costs are kept as low as possible for <Col N="1647" /> the benefit of consumers.  As the Minister mentioned yesterday, coal is a cheap fuel that is widely available and the decision of the board to build a coal-fired generation station makes more sense than ever.  No doubt Deputies will remember that some part of the price reduction announced by the Minister on 11 March was attributable to savings arising from the use of coal at Moneypoint so that electricity consumers at this early stage have benefited from this development.  In connection with the Moneypoint project, I should like to refer to the apprehension expressed by several people in the midwest region about the possibility of the ESB extending beyond their original mandate which could seriously damage the employment prospects and the business potential of people involved in coal distribution.  However, that is a matter for another debate and we will take it up at a later stage.</P>
    <P>I welcome the indication of the Minister that he is examining the question of the price of gas in consultation with the ESB and BGE.  I have no doubt that any benefits arising from these discussions will be passed on to give further benefit to electricity consumers.  I am Chairman of the Joint Committee on Commercial State-Sponsored Bodies and that committee are concerned about the absence of an overall energy plan.  We now have four indigenous fuel agencies, some of whom are taking expensive advertisements in newspapers at a cost of about £11,500 per day, with BGE competing with the ESB.  It would be sensible to have harmonisation of our national energy policy to ensure that there is no wasteful duplication by way of competitive efforts.  When we challenged BGE and the ESB recently the answer given was that competition is good for business. While that is axiomatic &mdash; like telling us that today is 23 April &mdash; from the point of view of the taxpayer it is not a good thing to have semi-State bodies competing against each other.  Competition is all right if they bear the cost themselves but ultimately it is the taxpayers who have to pay and that is not good.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1648" /> That is why I emphasise again the philosophy of the Labour Party, that there should be an overall national energy policy to ensure that the optimum benefits go to the ordinary woman with a young family.  We are not talking about industry, supremely important though that may be as a means of providing jobs. I accept completely the assurance given last night by the Minister and leader of my party with regard to passing on the benefit to the consumers.  When we took evidence from the ESB some two weeks ago, they told the committee to which I have referred that they were prepared at all times to pass on any benefits to the consumers.</P>
    <P>There can be no doubt that all electricity consumers have benefited significantly from the announcement by the Minister of price reductions and they will continue to benefit.  Two weeks ago I asked Mr. Moriarty, Chief Executive of the ESB, what they hoped to do in this regard.  I am absolutely satisfied that it is the policy of the ESB and the Government to give as much benefit as possible to the ordinary young housewife.</P>
    <P>Some people were critical of Fianna Fáil for putting down this motion but that was rather naive to say the least.  Fianna Fáil know just as we do that if the present situation continues the benefit will have to be passed on to the ordinary housewife. I would not criticise Fianna Fáil or any responsible Opposition for putting down such a motion.  A cynic might dismiss it as an exercise in political expediency, that they want to get their foot in the door before the Government get full credit so that afterwards they can claim they were responsible for the price reduction. It would be disingenuous and very naive of us to criticise any responsible Opposition in that connection.  Good luck to Fianna Fáil for putting down the motion.  However, there is a time and a place for everything.  I wish I were as sure of my salvation as I am that there will be further reductions in costs to ESB consumers and it will be done as soon as it is possible for the Government to do it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardBrady-DUB" hpid="Mr. G. Brady Mr. G. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>It is necessary to look at the mix of sources of electricity generation within the country.  Previous speakers referred to the 20 per cent oil limit as being a small margin for latitude.  As I develop my contribution to this debate it will become quite clear that it is anything but a small area in which to effect the deserved price reduction &mdash; 53 per cent for natural gas, 21 per cent from peat and the remaining approximately 5 per cent from hydro power.  Obviously it is sensible to keep an admixture of this kind and not to depend upon a single source.  I suppose in the European context Ireland is in the upper end of the range of pricing for industrial usage.  Indeed closer to home, comparing with England, we find ourselves out of kilter on the domestic rate of charges for electricity.</P>
      <P>No one could have envisaged the price of oil plummeting over the past six months back to the seventies level.  The public would regard it as quite derisory if they came into this Chamber and listened to the contributions made by the Government about not getting this due reduction in price.  It is quite outlandish. It is sad to hear speakers almost defending what is an obvious sleight of hand or rearrangement of finances.  There must be some type of ulterior motive on the part of the Government to engage in withholding a price reduction which is the right of the consumer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As this reduction of close to 75 per cent since last December brings us back to mid-seventies prices, how on earth can the Government, unless there is a reason that has not been disclosed to this House, justify holding back that reduction?  Let me try to explain what I feel is the reason for it.  There is 53 per cent from natural gas for which the ESB are charged a nominal 25p per therm which I would allege is pegged artificially and deliberately high at the old oil price level and this rate of difference in price is then transferred back to the Exchequer.  Last year An Bord Gáis returned £80 million to the Exchequer.  That is quite a sizeable sum of money.  Last night the Minister said that the ESB had reported a loss of some £27 million for the year ending <Col N="1650" /> March 1985 bringing their cumulative deficit to £64 million and that that figure could not be ignored either by the Government or the company in considering appropriate pricing policy; that the Government had a responsibility to ensure that the ESB maintained their financial viability as otherwise the Exchequer and, in the final analysis, the taxpayer would have to carry the burden.</P>
    <P>Some £80 million goes back to the Exchequer.  If the Government were to refund even half of that, quite substantial reductions in cost to the consumer would ensure and that is from the natural gas option and not taking into account the reduction in the cost of oil.  So we are not just talking in terms of a latitude of 20 per cent of the national output in generation of power, but more like 73 per cent. So I do not know what the obsession is with the 20 per cent oil limit.  That is just inaccurate.  I would contend that this gas price is being kept artificially high deliberately and, of course, it is quite obvious that this will have adverse effects on the balance of payments.</P>
    <P>It is derisory to delay implementing the reduction.  The Minister says the Government would be foolhardy in the extreme to embark on a programme of reductions. Obviously, unless the southern part of the country is enjoying relative prosperity or basking in an affluence which is unknown in the part of Ireland where I live, these reductions are needed.  A week hardly goes by in which constituency clinics are not full of people complaining about their inability to pay ESB charges, telephone charges, or whatever. That is a fact that cannot be evaded by talking in grandiose figures of reductions of millions of pounds.</P>
    <P>This is an opportunity.  Fianna Fáil are being sensible in putting forward a motion calling for a relief.  If members of the Government say this is a small measure, they are not in touch with reality because any small measure is huge in the financial budgets of many families in Dublin at the moment.  Unless the Minister is designing some sort of shock treatment for the country at present he is going about it the wrong way.  The <Col N="1651" /> public just cannot afford to meet these huge costs.  This is something that we have to keep in perspective.  It is not a question of there being a small margin to play about with.  There is a very much greater margin and the cost involved, even on the oil option, is about 75 per cent.</P>
    <P>In Dublin, and I am sure this applies in many parts of the country, we have an emergence of the new poor in our society. Large families who are ill-prepared for redundancy or massive layoffs and unemployment, who enjoyed a moderate standard of living, find themselves now in a situation where the wage earner is very hard-pressed to pay a never ending spiral of bills that come in week after week.  I would go so far as to say that in extreme cases where the pressure has become so unbearable, either through overdrafts or bills of this kind, people who are susceptible to stress and strain become suicidal.  The Opposition, in putting down a motion like this; are offering some hope that people can clutch at and say that at least there is a reduction in some type of energy usage.</P>
    <P>Certainly, at Christmas the reduction in petrol charges was gobbled up.  It was almost an absurdity at the time.  The reasons were couched in bureaucratic jargon that this was necessary to offset this and that.  Having undergone a savage onslaught and trying to maintain their heads above water, the public are at least entitled to some reduction.  I am not so sure about the feelings of members of Fine Gael but certainly members of Labour are being totally inconsistent with their very principles if they do not at least uphold that view of the hard-pressed sector of our society.</P>
    <P>We have extolled the virtues of the ESB and the great work they have done. No one denies that.  But they do not engage in what I feel should be a mandatory part of their development, that is, an education programme to endeavour to economise on electricity usage. Obviously, there is a vested interest in the usage of electricity.  They are advertising all the time clean, efficient, cheap <Col N="1652" /> power when a lot of their energy &mdash; and I do not say that facetiously &mdash; should be put into educating people, showing them ways and means to economise and not leaving it to parents to continuously badger and harp at their children to turn off lights, to turn off fires and so on.  Why do we not hear more of that from the ESB?  Why do they not educate people on how to cut back on usage?  I say that as a criticism of the ESB.</P>
    <P>Alternative sources of energy are not developed by the ESB such as wind power, wave power and those areas of electrical generation that are ecologically acceptable to a planet which is already well polluted.  There is no pollution from natural gas, even though it might have a 41 per cent efficiency burning rate compared with bituminous coal. The examples at the North Wall and the Marina in Cork show a world wide reputation in efficiency.  There has to be comment made about the change from natural gas to the wretched polluting bituminous coal at the Moneypoint station which is nearing completion.</P>
    <P>I want to put a challenge to the Minister. Eighteen months ago I raised the question of fitting sulphur recovering scrubbers to that plant and I was told the cost would be close to £300 million, which would be unacceptable, and therefore EC regulations had to be breached.  Now Ireland is a producer of acid rain in the order of 67,000 tonnes when it gets to full capacity of 900 MW in about 18 months' time.  That is simply not good enough.  In reply to a question I tabled about acid rain from the Moneypoint power plant, I was told the ESB are carrying out a cost appraisal at the direction of the Government for installing flue gas desulphurisation systems at Moneypoint and other generating stations.  He said the study was almost complete and that a report was expected shortly.  That is a total contradiction of what I asked about earlier.  I suggest that it is demanded now that these sulphur recovery&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is downright cruel to delay bringing in this reduction.  It is not unreasonable to assume that some other motive prevails. Given the track record of news being delivered in a differing context within a few months by this Government, I regard this as an example of bureaucratic arrogance of which, regrettably, the consumer is the butt.  I call on all sensible Members in this House, particularly members of the Labour Party, to row in with this constructive proposal.</P>

      <P>If I may, I should like to read into the record this motion, because listening to Government speakers they seem to have forgotten the wording.  Our motion reads:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann calls on the Minister for Energy to make the necessary arrangements with the ESB to pass on, forthwith, to all their domestic consumers the full benefit of the recent reductions in the price of oil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are not asking to close down the ESB, nor are we criticising the ESB for the contribution they have made to this State over the years.  We are simply asking them to pass on the benefits they received, particularly over the last six months, to the consumer.  The failure of the Government to instruct the ESB to reduce immediately the price of electricity to consumers means that all households are paying what amounts to a Government tax on the electricity they use.  That cannot be disputed.  Concessions were made and there were reductions in prices, but electricity prices did not come down.  This is yet another burden on the already hard-pressed families who had to suffer the removal of food subsidies and the imposition of VAT on <Col N="1654" /> clothes and footwear under the present Coalition Government.</P>
    <P>I am making these points because I want to spell out very clearly this Government's lack of concern about the issues affecting the community.  The most vulnerable sections of our community are suffering because of high electricity costs. When there was an opportunity to give relief it was not given.  Deputy Prendergast can talk all night about the good days, but we know how many good days we had in the last three years.  We were promised many good things when this Government came into office.  They had the brains of Europe.  They had all the answers.  Yet, three years later the people know what to expect from them.</P>
    <P>The Government were very quick to introduce taxation measures, but no concessions were made.  The people had to pay up immediately, but any relief was given begrudgingly and only as a result of pressure from this side of the house and constant criticism by Fianna Fáil Deputies on behalf of the people for the way they were being treated by the Government.  For example, the miserly 4 per cent increase in social welfare payments will not be given for another three months, but most taxes introduced in the budget were implemented immediately. This is the so-called Government of concern. This is the Government which Deputy Prendergast said was giving good news and that we should tell the people the good times would be here shortly.</P>
    <P>In line with the fall in oil prices the Government should pass the benefit to all consumers of electricity immediately. The Minister for Industry and Commerce publicly stated that he would take strong action against any manufacturer or wholesaler who did not pass on the benefit of the reduced cost of products to the consumer.  Would somebody explain what is the difference between what the Minister for Energy said last night and what the Minister for Industry and Commerce said?  There is a direct contradiction in the way the Departments are running their affairs.  If the Minister for Industry and Commerce follows through on that pledge, he must ensure that the <Col N="1655" /> ESB reduce the cost of electricity to all consumers.</P>
    <P>This must not be a token reduction but a true reflection of the dramatic fall in oil prices, which have fallen by almost 20 per cent in the last six months.  The unnecessarily high price of electricity is also unacceptable in view of the fact that natural gas is used to generate part of our electricity requirements.  With the advent of natural gas many people hoped we would have cheaper electricity.  However, the only one to benefit from this natural resource has been the Government creaming off the profits, a complete misdirection of the finances of the State. High prices for gas and electricity, with industry, commerce and everybody else unable to complete or meet costs, amount to a complete misdirection of the State's resources.  If Bord Gáis are to be consistent in their policy of selling gas at an oil related price, the users of natural gas, mainly householders in Cork and Dublin, should be entitled to a reduction in price immediately.  I was glad to hear the chief executive of Cork Gas Company this week stating that there would be a reduction in the price of gas in the near future.  I am interested to know what the reduction will be.</P>
    <P>In the report of the inquiry into electricity prices last year by the Department of Energy a number of relevant points were raised and I want to refer to two of them.  Government levies on fuels have increased the price of electricity unnecessarily. Second, the Government should sanction electricity price adjustments promptly and not have the matter drag on, causing further problems for the ESB and everybody else concerned.  These points were made not alone by representatives of Irish industry but by ESB representatives.  These recommendations were not implemented by the Department of Energy.  Let us be clear that recommendations made by the Minister's Department regarding issues affecting the ESB were not acted on.  The Government by refusing to ensure that electricity prices are adjusted in line with <Col N="1656" /> the cost of oil are putting a levy on the cost of oil, thereby increasing unnecessarily the price of electricity.  The imposition of a levy in lieu of a rate on ESB property means that an additional £19 million is being imposed on the ESB and that is being passed on to the customer in the form of higher electricity costs. This tax should be withdrawn immediately.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Energy last night said, as reported in <i>The Cork Examiner</i> today, that he rejected the Fianna Fáil motion to reduce ESB prices to private consumers now, but he promised to review the situation to see if further reductions could be achieved.  He said that the Government had the responsibility to ensure that the ESB maintained their financial viability as failure to do so would inevitably result in the Exchequer, and in the final analysis the taxpayer, being called on to carry the burden.  What does the Minister mean by that?  Surely there is a contradiction when the Government are taking £19 million from the ESB by a back door method.  It is an easy way to get money.  If the ESB had that money they could get on with their job and give a proper service at a proper price; but no, the Government must cream off in the easy way £19 million which would have a significant effect on the accounts of ESB consumers.</P>
    <P>The Minister and the Government appear not to realise the effects their policies are having on the community. When we have raised matters in this House affecting the community we have heard so often what I will give an example of now.  The then Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism, Deputy Bruton, replying to me said that it was not the responsibility of Government to create jobs; it was their responsibility to create the environment to create jobs. He outlined the difference for me.  I say here tonight that it is the responsibility of the Government to create that environment by bringing down prices throughout the community.  That will help to create jobs.  We hear from Ministers repeatedly that industry must become competitive.  In order to achieve <Col N="1657" /> that, the Government have a responsibility to ensure that price reductions are passed on; and they should not make big noises about 5 per cent when it should be 20 per cent.  The Government have an opportunity and a responsibility to make a positive response in this area to the community.</P>
    <P>Are the Minister and the Government aware of the number of people who are in dire straits because of arrears with their ESB bills?  We have gone through a long, hard winter when people had to use more electricity than for many years past.  In my constituency in Cork there is a huge unemployment problem, as is well known in this House because we have referred to it often.  Consider the problems and the difficulties of the people there whose incomes are insufficient to keep them living in a normal way and to feed and clothe their children.  Some of those people cannot meet those bills.  Some homes in my constituency have no electricity. It has been cut off because the people there could not pay their bills. The Government are failing in their duty in not recognising this.  We have heard pleasant talk from across the House tonight about the good times that are to come.  It is a pity that Members opposite have forgotten that bad times are here at the moment for many people and will be here for a long time to come if they are depending on the Coalition and their policies to tackle those issues.  The Minister has a duty to the public at large. The reduction in the oil prices should be passed on.  It is no reflection on the ESB, but it is a reflection on the policies of this Government that they extract money in any way possible as long as they get enough and the public do not benefit from it.</P>
    <P>Over the years when increases occurred and the ESB put levies on the meter or whatever in order to get money, that money was given by the public and that was very difficult for many people.  Now here is an opportunity to do something positive and relieve people, and I refer especially to the poorer section of the community.  It is widely known and recognised that this Government have <Col N="1658" /> forgotten totally the plight of the less well off and the almost quarter of a million unemployed, and the Government have contributed to that situation very substantially. These people are totally disillusioned with the Government's approach.  Will the Minister here tonight and his colleagues accept this motion in the interest of the community?  It was put down in good faith.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to take up my colleague on one point.  He referred to social welfare people being unable to pay. I agree with that, but let me point out that Ireland has the greatest number per head of population of free electricity recipients of any European country and his party made a major contribution to that, rightly so.  We are committed to that policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am in a quandry in seeking to speak on this motion and amendment which are before the House.  The Minister for Energy is called upon to pass on in electricity prices the benefit of recent reductions in the price of oil, and particular reference is made to domestic consumers. I must agree, as I have said here many times, that the price of electricity for many reasons is very high to both industry and the domestic consumer. However, there is no evidence before the House that the full benefits of the oil price reduction to the ESB have not been passed on to the consumer.  On the contrary, in the robust case which he put before us the Minister pointed out that not alone were these benefits being passed on in full but additional benefits arising from the weaker dollar, interest rates and the commencement of generation from coal were also being passed on. He made it clear that the reduction in electricity prices which he announced in this House on 11 March is costing £30 million this year and would cost at least £36 million in a full year.  Furthermore, he held out the prospect of further reductions at a later stage and was able to confirm a stable outlook for electricity <Col N="1659" /> prices for the next two to three years.  At the same time he said that the oil price reduction to the ESB was worth less than £20 million per annum.  Nobody has sought to challenge these figures.</P>
    <P>The Minister put all the facts regarding oil prices on the table and has not been contradicted in the House.  Members who have already spoken sought to make play of the slight deferment of reductions to domestic consumers but a brief study of the Minister's statement shows that this was a carefully balanced and deliberate decision in the best long term interests of the domestic consumer.  Two rounds of reductions have been given to industrial consumers in a period of 15 months in the interests of competitiveness and job creation and this is not in dispute.</P>
    <P>Given the findings of an independent inquiry that industrial electricity prices were out of line with European averages, the policy of the Minister and the ESB of tilting the balance in favour of the industrial tariff is fully justified.  It is further justified by the fact that electricity tariffs have for some years now stayed well below the rate of inflation and the clock has been turned back a full two years in regard to the domestic tariff. However, this has not been recognised and at times one had to check the monitor to see what was being debated in the House.  At times, it could have been a discussion on an Estimate for the Department of Energy as Deputies ranged far and wide on energy, touching on such things as FEOGA, the western electricity package, the policy in relation to peat development and so on.  It could also have been a debate on social welfare policy as the free electricity scheme was also discussed or, indeed, a discussion on industrial policy as there were references to Clondalkin Paper Mills.  It could also have been a discussion on competition policy as references were made to the price of petrol, diesel, heating oil, fertilisers and pesticides.  I submit that these are issues for another day as the motion is about reductions in electricity prices. The case put before the House by the Minister shows that the position of the <Col N="1660" /> ESB in relation to passing on reduced costs was fully explained.  When account is taken of the fact that the starting position of the ESB meant that they incurred a loss of £27 million and have an accumulated deficit, I would not expect the Minister or his Department to have the detailed information necessary to determine whether other sectors of the economy have been as conscientious as the ESB in passing on benefits, for example, the food sector.</P>
    <P>The underlying downward trend in inflation suggests that reductions have been passed on to some extent at least but, in relation to the motion and the amendment before the House, the Minister has demonstrated that the ESB have been assiduous to a fault in this context. The ESB are rightly proud to set the trend now as they have done on many occasions over the past 60 years.</P>
    <P>One Deputy spoke about intermediaries confiscating price reductions which could have been passed on to the consumer. The Minister amply demonstrated that the ESB are not in that category and the motion, after all, is about electricity prices.  Some Members seemed to want to send a message to other sectors of the economy about reducing prices.  If there is such a message, the example of the ESB is a good one to copy.  As I said, the Minister clarified his intentions in regard to domestic consumers and I share and support his view that the individual consumer will be well satisfied in the short term.  The 5 per cent reduction will be in force for some time as against a transitional benefit of 2.5 per cent a few months earlier.  I commend the amendment to the House as I am satisfied that, as in relation to Dublin Gas, the Minister will produce the goods.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this motion which calls for the passing on immediately of the 5 per cent reduction which the Minister announced will go to domestic consumers next September.  Perhaps Deputy Bell might be interested in listening to facts.  We welcome any reductions in relation to ESB costs for industrial, <Col N="1661" /> business and domestic consumers.  However, I wish to remind the House that the report of the committee of inquiry &mdash; I was proud to be a member of the Government which initiated this inquiry &mdash; found that Irish industrial electricity costs are on average 20 per cent above those of our EC competitors.  When one looks at some of the heavier users of electricity one finds that the cost differential is as much as 40 per cent and more.</P>
      <P>We welcome any reduction in the price of electricity but we will not pat the Government on the back for doing so because the Minister chose to ignore the reality in relation to the input cost of the ESB.  The Government came to power in December 1982 and in the middle of 1983 they increased gas prices to the ESB by approximately 46 per cent which, in effect, took £38 million in additional ESB revenue out of the pockets of ESB consumers. They also doubled the figure of £10 million which had been imposed on the ESB in lieu of rates to £20 million so, in effect, they added a sum of £48 million to the cost of the ESB.</P>
      <P>It is nice to know that oil costs only 20 per cent of the input of fuel for the generation of electricity at present.  I also note that the Minister said they will use every opportunity to use oil because it is cheaper.  How does the Minister reconcile that statement with the closure of the Great Island generating station, Wexford? What determines the cost of oil? We all know what it costs now and what it cost six and 12 months ago.  I am being generous to the Government when I say that it is less than half what it was.  Is any Member seriously suggesting that does not have a significant effect on the cost of fuel to the ESB?  It certainly does. Even greater still is the depreciation in the value of the US dollar.  In round terms it is 30 per cent less than it was this time last year.  In itself that represents a huge cost reduction for the ESB in purchasing oil and servicing their very extensive foreign borrowings.  We all know they have an abundance of such borrowings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There may be a minus in relation to the decision of the Minister for Finance <Col N="1662" /> to agree to a re-alignment of EMS currencies. At that time the Deutsche Mark was revalued by 3 per cent.  I do not deny that factor must be taken into consideration but the other part of that equation is that sterling has reduced significantly in value. I have no doubt that the ESB have substantial borrowings in that currency also. I put it to the House fairly and squarely that the reductions offered recently do not measure up to the benefits that have flowed to the ESB.  I am not here to denigrate the ESB but to salute them as a successful semi-State organisation.  I am here to ask that the ESB, as Deputy Prendergast seemed to suggest, be clapped on the back for ensuring the development of Bord na Móna.  I must put it on record that the ESB are part of our great national development and the Bord na Móna are another significant contributor to that.  One does not depend on the other.  The ESB should never have been allowed to make money on the back of Bord na Móna.</P>
    <P>The ESB put out propaganda last year to the effect that because of the huge prices they had to pay to Bord na Móna to increase their profits they had suffered. That was a myth.  Mr. Lang, of the ESB purchasing section, at a meeting of the Joint Committee on Commercial State-Sponsored Bodies agreed with me that the unit cost of milled peat, the mixture of sod milled peat and peat was very competitive with oil or gas.  It is no harm to stress that the reductions announced do not reflect the benefits that have flowed to the ESB.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Energy, like the ESB, told us that the ESB have a very big deficit to look after.  Any time anybody looks for anything from the ESB we are told they have a big deficit to look after, but let us analyse where that deficit comes from.  It is not a deficit in the true sense of the word because double depreciation still exists in the accounting practices of the company.  I am amazed that Deputy Manning, who time and again when I was Minister for Energy put the case that it was time to remove the double depreciation accounting practices of the ESB, totally ignored those arguments tonight.  It <Col N="1663" /> is amazing the way all the twists and turns can be done by Government Members who will not face up to the facts of life. Deputy Bell may smile but he must bear in mind that the main reason why we tabled this motion was to seek aid for the people who are suffering the greatest hardship.  I am glad that the Minister of State who was responsible for social welfare is present.</P>

      <P>So many Ministers were moved around in the musical chairs shift some time ago that it is hard to know where any of them is now.  I am glad the Minister is still involved with the Department of Social Welfare.  If he looks at any of the files going through his Department he will learn of the real hardship experienced by many people. At our clinics people with small businesses and builders approach us for help. They are told time and again by officials of the Department of Social Welfare that the income they had a couple of years ago should be sufficient to enable them to cope with their difficulties.  Those people, and the unemployed, should be assisted by the Government.  We are trying to get the Government to give relief to such people now and not at the end of the year.  I wonder how housewives will feel when they discover in their bills this week that the increase announced last December has been added on.  I cannot understand how Deputy Bell has come to the conclusion that this is only a temporary postponement of a reduction.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The increase announced last December applies from this month but the reduction announced recently will not apply until next September. If the Labour Party are not prepared to give some relief to those who are suffering great hardship the reduction in ESB charges announced recently will not be passed on to consumers until next September.  That does not represent a temporary postponement of a reduction.</P>
      <P>I marvel at the argument put up by Government speakers tonight.  I was surprised that I did not hear the child benefit scheme being trotted out tonight because we have been told often that it is the answer to everything.  When one refers to hardship in the House one is told that the child benefit scheme is the answer. That myth was blown long ago despite the efforts of the new Minister for Social Welfare to spread a false impression throughout the country.  That Minister even resorted to writing letters to the newspapers.  Deputy Bell may smile but he is aware that any person on the 35 per cent tax rate who is receiving benefit under the child benefit scheme receives £3.02 per week.  Out of that amount that person must pay the increased electricity charges and more for bread, butter and milk.  Anybody who can pay those increases out of that amount is a magician. The Government expect the people to be magicians.</P>
      <P>I am gravely concerned that the Government do not realise the hardship that is rampant throughout the country. If Members on the Government side were holding clinics they would be aware of it, but I am afraid they are hiding. They must remember that they cannot hide from the people all the time.  They will have to face the people soon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should now like to refer to another change of position by the Minister for Energy.  We are all aware of the rows that take place from time to time between himself and the Minister for Finance.  We are all aware that they were at it in 1983 and 1984.  On 25 June 1984 a newspaper carried a story under the heading, &ldquo;Spring hits Bruton in ESB price clash&rdquo;. <Col N="1665" /> At that time Deputy Bruton, who was Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism, was proposing that there should be a two tier system for electricity prices, higher for household consumers and lower for industries and business. However, Deputy Spring, in simple terms, told Deputy Bruton to mind his own business.  He does not stand for that sort of thing.  In the end he said that the view expressed by Deputy Bruton was one man's opinion.</P>
    <P>According to the <i>Irish Independent</i> 25 June 1984 the Minister, Deputy Spring, made it clear that energy prices were decided by the Minister for Energy.  He said that policy on ESB charges could not be decided in advance of any special Government inquiry into prices, that the Department of Energy was his responsibility and that the Minister, Deputy Bruton, in other words could mind his own business.  Deputy Spring did not accept a two-tier system then but when it suits him in 1986 in order to hold the Government together he is prepared to accept it.  That represents another U-turn by the Minister for Energy.  Does he remember what he did last year, or the year before?</P>
    <P>How does the Minister explain not being able to pass on benefits to hardship cases when there was so much money around to deal with the many crises that arose during the term of office of the Government?  Hundreds of millions of pounds were available for the PMPA and to bail out ICI.  There was no problem about getting that money and today in the House I got confirmation from the Minister that Dublin Gas are to be nationalised, warts and all.  The receiver will be given a blank cheque and nobody knows what the price will be.  It is incredible that the Government should make that decision without having a clue as to what the cost will be.  This was supposed to be a Government of financial rectitude. Throughout the country they preached what we should and should not do.  They have it within their remit to bring out what should have been brought out long ago.  Indeed, had it been done eight <Col N="1666" /> months ago Dublin Gas might not be in their present position.  The Government should recognise that they can no longer continue to reap high yields from high gas prices when the price of oil has been reduced by half.  That is the reality of the world energy market and it is time they recognised that fact.</P>
    <P>Our fundamental plea is to pass on the reduction at the same time as everybody else.  The key to national recovery is in the passing on of the benefits throughout the economy.  The Government should not make the hard-pressed housewives suffer, suffer at the expense of a Government hiding behind smokescreens, running away from their responsibilities.  It is the responsibility of the Minister to raise prices; equally it is his responsibility to ensure that they are reduced.  We maintain there is a very good case for doing so.  I will be amazed if the Minister is not, within the next six months, announcing another price reduction because circumstances will force him to do so&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Indeed, I hope that Deputy Bell, having heard the other side of the argument, will entice some of his colleagues to bring some relief to the hard-pressed housewives. I was not being insulting in so describing them, though the Deputy seemed to so imply in his remarks, because in view of all the facts and circumstances, it is an insult to offer them a derisory reduction from which they will not benefit until December next when, hopefully, Santa Claus will have better news for them with a new Government in power.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 25:</P>
    <P>In page 20, subsection (4), lines 39 to 43, to delete &ldquo;on such day or days as, by order or orders made by the Minister under this section, may be fixed therefor either generally or with reference to any particular purpose or provision and different days may be so fixed for different purposes and different provisions&rdquo;, and substitute &ldquo;for accounting period commencing on or after the 1st of January, 1987&rdquo;.</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash; (Deputy Flynn)</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>We are considering the implementation date, and I have been asking the Minister to consider a gestation period of 18 months because of the need of business people to acquaint themselves with the new measure, to take specialist advice and to deal with the new procedures so that they will be able to work out all the changes this will mean for the various companies and so that they will be given a reasonable time in which to change their corporate status, if necessary.  Companies can alter their status: they can decide to become unlimited companies or to become branches or to take other measures so that they will not have to take on board all of this legislation.</P>
      <P>The Minister was not forthcoming when I asked him to deal with whatever difficulties might arise and to consider the main effects of the legislation on small Irish companies, particularly those who do not have the necessary skills to deal with the changes proposed.  With that in mind, I was hoping that the Minister might relent.  During the response on Second Stage, Minister Bruton was being very forthcoming in this matter and recognised the need to allow businesses a time schedule of at least 18 months to acclimatise to the change.  Minister of State Collins does not seem to be accepting that.  I ask at least for a reasonable time to be given for the necessary adjustment to be made.</P>
      <P>In so far as this amendment is concerned, is it intended to bring different types of companies into line on different dates?  That could be a particular problem with individual companies.  If the accounting periods did not coincide with the new measures, it would be in the best interests to have a reasonably long period so that all could get into line on a particular date and have the matter finalised. In existing legislation the requirement is that the latest date for filing of annual returns is 11 months after the end of the financial year.  Because of the disparity between dates of filing, registration and so forth, does the Minister not think that there is a very justifiable argument for allowing an extended time scale for implementation?</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said before, the translation of the directive from European into Irish law should have been made in 1980 and it should have been in effect by 1981.  We are at present before the European Court of Justice for its non-implementation. To a certain extent, my <Col N="1671" /> hands are tied.  There may very well be a directive from that court to implement this legislation on a certain date.</P>
      <P>The effects of the directive and the requirements of this Bill have been known for quite some time within the accounting bodies, among industrialists and commercial undertakings.  There is no reason to feel that they have not been given ample time.  I realise, however, that companies need time to adjust and I am not anxious to rush unnecessarily this Bill into effect when it becomes law.  I shall give a reasonable time for adjustment but, as I said before.  I shall have to bring in the legislation sooner rather than later.</P>
      <P>In response to the Deputy's other comments, it is my intention to bring the generality of companies under the aegis of the legislation at the same time, that is all the companies affected by it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall not press the Minister any further on that point.  However, I would refer him to article 55 of the EC directive.  While we might be pressed by the Commission for an early implementation date, one must consider that there are other EC member states which have not yet implemented this legislation.  They also would be quite happy to have a derogation for a limited period.  Article 55 could be loosely interpreted as allowing the Minister some latitude.  Under subsection (e) of that article it is stated that a period of 18 months may be extended for up to eight years in so far as certain types of companies are concerned, particularly shipping companies.  It also deals with the type of companies in existence at the entry into force of the provisions referred to in paragraph 1 of that directive. That paragraph is quite clear and specific, that member states &mdash; and that includes Ireland &mdash; can bring into force laws and regulations and the provision necessary to comply with the directive within two years of its notification.  I know that that time limit has expired, but one could loosely interpret it that the effective date is the date on which the legislation is passed into law when signed by <Col N="1672" /> the President.  If that be so, we are still talking about 18 months.  If representations were made to Brussels in this regard, a derogation might be found to satisfy my request for a little breathing space for companies, so that expense would not be placed on them on the double.  My main point is that the Minister, I am satisfied, is not the sort of Minister to be involved in retrospective legislation.  Never let it be put on the record of this House that the Minister is a man who would put into our law retrospective legislation which would incur expense and the possibility of job losses for individuals in Irish companies and businesses.  Let him do himself, the country and business a favour by seeking this derogation on our behalf and he will be well thanked by all concerned.</P>

      <P>I am grateful for the Deputy's comments.  I should not like to be a party to any job losses.  As I said earlier, the type of derogation being sought by the Deputy is not a possibility. One must assume that the Commission would not take us to the Court of Justice unless it had good grounds on which to do so.  As I have been at pains to explain to the House, we are a number of years behind in the implementation of this directive.  However, I am aware of the difficulties of Irish industry and commerce and note the remarks of the Deputy.  I am to a certain extent constrained in what I can do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister allow that under article 55 certain different types of companies are referred to?  Will all these companies have to comply on the same date or will there be staggered implementation?  I should like the Minister to grant the five year period to unregistered companies as outlined in subsection (a) paragraph (2) of article 55 of the directive.  I am asking him to take the full options available under that directive for the benefit of all companies concerned.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 27:</P>
      <P>In page 23, part I, line 7, after &ldquo;income&rdquo;, to insert &ldquo;(8)&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These amendments all deal with the positioning of and the content of Note (8) in the balance sheet formats.  Note (8) in the notes to the balance sheet formats on page 26 of the Bill requires that in determining the amount to be shown in <Col N="1674" /> respect of &ldquo;net current assets (liabilities)&rdquo; in format 1 of the balance sheets, account must be taken of any amounts shown under the heading &ldquo;pre-payments and accrued income&rdquo;.  In fact, because of the way balance sheet format 1 is presented such amounts are automatically taken account of.  The present text of Note (8) is therefore superfluous.  I propose to delete it and to delete the reference to Note (8) in format 1 at the item, Net Current Assets (liabilities).</P>
    <P>Instead, I propose, in amendments Nos. 27, 30 and 32 to replace the text of Note (8) with a new text requiring details to be given in the balance sheet, or via a note thereto, of the amounts of any Government grants included in the accounts, and to position Note (8) at the headings &ldquo;prepayments and accrued income&rdquo; in formats 1 and 2 where, in accordance with accounting practice such amounts would normally be included.</P>
    <P>This amendment is in response to a suggestion by the accountancy bodies who feel, and I agree, that such information on Government grants is of sufficient note to warrant a specific disclosure requirement.  The net purpose of this is to ensure that where Government grants are forthcoming they are noted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment is rather important.  The question is one that has arisen for many years.  It concerns the whole position of pensions in so far as companies and their accounts are concerned. There are two types of these pension and there are defined contribution benefits.  I am very concerned about money collected from employees to the extent that that money should be kept separate from the accounts of the general business of an operation.  I was hoping that it would be possible to provide that there would be a separate financial fund or account into which all moneys from the pension fund, whether subscribed by the individual employees or by contribution and regardless of whether the scheme was a defined benefit one to <Col N="1677" /> which the company had made contributions, would be shown clearly on a yearly basis in defined accounts returned to the registrar's office and held in a separate bank account.  The purpose of this, now that all these matters are to be published, is that the employees in particular would be able to see readily that the company had honoured their obligation by making their contribution and that, in the other instance, they had more than honoured their obligation in keeping the employees' contributions safe and separate from the financial resources of the company.  It is with that in mind that I have tabled the amendment.</P>
      <P>This amendment should be welcomed by everyone who genuinely wishes for a situation whereby when companies run into difficulty at least the pension fund for the employees will have been safeguarded. I was hoping the Minister would find it possible, as an extra, to take this amendment on board.  Perhaps he will reconsider it for inclusion by way of amendment on Report Stage.</P>
      <P>What the amendment stands for is self-evident. It incorporates a provision that has been asked for by trade unions and workers for many years.  This Bill provided a glorious opportunity by way of the insertion of a single sentence such as I am proposing here which would ensure that moneys paid in respect of pension funds, whether by way of benefit or contribution, would be held separately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I sympathise with the Deputy's concern to ensure that moneys provided for pension funds should be kept in separate accounts.  However, as indicated in reply on Second Stage, companies legislation <i>per se</i> is not the correct vehicle for introducing provisions dealing with what are essentially supervisory aspects of pension fund management by firms.  The area covered by the Deputy is one which is being examined by the Minister for Social Welfare in the context of the establishment of a pension board representative of all interested parties <Col N="1678" /> and which will review and make recommendations on the supervision of occupational pension schemes in general.  The sort of concern which the Deputy has voiced will, I believe, be at the top of the list in such a review.  I will be happy to communicate the Deputy's concerns to my colleague, the Minister for Social Welfare, and I ask Deputy Flynn therefore to withdraw the amendment on that basis.</P>
      <P>The information required is fairly substantial but in company law we are dealing with company matters and pension funding is a separate matter.  The Deputy's amendment has my philosophical support but the matter falls to be dealt with by another Minister and I do not wish to impinge on the role of another Minister or to split legislation that is appropriate to one Department.  For that reason I ask the Deputy to understand my position.  I will undertake to convey his serious concern in the matter to the Minister for Social Welfare.  It is a concern that I share personally.  I will ensure that the matter is considered as a top priority in the context of the establishment of a pensions board.  The Deputy will understand that I am trying to keep what is in effect company law within the realm of company law and pension funds within the realm of pension fund legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Minister of State's attitude in this matter.  The Minister of State obviously feels that there is a vacuum in the existing law dealing with pensions.  Because it was mentioned, I thought that this was an ideal opportunity to impress upon companies, through the company law, that this was a requirement which would be made of them.  No matter how we look at it, details of the amount of money involved in pensions and reserves are going to be recorded anyway and they are going to be readily available in so far as the full accounting procedures are concerned under the standing practice. All I was concerned with was not just having it as included matter in the format but that it would have been mandatory on them also to have it under a separate <Col N="1679" /> financial account so that it could not be swallowed up in redundancy payments, buy outs, purchases of other assets, takeovers or any other type of financial arrangement and that pension fund money cannot be utilised, even in the short term.  That happens so often.</P>
      <P>Companies do not willingly put their hands on the pension fund.  They always have a reason.  They take it for a temporary period to do something which will enhance the company, buy further assets or a new product line.  They say they will build it up on the double afterwards. Suddenly, it all goes wrong and the employees lose their pensions.  There is no redress.  Some effort was made a year ago to utilise the redundancy fund to come to the rescue of those people but it was not adequate.  The onus of responsibility rests with the directors and the officers of the board.  They should be held liable and under penalty similar to the question of fraudulent fining in so far as the taking up of pensions in an unauthorised way is concerned.  However, I accept the Minister of State's good faith in the matter.</P>
      <P>Was this question referred to in the directive or is this a peculiar Irish inclusion to accommodate our own set of circumstances? In reading down through the directive it did not occur to me as readily as some of the other items the Minister of State referred to.  It was because of that that I thought that this was a peculiar Irish insertion.  Obviously some of the things in the Schedule are not peculiar to Ireland but they are individual as far as Ireland is concerned.  This is one of them and that is the reason I thought it was a reasonable time to have a go at the Minister of State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I can confirm that the reference to the separate notation for pension funds is one that my Department added to the directive.  It was as far as we could go along the road within the context of company law.  I have complete sympathy with what the Deputy has stated.  I would say also, that there should be an obligation not only on the directors and <Col N="1680" /> officers of the company but also on the trade unions negotiating with the company to see that whatever pension scheme is in operation is safeguarded and should be reviewed regularly by both sides.  It is an area outside the scope of company law.  I did go as far along the road as I could but I am asking the Deputy to understand my position.  It will be brought to the attention of the Minister for Social Welfare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say that the first long overdue step has been taken along the road.  That is to be welcomed. It is a pity that we do not get a little bit more publicity, not for our own personal advantage, but for this legislation which has many good things in it for the protection of employees and employers.  This is particularly for the protection of employees and it is a pity that it does not get a good headline because now the nature of every pension scheme held on behalf of employees by any company has to be published and published for the benefit of all concerned each year.  It has to be stated explicitly whether it is funded externally or internally.  It has also to be stated whether an actuary has in fact completed an assessment of the fund and whether the fund is capable of doing and performing as was intended.  The date of the last actuarial experience has to be recorded.  This must be a considerable advance for the employees of many of our companies, and for many of our companies' employees who found themselves outside the gates of Leinster House trying to seek compensation for funds that were pinched by fraudulent trading and directors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome this and it is a pity that the representatives of The Workers' Party who berated me today about being so conservative in so far as the thresholds of this legislation are concerned could not be here to support the action being taken in the first step along the road to protect the pensions of employees of industry.  I hold the Minister of State to his word.  I take it in good faith that the representations he promised will be made to the Minister for Social Welfare and that this <Col N="1681" /> matter will be relieved by early legislation. I know and understand that it is not primarily a company law business.</P>

      <P>This is a means whereby companies through their advisers can, in effect, escape some of the harsher elements of disclosure as outlined.  I particularly want to remove the word &ldquo;seriously&rdquo; in that I felt that &ldquo;prejudicial&rdquo; conveys a meaning strong enough in so far as disclosure is concerned.  There is no need for the adjective &ldquo;seriously&rdquo; to expand on that matter.  If it were deleted it would give a much more flexible interpretation to the legislation. There is no need for that word to be included.  All the words of the directive have not been taken on board in the other sections of the Bill.  One particular instance which I recall is where the word &ldquo;indication&rdquo; was placed in a particular area that was not relevant to the actual place where it appeared in the directive. It suited our purpose admirably.  I was of the opinion that the Minister of State could quite easily have deleted the word &ldquo;seriously&rdquo; without diminishing the effect of the legislation.  The Minister of State would have enhanced the opportunity for individual companies to utilise a mechanism to get round a situation where information, which might very well be prejudicial to their continuing in business, would be deleted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all know that section 13 of the Bill is the one section which allows open shooting to predators.  It enables people <Col N="1682" /> who seek information on their competitors to undermine the economic viability of individual companies.  The utilisation of this formula is the way individual auditors and directors could say that that information, if it was disclosed, would seriously prejudice their ability to continue in business.  We are concerned with research and development and the whole question of science and technology.  If the information gleaned because of expenditure on research and development was to be available willy nilly to all concerned, then the predators would be everywhere. It would mean a cessation of science and technology development in this country. I ask the Minister, with a view to making it easier for directors and people involved in sensitive areas of strategic information, whether market development or product development, to give them the leeway of having this section adjusted to remove the word &ldquo;seriously&rdquo; and allow &ldquo;prejudicial&rdquo; to stand independently.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>We are slightly at odds on this.  Paragraph 41(5), which the Deputy wishes to amend, does not relate to the overall activities of the company but merely to the turnover of the company. It does not relate to section 13 as the Deputy alleges.  I sympathise with the Deputy in his request to delete the word &ldquo;seriously&rdquo;.  There is nothing I can do since the words &ldquo;seriously prejudicial&rdquo; are laid down in article 45 (1) (b) of the directive and we are obliged to follow that in this provision.  The inference made by Deputy Flynn in regard to science and technology is not what this paragraph refers to.  It merely refers to turnover.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I have one critical question to ask the Minister and, if I get the answer I would like, there will be no further need for discussion.  If the directors' opinion and judgment were to the effect that any disclosure would be prejudicial to the company's performance or activity, would that mean the auditor would not be in a position to challenge their judgments?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The words used in the <Col N="1683" /> paragraph, &ldquo;where in the opinion of the directors the disclosure of any information required by this paragraph would be seriously prejudicial&rdquo; make it quite clear that it is the responsibility of the directors to determine the disclosure of information on turnover.  We are talking about turnover and not items of expenditure such as research and development.  If the directors of a company feel that to divulge the turnover of a company is seriously prejudicial to the company, then they may so reserve their position. That information need not be disclosed but the fact that any such information has not been disclosed must be stated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of turnover is rather critical to this whole matter. Turnover has to be broken down by categories and geographical markets.  Once turnover is broken down into the various products with which it is involved and when it is broken down still further into the markets into which that product is selling we get a very easy numerical calculation. It would be possible from the numerical calculation for individual companies dealing in single products to have the unit cost of production elicited from that information.  If that were the case one can imagine how damaging it might be to a company whose competitors were doing their fine calculations on the turnover <i>versus</i> the amount of articles sold into a particular market.  Once you have the unit cost of production you have the strategic source of information on any company.  That is the concern of industrialists. The competitors would then be able to underpin their pricing structure and under sell it if necessary and, consequently, perhaps cause the collapse of companies.  That is a genuine fear.  It is for that reason that I wanted a more liberal interpretation of the meaning of prejudice.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 35:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In page 44, Part IV, paragraph 43, after subparagraph (3), between lines <Col N="1685" /> 14 and 15, but before the heading &ldquo;General&rdquo;, to insert the following subparagraphs:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(4)  Any amount expended on research and development in the financial year, and any amount committed in respect of research and development in subsequent years, shall be stated.</P>
    <P>(5)  Where, in the opinion of the directors, the disclosure of any information required by subparagraph (4) of this paragraph would be predudical to the interests of the company, that information need not be disclosed, but the fact that any such information has not been disclosed shall be stated.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to secure that, as part of the information supplementing the profit and loss account, companies will disclose particulars of amounts expended and committed in respect of research and development activities.  The amendment provides, however, that this information need not be disclosed where the directors of a company consider that its disclosure would be prejudicial to the interests of the company.</P>
    <P>Because a commitment to research and development can play such a key role in many companies, future growth, disclosure of the actual level of expenditure taking place in this area would provide a very useful indicator of a company's future prospects to potential investors, and the proposed amendment will secure this disclosure.  At the same time, however, it is necessary to protect those companies which might be damaged by disclosing particulars of their activities in this area and the proposed amendment, therefore, allows the information in question to be withheld in such cases.</P>
    <P>The amendment goes substantially to meet the desires expressed so eloquently by Deputy Flynn on a number of occasions this evening.  Expenditure on research and development need not be disclosed if the directors consider that <Col N="1686" /> such disclosure would be prejudicial to the interests of the company.  I am sure this is what the Deputy would like to see.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is exactly what I like to see.  It was pleasing to see this amendment in the name of the Minister.  This simple amendment at the end of the business today sums up all I should like to see applied to the legislation and I only regret that the Minister did not find it possible to apply similar phrasing in respect of all sections.  I know he would not feel justified in doing that and that no doubt it would be a matter of great concern to our EC partners that he had done something to negative the impact of the Bill but it would have had my wholehearted support.  The reason I pressed my amendment was that I recognised the Minister did not have his heart in the word &ldquo;seriously&rdquo;, otherwise he would have incorporated it in his amendment.  I thought that perhaps he might take the option to remove it, but unfortunately he is slavishly complying with the article of the directive.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I rather think he has been slavish in his support of it because he could have deleted some of the more difficult sentences without any great difficulty. Research and development are absolutely fundamental so far as the progress of a company is concerned and particularly the financial commitments to such development.  This must be protected. I am pleased that directors may take the option of stating that disclosure would be prejudicial to the interests of the company concerned.  For that reason I welcome the Minister's amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now that the Minister is getting into the right frame of mind so far as protecting Irish business interests are concerned, perhaps he would indicate to his advisers that on Report Stage there might be similarly worded amendments in respect of six other sections.  If he did that he would provide a framework to allow for disclosure in proper circumstances but there <Col N="1687" /> would also be the opportunity for directors and concerned people to protect their limited liability status on the one hand and their investments on the other hand.  The Minister would be doing a good day's work if he were to do this in respect of some of the other sections on Report Stage.</P>

Perhaps the Minister might consider between now and Report Stage if it is necessary to alter item No. 2 under the heading &ldquo;Taxation, including deferred taxation&rdquo;.  I suggest that deferred taxation might not always be a liability and that being the case it could be misinterpreted later.  The matter might be worth considering.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the words &ldquo;deferred taxation&rdquo; are used in standard accounting terminology, are clearly understood and inserted in the accounts at the audit stage.  As the Deputy said, deferred taxation may not subsequently be a liability but because of the terminology of the taxation code it was necessary to include the words.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer the Minister to Note No. (2) under the heading of &ldquo;goodwill&rdquo; where it is indicated that goodwill shall only be included to the extent that it was acquired for a valuable consideration. Will it be permissible to write off goodwill immediately against reserves?  I understand it can be capitalised only if it was acquired for a considerable consideration. It is important to get that matter cleared.  Is it depreciated systematically over a number of years by the directors or does it necessarily have to be written off immediately against the reserves?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>In the first instance, amounts representing goodwill shall only be included to the extent that the goodwill was actually acquired for a valuable <Col N="1689" /> consideration.  In other words, it cannot be brought up out of nowhere.  There must have been a valuable consideration in order to have it expressed on the balance sheet.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to page 30 paragraph 9 (2) which is as follows:</P>
      <P>Subject to subparagraph (3) of this paragraph, the amount of the consideration for any goodwill acquired by a company shall be reduced by provisions for depreciation calculated to write off that amount systematically over a period chosen by the directors of the company.</P>
      <P>Again, it is a matter for the directors of the company to decide the period over which they wish to write it off.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the period determined by the directors or would the period of economic life not be a better way of systematically writing it off?  Could it be written off immediately?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy would refer to subparagraph (3), it states:</P>
      <P>The period chosen shall not exceed the useful economic life of the goodwill in question.</P>
      <P>In subparagraph (2) it is the direct responsibility of the directors to determine the period over which the goodwill can be written off but that period cannot exceed the useful economic life of the goodwill in question.  Also subparagraph (4) reads:</P>
      <P>In any case where any goodwill acquired by a company is shown or included as an asset in the company's balance sheet, the period chosen for writing off the consideration for that goodwill and the reasons for choosing that period shall be disclosed in a note to the accounts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is covered fairly adequately.  It <Col N="1690" /> is a tricky area but it has been handled properly and in realistic terms because a figure for goodwill can wrongly inflate the value of a balance sheet.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important for those who would be reading this legislation subsequently and seeking interpretations.  I interpret it clearly that goodwill has to be of high valuation the day it is acquired in the first instance and that it can be systematically written off over its economic life or it can be written off over a period decided by the directors.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">

      <P>Yes, it is a highly technical Bill and I would expect that that would be the <i>modus operandi</i> that would lead to the best result in the final analysis.  It is obvious that a lot of this work has been professionally advised upon.  That is an important aspect because the provisions of the Bill, together with the Schedule, as far as I can see, will last for a considerable length of time and will form the basis of legislation in company law for our lifetime. It is just as well that this legislation has been professionally advised upon and it was a wise course of action for him to take.  it is obvious from some of his remarks that he has been advised that this is what the accounting profession would like, but it has to be borne in mind that some of the Standard Statements of Accounting and Practices have been altered by some of the provisions and there is a conflict between some of those statements.  That is inevitable and it will make life easier for all concerned that they will be able to reconcile them with the Bill.</P>

      <P>So that it will be on record, if anybody wants to know, there is a conflict with the Standard Statements of Accounting and Practices Nos. 9, 19 and 20.  SSAP 9 deals with the question of valuing work in progress on long term contracts.  There seems to be a conflict there so far as this Bill is concerned, <Col N="1694" /> particularly with section 5(c).  Under SSAP 19, investment properties are not required to be depreciated.  This would be in conflict with the Bill's requirements that all fixed assets must have a limited, useful, economic life.  There also seems to be a conflict with SSAP 20 which deals with the question of foreign currency translation.  It would be in the best interests of all concerned if they could be reconciled.  May I say a final few words about the Bill or do we have to do anything else?</P>

      <P>I want to thank the Minister for being so forthcoming.  He will appreciate the means I adopted in dealing with this matter; rather than fighting it out on Committee Stage I took the opportunity to put most of the markers down on Second Stage.  I think that was a good exercise.  I am on record as saying I regret that this Bill had to be introduced because I have no doubt it would never have seen the light of day in Irish circumstances but for the fact that the EC demanded it of us.  There is something to be learned from this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some sections of this Bill will create difficulties for some businesses, not necessarily the large businesses because <Col N="1695" /> they have the capacity to deal with them. The non-EC businesses can arrange themselves as branches and they will not be over-burdened one way or the other. But there is a certain type of Irish business which will find it difficult to adjust, and will find it expensive.  They may have difficulties in implementing this legislation but, irrespective of whether there are difficulties, I am satisfied this legislation will have no effect unless the registrar's office is brought into production to deal with it.  The experience in registrars' offices in all EC countries is the same. Accounts are not filed in time, there is no follow-up, there is no policing of the arrangements and, unless the Minister can give a categorical assurance that he going to take it on board and that his Department will be capable of dealing with this legislation, it will have been a waste of time and effort.</P>

Perhaps he might think better of it tomorrow.  I thought another party would have taken more interest in this legislation because they portray themselves throughout Ireland as the protectors of business, and ensuring that business gets the right climate in which to thrive.  It is remiss of them that they did not feel it worth their while to come into this House to discuss the most important piece of company legislation since 1963.

      <P>Section 2 reads:</P>
      <P>Section 7 of the Act of 1956, which relates to formalities to be complied with in certain cases, is hereby amended by the insertion of the following proviso after paragraph (b) of subsection (2):</P>
      <P>Section 7 of the 1956 Act reads:</P>
      <P>Pending the re-integration of the national territory, subsection (1) of section 6 shall not apply to a person, not otherwise an Irish citizen, born in Northern Ireland on or after the 6th December, 1922, unless, in the prescribed manner, that person, if of full age, declares himself to be an Irish citizen or, if he is not of full age, his parent or guardian declares him to be an Irish citizen.  In any such case, the subsection shall be deemed to apply to him from birth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1697" /> (2)  Neither subsection (2) nor (4) of section 6 shall confer Irish citizenship on a person born outside Ireland if the father or mother through whom he derives citizenship was also born outside Ireland, unless&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  that person's birth is registered under section 27, or</P>
    <P>(b)  his father or mother, as the case may be, was at the time of his birth resident abroad in the public service.</P>
    <P>The Minister is proposing in section 2 of this Bill to insert after section 7 (2) (b) of the 1956 Act:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Provided that the citizenship of a person who is registered under section 27 shall commence only as on and from the date of such registration.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The first part of section 7 of that Act deals with citizens from Northern Ireland and the second part deals in particular with a father or a mother, as the case may be, who was at the time of the person's birth resident abroad in the public service.</P>
    <P>There is no proviso here in relation to the timing in this Act at the moment and the Minister has taken this opportunity to introduce such a proviso, that such citizenship shall commence only as on and from the date of such registration.  Is this to remove or to cut out retrospective citizenship and will the retrospective citizenship apply only to people who make a declaration in the North of Ireland in future and not to people whose parents are abroad at the time of their birth?</P>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>Under section 6 (1) of the 1956 Act every person born in Ireland is an Irish citizen from birth.  Section 6 (2)  of that Act provides that every person is an Irish citizen if his father or mother was an Irish citizen at the time of that person's birth.  Section 7 (2) provides <i>inter alia</i> that a person outside Ireland whose father or mother from whom he or she derives citizenship was also born outside <Col N="1698" /> Ireland shall not be an Irish citizen unless his birth is registered under section 27 of the 1956 Act.  The amendment does not refer to Northern Ireland.  It refers to persons who are born outside Ireland and who would have to register under section 27 of the 1956 Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that persons born in the North will continue to have retrospective citizenship on the making of a declaration.  That is not affected because that is in the first part of this section.  The amendment the Minister is making here is to the second part of the section which deals specifically with a case where the father or mother was at the time of the person's birth resident abroad in the public service.  In such cases does retrospection apply at present or was it just unclear whether retrospection applied at present?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>At present retrospection applies and under the amendment it will not apply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite clear, in any event, that a change is taking place for people in those circumstances.  Section 7 (1)  on page 445 of the 1956 Act covers that.  At present it applies from birth for Northern Ireland and the Minister has made it quite clear that will continue, but take the American Irish for instance.  If the person concerned is born in America I take it that person's citizenship would in these circumstances apply only from the date of registration and that he or she would not receive retrospective citizenship to birth and would not be able to benefit from that if it conferred benefit in any circumstances, after this change is introduced.  While we are not making a change in relation to people in the North, we are making a change that would affect the American Irish.  For instance, if the grandparents were Irish and a grandson or granddaughter wants to become an Irish citizen he or she can be an Irish citizen only from the date of registration and not retrospectively before that.</P>

      <P>I will clarify &ldquo;on citizenship by descent&rdquo; for the Deputy.  Anybody born here is an Irish citizen.  The first generation born abroad are Irish. That means that the children of Irish citizens living in America, South Africa or anywhere else are Irish.  The second generation born abroad are entitled to citizenship if they register.  The third generation born abroad may register if either parent has registered.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Are there any practical examples of this?  For instance, if such a person is in America and there is a desire to have that person extradited for crime, political offences, or whatever, what would be the position in those circumstances? If the person wanted to become an Irish citizen and was entitled to do so under this section he could become an Irish citizen only from the date of registration. Would that affect the extradition laws?  Would the extradition be based on the date on which the crime was committed, or would it relate to the status of the person on the day he appeared before the court?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not the answers to that.  I can deal with the retrospection and the position of such persons as citizens depending on the registration of their parents or grandparents.  I cannot deal with their position on extradition at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it the Minister appreciates that I am trying to get at the practical implications.  She has explained clearly for me the way in which it will apply, the people to whom it will apply and those to whom it will not apply.  As a consequence of that, what would be the practical application?  Why bother to do it at all?  Why is it introduced?  Obviously it is introduced for some reason.  I <Col N="1700" /> do not know the reason.  It is perhaps because the Department or Ministers previously found something anomalous and they want to control it or to do something else.  I take it that it is not introduced for no reason at all.</P>
      <P>On looking through the Act I found other things that could be amended while this 1985 Bill was being considered.  I have suggested one or two and, if I had the time and resources to go through the whole Act, I am sure I could find other things which could be updated given the circumstances of today.  I did not do that. I just picked out one or two that related to the area we are dealing with in this Bill and I suggested amendments to be considered on Committee Stage.  I must ask myself why the Minister is doing this. Maybe the Minister has some idea at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is perfectly right.  The amendment should not be made just for the sake of it.  The thinking behind this is that in certain countries there was risk of abuse where people were registering in old age merely to enable their children or grandchildren to benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>So we are getting a little nearer to what the reason might be.  Elderly people of Irish descent might want to pass on their citizenship to their grandsons, granddaughters, or whatever.  Why not let them do that?  Why prevent them from doing it now?  Did anything they were doing seem to be troublesome or difficult?  Surely there cannot be many of them looking for citizenship now as our problem is more one of emigration than immigration?  Has there been something undesirable in regard to these developments?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>There were ulterior motives and it was a case of using Irish citizenship to get a second passport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister could elaborate.  Was this a means of getting into Great Britain by the back door? After all, if they were descended from <Col N="1701" /> those wonderful Irish people who went abroad in the past and who established such a great name for us round the world I cannot see why we would be too worried if they had a second passport which was Irish unless there was a reason for being concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>It was deemed as a necessary amendment because there was an increase in the number of people apparently who showed no interest in Ireland or in their ancestry for 60 or 70 years but who then saw it as a means whereby their children or grandchildren could get an Irish passport.  They also saw it as a means of getting out of the country in which they lived and moving elsewhere in Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister be a little more specific in this regard?  We are changing the law and the Minister seems to have more information.  There appears to have been an increase in the number of people showing an interest in having an Irish passport.  They are not so young now and it could be for very simple reasons.  When you get a certain age &mdash; the Minister would not know anything about this yet &mdash; you take a greater interest in your heritage, ancestry and the old country.  Is there a problem in this regard?  The Minister suggested that there might be specific reasons; we are all adults here and she could let us hear some of the reasons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>The intention in 1955-56 when the original Act was being drafted was that citizenship should only date from registration.  There has been a dramatic increase in the number of applications from South Africa in recent years from this group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, at least we now know what the Minister is talking about and why these proposals are being made. What are the practical consequences of the retrospection before the date of registration in such cases?  They can still be granted citizenship here and we are saying that it will only commence from that date.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>Where they have an interest in Ireland and in their Irish ancestry of course they can register and their children will also be able to register and claim Irish citizenship.  At present it is open but when the change is made it will not be possible to act in the way I have described.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>I should love to oblige the Deputy but I cannot be specific in regard to applications from abroad. However, the number of foreign birth registrations has risen in recent years; in 1985 1,653 people registered, in 1983 the figure was 925 and, to go back even further, until 1975 the number registering was under 500 every year.  That does not help in regard to the regions or countries, where registration took place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>We can see from those figures that the numbers increased from 500 in 1975 to 1,653 in 1985.  Has the Minister any idea why so many people are registering and of the benefit as a result?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>I can only hazard a guess. Obviously, in certain parts of the world, people want to have an alternative to their present citizenship.  One thinks of South Africa or Hong Kong in this <Col N="1703" /> regard.  It could also be the case that the steep increase since 1975 was as a result of our entry to the EC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The increase may well be related to our entry to the EC.  Did the Minister also say that there has been a substantial increase in the number of applications from South Africa?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>On Committee Stage we deal with sections in detail and I had expected that the Minister would have told the House that this section represented a change in the 1956 Act.  I had expected the Minister would have given the reason for the change.  At the outset I asked if the Minister intended making a statement on this new section.  On Committee Stage we have an opportunity to get a lot of information from a Minister and have a discussion about provisions in a Bill.  While I did not move an amendment to the section I was anxious to know the reasons for including it.  Naturally, I was a little suspicious when the Minister did not have anything to say about the section at the outset.  I wonder if this is a provision we should be adopting.  There may be many people living abroad, in <Col N="1704" /> Hong Kong and so on, whose parents or grandparents were Irish and who may be anxious to return to this country.  Will they be cut off?  Who is putting the pressure on the Minister and the Government to adopt this provision?</P>
      <P>Earlier I asked if Britain was putting on the pressure.  The Minister mentioned that the section was introduced to deal with people who may have two passports or people using Ireland as a backdoor into Britain or into the EC.  When one considers those matters it makes one wonder about the wisdom of adopting the provision and cutting off people from the country.  The section states that the citizenship shall commence only from the date of the registration and, obviously, that will affect the children of Irish people living abroad.  Is it wise to cut off the children of Irish people who live abroad? I would have thought we would have been glad to see the children of such people coming to Ireland after a long time, even if they were to use their citizenship of this country to be members of the great European Community we all belong to.  We should facilitate such people and not introduce regulations which will restrict them.  We are creating a new generation of emigrants and I wonder if this section will cut them off altogether.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am uneasy about the section and the Minister's statement has not relieved my unease.  I would have preferred if the Minister had outlined the reasons for this measure.  I should like to know if the provision will affect extraditions for crimes or political offences.  We are aware that the Government have signed the European Convention on Terrorism and that before ratifying it, having listened to the arguments made at home since it was signed &mdash; it is our view that it was signed in some haste &mdash; they may decide to make provisions for our citizens, as other countries did.  If that occurs, will the people we are cutting off in this section be affected because their citizenship will start from the date of registration and not from the date of birth?  For example, if an American citizen whose extradition is being sought <Col N="1705" /> from this country decides to seek citizenship here, what will the position be? Will the fact that citizenship commences from the date of registration affect the extradition process?  Will a court be obliged to accept that nationality was from the date of registration?</P>
    <P>Obviously, the section is intended to put a stop to an abuse of some type but I am not sure what the abuse is.  In recent times there has been a big increase in the number of public servants and others going abroad to work.  There is a provision in the 1956 Act under which the Minister may confer citizenship on a person born outside Ireland if his father or mother, as the case may be, was at the time of his birth resident abroad in the public service.  Will the Minister explain to the House where the call for this provision came from?  Did it come from the EC, Britain, the Minister or the Department?</P>

      <P>Deputy Naughten has been given permission to raise on the Adjournment the non-availability of school transport for a child &mdash; details supplied &mdash; in County Roscommon, the subject matter of Question No. 215 of 15 April 1986.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for allowing me raise this matter on the Adjournment.  While it may not appear to be a very important issue, since it affects only one child in a remote part of the country, nevertheless it is important because I believe the child concerned is being deprived of school transport simply because the child is a girl.  The boys in that area all enjoy transport to Runnamate national school while this child, because she is a girl, is deprived of transport.</P>
      <P>The case to which I refer is that of Anne Marie McDonagh, who is five years of age and who started school at Easter 1985.  On commencing school the school applied for a pass for Anne Marie McDonagh to Runnamoate national school.  Anne Marie McDonagh lives in an area deemed to be in the Castleplunkett national school catchment area as far as education for girls is concerned. This is because of the closure of an old monastery school which, when open, catered for boys and the boys in that area were deemed to be in the Runnamoate catchment area.  When the pass for Anne Marie McDonagh was applied for it was refused because she was deemed to be a member of a new family.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might point out that in September 1985 I discussed this matter with the <Col N="1707" /> Department.  They informed me that girls in that area &mdash; because they or their brothers were already in attendance at Runnamoate national school &mdash; were allowed fare-paying facilities.  I want to point out that Anne Marie McDonagh is the fifth member of a family, with four brothers, all of whom attended the Runnamoate national school.  If one of those boys had been a girl then Anne Marie would have qualified for transport.  That is how ridiculous the situation appears to be.</P>
    <P>I have raised this matter to impress on the Minister the importance of providing school transport for this child.  When that departmental decision was appealed it was pointed out that the child did not represent a member of a new family in that her four brothers had attended the school before her.  The Department stated that the reason she was refused transport was that she was the first girl in that family to go to that school and that, therefore, they were deemed to be a new family.  Naturally that decision was appealed on the grounds that this child wished to attend the school in her parish. I need not point out the importance of this to parents in rural areas, parents who wish to send their child to the school within the parish for First Holy Communion, Confirmation purposes and so on. The Minister will be well aware of the problems this can cause.  Her parent was informed that she could not get transport without receiving permission from the national school of the catchment area in which she was deemed to be.  I would point out to the Minister that the McDonagh family were the only family in that area asked to seek such permission.  I would point out to the Minister also that all of the children living in that area enjoy transport to Runnamoate national school with the exception of Anne Marie McDonagh.</P>
    <P>For the life of me, I cannot understand why this family are being victimised by the Department unless it is because of a threat of strike action by the principal in Castleplunkett national school.  Furthermore, I believe, if that is the case, that this is intimidation of the kind the <Col N="1708" /> Department of Education should not have any part in.  I do not believe the Department should allow one teacher to dictate whether or not one child should be afforded school transport.  Nor do I believe that they should allow one child to be victimised or one family penalised. That child must be taken to school four miles each day while the children living each side of her are given fare-paying facilities or, if they are boys, free transport.</P>
    <P>In 1985 the Minister of State's predecessor granted an additional school run in that area which eliminated all other transport problems and, God knows, there were many problems encountered in the Runnamoate catchment area.  Mrs. McDonagh, along with the other parents, met the Minister of State, Deputy Creed. As a result of that meeting an additional school run was granted which eliminated all the transport difficulties being encountered at that time, except in the case of the one family and the one child about whom I am speaking this evening.  I am satisfied that the only reason this child is being deprived of transport is because of her sex.  That is a terrible indictment of the Department of Education.  There are other matters I shall discuss with the Minister privately and which I believe should make this little girl eligible for school transport.  I appeal to the Minister to ensure that a bus ticket is issued to this child.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the late hour and I shall not detain the House any longer.  I appeal to the Minister to examine this case with a view to granting transport to the child concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Kenny)</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to thank Deputy Naughten for affording me an opportunity to reply to him on this matter.  I should say that it is not my intention, as Minister of State, to discriminate against any child in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before dealing specifically with the case of school transport for the pupil in question, I should like to outline briefly the main purpose of the primary school <Col N="1709" /> transport scheme and the general conditions applying to the provision of school transport.  The main purpose of the scheme is to enable children, who might otherwise suffer undue hardship in doing so, to make a regular attendance at school.  The scheme does not operate in order to afford a choice of school to children and it was never meant to do so. Therefore, except in cases of school amalgamations, eligibility for transport is determined by reference to a pupil's nearest open suitable school.</P>
    <P>As regards the general conditions applying to the provision of school transport, the terms of the primary school transport scheme state that, in order to be eligible for school transport, pupils under ten years of age must live at least two miles from their nearest school.  In the case of children over ten years of age, the distance criterion governing eligibility is three miles from their nearest school.</P>
    <P>It is pertinent to note that these age-distance conditions for eligibility accord with the provisions of the School Attendance Act under which parents' liability to prosecution under the Act for not sending their children to school is mitigated on grounds of accessibility.  Accessibility is defined in the Act as a school which is within two miles for children under ten years of age and within three miles for children over ten years.  As I have said, these are the age-distance conditions of eligibility obtaining in the primary school transport scheme.</P>
    <P>In the specific case raised by the Deputy, the pupil lives 3.2 miles from Castleplunkett national school, which is her nearest open suitable school.  Therefore, under the terms of the primary school transport scheme, the pupil is eligible for free school transport to Castleplunkett and there is a suitable transport service to that school.  I understand that the service comes to within a quarter of a mile of her home.  Therefore, if an application for school transport to Castleplunkett national school from September next is made on behalf of this pupil, arrangements will be made to facilitate <Col N="1710" /> her.  The pupil lives 4.2 miles from Runnamoate national school, which she attends, and transport is being sought on her behalf to that school.</P>
    <P>Under the terms of the primary school transport scheme, where spare seats are available on special school services after all pupils who are eligible for free transport have been accommodated, concessionary fare-paying facilities may be granted subject to certain specified conditions. One of these conditions is:</P>
    <P>Where transport is sought on behalf of basically eligible children to a school other than the nearest school or appropriate school of amalgamation, the granting of transport may be considered only if documentary evidence of the agreement of the authorities of the nearest school or of the school of amalgamation as appropriate is submitted to the Department of Education.</P>
    <P>It will be seen from this that in order to comply with the terms of the primary school transport scheme an application for concessionary fare-paying transport on behalf of the pupil in question to Runnamoate national school, which is not her nearest school, may be considered only if documentary evidence of the agreement of the nearest school, Castleplunkett national school, is submitted to my Department.  As this condition has not been complied with, the pupil is not eligible for transport to Runnamoate national school and I have no option but to refuse transport facilities to her to that school.</P>
    <P>Deputy Naughten has referred to a decision in October 1984 to provide school transport for the pupils of Runnamoate national school.  It appears that the Deputy may not be aware or does not recall that it was agreed at about that time that girls who were currently attending Runnamoate national school and who were in receipt of fare-paying transport would be allowed to retain this facility on an incidental basis, that is, where there are spare seats available after all pupils who are eligible for free transport have been accommodated.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1711" /> It was subsequently arranged that the younger sisters of girls who had attended Runnamoate national school would be granted incidental fare-paying transport also.  It was not purported that these arrangements would be extended to new pupils who did not have older sisters who were attending, or had attended, Runnamoate national school.  As the pupil in question here had not started school at that time &mdash; she started at Easter 1985 &mdash; and had no older sisters who attended Runnamoate, the arrangements did not and were not meant to apply to her.</P>
    <P>I realise and accept that the whole matter is complicated by the fact that boys from the area in which the pupil in question lives are eligible, under amalgamation arrangements, for transport to Runnamoate national school and that some girls, including neighbours of the pupil in question, who live nearer to Castleplunkett, are availing themselves of fare-paying transport facilities to Runnamoate. I will explain.</P>
    <P>Until 1971, the appropriate school for boys from the area in question was the High Lake Monastery School.  That school catered exclusively for boys. When it was closed in 1971, the pupils of the school were provided with free transport to Runnamoate, under the normal arrangements which operate in the case of a school which is closed and amalgamated with another.  Boys who live in the area of the High Lake school continue to get free transport to Runnamoate.</P>
    <P>Because of the availability of transport from the area to Runnamoate, some girls opted to attend Runnamoate and are availing themselves of school transport facilities.  The management authorities of their appropriate school, Castleplunkett, did not object to these arrangements until <Col N="1712" /> they found that because of a falling school enrolment, they were in danger of losing an assistant teaching post.  I accept the Deputy's reference to the principal teacher there.  I am sure there is anxiety about jobs in Castleplunkett.</P>
    <P>The Castleplunkett school authorities have written to the Department and have indicated that they would object to transport to Runnamoate national school being provided unconditionally for new pupils who live in the catchment area of their school.  Castleplunkett school is in danger of losing one of its three teaching posts if its enrolment falls much below its present level.  Such a situation would be hastened if transport continued to be provided to Runnamoate for pupils whose nearest appropriate school is Castleplunkett.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances, I think that the fears of the Castleplunkett school authorities are undoubtedly justified.  I hope the Deputy will appreciate, therefore, that under the terms of the school transport scheme and in all the circumstances, an application for transport to Runnamoate national school for the pupil in question may not be considered by my Department.</P>
    <P>Deputy Naughten referred to some other personal circumstances pertaining to this case which he does not wish to raise publicly here.  I assure the Deputy that I am quite prepared to discuss these matters in confidence with him.  Having dealt with many school transport schemes while on the back benches of this House, it would not be my wish in any way to discriminate against any child attending primary schools in Ireland.</P>

      <P>My Department has no plans to provide additional accommodation for the category of juvenile offender referred to by the Deputy.  The existing accommodation is considered adequate to meet the needs of such children referred by the courts.</P>
      <P>As regards preventative measures, four youth encounter projects &mdash; two in Dublin, one in Cork and one in Limerick &mdash; provide schooling and day care for some 100 young people who are at risk of getting into trouble with the law.  These centres provide positive liaison with the families of children who attend them.</P>

      <P>In accordance with the provisions of the Government's national plan, <i>Building on Reality, 1985-1987,</i> the value of the maintenance elements of grants was increased by 16 per cent for the academic year 1985-86. In addition, the income eligibility limits were increased by 11 per cent and a tapering of eligibility limits was introduced whereby partial payment of fees was provided for in that academic year. In accordance with the national plan, the increase in the maintenance elements to be made in 1986 is that which is warranted by reference to indexation.  The representations received from the Union of Students in Ireland seek an increase of 40 per cent and, in addition, compensation for inflation in the existing value of the maintenance grants.</P>
      <P>I am giving consideration to the request for a meeting from the Union of Students in Ireland and I shall be in touch with them on this issue.</P>

      <P>Presumably the Deputy is referring to the capital allocations for the local authority housing construction programme.  There has been no delay in notifying Waterford County Council of their capital allocation for the current year.</P>
      <P>Heretofore, local authorities were allocated housing capital in two stages, viz. the initial allocation, usually in April, to cover existing commitments on their programmes and some new work to start early in the year, and an additional allocation, usually in June, to cover new works expected to commence later in the year.</P>
      <P>This year local authorities were requested to furnish one claim covering their overall estimated capital requirements for 1986.  This revised procedure will enable me to notify local authorities of their overall capital allocation earlier in the year, thus leaving them better placed to plan their housing programmes for the year ahead.  I expect to be in a position shortly to notify all housing authorities of their capital allocation for 1986.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. J. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the taxpayer is in receipt of a retirement pension and a social welfare contributory old age pension both of which are chargeable to income tax.  As the social welfare pension is paid in full without deduction of tax, the tax attributable to it is normally fully collected by restricting the taxpayer's tax free allowances under PAYE.  For the year 1985-86 this restriction was incapable of producing under PAYE the full tax attributable to the social welfare pension (including additional amounts in respect of qualified dependants) and, consequently, it was necessary to make a direct assessment on an estimated basis on the taxpayer to enable the balance of the tax due to be collected.  When the details requested by the inspector in his letter of 9 April 1986 are supplied by the taxpayer the assessment will be amended to show the correct liability for 1985-86.</P>
      <P>An amended certificate of tax free allowances for 1986-87 to enable the maximum amount of the liability for the year to be collected under PAYE will be issued to the taxpayer as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1556" /> The inspector will then communicate with the taxpayer as to the manner in which the balance of his liabilities for 1986-87 and 1985-86 are to be discharged.</P>

Broadly it coincides with income as estimated in accordance with the Income Tax Acts. As proof of income, therefore, health boards require applicants to submit either a Form P60 from employed persons or a Revenue Commissioners' notice of assessment of statement of amended liability from the self-employed including farmers.</P>

      <P>It had been intended that the Vocational Education Act, 1930, would be amended to allow for, <i>inter alia</i>, statutory teacher representation on vocational education committees.  In November, 1985, my predecessor issued a discussion document on local education structures which would, of course, involve the vocational education committees.  In view of this development the proposed amendment to the 1930 Act was not proceeded with and the proposals outlined in the local education structures document provide for teacher representation on the local education councils recommended therein.  Discussions are taking place at present with the interested parties regarding the local education structures and, when these are <Col N="1566" /> finalised, I will consider my proposals for submission to the Government in the matter.</P>

      <P>The Government decisions on the new structures for post-primary courses were first announced in May 1985.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In October 1985 copies of a document <Col N="1567" /> outlining these decisions were issued to the authorities of all post-primary schools with a covering circular explaining how schools were to apply for the transition year and other programmes.  Schools were advised then that applications should reach the Department by February preceding the school year in which it is proposed to introduce the courses.  In respect of the courses proposed for the 1986-87 school year, however, applications were to be accepted up to 1 March 1986.  A further circular with more specific details and enclosing guidelines from the Curriculum and Examinations Board also issued to schools in January 1986 and this also contained a reminder of the closing date of 1 March 1986.</P>
    <P>Schools were asked to have their applications submitted by that date to allow time for the necessary processing within my Department and to enable a decision on their application to be communicated to each school sufficiently early to allow them to plan their programmes for the coming school year.  As the transition year option was originally introduced on a pilot basis in 1974 and is, therefore, an option which is not novel and unfamiliar to the authorities of post-primary schools, I am satisfied that the time allowed for making applications was adequate.</P>
