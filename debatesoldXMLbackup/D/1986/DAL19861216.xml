      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will outline the Government's plans for further areas of Dáil reform; when it is intended to commence Friday sittings to deal with Private Members' Bills; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. Barrett, Dún Laoghaire) Nuala Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. Barrett,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Dún Laoghaire</i>): The Government have already introduced a substantial number of Dáil reform measures, such as the new committee system; the new questions system; the new format for debating Estimates and new procedures for debating reports laid before the Oireachtas.  The Deputy will also be aware that the proceedings of the House are now being broadast by RTE.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of other reform measures are in the course of preparation at present.  These include a new system of explanatory and financial memoranda on Bills and a new system for Private Members' Bills.  The latter is at an advanced stage and I expect draft amendments to Standing Orders to be considered shortly <Col N="2796" /> by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.</P>
    <P>Other reform measures which I am examining at present include procedures to allow Deputies to raise matters of concern in the Dáil; a review of Standing Orders to see how they might be improved to streamline Dáil business and a general review of the committee system to see how it might be improved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister tell us if he proposes to circulate the draft amendments to Standing Orders to all Deputies so that all can be involved in the review procedure?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett (Dún Laoghaire) Mr. Barrett (Dún Laoghaire)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Dún Laoghaire</i>): The procedure is that amendments to Standing Orders are approved first by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and a motion is placed on the Order Paper for debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Just to bring reality into the proceedings, would the Minister tell us what is happening in regard to a significant aspect of Dáil reform, publication before the end of the year of the Book of Estimates?  Again to add reality to my question, would he inform us when the Book of Estimates will be published?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett (Dún Laoghaire) Mr. Barrett (Dún Laoghaire)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Dún Laoghaire</i>): The Book of Estimates is a matter for the Government.  It will be published when it is ready.  Amendments to procedure are circulated to us when they are ready. I hope we have learned quite a bit during the last four years in relation to the preparation of Estimates.  I cannot see why some new procedures cannot be devised by the incoming Dáil.  Personally, I consider the matter should be put before one of the committees.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister of State is aware that not all Deputies are represented on the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  In view of that, would it not be appropriate to circulate draft amendments to Standing Orders to those Deputies who are not members of the committee so that their views could <Col N="2797" /> be considered by the committee before the committee make decisions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett (Dún Laoghaire) Mr. Barrett (Dún Laoghaire)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Dún Laoghaire</i>): It would be impossible to have a Committee on Procedure and Privileges consisting of 116 members.  Membership at the moment represents all Members of the House and when amendments to Standing Orders are approved by the committee they come into the House for debate, and any Member is entitled to propose amendments or to vote against proposed amendments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister was wrong when he said the committee has representation from all parties in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett (Dún Laoghaire) Mr. Barrett (Dún Laoghaire)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Dún Laoghaire</i>): I did not say that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The committee have members of Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil and Labour.  Would the Minister not accept that it would be at least a courtesy to inform those Members who are not on the committee about changes proposed so that they could let the committee have their views on them before a decision is made on amendments to Standing Orders?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett (Dún Laoghaire) Mr. Barrett (Dún Laoghaire)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Dún Laoghaire</i>): I said it would be impossible to have a committee consisting of 116 members.  Those members represent, in the views and considerations they put before the committee, all the Members of this House, irrespective of political party.  When the committee want to make recommendations to the House they do so by putting a motion before the House.  Any Member can then come in and debate, amend or seek to amend the proposals of the committee.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PearseWyse" hpid="Mr. Wyse Mr. Wyse">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he considers that applicants for medical cards should be assessed on net take-home pay rather than assessed on <Col N="2798" /> their gross income; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond) Barry Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the provision of the Health Act, 1970, medical cards are issued to persons who are unable without undue hardship to arrange general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants.</P>
      <P>It is a matter for the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board to determine eligibility in individual cases. To assist this process and to ensure uniformity of decisions in different health board areas, income guidelines have been adopted.  These guidelines are based on gross income.  If guidelines were based on net income without any expansion of eligibility, it would be necessary to reduce the guidelines.  This would tend to favour persons with larger incomes.</P>
      <P>If the current guidelines were applied on the basis of net income, a considerable expansion of eligibility would result.  This would cost in the order of £15-£16 million.  In any event, I find it difficult to understand the purpose of the Deputy's question since his party's manifesto proposes to cut health expenditure by no less than £68 million including the imposition of prescription changes on the very medical card holders the Deputy refers to in his question.</P>
      <P>In addition, the resultant increase on the numbers covered by medical cards might make it necessary to re-negotiate the fees payable under the scheme and this would also add considerably to the extra cost involved.  I do not therefore, consider that applicants for medical cards should be assessed on net take-home pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PearseWyse" hpid="Mr. Wyse Mr. Wyse">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to assure the Minister that we are a party with a human approach to such matters.  I suggest that the Minister read our policy document&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>A question, Deputy, please.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PearseWyse" hpid="Mr. Wyse Mr. Wyse">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the appalling hardship existing in homes today, <Col N="2799" /> especially on those who are unemployed, would the Minister consider removing the gross income stipulation in the eligibility guidelines and allowing community welfare officers some discretionary powers in making assessments?  I am not advocating additional costs on the health boards.  What I am seeking are more discretionary powers for community welfare officers which can be done only by the removal of the gross income stipulation. Would the Minister accept that and give such powers to community welfare officers who are fully aware of the position obtaining in homes today?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case of individual applications where particular hardship arises, where people might exceed the gross income guidelines, a chief executive officer and a programme manager delegated by him have power to issue medical cards in such exceptional circumstances.  However, we must retain the general guidelines which are uniform and which assist people's eligibility throughout the country.  I might point out to the Deputy that his own party proposals in relation to medical card holders &mdash; that for every prescription issued they would have to pay 50 pence &mdash; would result in a cut of approximately £5 million in payments by medical card holders and another £4 million on drugs.  I think the Deputy should go back to his party and tell them they cannot have it both ways.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">

    <Speaker pid="PearseWyse" hpid="Mr. Wyse Mr. Wyse">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that is an answer to my question &mdash; a Minister making certain statements without reading policy documents on matters such as health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>We cannot discuss policy documents here.  There will be an adequate opportunity some time in a more suitable place for that sort of thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PearseWyse" hpid="Mr. Wyse Mr. Wyse">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware the Minister will <Col N="2800" /> have every opportunity of producing his own policy document when the time comes.  I am asking the Minister &mdash; for heaven's sake let us leave politics out of this for the moment &mdash; would he agree to delete the words &ldquo;gross income&rdquo; from the appropriate guidelines and give more discretionary power to community welfare officers who are the most appropriate people to carry out such assessments?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I will make the point to the Deputy that he is much longer in the House than I have been.  Since 1970 community welfare officers have not issued medical cards.  They are issued by chief executive officers, by programme managers and delegated officers.  CWOs have no such function, never had and are unlikely to have.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PearseWyse" hpid="Mr. Wyse Mr. Wyse">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>This is misleading because community welfare officers make the assessment and the Minister knows that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister did say that the chief executive officer was responsible for deciding the guidelines for medical cards.  Will he say why an official of his Department wrote on his behalf to the health boards telling them they were to apply the guidelines rigidly?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>They have been asked to make sure that people who are not eligible do not get medical cards.  It is quite interesting that in some areas we can carry out a sudden review and on one such occasion in one county the number of persons eligible dropped from 65 per cent to 58 per cent, all within the guidelines.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he will initiate a policy of preventive education at all levels of society, which is the most important strategy in tackling drug abuse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The Special Governmental Task Force on Drug Abuse recognised the importance of initiating a policy of preventive education at all levels of society as an important strategy in tackling drug abuse.</P>
      <P>In pursuance of the task force's recommendations in this area, the Health Education Bureau and the Department of Education have co-operated closely in the production of materials for use in schools and in the organisation of appropriate workshops and seminars for teachers. Also, the bureau have been continuing their training programme for teachers in health education, including drug education, and about 1,600 teachers have been through this programme to date.  Both organisations are currently involved in producing additional materials for schools.</P>
      <P>In the context of youth clubs and related activities, the Health Education Bureau have also produced a resource pack on substance abuse in conjunction with the National Youth Council of Ireland.  The pack has already been distributed, mostly through training courses for youth leaders.  This drug education training programme is available to all youth groups through the National Youth Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As well as co-operating with the Department of Education in teacher training and materials and programme development, the bureau have also designed programmes aimed specifically at heightening public awareness of the real and immediate dangers of drug abuse.  The bureau have been involved with health boards and other agencies in <Col N="2802" /> training doctors, pharmacists and teachers as drug educators.</P>
    <P>I should also mention that the Council of Europe's European Health Committee is sponsoring a pilot project in the Dún Laoghaire area which involves detailed education at a number of different levels &mdash; at school level, at the level of parents and within the community. This project is being co-ordinated by a psychologist from the Department of Education.</P>
    <P>Additionally, my Department have continued to fund the Diploma Course in Addiction Studies in Trinity College which started in 1983.  This course provides specialised training for workers in direct contact with drug abusers and their families.  Such workers include social workers, nurses, gardaí and teachers.</P>
    <P>I think the Deputy will agree that all of these activities, which are being closely co-ordinated by the Health Education Bureau and the Department of Education, constitute an effective and comprehensive policy of preventive education at all levels of society.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied with the success of the preventive education programme to date relating to drug abuse?  If he is not, will he step up that programme somewhat, at least affording it the same order of priority as is now proposed to highlight the AIDS problem?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact that there are now 1,600 teachers having undergone the course, that many hundreds of youth groups have participated in the preventive education course and the fact that young gardaí coming out have basic skills in detection and an awareness of the position, all of that, together with the work we are doing in the hospitals in ensuring that drugs are kept under much more careful custody and security, has helped greatly.  I think the diploma course has produced approximately 40 persons who have participated in a full course and they are making a considerable impact on the community.  However, I agree with the Deputy that a lot more has to be done.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister not concerned at the high level of crime and particularly the high level of infectious disease, including in Mountjoy the problem of infectious disease arising from the abuse of drugs?  What further steps is he prepared to take to ensure that the campaign against drug abuse is effective?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly, there is a serious problem of hepatitis among drug abusers and as the Deputy has said, there are a number, in Mountjoy.  I am extremely anxious to have such prisoners &mdash; and indeed women prisoners who have infection as well &mdash; separated, treated on a separate basis and rehabilitated during the period of their custody for their return to society.  In that regard I have endeavoured to do a considerable amount of work, including the prospect of using the premises in Dundrum, but, as the Deputy knows, there is very perverse opposition around in relation to much of the work we are trying to do.  Slowly but surely we are overcoming that and bringing in a better mode of treatment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonalOrmonde" hpid="Dr. Ormonde Dr. Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if it is proposed to implement the recommendations in the report <i>Communications Networks and the Elderly</i>; and if so, when.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>It is Government policy to ensure that, as far as possible, the elderly can remain in their own homes and communities and not enter institutional care unnecessarily.  I am interested in the potential of new technology-alarm systems as a means of helping vulnerable elderly persons to maintain their independence in their own homes.  The provision of an alarm system is one of many options open to the health boards in the development of community health services for the elderly.  However, I do not see the health services as having the sole responsibility for the provision of alarms but my Department are willing to co-operate with agencies both public and voluntary in the introduction of <Col N="2804" /> alarm systems which will promote the welfare of the elderly.</P>
      <P>The report made a number of recommendations, particularly in relation to co-operation between Government Departments and my Department are taking up these issues with other Government Departments.  I am keen that the report's recommendations on the establishment of a pilot scheme be implemented and I have allocated money to the Eastern Health Board to assist the South (Dublin) Inner City Group with the introduction of an alarm system for elderly persons in the centre of Dublin.  I am also exploring the possibility in co-operation with the Northern Ireland authorities, of initiating a scheme in the Border areas to protect vulnerable elderly persons living in remote places.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The south Dublin inner city scheme is well under way.  It is currently semi-operational and is proving effective.  That is my awareness of it as of two months ago.  We are in contact with my counterpart in Northern Ireland and we have put up proposals for using on a joint Border basis moneys we hope to receive from the international fund and to do so in co-operation with the two health boards straddling the border area, particularly the Northern Eastern Health Board area where an excellent ambulance alarm system or communications system is in existence at the moment and we want to double that across Counties Louth, Cavan, Monaghan and up into Leitrim.</P>

I assure the Deputy that we are very anxious to work in close co-operation with the North Eastern Health Board, and discussions are taking place at the moment in that regard.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">

      <P>Yes.  We have a very experienced assistant secretary who is our permanent representative and correspondent with the Pompidou Group and we have also a number of other officers, including our professional staff at pharmacist level.  In the GMS where we have a fair degree of experience of the irresponsible prescribing of drugs our staff have gained considerable experience in that area.  I assure the Deputy that we are keeping in very close touch with the problem although, as he is aware, the number of staff in the Department is small and they are stretched across a wide range of activities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health the proposals he has for the improvement and development of the district hospitals in County Clare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have any proposals from the Mid-Western Health Board at present for further developments at the district hospitals in County <Col N="2807" /> Clare.  However, as the Deputy is probably aware, a considerable amount of work has been carried out at these three hospitals in the last few years.  For example: at Ennistymon district hospital upgrading of the toilets and bathrooms and also rewiring and fire precaution works have been carried out; at Raheen district hospital the ground floor has been extended with the result that all the patients are now accommodated at this level and at Kilrush district hospital major rewiring and fire precaution works have been completed while surplus accommodation was used to provide a day psychiatric unit which opened earlier this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that there are proposals for a day centre at Ennistymon hospital?  Are his Department aware that a schedule of accommodation has been drawn up and that his Department, together with the health board and the hospital authorities, should have come to some agreement by now?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the board at present are drawing up plans for the development of a day hospital at Ennistymon and that these will be submitted to the Department in due course. I have not got them at the moment.  A local voluntary group have promised to make a contribution towards the cost of this project.  That is the position regarding Ennistymon, and I would be glad to hear from the health board about their immediate plans in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will be aware that there is a necessity in Kilrush in particular for some acute hospital accommodation. Has any attention been paid to that area in the plans which have been put forward by the health board for the Kilrush district hospital?  The Minister will be aware that an application for a lift in the hospital was made quite some time ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that the health board are examining proposals for the provision of a lift in Kilrush hospital <Col N="2808" /> costing about £30,000.  I gather that the monitoring group in the area may be in a position to provide some funds in connection with this development.  I would be glad to hear from them also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the activities of many voluntary groups, is the Minister aware that the imposition of VAT on hospital equipment and facilities which have been provided by voluntary groups is hampering the activities of many of those voluntary groups?  Can he take any action to deal with that?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>My friend, the Minister for Finance, expects to make an announcement about that in a week or two.  We are, accordingly, finalising arrangements relating to the purchase of equipment by voluntary groups.  It would be a VAT refund system.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he will make a statement on the recent report by the Committee of Public Expenditure on the proposed new dental hospital for Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The Dublin Dental Hospital is primarily an educational institution and comes within the ambit of the Minister for Education.  The proposed new Dublin Dental Hospital to be constructed at the St. James's Hospital site will be funded entirely by the Department of Education so that the criticisms, comments and recommendations in the recent report of the Dáil Committee on Public Expenditure in relation to the new hospital project are largely directed towards that Department rather than towards the Department of Health.  In regard to those matters in which my Department does have an involvement I would comment as follows.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since my Department share in the day to day running costs of the Dublin Dental Hospital I agree that there should be an <Col N="2809" /> adequate recovery of fees from ineligible patients who receive treatment in the hospital.  There has, in fact, been a considerable improvement recently in the level of collection of fees from ineligible patients.  With regard to the employment of dental auxiliaries, the Dental Council are already carrying out a study on the lines recommended by the committee. The question of whether and how dental auxiliaries might be employed will depend in the first instance on the recommendations of the Dental Council, following the completion of their survey.</P>
    <P>With regard to the new offices to be provided for the Eastern Health Board, the new accommodation did not arise because of the dental hospital project and would have had to be provided in any case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister, as the Minister responsible for dental health, inform the House if any manpower survey had been carried out by his Department prior to the decision to go ahead with the Dublin Dental Hospital? If such a survey was carried out, will the Minister inform the House as to the number of dentists deemed to be required by the Department for a year, to service the population?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a long established public education policy decision that the country should have two dental hospitals, one in Cork and one in Dublin. I do not propose to change that policy decision.  The Higher Education Authority gave authority to the Cork Dental Hospital to train 25 students per annum. At the moment Cork are training 30. There has been a lot of pressure on this issue from some people, not necessarily the Deputy, with an inverted sense of parochialism.  The Cork Dental Hospital are training 35 students which is 10 in excess of their approved number and Dublin are training 35 although the HEA gave them authority to train 40.  The report of the Committee on Public Expenditure is quite erroneous and signally ill-drafted and the very special pleading in it does not stand up.  The Cork <Col N="2810" /> Dental School may be assured of the continuity of its existence but it will not succeed in cornering all dental training and the Dublin school will be established. The Deputy should see the Dublin Dental Hospital with its appalling facilities.  The site works at St. James's are now going ahead and the Dublin Dental Hospital will go ahead.  I strongly support the Minister for Education in that regard.  If I speak strongly about this it is because the pressures on this matter have been incessant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I will allow a short question from Deputy Dowling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister say at what stage is the development of the Dublin site and when will it be completed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The site works contract for the Dublin Dental Hospital has been awarded by the Department of Education and work has commenced on that site.  The planning of the hospital has not yet been completed, but the site works have started.  It has not yet gone to tender but hopefully it will go to tender.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>It is clear from the Minister's original reply that a dental manpower survey was not done before the decision was made to spend £17.5 million on a new dental hospital.  I do not deny that Dublin needs a dental hospital.  Is the Minister criticising Cork for over-producing dentists when we are attempting to be more efficient and is he supporting Dublin in under-producing dentists?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That is argument.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that in view of the evidence in relation to dental health, with the fluoridation programme and fluoride toothpastes, there has been a closure of dental schools throughout Europe because of improved dental health?  Surely he will agree that two dental hospitals, one in Cork and <Col N="2811" /> one in Dublin, each producing 25 dentists would be adequate?  In other words, the Dublin hospital could be built on a reduced scale costing about £4 million and the money saved could go into dental care.  The Minister should know that the dental care programme in the health boards is at crisis point because of lack of finance.  Surely that would be a more sensible decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy had asked those from my Department, the chief dental officer and the deputy chief dental officer, who gave evidence, he would have been assured that the figure of £17.5 million is rubbish, and that the £17.5 million is a Department of Education expense for a clinical science complex for the whole of St. James's Hospital.  In that complex there is a new dental hospital.  Unfortunately, the word has gone out apparently all over Cork that Dublin is getting a £17.5 million dental hospital.  This is not true.  I assure the Deputy that the Cork school, provided it trains 25 students per annum, will continue.  I gather that in Cork they are now looking for additional staff from the HEA because there are 35 students and I hope the HEA will not be so foolish as to sanction those staff.  The profession engaged in internecine warfare in relation to this matter and made very special pleadings to Deputies in this House, particularly those from Cork.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>That is unfair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Deputies will resist the pressures, because we need 25 dentists trained in Cork and about 46 trained in Dublin.  That will be quite adequate for the number of dentists needed, and we may do well with less&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he is concerned at the number of persons admitted to psychiatric hospitals for the treatment of abuse of alcohol; and the plans he has for a programme of prevention of such abuse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very concerned about this problem.  Every year about 7,200 admissions or one-quarter of all admissions to psychiatric hospitals and units are due to alcohol-related problems. The prevention of alcohol abuse is a complex task.  The Health Education Bureau will continue to carry out programmes designed to alert and educate people about the hazards of alcohol abuse.  However, I am sure the Deputy realises that prevention has implications well beyond the health sector.  It includes measures such as: higher taxation of alcohol; stricter enforcement of the laws against drunken driving and under age drinking; restrictions on drink advertising; restrictions on availability of alcohol.</P>
      <P>The prevention of alcohol abuse, therefore, requires a broad approach by a number of Government Departments and will not be achieved by a health view only.  The consultation document on health policy issued by my Department and the forthcoming report on health promotion to be issued by the Health Education Bureau will expand on this theme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>While I agree with what the Minister says, in that there are a number of areas and Departments involved can he tell us whether his Department or the Government have any positive action programme in mind in view of the particular problems associated with the abuse of alcohol and particularly in view of the number of young people now being admitted to psychiatric hospitals?  While we are all aware of what needs to be done have the Minister's <Col N="2813" /> Department or the Government any comprehensive positive action programme in mind?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>In the immediate future, legislation will be published in relation to the licensing laws generally which will specifically deal with underage drinking and the revision of penalties. I am free to say that there was a Government decision on that matter this morning. The Deputy will be aware very shortly of the legislation.  We have to ask for particular restraint on the question of advertising.  In this country there is enormous glamorisation of the use of alcohol.  Several thousand young people under the age of 25 are being admitted to our psychiatric hospitals suffering from alcoholism.  It is an increasing problem.</P>
      <P>We also have the problem of a growing drink culture whereby millions of pounds are being spent in public houses which are being turned into very glamorised areas of drink consumption.  Maybe it is because I am growing old but the number of young people who seem to live in them seems to be of enormous proportions.  I have no doubt that the drink driving laws are being enforced.  Equally, we have the problem of the price of drink.  The price of drink during the past four to five years has not risen very much.  I share the concern of the Deputy.  Basically, we have to come back to more effective health education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister considered a campaign similar to the vigorous campaign which was mounted against the use of tobacco?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have no hesitation in prohibiting the advertising on a <Col N="2814" /> public basis of drink, including television in particular, but as the Deputy knows the howls of execration which would greet that enforcement would be a problem. In a few days I will be publishing the tobacco protection legislation which will relate to the consumption of tobacco in public places.  Again, we have a very serious problem in that there are double standards operating in this area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he has any plans to provide improved facilities and additional medical equipment at the general hospital, Ennis, County Clare; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that a number of significant improvements to facilities have taken place at Ennis General Hospital in recent years.  A new radiology unit was completed and equipped in 1984; a 30-bed maternity unit, serving County Clare, was opened at the St. John of God Hospital, Cahercalla in November 1985; a scheme involving renovation of the operating theatres and provision of a recovery room was completed earlier this year; and extensive fire precaution works have recently been carried out as specified by the local fire officer.</P>
      <P>I am confident that the substantial improvements to facilities which have been completed will enable the hospital staff to continue to provide a satisfactory level of treatment for patients from County Clare.</P>
      <P>A blueprint for the further development of Ennis General Hospital has already been drawn up by a project team representative of my Department and the health board.  This provides a guide for future developments at this hospital as resources permit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will be aware that in spite of the work which has been carried out in the General Hospital there are still widespread complaints about the poor facilities, the overcrowding and the general condition of the building which was designed 40 to 50 years ago to cater for 40 patients.  There are three to four times that number of patients in the hospital at present.  Can the Minister tell us whether the blueprint and the work which has been carried out are part of an overall development scheme for the hospital and whether it is proposed to undertake any additional works during the coming year?</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, considerable sums of money have been spent in the hospital.  The Deputy has referred to a degree of overcrowding but as he is aware there is a difficulty in the medical department particularly in the discharging of elderly patients who for social reasons are kept longer than usual in the hospital.  It is hoped that some of the beds in the larger geriatric hospital of St. Joseph's which has 300 beds and in the three District Hospitals which we referred to earlier on, Kilrush, Ennistymon and Raheen, which have a total of 112 beds could be made available as short stay beds for elderly patients. Discussions on this matter are ongoing with the health board at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Minister has given us a summary of the improvements: approximately £500,000 has been spent in the last two years on updating the theatre, the laboratory and the X-ray unit, but Deputy Daly's question is about existing accommodation.  The provision of toilets and bathrooms are an immediate requirement.  Can the Minister tell us whether the health board have any proposals for the improvement of toilet and bathroom facilities, which would greatly alleviate the distress caused when there is ward overcrowding?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I will certainly look into that matter.  Such a basic facility within any hospital is a matter of concern for us and a number of our older hospitals are in need of upgrading.  The major issue concerned the surgical wards which needed immediate upgrading.  That has been done, as has the upgrading of the theatre facilities.  There are 127 beds in the hospital, 300 beds in St. Joseph's and 112 beds in the district hospitals.  That is the number of beds in County Clare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will be aware that part of the development plan for the hospitals is the provision of additional beds.  Will funds be made available for the provision of additional medical beds, in particular, in the General Hospital and will he provide on-going finance to enable <Col N="2821" /> the plan which has been drawn up to be undertaken?  I appreciate that resources are limited but can the Minister give any undertaking that on-going financial provision will be made to deal with this most unsatisfactory situation in the General Hospital in Ennis?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the physical improvement of the hospital, every effort will be made on our part to provide additional capital moneys.  The recent improvements were expensive.  The surgical and theatre facilities cost about £85,000 and the fire precaution works cost £65,000.  The board have requested a grant in respect of those latter works. We have a proposal from the board to provide an additional 15 beds, but this has not generally been considered to be the best solution.  I will certainly review the situation again.  It is a well-funded, well-budgeted hospital.  The budget for this year is not far off £4 million.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he is aware of a report recently prepared on behalf of the National Council for the Aged which found that many homes for the aged were in breach of regulations laid down by his Department; if he has any plans to increase supervision of the operation of these homes and ensure proper compliance with the regulations; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <P>The research programme used in the preparation of this report included a fieldwork study of 24 homes which commenced in March 1985 and was completed by May 1985.  The new regulations &ldquo;The Homes For Incapacitated Persons Regulations, 1985&rdquo; did not come into force until the first day of October 1985.  These regulations provide for stricter standards of care, supervision and operation together with frequent monitoring of these homes by the health boards.</P>

      <P>Has the Minister <Col N="2822" /> any indication of how effective these new regulations are in upgrading standards in these homes?

      <P>I would agree that a formal, statutory registration system in relation to these homes is needed, but the immediate issue that arose was the general level of standards of care, such as having a qualified nurse in the home, supervision and operation.  I am in favour of registration of those homes but that can only be done if there is a statutory registration system for all such institutions, including private hospitals, public voluntary hospitals and health board hospitals.  At the moment anybody can open any kind of a home or hospital provided they meet planning regulations. The only hospitals that cannot be opened are those dealing with maternity and psychiatric cases but there is open season for anything else.  I agree we should have registration and in the proposals I have made to the Government for the reorganisation of the health services I have included the registration of hospitals and nursing homes for the Government's consideration.</P>

      <P>It was the best part of 20 years or more since previous regulations had been brought in.  We had to bring in regulations which would not result in a general closure of nursing homes and provide a reasonable opportunity to those homes covered by the 1964 regulations to upgrade their facilities.  In fairness, the general standards of a large number of nursing homes have improved considerably in the past two or three <Col N="2823" /> years with the impact of those regulations. They have been in operation since September 1985 and I would hope they would be reviewed again in mid-1987, tightened further and made stronger, without having to force the closure of a number of homes who are on the margin.</P>

      <P>Are the health boards, particularly in the Dublin area, aware of all the homes for the elderly so that they can check to see if the regulations are being enforced?  Is it possible there are a number of homes for the elderly of which the health boards are not aware because they do not have to register?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>By and large the health boards have a full register of persons who keep such homes.  The regulations about the supervision of those homes are quite specific.  One must have a qualified medical practitioner attached to a particular home and a general nurse supervising the home.  The fire regulations are certainly being enforced with very considerable rigour and the health inspectors keep in close contact with regard to the consumption of food on those premises.  The Eastern Health Board have a much greater awareness of the role of such homes.  At the same time, I am very anxious to expand the general geriatric public bed numbers because many such nursing homes are beyond the means of many people, even with a limited health board subvention.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13 and 19 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2824" /> It is the intention that the negotiations for the review of the common contract will be conducted by management with the Irish Medical Organisation as soon as possible.  To this effect the Local Government Staff Negotiations Board has written to the Irish Medical Organisation seeking such a review.  The initial response of that organisation was that it was not prepared to undertake a review of the common contract until such time as certain difficulties which arose in the application of the common contract to two individual cases were resolved.  While every effort is being made to resolve these two cases, I cannot accept that this would constitute sufficient grounds for holding up the negotiations.  In any event section 10 of the Interim Report of the Working Party on a Common Contract states that &ldquo;the contract should be the subject of a complete general review within a period of five years&rdquo;.  That period has now expired.</P>
    <P>A response from the Irish Medical Organisation to a further recent letter from the Local Government Staff Negotiations Board is awaited.  I can assure the Deputy that it is a matter of concern to me that the review has not already commenced.  In a recent meeting with the Irish Medical Organisation I highlighted the importance attached by me to this matter and I intend to return to it in future meetings with the organisation in the near future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that the reason for the association's resistance to any renegotiation of the contract, even though it is up for review, is that the present contract offers them a blank cheque whereby some of their members, on top of their annual salary of £32,000, are earning treble that in private practice, utilising publicly funded equipment and staff?  Would the Minister agree that it is a major scandal that such a haemorrhage should be taking place from the health services at a time when there are serious cutbacks?  If the association do not immediately enter into negotiations, would the Minister assure the <Col N="2825" /> House that this type of serious abuse of the present contract will be stopped immediately?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I would share the Deputy's view that the common contract should never have been drafted or negotiated in the manner it was and that the management should never have signed it with the representatives of the then medical organisations in the manner in which it was signed and agreed. However, that is past history and it is a very salutary lesson.  We are now trying to redress this and to bring in a common contract which would reflect mutual responsibilities and mutual regard for public moneys.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The plans for transfer of services from St. Laurence's and Jervis Street Hospitals provide for certain outpatient clinics to open next month and for a phased relocation of the remaining outpatient and in-patient facilities during 1987.  It is not envisaged that the casualty units at the two hospitals will be transferred <Col N="2826" /> and amalgamated at Beaumont until the inpatient facilities are operational.</P>
      <P>Additional revenue costs will arise from the opening of the casualty unit at Beaumont.  I have no doubt, however, that it will be capable of providing an improved service to patients.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the consultants and the administrator of Jervis Street Hospital have expressed concern at the Minister's plan to open the outpatient's department, that it is not in the best interests of the patients?  I am sure the Minister is aware that patients will have to travel to Beaumont Hospital and then into the centre of the city, to Jervis Street or St. Laurence's Hospital for X-rays and pathology? There will need to be a duplication of charts, or else charts will have to be transported, with the danger of loss.  Would the Minister not accept that the best way to proceed on the opening of Beaumont Hospital would be to open the whole hospital as one major general teaching hospital for the north side of the city?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that when the outpatient's clinics come into operation next month there will be quite a substantial number of consultants working in the hospital on an outpatient basis.  I can also assure the Deputy that those consultants would not go to Beaumont Hospital if they thought that their patients, or any other patients, would be at risk.  We intend to have an X-ray and, indeed, a pathology back-up available in the hospital at that time.  The fears expressed for different reasons by some consultants who are attached to Jervis Street Hospital are not shared by the Royal College of Surgeons, by the medical officers of the Department of Health, by the Beaumont Hospital Board, which has a substantial medical presence on it, or by the board of the Richmond Hospital which equally has a substantial medical presence on it.  I think we can move in this manner.  In the case of many a hospital, that is the kind of phase opening structure which is done.  I <Col N="2827" /> am quite sure those consultants would not wish me to say that because they have private practices in Merrion Square, and might be giving lectures simultaneously in the Royal College of Surgeons, the patients for whom they are caring are at risk.  They would be at no greater risk in those circumstances than they would be while the consultants would be working in the outpatient's clinics at Beaumont.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if the figure of £12 million deficit announced by him during the debate on the supplementary Estimate is the projected deficit figure for 1 January 1987; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The £12 million deficit referred to by the Deputy is, in fact, the combined bank overdraft level of all health boards on Thursday, 27 November 1986.  As explained previously, the Department of Health are reviewing individual board's needs on a weekly basis and have met their requirements through a mix of cash and overdraft cover.  The level of overdraft reached on 27 November 1986 represented only 1.6 per cent of the health boards' combined approved expenditure of £742 million, excluding the 25th round and special pay awards.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>On 1 January the new allocations will come into operation. It is customary around that period that deficits drop sharply.  The question of the transfer of balances comes into operation at that time of the year also.  I would say that the deficit will go higher than £12 million, but we should bear in mind that one is talking about £12 million and a figure going up to the best part of £20 million throughout the month of <Col N="2828" /> December.  That would be for a very short period of two or three weeks, or perhaps one week.  One is talking about a total expenditure of £750 million and this is only 1 per cent up or down.  As the Deputy well knows, a health board has an authorised level of overdrafting accommodation.  The deficit may take up only one-third or a half, but at some time it may take up the whole accommodation. As of 27 November last, it was £12 million.  I expect that it would grow and then taper off as we come into next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that each CEO has told the boards that the combined deficit will be approximately £30 million this year?  Would he not consider it misleading to select one day, 27 November, and tell us that because it was £12 million on that day, anybody who said that it would be £30 million, to use his own words, was working himself into a frenzy and that the Minister's statement had put that kind of political flurry into a correct perspective? Now the Minister accepts that it will be higher than £12 million and the CEOs and the health boards say it will be as high as £30 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>It varies.  Even in December the total has varied from £12 million up to £18 million or £19 million and back down again.  For example, on Tuesday, 2 December, the total was £12.9 million, while on 27 November it was £12 million.  There is a very sharp difference between the authorised approved overdraft, which is up to £30 million for the health boards, and the actual take up.  We shall not know the position until another fortnight has gone by.  However, the health boards, between them, have authorised overdraft accommodation of about £35 million.  So far they have taken up figures varying between £12 million and £15 million and back down to £12 million.  I should think it will be higher by the year end.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad to <Col N="2830" /> have this opportunity of publicly recording my appreciation of the very important contribution which the Voluntary Health Insurance Board, and their staff, have made to the excellent standards of health care which we enjoy in Ireland.</P>
      <P>I have referred many times to the clear need for a change in emphasis in our demands and expectations of the health services.  This applies just as much to VHI schemes as to the public health services. Indeed, as I have recently informed the House, I am very anxious to encourage the development of the VHI's primary care coverage so as to influence patients to make greater use, in appropriate circumstances, of primary care rather than hospital treatment.  I have commissioned consultants to examine voluntary insurance schemes in other countries and to assess their suitability for adaptation to meet our requirements.  The consultants will also provide an analysis of how suitable models would operate under Irish conditions.  The VHI are co-operating fully in this exercise.</P>
      <P>The consultants' report is expected before the end of this year.  I hope that this will result in the early introduction by the VHI of a comprehensive general practitioner and out-patient scheme. Such a scheme would be warmly welcomed and subscribed to by the general population.</P>
      <P>As I have already indicated to the House, the VHI will also have to turn their attention to a radical reappraisal of their existing in-patient schemes.  This reappraisal will have to be radical if we are to achieve our long term objectives.</P>
      <P>I have already obtained Government approval to an amendment of the VHI Act 1957.  The drafting of that legislation is already in train and present indications are that I will be in a position to introduce it early in the new year.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Dukes) Alan Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Dukes)</NameTxt>
      <P>So as to put this matter in perspective I think I should go back to the High Court decision of March last &mdash; the <i>State (Clarke) v. Senezio</i>.  In layman's language what the High Court decided was that the issue of summonses by computer was invalid in so far as the court clerk issuing the summonses did not personally receive the complaint on which the summons is based and that he did not personally consider the justification for the issue of a summons. Two things happened at once.  The first was to appeal the decision.  The other was to change the procedure for computerised summonses so that from then onwards the two requirements of the judgment were met.  That happened on <Col N="2832" /> the very afternoon that the judgment was handed down.</P>
      <P>The judgment of the Supreme Court on the appeal was delivered last Friday. Apart from confirming the specific decision of the High Court, the Supreme Court raised a completely new issue, namely, whether the court clerk could issue a summons at all against the background of the provisions in section 10 of the Petty Sessions (Ireland) Act, 1851. The court offered the view that he could not and that the statutory law would need to be changed so as to allow him to do so.  I may add that this view was <i>obiter</i> but, naturally, it carries considerable importance and clearly must be acted upon as soon as possible.  The view was also expressed that if the statute law was changed in this way the question of a constitutional challenge would not arise. The Supreme Court judgment clearly calls for an urgent review of the law relating to the issue of summonses.  That review commenced immediately on receipt of the judgment and the Government have now approved in principle a short Bill which I intend, subject to the agreement of the Whips, to initiate this week.  The purpose of the Bill is to amend the law in such a way as will allow the service of summonses in the District Court as an administrative arrangement as suggested by the Supreme Court. Deputies will appreciate that it would not be appropriate to discuss the provisions in any further detail since the text will be circulated in the next day or two.  Should this Bill be introduced as planned the House will have an opportunity to debate the issue in full.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to what I might call the logistics of the question, it is not possible to provide the kind of statistical information sought in the question in the time available and to provide it at all would, it seems to me, require the diversion of such staff resources as would be counter productive. Suffice it to say that I accept, as do the Government, that the effects of the Supreme Court judgment &mdash; and here I distinguish it from the related High Court judgment &mdash; would give rise to <Col N="2833" /> serious problems in relation to the striking out of cases by district justices on foot of summonses issued by computer, unless the law were changed as soon as possible. In the alternative, serious difficulties and waste of resources could arise if methods &mdash; other than legislation &mdash; were to be sought to overcome the implications of that judgment.  It is for that reason that we will be asking the Houses of the Oireachtas to pass the urgent legislation.</P>
    <P>Finally, also so as to get matters into perspective, I should point out that substantially the problem arises only in Dublin city and county.  In that area there is a total of approximately 115,000 summonses issued for hearing on various dates up to April, 1987.  Of these, 75,000 are in respect of parking offences.</P>

We are already rushing through an extradition Bill and we have just rushed through the Single European Act.  Do this Government not plan ahead or do they not have any administrative machinery?  Do they not plan such things in advance rather than rushing them through the House?</P>
      <P>Last Friday I made a statement and highlighted this problem following the Supreme Court judgment.  I said that the administration of the drink and driving laws was thrown into chaos in Dublin and I called on the Minister for Justice to take immediate action to restore the proper and effective administration of the law, particularly in relation to drunk driving cases, and many other cases as well.</P>

Of course, as I pointed out yesterday at lunchtime during a radio interview, I regret that Deputy Woods did not see fit to treat us all to the benefit of his considerable erudition in these matters last March when the High Court decision was made. Had he been in a position to do that we might have saved ourselves the trouble, expense and the effort of appealing the matter to the Supreme Court.</P>

      <P>I do not intend in this House to make any apology to anybody outside the House whom I have not offended.  It may be that there are people outside this House who, like Deputy Woods, interpret disagreement as an offensive thing, but I do not think it is the case in this instance.  The matter has been dealt wit very expeditiously.  The judgment of the Supreme Court became available last Friday.  I had the draft of a Bill before the Government this morning, the Government have agreed the matter in principle and, subject to agreement between the Whips, we will have the Bill in the House this week.

I find it rather strange that last Friday the Deputy &mdash; I will not say quite <Col N="2837" /> rightly because I do not believe he does these things in the proper manner &mdash; was urging on me, to put it mildly, to take action immediately.

      <P>There are no such proposals. The Deputy recognises, even if he is not prepared to admit it, that the Supreme Court is not under the control of the Government.  It makes its decisions at the moment as it chooses.  If those decisions call into question a law, the application of which is in the national interest, then, as Deputy Woods urged on Friday, it is desirable that legislative action is taken at once to deal with it. That is how this House proceeded on a number of occasions in the past, whichever Government were in power.  The Deputy's attempt to suggest otherwise, to raise extraneous matter or to suggest that this in some way reflects on the Government will carry as little weight as do so many of his comments in this House.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. <i>a</i>1:</P>
      <P>In page 2, before section 1, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;1.&mdash;The following section is hereby substituted for section 22 of the Act of 1965&mdash;</P>
      <P>&lsquo;22.&mdash;(1)  Where extradition is requested for the purpose of proceeding against any person, to whom this section applies, for an offence, the requesting country shall produce signed statements of witnesses, which, if the person were being prosecuted for a similar or corresponding offence under the laws of the State in respect of an act committed in the State, would be required to be tendered at a preliminary examination before a Justice of the District Court, in order that an order returning the person for trial on indictment might be made.</P>
      <P>(2)  An order for committal under section 29 of this Act shall not be made unless the Justice is satisfied on the basis of the said statements and other documents that the person claimed would be returned for trial in the State if the offence had taken place in the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(3)  This section applies to persons who are Irish citizens and to any other persons to whom the relevant <Col N="3031" /> extradition provisions provide that it shall apply.&rsquo;.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 8 appears on the list of amendments as amendment No. 6 but due to the manoeuvrings that went on in the past day or two it became necessary for me to play the same game.  As a result, amendment No. 6 becomes amendment No. <i>a</i>1.  It is the kernel of the amendments to this Bill because it sets forward, by way of substitution for section 22 of the Extradition Act, 1965, the necessity for the introduction into law of the establishment of a <i>prima facie</i> case in respect of a request for the extradition of an Irish citizen from this State.  In order that we understand this and in view of statements made by the Minister for Justice in the past week or two which might well be misleading to people who do not know the details of it, I want to draw the attention of the House to the terms of section 14 of the Extradition Act, 1965.  It provides that extradition shall not be granted where a person claimed is a citizen of Ireland.  It goes on to qualify that in a limited way by saying, unless the relevant extradition provisions otherwise provide. Basically, our law is that we do not extradite our own citizens.  That is the basis from which we are starting.</P>
    <P>The Minister argued on Second Stage and elsewhere outside the House that if we were to bring in in any way a requirement of a <i>prima facie</i> case to be shown in respect of somebody whose extradition is sought from here, we would be turning the whole law and practice of the entirety of Europe &mdash; he almost said the entirety of the whole civilised world &mdash; on its head.  He said everyone is moving away from this requirement.  I must emphasise the provisions of section 14 of the 1965 Act in order to show what our law is.  In addition it is necessary to point out that a lot of other states in Europe have the same provision in their law as our section 14 of the 1965 Act.  The reason is that it exactly reflects Article 6 of the 1957 European Convention on Extradition. Unlike us who have not availed in practical terms of our perfect right not to <Col N="3032" /> extradite our own citizens about half of the countries of Europe have exercised that right not to extradite their own citizens. Nobody says boo to them and the Minister for Justice seems to entirely ignore them.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats in their amendment are proposing what I think is a happy medium between those two extremes and I hope the House will agree with that.  We are not refusing to extradite our own citizens although many of our partners in Europe refuse, but what we are saying is that we will extradite our own citizens subject to a condition.  The condition I am asking the House to write into the Bill is one that a <i>prima facie</i> case should be shown against the person whose extradition is sought.  We feel that is necessary because, as is well known, there are judicial processes and have been cases over recent years in Britain, for example &mdash; where a lot of people extradited from here go &mdash; which are very unsatisfactory, to say the least of it.  There are serious doubts here and in Britain about the propriety of the convictions of a whole series of Irish defendants, the Birmingham Six, the Guildford Four, the Maguire family and their various associates. They were sentenced to long terms of imprisonment having been convicted of terrorist-related crimes and about whose convictions there are very substantial doubts at all levels of society in Britain.  Hopefully, the Home Secretary in Britain will look into these cases yet again with a view to seeing if justice can be achieved.</P>
    <P>It is in that context as far as Britain is concerned, and in the context of a whole series of unsatisfactory court cases in Northern Ireland, that we put forward our amendment.  By anyone's standards those court cases in Northern Ireland were unsatisfactory.  There were convictions of huge numbers of defendants &mdash; in one case as many as 36 at the one time &mdash; all on the evidence of one person, a self-confessed co-conspirator of theirs and who was described by the judge who subsequently relied on his evidence to convict those people as somebody in whose credibility nobody could have any <Col N="3033" /> confidence.  However, convictions took place not just in that case but in a series of other similar cases.</P>
    <P>It would be a matter for the district justice here to evaluate the value of the <i>prima facie</i> statements.  Even if it were of no value in those supergrass type cases the fact that all those convictions took place in those circumstances is a sign of an attitude of mind among senior judicial figures in that jurisdiction which is quite frightening.  It is not unreasonable to require that a <i>prima facie</i> case be shown to exist before citizens of this country are extradited for trial in that system which, by common consent, has proved itself to be so deeply unsatisfactory.  One's concern in these matters is not just confined to extraditions to Britain and Northern Ireland.  We had the recent instance of a citizen from here being tried in the Canary Islands in Spain in respect of an alleged offence.  That man was not extradited but was kept in custody for two years and one month before being brought before a court.  The charges against him, it should be said in fairness to the court, were thrown out on the first day of that trial.  I do not think anybody could have a complaint about the court but I have every complaint and reservation about the system that keeps somebody in custody awaiting trial for 25 months without any possibility of access to bail.  The system in several other continental European countries is not that different.  The period of delay before one gets a trial in a country like Italy is very considerable by our standards.  It is often 18 months and more.  The delays in France are extremely long by our standards.</P>
    <P>There is another major difference in extradition to those countries in that, whereas here a defendant has on the face of it a right to bail with the onus being on the State to deprive him of that right, the onus is the other way round on the Continent.  The onus is on the defendant by and large to prove his right to bail and not on the State to prove that he should not get it.  The result is that most defendants who are arrested and taken into custody are retained in custody for these <Col N="3034" /> very long periods before they come to trial.  I emphasise those points in relation to some of the continental countries because the Minister in the course of his Second Stage speech seemed to give the impression that this was only a Northern Ireland/Republic of Ireland or Republic of Ireland/Great Britain problem, which it is not.  The Bill is setting up extraordinary law for the country which will last for many decades and under which cases will arise that we do not know anything about.</P>
    <P>It is worth drawing attention to the fact that this world keeps getting smaller and smaller and that our horizons will have to go beyond Europe and the signatories of those two Conventions.  The Minister referred to the <i>prima facie</i> requirement as being almost a dead duck and being disregarded by most countries but it is remarkable to recall that in this Chamber three weeks ago the House was asked to ratify an extradition treaty between this country and the US in which the provision we want inserted in the Bill was included. I might add that it was not included at the request of the Irish side but at the request of the American side.  The American side said that if Ireland wants to extradite somebody from the United States, Ireland will have to bring in affidavits and sworn evidence on affidavit to show that there is a <i>prima facie</i> case; otherwise the American authorities will not extradite.</P>
    <P>An even more recent treaty was the one which was finally agreed between the United States and the United Kingdom in July last after more than one year's delay from its original signature and considerable amendment by the US Senate. That contains a provision on the lines we are talking about, a requirement of a <i>prima facie</i> case being shown but unlike the Irish/US Treaty it is needed on both sides in the Anglo/US Treaty.  Therefore, to suggest as the Minister tried to do that the <i>prima facie</i> requirement has disappeared from international law in extradition treaties is blatantly untrue.  This House approved of one three weeks ago and another was concluded as recently as last July between two of the major <Col N="3035" /> nations in the world, the US and the UK. It was insisted on and will continue to be insisted on by most countries that have concern for human rights, particularly when one sees what has been happening in certain places in recent years.</P>
    <P>Our concern is that no Irish citizen should be put in the position that he would be returned for trial abroad to a jurisdiction whose judicial processes have not entirely given rise to deep confidence among our people.  No Irish citizen should be returned for trial to such a jurisdiction in circumstances in which he would not be returned for trial in our own jurisdiction if he had committed that alleged offence in Ireland.  That is a perfectly reasonable proposition.  It is allowed to the Government and to this House in enacting this legislation to act in that way, as we suggest, by virtue of Article 6 of the 1957 Convention which does not require us to extradite our own citizens at all, and by virtue of section 14 of our own 1965 Act which states that in our law, on the face of it, no Irish citizen shall be extradited unless special provisions are made to that effect.</P>
    <P>I challenge the Minister to say why we should require a lower standard of safeguard for our citizens when sending them abroad to a jurisdiction whose processes we may be suspicious of or do not understand fully than for our own citizens going before our own courts with all the safeguards that implies.  The reason why for a long time, centuries perhaps, a requirement for a <i>prima facie</i> case to be shown and for a hearing before a district justice in advance of a trial on indictment, is that the law here always has regarded the trial of any man on an indictable offence as a serious matter for him: he is subject to tremendous tension and worry, strain and expense, with his liberty being interfered with if he is held in custody prior to his trial.  The law has always taken the view here that a man should not be put at that hazard unless there are reasonable grounds for doing so.</P>
    <P>It is right that our law should be that <Col N="3036" /> way and I am sure the Minister has no intention of changing that law, but is it right that a man should have that safeguard here but not have that safeguard if a request is made to put him on trial, not from our own police or our own judicial authorities but from a foreign police and a foreign authority?  It seems to me to be unanswerable that at the very least we should seek to have the same safeguards for our own citizens whom we choose to send abroad for trial as for our own citizens whom we choose to try here through our processes.</P>
    <P>I have not heard one word from the Minister or any other defender of the provisions of the Bill, unamended, that would seek meaningfully to defend what the Minister now wants to do.  It seems to fly in the face of the two most recent celebrated extradition treaties entered into, one by Ireland and the other by Britain and the US.  The amendment is, therefore, nothing new, nothing unusual. It does not conflict with our own law because it is precisely in accordance with section 14 of the 1965 Act; nor does it conflict with any of our international obligations because it is entirely in accordance with Article 6 of the Convention of 1957.</P>
    <P>If we do what is suggested in the amendment we will not be going a quarter as far as many of our European partners have gone because they are refusing to extradite their citizens at all.  We are only refusing to extradite them unless the same safeguards are there as we would require in our jurisdiction to put someone on trial here.  That should be accepted as perfectly reasonable, and I hope the Minister will accept it.  I suggest he has been ill-advised in the attitude he has been taking.  Perhaps he does not fully comprehend what is involved, and I hope it will get across to him now.  I remind the Minister, whom I regard as a relatively open-minded man, that some views he formed in the recent past on matters like this turned out very rapidly to be erroneous, not the least of them being the subject of the views we heard exchanged here during a Private Notice Question <Col N="3037" /> before this debate began.  Then the Minister had to stand and ask permission of the House to bring in yet another emergency Bill to remedy a defect which he announced in most unequivocal terms as not being a problem at all or a defect as recently as last Friday.  Perhaps he does not have the resources available, and if he does they do not have a monopoly of wisdom in these matters.  This point before the House should be fully and properly considered.</P>

      <P>This is the principal amendment to the Bill because it deals with the principal defect in the Bill as most people see it.  We are trying here to insert the principal safeguard which the majority of people feel it reasonable should be put in.  From that point of view I want to refer to a report on page 1 of today's <i>Irish Times</i> quoting an anonymous spokesman for the Government, what might well be the last croak of a man who has the good fortune or feels it is incumbent on him in these times to depart for lusher pastures in the fields of Flanders.  He is quoted as saying:</P>
      <P>The two parties &mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="3038" /> that is, Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats</P>
    <P>&mdash; were accused of trying &ldquo;to prevent effective extradition.  They seem to be hell bent on making Ireland the last haven in Europe for every terrorist you can think of&rdquo;, he said.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I can tell the Minister for Justice that of all the 166 Members of this House, I am perhaps about the last one who would be hell bent on making Ireland the last haven in Europe for every terrorist one can think of.  I held the office that the present Minister holds, not at a time of relative ease and safety as is the case with its present incumbent, but at a time of great danger, when half the people, rather than one or 1 or 2 per cent, supported concepts of violence they have long since copped on to, when it was difficult to dissuade people that certain terrorist activities were very much against the interests of our people.  It took a lot of hard work and courage at that time, in a very lonely situation frequently &mdash; in which one had no support from newspapers or spokesmen of this kind &mdash; to stand up against something that a lot of people in this country thought one should not stand up against.  Therefore to say that I am hell bent on making Ireland the last haven in Europe for every terrorist one can think of is a bit unreasonable and unreal to say the least.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This article goes on to say that Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrats knew the implications of their amendment well.  It <Col N="3039" /> says that the effect of such regulations in Britain caused Spain to give up its attempts to extradite people from there. Certainly we know the effect of our amendments.  The effect of this and other similar amendments is to do precisely what I have said already &mdash; a very reasonable thing &mdash; to ensure that someone will not be sent for trial abroad in circumstances in which he would not be sent for trial here with all the safeguards that exist in a trial here.  This departing spokesman's example of Spain giving up in despair because they could not extradite people back out of Britain was an unhappy choice, to say the least of it. The real problem in Europe over the last decade as far as extradition is concerned has been the effort of Britain and other countries to get some of the biggest criminals in the world back from Spain, where they ran free for years, gave interviews on television because they knew they were as safe as a house; where criminals from this country who had defrauded people of large sums of money were able to disport themselves in what the television describes as luxury villas and swimming pools all over the south of Spain. The example, therefore, was an unhappy one and shows how ill-founded is the whole of this ridiculous criticism.  What a pity that a matter of importance such as this should be treated in this way by somebody, even if it is his swansong, before he deserts the ship that he knows is not likely to carry him too much further if he were to stay with it.</P>
    <P>That is the principle that is involved here.  The House will note from the terms of the amendment that it applies to all extradition.  Even though section 22 of the 1965 Act applied to Part II countries only, that is not to Britain and Northern Ireland, the provisions of this amendment, this new section we propose here, would be to have it applied to all such countries including Britain and Northern Ireland.  I see no reason whatever, since our independence, for Britain and Northern Ireland being looked on differently. I explained on Second Stage here that the 1870 and 1873 Acts which governed our <Col N="3040" /> law up to 1965 and which were re-enacted largely in Part III of the 1965 Act are no longer appropriate.  They have not been since we gained independence because the provisions as between Ireland, England, Wales and Scotland arrived at in the 1870s were brought about at a time when there was one United Kingdom consisting of these two islands, when moving people around within the jurisdiction of the one country, as it was then, one legal entity &mdash; the United Kingdom &mdash; simply consisted of moving people from one sub-jurisdiction to another.  It had no more meaning or significance than moving somebody who is arrested in Glasgow today down to London on the train to be charged with some offence he committed down there or <i>vice versa</i>.  It is quite wrong to give the impression that the particular arrangements which had existed hitherto between Britain and here should exist for all time.  We should now revert to realising that we are a sovereign State, that our relationship in these matters with all other sovereign States should be equal and similar.</P>
    <P>It is necessary, as a result of this &mdash; and this will appear in a later amendment &mdash; to have also in our extradition relations with Britain and Northern Ireland the introduction of the rule of speciality which is part and parcel of our extradition law generally, and which is part and parcel of extradition law under the convention and internationally.  It is ridiculous that we should have provisions in our law saying that if some country other than Britain or Northern Ireland seeks the extradition of someone from here they must undertake not to charge them with any other offence.  It is ridiculous that it should not apply to Britain.  Why should Britain not give the same undertaking that every other country in the world gives in this regard?  Why should Britain not honour the rule of speciality? Why should the Minister be so keen to retain this concept of the old, internal, United Kingdom transfers of the 1870s in this law and not change it?  Why should there be these special laws as between ourselves and Britain?  Britain is to us just another sovereign country, a friendly one <Col N="3041" />&mdash; we are friendly with all of them &mdash; but our relationship with Britan should be no different so far as extradition is concerned from our relationship with, say, Argentina, Australia, Japan, the United States, Germany or anywhere else.  This Bill should not seek to retain concepts that were outdated even 100 years ago. This affords us a badly needed opportunity to change our extradition in this respect.</P>
    <P>I would appeal to all Members of this House, not just the Minister, to give the fullest consideration to this amendment. It has been very carefully drafted.  It is the view of numerous counsel who have read it that it reflects properly, adequately and fully, in legal language, the requirement I have enunciated here today.  It is also the view of a great many people that that requirement is a reasonable one, one that the great majority of our people would wish to see incorporated in our law.  If this Bill were to be passed without the amendment being incorporated, a lot of people would be extremely nervous.  Indeed the view of probably a majority of people in this country is that if this provision &mdash; and this is the key amendment &mdash; is not included in this Bill by way of its acceptance by the House then the House and particularly those of us who voted for this Bill on Second Stage, would do well to consider whether it would be appropriate for us to vote for if on Fifth Stage.  Whatever conclusion we come to in relation to that point will be entirely dependent on the response and attitude of the Minister for Justice and of the Government.</P>
    <P>We were told that the Minister was putting down a particular type of amendment. We waited until this morning for it but we have not got it.  We can only assume that either he has decided not to table the amendment or has been overruled. But, even had he put down that type of amendment, the general view of this House would be that it would not suffice in the circumstances that have now been outlined.  At the very least it would have shown a willingness on the part of the Minister to have an open mind, to take account of people's concerns about <Col N="3042" /> these matters.  However, that is all by the way because that amendment has not been forthcoming from the Minister and Committee Stage has now commenced. This amendment is well drafted, has been settled by a number of Counsel, can properly fit into our law, and in no sense does it weaken our extradition law or make it more difficult.  It simply makes it the same to get somebody extradited from this country for trial abroad as it would be to get that person sent within this country for trial here.</P>
    <P>What can be unreasonable about that or how can that create unreasonable difficulties? I do not accept the concept the Minister seemed to express, that extradition should be some kind of administrative slot machine which you put your money into at one side, pull the handle and your ticket of extradition comes out at the other side.  There must be a judicial input in it and some judicial figure, even a district justice, must be satisfied that there is some case to answer before he sends a citizen of this country abroad. This provision applies only to citizens of this country.  It is not proposed to apply it to people who are not citizens unless special provision is made for it, and subsection (3) of the amendment allows for that.  The need to protect someone who is being extradited to his own country is clearly much less than the need to protect and safeguard a citizen here who is being extradited out of here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment we put down is in many respects, though drafted somewhat differently, similar to the one Deputy O'Malley has just spoken to.  It is amendment number 3 on the list of amendments and it seeks to provide that:</P>
      <P>2. &mdash; (1) No citizen of Ireland shall be extradited pursuant to the provisions of this Act, or the Act of 1965, unless the provisions of subsection (2) of this section have been satisfied.</P>
      <P>The subsection (2) referred to there proposes that:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No order for the extradition of an Irish citizen shall be made unless the <Col N="3043" /> District Court is satisfied, on the evidence before it, that there is a sufficient case which would warrant the sending forward for trial of that person as if the offence alleged were an indictable offence and had been committed within the State.</P>
    <P>We, too, are looking for a similar kind of safeguard for the Irish citizen in conjunction with the signing of this Convention on Terrorism.  Under subsection (3) of our amendment we cover other matters such as the serving of the document on the person, the question of the document being received in evidence without further proof of it purports to be signed or certified by a judge, magistrate or other judicial authority of the requesting country and its authentication by the oath of some witness.  Subsection (4) deals with the case of a person who has been convicted previously where the extradition of a convicted person is sought.  Subsection (4) (b) reads:</P>
    <P>Provided always that no person shall be extradited if that person has been tried and convicted <i>in absentia.</i></P>
    <P>The amendment we are proposing here is very reasonable in the circumstances. Indeed, it is quite extraordinary to find that this Government, who so often talk about civil liberties, seem unwilling to afford to Irish citizens whom they are willing to hand over to foreign jurisdictions even the most minimal protection. In this respect we should be very clear about what the <i>prima facie</i> rule involves.  It would not do what the Taoiseach has suggested and what has been repeated today in the media which obviously comes from what the Taoiseach suggested at the weekend through his handlers, as Deputy O'Malley said.  It would not make this country into a haven for international criminals, as the Taoiseach believes or says he believes.  The Taoiseach should know that England has operated a <i>prima facie</i> rule since 1870, and surely he does not believe that England could be regarded as a haven for international criminals.  A <i>prima facie</i><Col N="3044" /> requirement for Irish citizens would not put us out of line with most of the European countries, again as the Taoiseach and the Minister would suggest.  Most European countries will not extradite their citizens at all.  It is this country and this Government who are out of step with Europe, not the concept of the Irish State and the Irish Government affording to Irish citizens a degree of protection which would still be less than most other governments offer their citizens.</P>
    <P>If we want to understand this convention we must look at its character and in doing that we find that the following countries will not extradite if there is no <i>prima facie</i> case: the USA which, of course, is not party to this convention, the UK, Israel, Denmark and Norway. Regarding the <i>prima facie</i> provision let us consider Germany, France, Belgium, Austria, The Netherlands, Italy, Portugal, Switzerland and Sweden.  It is wrong to apply simple comparisons between civil law states such as Germany, Italy, France and The Netherlands where an inquisitorial judicial process obtains and where there is a tradition of judicial investigation and close examination of all documents, in particular external legal documents and processes.  In these countries the practice and terms of a statement setting out the details of the offence, which is merely what is required under the provisions of the convention on extradition, would be quite different from what obtains in common law jurisdictions such as Ireland.  In effect they are much tighter.  Then if we look at another group of countries we find that these countries will not extradite if the person is one of their own nationals.  Germany, France, Belgium, Austria and The Netherlands will not extradite their own nationals in any event.</P>
    <P>Some countries will not extradite to a country where a person will be tried by a special court.  The reason for that is obvious, that there is an assumption that the circumstances in that country are not quite normal.  Therefore, some countries have put in a reservation in signing this convention that they will not extradite to a country where the person will be tried <Col N="3045" /> by a special court.  Those countries are Denmark, Norway, Austria, Switzerland and Sweden.</P>
    <P>Finally, there is a group of countries which say that in any event they will consider whether the offence is political. They will take into consideration the terms of the convention but ultimately will make the decision themselves, and they will not extradite without that control on the extradition of persons.  Those countries are Denmark, Norway, Germany, France, Austria, The Netherlands, Italy, Portugal, Switzerland and Sweden.</P>
    <P>Therefore, when we look at the character of this convention we find that it is not quite what the Minister is trying to suggest to us, that all our European partners just rush all their citizens out any time an extradition is called for.  The various countries are trying to deal with a very special problem, with a new form of international terrorism.  They have come together to make arrangements to deal with that problem but in making those arrangements have entered special safeguards particularly for their own citizens. It is interesting to look at Britain, for example.  The British at present have a <i>prima facie</i> requirement, as indeed do the Americans.  Recently we signed an agreement with America which left out the <i>prima facie</i> requirement.  The <i>prima facie</i> case applies coming here, but not going from here to America.  The Minister has said that the British are considering plans for changes in legislation and that they had issued a White Paper and draft legislation.  The British White Paper of March 1986 says on page 21, paragraph 52:</P>
    <P>The Government considers that such a reform of UK extradition law will represent an effective contribution to the fight against international crime. Procedures will be simplified, but these will be balanced by the preservation of the most effective means of safeguarding the individual.  This will include the power of the Secretary of State to withhold extradition in any <Col N="3046" /> case in which he considers it appropriate.</P>
    <P>No matter what they are planning to do, they are certainly planning to provide safeguards for their citizens.  This protection is already carried in the draft legislation.  Therefore, it is wrong to suggest that we are the odd man out in this thing and that we do not have a means of dealing with the problems in the North of Ireland.  We have special arrangements to deal with those problems in the Criminal Law Jurisdiction Act, 1976, of which the Minister's predecessors thought very highly.  That Act was used up to 1982 and people were tried here for offences committed in the North.  Since this Government came into office this legislation was left aside.</P>
    <P>It is important that people are not given false ideas in relation to extradition and are not given the impression which was given by a Government spokesman in the media today that those who are against this Bill must be associated in some way with terrorists.  I am sure the Minister will not follow that line.  The Minister seemed to take a very sensible attitude towards this Bill earlier and indicated that he was prepared to look at amendments.  When a headline appeared in the newspapers saying that our amendments would not be accepted the Minister pointed out, on a radio programme, that he would certainly consider any amendments to this Bill.  The Taoiseach soon after said that there would not be amendments to this Bill.  It is clear that the leaks to the press and the suggestions about terrorism are coming from the Taoiseach's side and not from the Minister's.  The Minister has obviously been overidden; he has been told there must be no changes in this Bill except for the very minor change which was introduced today.</P>
    <P>The Minister now has the opportunity to put his comments into the Official Report which will be here long after newspaper comments have been forgotten. It should go out loud and clear from this House that if there is any evidence against any individual, that person can be tried here under the Criminal Law <Col N="3047" /> Jurisdiction Act.  The Minister knows that is the situation.  The <i>prima facie</i> requirement will, in effect, give Irish citizens the same rights in relation to being extradited for trial abroad that they would have if they were tried at home. That is all we are asking, the Minister may say that we had not this requirement before but perhaps we should have considered this long ago and amended legislation to provide for this requirement. We are simply seeking that ordinary citizens be given the same treatment abroad as they would receive at home.  Under our law an accused person can be remanded on bail for more than a week without the production of a <i>prima facie</i> case against him only with the special leave of our courts.  The Government are not only defending but worsening a legal situation in which Irish citizens can be handed over to jurisdictions where they can legally be held in custody, not for weeks or months but for years without trial in circumstances which would not even merit their detention on bail here for more than a week.  Surely the first duty of any self-respecting Government is to protect the interests of the citizens of the State?  Are the Government not interested in the rights of Irish citizens or in the rule of law, but only in placating people who are obviously pushing them to deliver on this in a rushed way?</P>

      <P>We are co-operating with the Minister in considering a review of the legislation in this area.  The more I look at this legislation the more I am convinced that this Bill should have gone to a special committee with experts available to them so that it could have been thoroughly debated.  Extradition law is a very complicated and sensitive matter. The danger is that the Government will <Col N="3048" /> try to force these measures through, using the media to create scares of one kind or another, and then worry about the problems, or let somebody else worry about them afterwards.  Surely this House is capable of considering new legislation in this area in a thorough and comprehensive way, just as they are doing in Britain at the moment.  There is not a great hurry there to make the changes: there is not a mad rush before Christmas to do so.  Indeed the Minister should have noted, and there are so many things to note if he had got down and&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I do not mind taking the Bill now, but what we are doing here is not giving adequate treatment to a measure which is such a fundamental issue for our citizens.  I have no doubt that we are not giving it adequate treatment. We completed Second Stage last Friday evening and we were expected to begin Committee Stage today and to have it completed by tomorrow night.  What opportunity is there for anyone to consider the Minister's Second Stage speech and its implications, never mind anyone else's Second Stage speech?  The proper way to have dealt with this Bill was to have had adequate consideration of Second Stage followed by adequate consideration of the Committee Stage amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="3049" /> We heard suggestions that the Minister was to put forward some form of amendment. Like Deputy O'Malley I was waiting to see what amendment would arise. In fact, a very minor amendment was put down which I do not think meets the requirement.  That small amendment towards the end of the Bill relates to the commencement of the legislation.  It was suggested again today in the media that the Minister intends to make arrangements for the British Director of Public Prosecutions to furnish a certificate on which the extradition of Irish citizens would be grounded.  Earlier Deputy O'Malley felt insulted about the terrorism tag which any of us would feel insulted about but surely it is the Irish Judiciary who should be insulted by that proposition because I would regard it as an insult to the Irish courts and as being totally unacceptable.</P>
    <P>When the Minister suggested that to amend the legislation on the lines proposed would leave this country a haven for terrorists he omitted to mention that both Britain and the United States insist on a <i>prima facie</i> case being established before they will agree to extradition.  The Minister would hardly consider those countries as havens for terrorists.  We will wait to see what suggestions the Minister will make but it is quite clear that he intends to make no statutory provision.  Some other kind of administrative proposal is not acceptable. In the not too distant past we have seen the difficulties which can arise with these administrative arrangements.  We can recall an occasion when very little attention was given to the signing of the warrants from Britain.  Therefore, it is not administrative arrangements we are seeking.  What we are seeking is an arrangements such as the one contained in our amendment or the one contained in Deputy O'Malley's amendment which would introduce the requirement for a <i>prima facie</i> case.  We regard a <i>prima facie</i> case requirement as being one of the most fundamental amendments required.  We will be pressing our amendment to a vote. I await what the Minister has to say with <Col N="3050" /> regard to his own proposals but since he has not put down any amendment it is hard to see what value they could have.</P>

      <P>We are discussing three amendments each of which is to be put in a different place in the Bill.  I suppose it does not make any difference where they are put in the Bill provided that there is some provision.  The amendment we propose to insert in page 3 before section 3 is very simple and brief and reads that:</P>
      <P>Where a request is received for the extradition of a person under this Act, the requesting country shall be required to provide evidence as to the commission by the person claimed of the offence for which extradition is requested, and extradition shall not be granted unless sufficient evidence is produced to satisfy the request.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That amendment is taken almost word for word from the 1965 Act.  Section 22 of that Act which deals with evidence of commission of offences by persons claimed <Col N="3051" /> states that where the relevant extradition provisions require the production by the requesting country of evidence as to the commission by the person claimed of the offences for which extradition is requested extradition shall not be granted unless sufficient evidence is produced to satisfy the requirement.  Therefore, all that is required is sufficient evidence.  The judge knows what evidence is required. That would cover the details of matters which are in Deputy O'Malleys amendment and also in the fairly lengthy amendment in the name of Deputy Woods such as that the requesting country shall produce signed statements of witnesses etc.</P>
    <P>I suggest that all that is required is what is in the 1965 Act which states that extradition shall not be granted unless sufficient evidence is produced to satisfy the request.  That is the tradition which exists.  It does not lay out or specify any specific procedure &mdash;<i>prima facie</i> evidence or anything else.  It simply says that the requesting country shall be required to provide evidence of the commission of the act by the person claimed and that when sufficient evidence is provided only then will extradition be granted.  That is a very reasonable request to make of any country which is seeking to have someone extradited, particularly when it is a citizen of ours who is being claimed by that other jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his Second Stage speech said that this requirement had never been sought before, that there was no reason why it should be required now and that it is not normal procedure but the change in political offences has never occurred before.  We always refused to extradite those charged with political offences.  Therefore, in this Bill we are dealing with a completely new situation as the Bill says that offences under certain headings shall not be regarded as political. In that case, therefore, we are entitled to seek evidence of the crime for which they are requested.  Deputy O'Malley made the point that this was specifically included at the request of the United States in the treaty we made with <Col N="3052" /> them a few weeks ago.  The USA is probably the country which pays most attention to and has most regard for the rights of its own citizens, particularly those abroad.  They have the fullest protection of the law and of the Government of the United States at all times, whether at home or abroad.  We should have the same concern for our citizens.  Certainly we have never had it for any of our citizens once they have taken the boat.  Once they move beyond the three-mile limit they no longer seem to be under the protection of our Government.  The Government should be thinking in terms of protecting the rights of citizens.</P>
    <P>The different legal systems in the jurisdictions to which people may be extradited were discussed on Second Stage.  In Northern Ireland there is the system of supergrasses and the Diplock courts.  The system in Britain seems all right but when dealing with Irish citizens there the system is under the greatest suspicion at present.  Irish citizens here have a great mistrust in regard to justice being obtained under the current British system in certain cases.  On the Continent there is a variety of systems and methods of detention.  An Irish citizen in Spain was held for two years before being brought before a court and released.  Although it had nothing to do with extradition, a recent case in Italy involved an Italian citizen who was held for nine years and then released because no charge was brought against him.  When such systems of justice exist, we must be very careful about releasing anybody from this country, especially one of our own citizens.</P>
    <P>The Minister seemed to be conceding that something was needed.  He opposed the idea of a <i>prima facie</i> case but seemed to indicate at the weekend that something was required.  We have not seen any amendment as yet and we must assume that he is sticking fast to his original position on the instructions of the Taoiseach and is not allowing for any amendment. This matter is the crunch of the whole Bill.  It is right that it be dealt with first because if this is not amended the whole Bill has much more serious implications for all our citizens.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="3053" /> We believe that our amendment No. 9 is in accordance with existing law under the 1965 Act.  It involves a simple procedure. A justice must have what he would deem to be sufficient evidence before him to satisfy the request for extradition.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>On Second Stage I dealt at some length with this question of a <i>prima facie</i> case, both in my opening statement at the beginning of the debate and in my reply at the conclusion.  I do not know what difficulties Deputy Woods had in absorbing my opening speech, but it was very clear that he had not taken account of much of it when he made his speech on Second Stage.</P>
      <P>In looking at the amendments before us it is right that the House should concentrate on the issues that are immediately relevant but it would be unreal to discuss them without indicating their proper context.  That is the line which has been followed by other speakers on the amendments so far.  The wider picture is that we have in effect three series of amendments put forward to this Bill, one of them being promoted by the main Opposition party.  The amendments in that series form part of a very clear pattern. If accepted it is clear that they would involve a deliberate move away from European norms, making extradition much more difficult in practical terms. Perhaps even more importantly, they would, if accepted, amount to a public and unambiguous declaration to the people of Northern Ireland and Britain that we were abandoning the Anglo-Irish Agreement and all that it means for us. That and nothing less is what is involved in the series of amendments put forward by Deputy Woods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have come into this House with proposals to strengthen our extradition arrangements in accordance with trends to which all of our European neighbours subscribe.  It would be an outrageous and perverse result if instead the Bill were to be used to throw overboard the legal advances we have been making in the battle against terrorism.  I do not intend <Col N="3054" /> to do that and I do not intend to start on a process which begins from the proposition that we are all in favour of extradition but....</P>
    <P>In this State we are in position which is literally unique in Europe.  No other State in Europe in looking at its extradition laws has had to deal with the situation where virtually everybody in another jurisdiction is a citizen of that State.  The French will not extradite Frenchmen to any other country, for example, to Germany or Spain, but they are not in a situation where virtually every Spaniard or German is also French. In our dealings with Northern Ireland we are in exactly that situation.  Virtually every person in that jurisdiction is a citizen of this country.  It might be asked, what that has to do with a <i>prima facie</i> requirement.  It is very relevant because if we impose such a requirement in relation to Irish citizens we are imposing it on nearly everybody in the Northern Ireland context and in doing so we are abandoning an approach which is now established throughout Europe, with a couple of exceptions.</P>
    <P>All that is well established and well known.  We could not seriously expect anybody to accept our good faith and our commitment to the restoration of peace and stability in Northern Ireland if we were now to go against international trends and impose a requirement which we never had with Northern Ireland or Britain, which we abandoned over 20 years ago with the rest of Europe, which is contrary to European norms and which is such a major practical obstacle to extradition that it has led in the past to the denunciation of at least one extradition treaty, mentioned earlier by Deputy O'Malley, because of the difficulties it was creating.  The situation is such that the British have abandoned the <i>prima facie</i> requirement in relation to the rest of Europe.  Yet these amendments appear to be based on the proposition that it is reasonable to reintroduce into our law a requirement that has caused these problems.</P>
    <P>To make matters even worse, a proposal to require a <i>prima facie</i> case in so <Col N="3055" /> far as it is grounded on allegations that a need for it has been shown in practice is simply misconceived.  We have heard references to various cases and I do not intend to go into those cases but I repeat what I said in my Second Stage speech, that with one possible exception a <i>prima facie</i> requirement would not have made the slightest difference.  By that I mean that the evidence available at the time would, in the opinion of people qualified to judge, have certainly been deemed to be sufficient to show a <i>prima facie</i> case.</P>
    <P>Of course, the practical difficulties of getting witnesses to appear before the court might have had their effect, but that is not what is at issue in the point I am now making.  The point is that as an alleged safeguard a <i>prima facie</i> requirement would have been irrelevant, as I said, with one possible exception.  We have already made arrangements to guard against the problem that might have existed in that particular case.</P>
    <P>The amendment tabled by Deputies Mac Giolla and De Rossa proposes that a country requesting extradition would be required to provide evidence as to the commission by the person claimed of the offence.  The effect of the amendments proposed by Deputy Woods would be to require that a <i>prima facie</i> case be made out in our courts before an Irish citizen could be extradited under Parts II or III of the Extradition Act, 1965.  Deputies O'Malley's and Harney's amendment would also provide for the requirement to apply in the cases of persons other than Irish citizens if that is provided for in the relevant extradition agreement.  Apparently those Deputies seek documentary evidence only.  I have two main comments to make on that.  The first one &mdash; and in my view, having heard all the arguments, the conclusive one &mdash; is that any new requirement of this kind represents a move in what in my view is the wrong direction.  We will be out of step with all our neighbours.</P>
    <P>The second comment is that I doubt that it would work.  The second pillar of that amendment is in the proposed subsection (2).  That subsection says that <Col N="3056" /> an order for committal shall not be made unless the justice is satisfied, on the basis of the statements and other documents, that the person claimed would be returned for trial in the State if the offence had taken place in the State.  The reason I say I doubt it would work is this: an important element in a preliminary case before a justice is that a defendant has the right to seek to have witnesses present and questioned.  If he does not exercise that right, that fact in itself is relevant to the justice's decision.  It is one thing to accept as being adequate evidence that is uncontested where the opportunity is provided to have it contested but it seems to be quite a different matter to accept it where that opportunity has not been afforded.  I find it difficult to see how a justice could ever meet the test as set down in the proposed subsection (2).  For those reasons I oppose this amendment.</P>
    <P>The simplified procedure which Part III of the 1965 Act provides for is intended, as I said on Second Stage, to reflect the close ties which exist between this country, Northern Ireland and Britain.  I really would ask that the Deputies on the Fianna Fáil benches accept that we have had an Act in operation since 1965, that on no occasion since 1965, to my knowledge, have they ever proposed to amend it; that on no occasion in the past four years, to my knowledge, have they sought to amend it and on no occasion in the past year, even indeed since the moment when I signed the European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism earlier this year, did they propose to amend it, or even suggest in public that there was a need for any amendment.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the simplified procedure in Part III of that Act provides for and reflects the close ties that exist between this country, Northern Ireland and Britain.  That situation obtaining between this State and Northern Ireland is unique in Europe, in terms of the numbers of persons in one jurisdiction who are citizens of the other.  That applies particularly in the context of Northern Ireland but, given the nature and scope <Col N="3057" /> of our citizenship laws, its application in the wider British context must not be under-estimated.</P>
    <P>There are other practical difficulties, apart from the ones that I have just mentioned. Any evidence tendered would have to conform to the rules as to the admissibility of evidence under our law. A brief example might illustrate the difficulties that might arise in that regard. The general rule under our law is to exclude hearsay evidence.  That apparently simple rule would present difficulties in a civil law jurisdiction seeking the extradition of a person, because the practice in some of the civil law countries is not to take statements direct from witnesses but for a police officer to testify in writing as to what a witness has said to him.  The <i>&ldquo;procès-verbal&rdquo;</i> presented to the investigating magistrate in France, for example, may consist of a written statement produced by a police officer acting as an agent of the magistrate and relating what the witness or witnesses have said to him.</P>
    <P>I am not prepared to accept the amendments before us now because the Government are not prepared to introduce obstacles in the way of legitimate extradition requests from other countries. Nevertheless, the Government accept that the amendments are intended to redress some genuine concerns about extradition.  One concern throughout the debate that has taken place on our accession to the terrorism convention is that the Bill might facilitate a development of extradition merely for questioning in the context of extradition to Northern Ireland and Britain.  That, in fact, is not a risk.  We have gone into that matter very fully and, as I previously indicated, arrangements have been agreed with the British Government under which all warrants to be sent to this jurisdiction will in future not be sent here for execution unless the case has been examined at a high legal level to verify that there is, in the opinion of the prosecuting authority concerned, sufficient evidence of a kind admissible in court on which to base a charge.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="3058" /> Those arrangements in themselves represent an important safeguard.  They reflect the understanding that is shared by the two Governments that an extradition request implies a clear expectation that court proceedings will normally follow.  I say normally, because there may very well be exceptional occasions when they would not be proceeded with, as indeed is the case in our own jurisdiction internally, as I said during the course of Second Stage debate.</P>
    <P>The British authorities have now agreed an addition to this arrangement. In all cases where a warrant is sent to this jurisdiction for backing that the British Attorney General will send to our Attorney General through diplomatic channel a confirmatory note to the effect that he, that is the British Attorney General, has satisfied himself that the relevant prosecuting authorities have complied with the arrangements I have just described.  That note will serve as an additional reassurance that those arrangements have been complied with in each case.  Those arrangements, further strengthened in the way I have just indicated, provide, in my view, the safeguards that ought to be accepted by any reasonable observer as being entirely adequate.</P>
    <P>The important thing to ensure, of course, is that things do not go wrong and that warrants will not be sent for execution where there is not sufficient evidence of a kind admissible in court on which to ground a charge.  I am satisfied that the arrangements to which I have just referred should be fully adequate safeguards against that happening and that we would not be justified, in the circumstances, in introducing any new statutory restriction in what is and has always been a simplified procedure for extradition by way of the backing of warrants. It would be particularly invidious to do so when we would not be doing the same thing in relation to other member states in the Council of Europe on whom we could not impose such a requirement because of the convention on extradition.</P>
    <P>I have said I am satisfied that these arrangements will be fully adequate, but <Col N="3059" /> I am not putting them forward on the basis only of my personal opinion of the matter.  The new arrangements will come into operation in the very near future, in some areas almost immediately and elsewhere very shortly after that.  The Government propose that before the Bill comes into operation sufficient time should be allowed so that those arrangements can be seen to be working in practice. For that reason when we come to section 12 &mdash; the commencement provision &mdash; I will be proposing an amendment to the effect that the commencement date referred to in that section should be 1 December 1987, instead of 1 June.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am uneasy at the manner in which the Bill comes before the House. Unfortunately, I did not have an opportunity to speak on Second Stage and, consequently, I ask leave of the House to remark on the provision of a <i>prima facie</i> case before extradition would apply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House must examine the new Bill and the proposals contained in it.  I listened very carefully to the Minister but I am still unhappy about the situation. The amendment proposes that statements will be presented to a district justice to enable him to determine whether a <i>prima facie</i> case has been made.  I appreciate the difficulties there would be in suggesting that witnesses would have to be called to give evidence before the district justice, especially in relation to those who would have to come from another country.  However, it is hard to see why any difficulty ought to arise when it comes to the presentation of statements because such statements would already be in existence &mdash; or should be &mdash; before any procedure is initiated to set the whole extradition procedure in train.  Before embarking on that course, presumably more would be involved than a senior police officer in London, Paris or anywhere else forming the idea that it would be useful to have a person extradited. The belief would have to be based on signed statements taken from witnesses. A file would be in existence and, as a <Col N="3060" /> result of studying it, someone would decide that extradition was required. There would not be any question of fresh statements or seeking witnesses to interview.</P>
    <P>Why should there be a difficulty in transferring the decision on a <i>prima facie</i> issue to an Irish legal officer instead of leaving this judicial decision to a non-judicial officer in another country? Whether a <i>prima facie</i> case exists &mdash; I am sure the Minister or anybody else would not advocate extradition unless a <i>prima facie</i> case existed against the person &mdash; is a matter for an Irish judicial officer, a district justice or a non-judicial officer in London or some other city.  The decision could rest with a senior legal officer who is performing an administrative function, not a judicial function.  I do not see any difficulty in this regard although, apparently, it is not even proposed that it should be made by an English judicial officer but by an English administrative officer.  It is a bit like the recent Supreme Court dilemma in regard to the Petty Sessions Act.  However this goes even further.  The fact that statements have to be submitted to see if a <i>prima facie</i> case exists is no great protection to a person suspected of a crime.  One could easily devise a system that would go a great deal further than that in seeking to provide protection for someone who may be subjected to extradition.  All that it requires is a set of signed statements and a judicial officer can decide very quickly whether a <i>prima facie</i> case exists.  He does not have to be satisfied that the person tried on the basis of these statements will be found guilty.  It does not go that far, he merely has to determine if these facts were established in accordance with the statements and that the evidence was uncontroverted. If it is controverted, he must decide that the evidence given, based on those statements, is the version that would be accepted and that the person might be convicted.  It is little enough and it is a bit difficult to understand why that minimal protection should not be accepted.</P>
    <P>The Minister made the point &mdash; I submit he is wrong &mdash; that a suspected <Col N="3061" /> person in this situation would be worse off than someone who goes for preliminary examination under the present system before a district justice because that person would have it open to him to cross-examine prosecution witnesses, to give evidence or to call evidence for the Defence before the district justice at the preliminary hearing.  It is true that such an accused person would have the right to do all those things but it is not a determining factor as far as the district justice is concerned, even assuming such evidence is called and that 20 controverting witnesses are called by the Defence.  If there is even one for the prosecution setting up a <i>prima facie</i> case, the district justice will send that person forward for trial, as is the standard practice.  While the district justice is considering the matter at the preliminary investigation stage in the District Court, his task is not to determine whether the one Prosecution witness or the 20 Defence witnesses are telling the truth or whether one carries more weight than the other. This is a matter for the trial court to determine.</P>
    <P>The Minister assured the House that a person would not be sent out of the country merely for questioning.  I wonder about that as one could envisage a situation where the investigating police officers might not be sure of their ground. Serious crimes might have been committed and they could very well want to indulge in what is often referred to in legal circles, when one is seeking to provide evidence which is not already there, as &ldquo;fishing&rdquo;.  All sorts of devices are used in its name, you throw out nets and haul them in to see what you have caught. Sometimes you catch something but very often you do not.  I could visualise situations arising in this context where the procedure might be used for fishing purposes. I am sorry to have to say that but may be the Minister can satisfy the House that that is an impossibility.  If all that is required to bring about an extradition is an administrative say so from a legal officer in the United Kingdom or anywhere else to the effect that a certain <Col N="3062" /> person was wanted and was to be extradited, and that nothing further than that was required, that could be used for a fishing procedure.  After all, we are talking about administrative officers.  What happens if a senior police officer in London or somewhere else tells an administrative officer on the legal side of law enforcement that they want to talk to a certain person and that the only way they can speak to him is by using this procedure, although they do not have a <i>prima facie</i> case?  It would be nice to believe that every administrative officer would look at things in a judicial manner but that would be expecting too much of all administrative officers at all levels.  Although the majority of them would have those high minded standards and could be relied upon, I am sure that many of them, acting as administrators and not in a judicial capacity, might not have such high minded standards.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the hearsay rules.  I have been educated and brought up in the common law system and believe the hearsay rule is a very good and sensible rule.  I am not very happy at the idea that the hearsay evidence which a police officer would give in Paris, Rome or anywhere else, would be a sufficient basis on which to have an Irish citizen extradited from Ireland to another country.  The basis of the hearsay rule is simple enough. If a person knows something he gives evidence, signs a statement and says that is what he saw or heard.  If that is the best evidence that can be obtained, there is no reason it should not be put forward. Why should it be sufficient for a police officer to say that a person said such and such to him?  I do not like that system.  I think the hearsay rule is a very sensible one and I do not feel any sense of comfort at the thought that because some police officer gives hearsay evidence that in itself is sufficient to take someone out of their environment.  I would like to believe that a great deal more than that would be required.</P>
    <P>There are many more people who wish to speak on this issue.  I have been thinking about it and feel a great deal of unease <Col N="3063" /> about it and the comments made by the Minister have not eased my mind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not as concerned about <i>habeas corpus</i> as Deputy Taylor.  I am looking at this as a practical measure, not as a theory and I do not believe we are talking about extradition <i>per se</i>.  I believe we are talking about what would happen if somebody from Northern Ireland caused damage or death in the North but was now in our jurisdiction and that we could not allow that person to go back to Northern Ireland without losing votes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Woods was talking about citizens of the State.  What precisely is a &ldquo;citizen of the State&rdquo;?  Niceties of law are important, but I do not believe we are really talking about extradition.  The concern being put forward is about built-in guarantees but they would not be factors if we were talking about extradition to the United States of America, Canada, Australia, Germany, Holland, Italy, France or any other EC country.  It only becomes a factor when we are talking about extradition to Great Britain and especially when we are talking about extradition to Northern Ireland.  When we look more closely at it, we are not really talking about that either.  We are really talking about votes in the Republic. If we were really talking about extraditing people to the North the picture I see would not really bother me.  Instead of talking about citizens of this State, let us talk about what would happen if, for instance, people from Northern Ireland living in the north-east of Donegal were wanted for very serious crimes in Northern Ireland.  As Deputy Blaney and I know because this happens in our constituency, if there is a question of extraditing them to the North there is a hue and cry, emotions run high, not because they are being extradited back to Northern Ireland but because they are Catholic, loosely called Catholics, nationalists or republicans which is really a modern title for bigoted Catholics.  The meaning of &ldquo;nationalism&rdquo; and &ldquo;republicanism&rdquo; has long since disappeared and it is now <Col N="3064" /> correctly called bigotry.  On the other side we have loyalism and unionism, unionism being the less bigoted protestantism and loyalism covering the bigoted Protestant. Thank God there are a sufficient number of Catholics and Protestants who want to share the common title &ldquo;Irishman&rdquo; without subtitles.</P>
    <P>Let us look closely at what we are talking about here.  I find it difficult to come to terms with the thinking of the person who says that someone wanted for a serious crime in Northern Ireland, such as murder, should walk free in our jurisdiction, and that there should be all kinds of protection built into the law to prevent that person being taken into Northern Ireland in the fear that if we let these people be taken, we are being less than nationalistic, we are second class citizens.</P>
    <P>I want to pose a question to the House: if the murderers of the Miami Showband, whom we now know to be Protestant paramilitaries, had absconded to the Republic and were arrested in this jurisdiction, would we be looking for these built-in guarantees to prevent them from being extradited to the North?  Would there be this emotion from the Fianna Fáil backbenchers about extraditing Protestant paramilitaries back to Northern Ireland?  Deputy Woods spoke about &ldquo;citizens of the State&rdquo;, but is he excluding those people from being citizens of the State or is he saying that the Catholic republicans &mdash; nationalists &mdash; are citizens and that the Protestant unionists &mdash; loyalists &mdash; are not?  If some of the soldiers who caused the atrocities in Derry on Bloody Sunday had deserted from the British Army and were found in hiding in County Donegal, would we look for built-in guarantees to prevent the extradition of those people back to the jurisdiction in the North?  We are really talking about built-in guarantees to prevent the extradition of Catholic republicans &mdash; nationalists &mdash; back to Northern Ireland. It is not that we want to protect a Catholic more than a Protestant in Northern Ireland but there are not a lot of votes in a political party defending the extradition of a Protestant back to Northern Ireland <Col N="3065" /> from the Republic.  There are votes against the extradition of a Catholic republican &mdash; nationalist &mdash; back to Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>What troubles me, and this is one of the real problems in this island, is the view of the unionists.  They talk about the security of Ireland or, as they put it, of Ulster.  They will not talk about the politics of Ireland and we wonder why, until we look at our own position.  We in the Republic and particularly the Fianna Fáil Party, talk about the politics but not the security of Ireland.  The sooner we realise that the better.  There are two extremes on this island with regard to constitutional politics: one group talks about the security but not the politics and the other talks about the politics but not the security and you cannot have one without the other.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil Party should realise that if they extend a sincere invitation to one million Protestant people in the north of Ireland to join with us in some kind of unity arrangement, they will be obliged to secure their lives and their properties today and not on the day we join with them.  I would excuse Deputy Woods, as I would excuse anyone else, in not understanding this as he comes from Dublin and not from the Northern areas. Sadly, I have come to the conclusion that what used to be Irish nationalism is being led by people who live in Dublin or south of it.  No two Deputies will disagree as much on the issue of extradition as Deputy Blaney and myself.  I am sure if Deputy Blaney was talking frankly on leadership being given from Dublin and south of it he and I would have absolute agreement.  The Government are not worried about bringing two traditions together but about how to get back into government again and how to consolidate the votes in the south.</P>
    <P>Extradition is an inherent part of security. Let us say someone walks into a bank in Strabane, sticks a gun at the bank manager's head and says, &ldquo;give me £50,000 or I will blow your brains out&rdquo;. That person will murder the bank manager and will then go the half mile from Strabane to Lifford &mdash; they used to be in <Col N="3066" /> the one parish up to a few years ago. People in this House suggest there should be built-in securities so that person should not be sent back across the Border to stand trial.  The murderer might be a Catholic but the bank manager might also be a Catholic.  It might be a Catholic killing a Catholic.  That is a problem for people who oppose extradition.  Catholics north of the Border think it is wrong in the extreme for people to break the law north of the Border and find sanctuary in the Republic.  I am not arguing against the fundamental thinking that if somebody is living in a jurisdiction and has to be extradited to another jurisdiction the laws of the country where he is living should be such that they would give him reasonable protection but nobody seems to pay much attention to the families of those whose lives have been taken.</P>

We are not talking in this debate about extradition. That is the word we are all using when we talk about a person being arrested in one jurisdiction and being tried in another jurisdiction but we are considering the unpleasantness of arresting a Catholic from Northern Ireland in the Republic and sending him back to Northern Ireland to be tried.  If it was a Protestant&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I am entitled to make it again because Deputy Mac Giolla interrupted me.  If a Protestant was arrested in the Republic I do not think the emotion would be the same.  As I said, and Deputy Mac Giolla will have to agree, if a soldier who had deserted from the British army was being tried for something so brutal as the happenings in Derry on Bloody Sunday and if the Government did not arrest him there would be protests in the <Col N="3067" /> streets to have him sent back to Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>I did not have a chance to speak on Second Stage of this Bill last week but I listened to the arguments put forward by Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats that there should be built-in guarantees and protections.  As one who lives in a Border area where these things are happening, I know people living in Donegal who have not crossed the Border to Tyrone or Derry for the last 15 or 16 years.  Nobody stops them. Rumours circulate that they are wanted for serious crime in Northern Ireland. They cannot be arrested unless the police in Northern Ireland issue an extradition warrant against them.  That extradition warrant would be examined in detail and if it was valid it would be acted upon.  I cannot defend a society that would blindly tolerate allowing somebody who is wanted for very serious crime in one part of Ireland to live scot-free in another part.</P>
      <P>Let me get down to kitchen sink politics. It has happened that a person who committed a crime in the town of Strabane walked free a half mile across the Border in the town of Lifford.  That has happened since the troubles broke out in the north not once but on a number of occasions.  The crime was not a simple crime of burglary but one of murder.  In my reckoning it makes little difference whether the person who was shot was a Catholic or a Protestant.  The taking of life is murder.  I would not protect or support any Government that would not see to it that justice was done in such a case.  There are people living in the Republic who are wanted for serious crimes in Northern Ireland.  It is not to give Ian Paisley ammunition to say that Paddy Harte said such and such in the Dáil because there are people walking around Northern Ireland who are wanted for serious crimes in Northern Ireland and they have not been arrested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point I want to make is that I cannot stomach the type of jargon coming from the spokesmen of Fianna <Col N="3068" /> Fáil about how they are the protectors of the innocent, how they and they alone have the God-given right to be the party to be allowed bring about Irish unity. They will not face up to the responsibilities that go with that.  I can no longer live with that.  It is all very well to use well-drilled English in the national Parliament in an effort to embarrass the Government or get the Government to weaken the extradition proposals but it amounts to nothing more than a big political game.  At the end of the day it is all about votes in the Republic and not about preventing the taking of more lives in the North.  Fianna Fáil, and the Unionist Party in Northern Ireland, can no longer continue to talk about security without realising that in order to get good security they must be prepared to talk about politics of today and tomorrow.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Following my Donegal colleague I should like to say by and large I disagree with him not so much in what he is thinking as he expresses himself but rather as a result of the wrong premise on which he bases his entire contribution. He is right in saying that we are not talking about extradition worldwide although it is the guise under which the Bills is before us.  We are not talking about extradition in the broad context of the European Community which is the heading under which we find the Bill but we are playing politics.  I am not talking about Fianna Fáil or the Progressive Democrats but about the Government. The Minister gave confirmation of this when he expressed the fear in so many words that if we were to go through with <Col N="3069" /> the context of the amendments before us we would be wrecking the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  I wish we would go through with the amendments not just for their own sake but so that they would wreck the Anglo-Irish so-called Agreement. The Government's pretensions and argument in the House are in favour of the Bill which takes away safeguards regarded as sacrosanct here and in many countries throughout the world.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Malley was correct in the arguments he advanced in favour of his amendment.  He expressed himself in ordinary everyday language that was easy for a lay person to understand.  He told us his amendment was seeking no more and no less than the requirement that a <i>prima facie</i> case be made before our district courts to justify the returning of a person to a higher court for trial.  That is the nub of the matter and no matter how glib, suave, low-keyed or reasonable the Minister may sound &mdash; all attributes that apply to the Minister occupying the front bench on the Government side and a few more &mdash; the fact remains that the Government through their Minister are attempting to put a face on something that is contrary to our sense of justice and the application and administration of justice here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had the experience of being before a district court on five occasions before my case was heard and due to a lack of evidence put before that court I was not returned for trial.  On the same occasion, back in 1970 or 1971 on the occasion of the so-called Arms Trial, four other so-called co-conspirators were returned for trial.  In their collective wisdom the legal luminaries did not offer any argument against the case put before that court. My legal advisers put forward an argument and I was not returned for trial because the district court held that there was no evidence to sustain the case against me.  It cost the others thousands of pounds to get a not-guilty verdict in the higher court.  I could not afford that type of money and that is why I was glad there was a requirement that the State should establish a <i>prima facie</i> case in the district court.  If I was treated in the <Col N="3070" /> manner proposed under the Bill grave injustice would be done and hardship inflicted on people even if they were exonerated later on.  In my view a public outcry would result against this alleged justice.  However, the procedure seems to be good enough if we are being requested by some foreign administration to hand over one of our citizens or one of our residents.  It is extradition on request.</P>
    <P>Deputy Taylor in more detail outlined the ludicrous situations that will arise if this Bill goes through.  A police officer, giving an opinion based on a statement by a third party or an alleged witness or a supergrass, could come along and satisfy the office empowered to give the documentation for a certificate, that a person was wanted for serious crimes.  In such circumstances we would deliver that person.  Why not save ourselves a great lot of money, take the window dressing off and tell all and sundry: &ldquo;When we get this Bill through all you will have to do is to send your police here with a bit of paper and do not waste the time of our Garda, do not be taking up time that we have not got through a charade in our courts&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Let us have them in and report to the Minister's office and say there: &ldquo;I am here to pick up Johnny Smith, we want him, there is a document duly signed&rdquo;. Let them bear the cost of taking him away instead of us wasting our money as well as denying the rights of our citizens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Harte spoke about parallels. They were total nonparallels.  He spoke about the soldiers who shot people in Derry on Bloody Sunday.  He asked what would have happened if they had taken refuge in Donegal &mdash; would we be concerned about protecting them from extradition to the Six Counties?  If they had <Col N="3071" /> come to Donegal or any of the other 26 counties after that shooting there would not be anything to extradite &mdash; they would have gone back in boxes.  Deputy Harte's blind spot runs through a few other Fine Gael people, though there are a few of them who are very unhappy about this Bill.  Parties being what they are, and with the prospect of an election those people do not stand up.  Put your toe over the line in the party system and either your toe is taken off or you do not have any shoe for the toe thereafter.  You may have no future in politics.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>You are a patient man. You have listened to much.  It is difficult to forget some of the crazy things advanced here by some Deputies, including myself sometimes.  When young Leonard was shot in Pettigo, our territory, by the RUC in the early days of these troubles, what was done about that death?  Was there ever a final inquest or any evidence or representations sent to such an inquest from a Government representing our interests in the Six Counties?  Was an effort ever made to identify and to extradite the RUC officer who shot that man in the back from his side of the Six Counties?  That young man was within yards of his home, the perpetrator being on the Six Counties side of the invisible line.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would invite Deputy Harte to make parallels with such incidents.  Instead of talking about the soldiers in Derry he would be making a sensible contribution to the debate.  Our citizens and residents are entitled at least to the <i>prima facie</i> requirement.  That protection is required more by the citizen for whom extradition is requested than for the person to be tried in the Irish courts.  If we were seriously concerned about extradition between ourselves and the other signatories of the Convention for the Suppression of Terrorism &mdash; this Bill was promised under the Anglo-Irish Agreement <Col N="3072" /> as part of what we were giving &mdash; we would be saying that, whatever might be the merits of anything the Government might concoct and put before the House, with the record of the administration of justice in respect of Irish people in Britain, we would extradite to other countries in Europe or throughout the world but not to the UK or the Six Counties because of their known record which brings discredit to the world wide reputation for British justice.  There is British justice and there is British justice for the Irish, two distinct things.  The Birmingham Six, the Guildford Four and the Maguires are the ones that are sticking out like sore thumbs, but there are many other injustices which are causing suffering and hardship to those incarcerated in British prisons but who have not got a strong enough lobby behind them to emphasise the injustices that have been done.</P>
    <P>They are handed over by the Irish &mdash; the British do not do it to their own.  Under this Bill we will gladly hand over our people on the flimsiest request to face courts in Britain that have been shown to be flawed when an accused is Irish, particularly if there is any suggestion that dealing with an offence is connected in any way with politics or terrorism.  If you sent your dog to be tried in a Six County court you would be up before the cruelty to animals people down here for letting your dog be put through the charade of what happens at trials up there.  Knowing the manner of their performance, knowing the manner in which justice is not administered, knowing that their police force are partisan, knowing the UDR and all the paraphernalia that go with them, their shoot-to-kill policy and the wiping out of Stalker and his inquiry &mdash; we are getting some of it now because they cannot keep it down; Stalker was not taken out because of his bad health or his bad conduct, as he has proved, but because he was too near the bone &mdash; we are still prepared to send our citizens to the tender mercies of that justice administration.</P>
    <P>We must be the daftest people in the world and the laughing stock of the <Col N="3073" /> world.  We have had proven in the European Court the crimes committed in the name of justice by the degrading, inhuman treatment meted out to prisoners by the British administration.  That is recorded in the Court.  We went to a great deal of trouble and expense to prove our case in that Court, yet, having got that verdict, having the evidence continue, we must be the laughing stock of Europe if we trust that other administration to such a degree that we are prepared to hand people over merely on the request of the authorities up there. That is what we are proposing to do.  That is why the UK and the Six Counties above all other places must be taboo in so far as extradition is concerned.  To those who talk about the streets of our cities and towns, the Border towns in particular, being over-populated with criminals who are wanted for atrocious offences in the Six Counties, I say what about that gift that the Government gave them in the past, the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act?  Why do they not avail of it?  Why have they not had a rush of cases down here to be heard under that Act?  Let me tell you.  Because they do not have the evidence to sustain the cases that they would like to put on record of these offences alleged to have been committed by named people who have had to get out and are living on this side of the Border.  That is why they have not come before this.  That is why they have not come under the extradition laws as they stand because even under those laws they would have to show a fair bit of cause. They would have to show something, but under this law, if enacted, they will have to show nothing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government are trying to make this their last will and testament in favour of the British Premier, Mrs. Thatcher, and she has the sign on them.  They can do nothing except what Mrs. Thatcher wants and they admit and agree that she has a right to occupy part of our country.  However, to get back after those interruptions, diversions, call them what you will, let me say that it was advanced here by the Minister that we have a unique situation here.  This was in his soft, pussyfooting way of being effective here in his argument.  You would hardly know he was having an argument, but he was, as I detected.  He said that the situation was unique in that many of the citizens from the adjoining Six Counties are citizens of this country. In fact, every person in the Six Counties is and has the right to be a citizen of this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Great.  Then in making this a unique situation the Minister implied, to my rather innocent way of looking at the argument he was making, <Col N="3077" /> that this was an additional reason we should not give our citizens the same right of a requirement for the prosecution or whoever it may be to produce a <i>prima facie</i> case in regard to extradition as would apply if they were being returned for trial to a higher court within our own jurisdiction in respect of a crime allegedly committed in this jurisdiction.  I do not know if that was the intent of his argument but that is what it appeared to be. If so, it makes nonsense of the whole thought that all the people on all of this island are Irish citizens.</P>
      <P>If that is the belief of the Government, why do they not propose a change in the Constitution that would remove those people, whom they feel are quite entitled to be suppressed and occupied by a foreign power in the Six Counties, from the citizenship of this country?  That would be the logical thing to do, being such a logical Government, having signed the Anglo-Irish Agreement, having undertaken to sign the European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism, on foot of which this extradition exercise comes in here.  It comes in here under the cover that it applies to the whole Community but it shows only their anxiety to satisfy the wild men and the wild claims in the Six Counties that are embarrassing Mrs. Thatcher by telling her loud and clear throughout Europe and the media that the streets of these little towns on the Border are crawling with murderers who have done bad deeds in the Six Counties. I cannot for the life of me understand how any young Minister having survived in this Government in more than one portfolio would allow himself be put in the position that he has got to try to justify what is before this House this evening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I pose one question to the Minister which is this: does this mean if we are to dish them out on request &mdash; probably it will be a slot machine operation later, computerised, micro-chipped, when they will be able to insert the card in London and get a prisoner back the following day without ever having moved a foot at all &mdash; that political asylum has gone by the board?  Is that out?  Then if we have somebody <Col N="3078" /> coming into this country, from wherever, or from any European country, allegedly wanted for an offence, do we just say: &ldquo;Sorry, boys, out you go; we have nowhere for you&rdquo;.  Does it and will it apply to other countries in the future? The Minister shakes his head as if to say &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  I am delighted that is so but I am far more concerned for the residents of this country in our jurisdiction and the citizens of the entire Thirty-two Counties, that they will be treated in a manner less favourable, affording them less opportunity to defend themselves if it is extradition they have got to face.  Is it right that they should be treated that way?  Is it not logical, if they are going to a foreign jurisdiction to face charges, that they should be even more cared for to ensure that there is a genuine case presented as <i>prima facie</i> evidence on why they should be so extradited?  Surely their protection by us, before leaving our jurisdiction, is even more important than the facilities we give our citizens in our courts in relation to crimes allegedly committed in this jurisdiction for which they may be returned for trial?  It is far more important. Yet, we are prepared to throw that out the window and retain the other.  The day has not yet come that we throw the whole lot out the window but the day may come yet when there will not be any <i>prima facie</i> evidence required at a district court, when one will be slammed into trial with whatever attendant costs, hardship and risks may be involved, without being given a chance of having one's case raked over before going to a higher court.</P>
    <P>In furtherance of his soft-footed arguments the Minister mentioned that had the <i>prima facie</i> position obtained only one case&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>My sort of logic would dictate that, with those sorts of assessment &mdash; like probably none, possibly less than one, certainly not more than one &mdash; then on the law of averages it must be that it is part of one.  How the blazes one could have part of one in such circumstances I do not know.  I will leave that to the Minister to answer later.  It would merely add up to the validity of the other softly put arguments the Minister attempts to make here which, knowing the Minister for a considerable time and knowing his powers of deduction, I do not believe he is really convinced about himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has said that to adopt these amendments &mdash; in particular that dealing with <i>prima facie</i> evidence and the other amendment which requires that we, as a country, should be satisfied the person concerned will receive a fair trial within a reasonable period, and that the general standards prevailing in the administration of justice in the place to which the person is to be removed are satisfactory and acceptable &mdash; would have the effect of negativing, or setting aside the Anglo-Irish Agreement and move us away from European norms. I do not understand the Minister when he says this.  He appears to be endeavouring to introduce just another red <Col N="3080" /> herring; we had one at the weekend, another this morning.  This would appear to be a third introduced to deflect the media and the people generally from the provisions of this Bill, to prevent them from looking at the reasonable safeguards being presented by this side of the House.</P>
      <P>Article 8 of the Anglo-Irish Agreement says:</P>
      <P>The Conference shall deal with issues of concern to both countries relating to the enforcement of the criminal law.</P>
      <P>As the Minister well knows, that has always been the case.  Further on the same agreement says:</P>
      <P>The Conference shall also be concerned with policy aspects of extradition and extra-territorial jurisdiction as between North and South.</P>
      <P>Is the Minister telling us that under the terms of this agreement somebody is saying to him: you cannot have a <i>prima facie</i> case here?  Is somebody saying to the Minister: we cannot bear to suggest that we, as a nation, should be satisfied with the standards of law enforcement and treatment of persons in custody in any country to which we extradite our citizens?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's Bill meets the requirement laid down in the Anglo-Irish Agreement. That is what leads me to believe that it is either a red herring the Minister has introduced here or that he is being dictated to, that the normal standards of international law are being set aside by somebody and are being ignored, or that the Minister is being told he must ignore them.  If so, that is not good enough.  The Minister said also that as far as we are concerned, we have a problem in relation to our citizens, we have a problem with the North of Ireland.  The Minister knows very well that is why we have the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act.  That is why we adhere to the principle of <i>aut dedere aut judicare</i>&mdash; that we will try or hand up. This is a principle of international law upheld by many more countries than the few about which we are speaking here, <Col N="3081" /> and has been so upheld for a very long time.  We subscribe to that principle.  The Minister's own predecessors in the Fine Gael Party, indeed Deputy Liam Cosgrave as Taoiseach, subscribed fully to that principle.  In 1979 the Nine partners in Europe went on to develop further extradition arrangements between those member countries on the basis of <i>aut dedere aut judicare.</i></P>
    <P>We have no apology to make for our extradition arrangements.  I was amazed that the Minister was not jumping up in his seat when he heard Deputy Harte talking about murderers walking around freely in the Republic and about people wanted in the North who are free in the Republic.  The Minister should have been quicker to protest at that than at Deputy Blaney's various contributions.  That is insulting to the Garda Síochána&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know if Deputy Harte really realises what is happening in this Act.  The purpose of this Act is to change the existing position.  The Garda <Col N="3082" /> Commissioner and the chief of the police authority in the North of Ireland have said repeatedly that if there is evidence against any individual in the Republic, then there is a mechanism whereby they can be dealt with, the Criminal Law Jurisdiction Act, 1976, which has not been used since 1982.  It is important that it go out loud and clear from this House that this Act can be used.</P>
      <P>In the context of the European Convention on Terrorism, we are looking at something extra.  This arises because the members of the Council of Europe wanted some means of dealing with the new forms of international terrorism.  It was to take a step further ahead, to designate certain offences which would not in future be regarded as political offences.  Certain offences will not be regarded as political offences in future, including unlawful seizure of an aircraft, an offence involving an attack against the life, physical integrity or liberty of an internationally protected person, the offence of kidnapping, hostage taking and an offence involving the use of an explosive or an automatic firearm, or an attempt to commit such offences or the offence of being an accomplice to a person who commits those offences.  A new category is also being introduced.  It is in the context of these new developments that we have proposed that a <i>prima facie</i> case should apply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that from time to time the question of extradition arises merely for questioning and he sees that as no problem.  I do not know if the Minister has been keeping in touch with the various events in recent times, but it certainly is a problem which should concern the Minister.  Can the Minister tell us how many people have been extradited from Ireland in the last five or ten years to other countries of the Council of Europe, for instance, Germany, the Netherlands and Italy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I thought. Those countries are probably not too worried about circumstances here, because they know they will get the kind of co-operation from us that they need. However, in Great Britain the number of persons extradited from here in 1982 was 45; in 1983, 26; in 1984, 26; in 1985, five; and in 1986 up to 31 October, three. If we look at extradition to the North we find that in 1982 there were 18; in 1983, 11; in 1984, one; in 1985, five; and in 1986 to 31 October, none.  When one considers what Deputy Harte had to say, I am surprised that he is not asking the Minister what has been happening in 1984, 1985 and 1986, when there were so few extraditions &mdash; and he likes to talk about Fianna Fáil.  We will go back to the last year when Fianna Fáil were in office.  In 1982 there were 18 extraditions to the North and 45 to Britain.  There is a certain attempt here to create an impression&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not making any such claim.  I am saying that during those periods the Criminal Law Jurisdiction Act was used and extradition was occurring. Deputy Harte is suggesting that there are people here who are wanted in the North and he seems to suggest now that there may not be evidence against such people, which is another question.

      <P>The Minister said that there was no question of extradition for questioning and that he does not see that as a problem.  I will quote from <i>The Irish Times</i> of 17 September 1982 where it says:</P>
      <P Just="Center">Extradition the best method, says Prior.</P>
      <P>Mr. Prior confirmed one point about which many observers had been unsure.  When the United Kingdom police force applies for the extradition of a suspect from the Republic, this does not mean that the police force necessarily has enough evidence to bring a charge against the suspect.</P>
      <P>The force need have only reasonable suspicion about the person in question, and apply for extradition to question the suspect rather than to charge him.</P>
      <P>The Minister would need to look to those safeguards on this extension of the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act.  It seems that the position of an Irish national would be worse than that of an English, German or French national, that an Irish national could be extradited virtually on demand whereas an English, French, German or other national could not.</P>
      <P>The Minister said he is having an examination at a high level in the requesting state.  He did not explain that system or else I did not fully catch what he said. The Minister spoke from prepared scripts on each occasion and it would have been very helpful if he had supplied them to this side of the House.  A number of Deputies have been anxious to see them. We do not have the advantage of looking at what exactly the Minister said.  As Report Stage is to be truncated there will be no time to examine his Committee State words closely and come back to them on Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was reported in the newspapers that the British DPP would examine at a high <Col N="3085" /> level a request for extradition and would satisfy himself that there was a case to be met.  The Minister mentioned in that context that here a person at a high level would be involved.  I would like him to elaborate further on that arrangement because that is all he is offering at this time.  It will be important to be clear on what exactly he is offering.  We would be left with the situation where it would be easier to extradite Irish citizens.  That is clear and it is also clear&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not what has been happening.  The Minister has rejected the <i>prima facie</i> rule, saying we could not have such a rule but there is no legal obstacle to the adoption of a <i>prima facie</i> rule in respect of all cases of extradition for a Government who are determined to introduce it.  We are only talking about a <i>prima facie</i> rule in relation to our own citizens.  We ask that no citizen of Ireland shall be extradited pursuant to the provisions of this legislation unless the District Court is satisfied on the evidence before it.  There is no legal obstacle to the adoption of a <i>prima facie</i> rule.  The European Convention on Extradition was entered into nearly 30 years ago when conditions and circumstances were <Col N="3086" /> entirely different from those pertaining today just as the conditions and circumstances were different at the time the 1965 Act was passed and when no provision was made for a <i>prima facie</i> rule.  It was very clear in that Act that a political offence or an offence connected with a political offence was excluded.</P>

      <P>Article 31 of the 1957 convention specifically provides for a country withdrawing from its obligations or, to use the technical term in international law, it provides for denunciation of the convention.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said it cannot be done.  Can you not listen?  Deputy O'Malley suggested several reasons why it can be done and I am adding to those by saying that if the Minister is determined there is a mechanism within the convention which provides for a denunciation and a re-entry.  If that is the line the Minister had to take, could we accede to the convention?</P>
      <P>In any event the convention does not prevent the introduction of a <i>prima facie</i> rule in respect of extradition to any country which is not a signatory of the 1957 convention.  The United Kingdom and the United States are not signatories of that convention.  There are various means by which the problems the Minister spoke about can be overcome if he has the will to overcome them.  We are faced with the question of a review of extradition and its extension in the sense that we are placing a limit on the political offence clause in the original Act.  This involves certain offences not being regarded as political in the future.  The categories are fairly wide.  Some are clear cut, others are open ended.  We will discuss those in greater detail when we come to the relevant sections of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important that people understand <Col N="3087" /> clearly what is or what is not a political offence in the context of extradition and how such offences are to be dealt with in future.  As I said earlier, so far as the British are concerned they are going to reserve to their Secretary of State the final decision as to what is a political offence.  They have acceded to the Convention on Terrorism.  They have legislation prepared which is for debate.  What will happen to that legislation remains to be seen but under it they are providing substantial safeguards for their own citizens and the ultimate safeguard whereby the Secretary of State will have the final say in any case where that may be necessary. What is extraordinary about the Government's approach is that they do not seem to be prepared to accept any safeguards for Irish citizens notwithstanding the fact that they are fully aware of the numerous safeguards which are operated under the convention and under the original convention in support of the citizens of the other member states.</P>
    <P>The Minister needs to re-assess the position and have another look at these amendments which have been put down by ourselves, the Progressive Democrats and the Workers' Party.  He should recognise that the intention behind these amendments is to provide a minimal safeguard for Irish citizens in the development of wider legislation relating to extradition.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann reaffirms its support for an efficient and effective semi-State sector as a major instrument of economic development and the provision of employment and deplores recent Government statements to the contrary.</P>
      <P>The Fianna Fáil Party have put down this motion because they are gravely concerned about what is happening in our economy or, more correctly, what is not happening.  We have, as this House and the country know, a stagnant economy. The present time demands clear thinking on economic objectives and on the means of achieving those objectives.  We know and have discussed in this House the fact that £1.5 billion has run out of the country before the Government's disastrous taxation policies, particularly the DIRT tax. We know that some of that £1.5 billion outflow has been as a result of repatriation of profits by companies established here, as is their right.  When many of those industries were being established by a Fianna Fáil Government, the idea was that those profits would be used for development in this country.  We know that some of the money ran out of the country because of the Government's unfortunate and mistimed devaluation of the punt last autumn, a devaluation which was totally useless in achieving what it was supposed to achieve since it was back up to 95p or 96p against the £ sterling within a very short time afterwards.  This is the background to the motion we have put down for debate in Private Members' Time this week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are not getting clear thinking or clear statements of objectives with regard to the development of the economy.  This debate may prove useful in that we hope to get from Government speakers a clarification of their thinking on the objectives of economic policy and the means of achieving those objectives.  Government <Col N="3089" /> spokesmen will have to be more forthcoming than they have been in the recent past if we are to achieve that aim.  What we want is a clarifying statement from the Government.  We do not want them speaking with forked tongues as they have been recently.  We want a clarifying statement with regard to the input of semi-State bodies to the economy.  It is only if we have clear objectives and a clear statement of the means of achieving those objectives that we can develop confidence in our economy and confidence among the investors in this economy.  The whole House knows how low investment has been throughout 1986 and this is as a direct result of the confusion about which I have been speaking.</P>
    <P>Are we to have the semi-State bodies as an engine for the development that is necessary or are we not?  We have an all-party committee which discusses, examines and probes the activities of our semi-State bodies.  The purpose of that committee and its activities is to make semi-State bodies more effective engines for development in this economy and that is also the purpose of this debate.</P>
    <P>Recently the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Noonan, stated that the Government were considering the selling off of sections of the public enterprise to private enterprise.  I want to make it clear that we on this side of the House have no ideological hangups about private industry or public industry.  What we want and have always advocated is that we should have the corporations, private or public, which will develop the country, provide employment and increase the wealth in our economy.</P>
    <P>The purpose of all the semi-State bodies, from the establishment of the ESB in 1927 to the establishment of the most recent of them, was to fill gaps that private enterprise at that time was not able to take up.  Our former leader, the great pragmatist, Sean Lemass, was significantly the man who established and developed most of the semi-State companies during the thirties.  Research was done on this quite a few years ago by a young employee of Aer Lingus, a budding <Col N="3090" /> economist named Garret FitzGerald, now Taoiseach.  In his book on the semi-State companies he gives an outline of when the greatest development took place.  There is in his analysis an account of the numbers that were established at various times.  For the years 1932 to 1939 he gives two different numbers &mdash; 13 and 14.</P>

      <P>Are we to discriminate between the roads in Dublin 4?  The Deputy should stick to the fertile fields of Meath.  Up to 1932 five semi-State bodies were established; then between 1932 and 1939 there were 14 more &mdash; if we take the higher of the two figures the Taoiseach, Deputy Garret FitzGerald, gives.  Between 1940 and 1944 five were established, then 13 between 1945 and 1951 in the aftermath of the war.  In the period 1952-1957 seven more were established and then another 10 in the years 1958-1960.  The history of those, as I said, was that they were established where private enterprise was not, in fact, fulfilling the role of development.</P>

      <P>I want to quote from the same book whose name I gave to the Ceann Comhairle and where the author said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The private sector in Ireland has in <Col N="3091" /> the past shown itself to be relatively unenterprising.</P>
    <P>He emphasises that as one of the <i>raisons d'etre</i> for the establishment of the semi-State bodies.</P>
    <P>As I said, Sean Lemass, a pragmatist, saw the gaps, saw the need and established the companies.  There were no great hang-ups, even then, about how they were to be financed because shares in some cases were invited.  However, very often there was a poor response and then the decision was taken to fund them from the Exchequer.  That is part of the background to this debate and the statements made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Noonan, were what prompted us to demand a clarification which I have mentioned, in the interests of clear thinking, clearly set objectives and clearly set means to achieve those objectives &mdash; and how important they are in the present state of the country, in the present state of the economy.</P>
    <P>I know that Sean Lemass had no great hang-up about how these companies would be financed.  If private investment were available he was glad to invite, to support and sustain it.  We do know that throughout long periods of that time Irish money was being invested abroad rather than at home and that cagey bankers preferred to place their investments elsewhere than in Ireland.  We had the case of the late lamented Frank Aiken indicating that perhaps we would have to come to grips with the banks and force them to lend money to worthwhile developmental enterprises at a cut rate of interest, rates of interest which were lower than the general market of that time was demanding.</P>
    <P>In a sense we became more State controlled, if you like, &ldquo;socialist&rdquo;, than many of the countries that were <i>ex professo</i> in that line at that time.  The total gross fixed investment was higher than the European average at that time, although there were socialists in office part of that time.  The hiving off of full State enterprises such as we had recently with An Post and <Col N="3092" /> Telecom Éireann was another way in which the semi-State companies came about.  The economic and social conditions that obtained when many of these companies were established do not necessarily obtain today, so that it is no harm for us in the House or for the all-party committee to have a look at what is going on.</P>
    <P>The incentives for private enterprise are now much greater than they were and I think that the climate and the inclination among enterpreneurs to take risks is greater now, or at least was greater until this Government laid their clammy dead hand on the economy four years ago. I know that Keynes defended the Irish system of investment in semi-State bodies in his time.  He said it was justified, as he justified our protectionist policy at one time.  Again, in the context of the time he was right and the policy, which was mainly a Fianna Fáil policy, was justifiable and justified.</P>
    <P>The point that I am coming to now is that in the personnel of this Government it has come to a position where there is an ideological dichotomy.  No sooner had the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Noonan, made his speech about the selling off to private interests of some branches of the semi-State or State bodies than we had Mr. Carroll of the Transport and General Workers' Union coming out and heavily attacking this development.  I want to say a few words about that.  The unfortunate thing about this is that they will get involved in an ideological melee.</P>
    <P>We tend to imitate what is happening in Britain in all our actions, in this country and with this particular Government. This is the problem, and the Minister for Industry and Commerce in referring to this selling off was, of course, thinking of what has been happening in Britain with regard to the telecommunications industry, the gas industry, the selling of Sealink etc.  That is a poor argument if it is not thought out in the context of our economy. It is very disappointing but not surprising that the Government are going down that road.  We know that the selling off of State-owned companies is going on <Col N="3093" /> in Britain.  In France, Mitterand's Government nationalised many companies and Shirac's Government tend to sell them off.  Going down that road here seems to be aping what others are doing without any substance behind it.</P>
    <P>
      <i>The Economist,</i> which everybody knows is a conservative economic journal, has been for some time indicating the uselessness, in a long term context, of selling off valuable assets such as the British Tory Government have been selling for some time.  They have indicated that it brings an immediate improvement in the finances as you see them but, in fact, it has no long term impact on the improvement of the finances of the country. I think that it was Lord Stockton, a former British Prime Minister, who said that it was selling the family's silver.  The immediate excess of wealth is welcomed at the time but, in fact, the family &mdash; in this case the State &mdash; is impoverished as a result.  We want to know what the Government's thinking is on this.  Is it the intention of the Minister for Industry and Commerce to sell off what is profitable and leave what is unprofitable as a burden on the State?  Surely the Irish people have an interest in maintaining what is profitable and certainly this side of the House would be very much dedicated to the principle, which we outlined in our document published in the autumn of 1982. <i>The Way Forward,</i> that we wanted vigorous, commercially viable, efficient State enterprises and that those were the principles upon which we would act with regard to semi-State bodies.</P>
    <P>We know also that the people now expect both management and workers of the semi-State bodies and semi-State companies to realise &mdash; that is, the commercial ones, &mdash; that they are in the market and that the taxpayer is not going to provide a never failing fund for financing them in the future.  I think that the workers and the management in practically all the semi-State bodies realise that and can be so motivated as to produce profits and keep viable industry going.</P>
    <P>I could deal with many semi-State bodies, including Dublin Gas and Aer <Col N="3094" /> Lingus, but other speakers will deal with them.  I will confine my remarks to Irish Shipping which were put into liquidation on 3 December 1984.  I said before in the House that this was a scandalous, poorly thought-out operation.  According to <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> payments scheduled for Irish Shipping for 1986 &mdash; up to 30 November &mdash; amount to £51,279,626.  For 1985 the figure was £14,350,752.  I see also that a sum of £25 million was allocated to the B &amp; I.</P>
    <P>Some people estimate that we have spent £100 million on Irish Shipping and we do not have a tub, punt or fishing boat to show for that money as far as Irish Shipping are concerned.  This is disgraceful for many reasons and the Government should face up to their responsibilities in regard to Irish Shipping and the disaster which they caused.  Personnel with skills, training and experience have been badly treated by their employers.  This was a 100 per cent Irish company and this side of the House backed resolutions expressing their anger at such treatment.  Many speakers on the Government side also made speeches to this effect but it has not moved the Government who are impervious to all suggestions, whether humane or developmental.</P>
    <P>I know that the committee set up to examine the question of a deep sea fleet reported to the Minister for Communications. He did not tell me what the report contained but he indicated in a Green Paper that we should have a deep sea fleet.  I should like a commitment from the Minister for Finance in regard to that proposition.  It does not mean wild spending; after all the <i>Irish Spruce</i> was sold for something over £3 million.  It was a 70,000 tonne ship and, at that rate, for a very modest investment we could have quite a large fleet.  Of course we do not necessarily need a large fleet but we should start off a deep sea fleet with one handy sized ship and when it makes a profit we should expand the fleet further out of profits as Irish Shipping did for 15 years before they were liquidated by the Government.  I know problems exist in regard to crewing and outflagging but <Col N="3095" /> those problems will have to be looked at in the context of the establishment of a deep sea fleet.  I am sure those problems can be solved as technology is now more sophisticated in regard to ships.  A deep sea fleet could be State or privately owned, or a mixture of both, but we should certainly have one.  I call on the Government to indicate the position.  I quote from the book which I mentioned already.  The author, now the Taoiseach, said:</P>
    <P>The policies of State enterprises in respect of competition with private enterprise have hitherto been unduly cautious and the fear of &ldquo;treading on the corns of private enterprise&rdquo; has inhibited economic development desirable in the national interest.</P>
    <P>Is that the thinking which informs the Government's philosophy or are they influenced by the thinking revealed by the Minister, Deputy Noonan, in his broadcast?  The Government, through their Ministers, owe it to the House to clarify their economic objectives and the place of an efficient and effective semi-State sector in that development and in the achievement of those objectives.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this motion and I will deal at some length with the future of Bord na Móna and the Government's plans in regard to their future.  Since the crisis in Bord na Móna in the middle of the year owing to the bad weather, a very serious situation developed when they announced they would have to lay off over 2,000 workers.  Over 1,000 of them are from County Offaly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsequently, the weather improved and thanks to the workforce of Bord na Móna they were able to harvest almost 90 per cent which was a great achievement. Our thanks must go to the management and workforce for being able to achieve so much.  However, Bord na Móna products will run out next June which will create a cash flow problem.  I was on a deputation from Offaly County Council to the Minister for Energy and we put <Col N="3096" /> forward proposals which would put Bord na Móna on a sound financial footing but nothing has happened.  The loan of £27 million which Bord na Móna received from the Exchequer should be turned into equity capital.  The Government could offer Bord na Móna a loan of £25 million.  They already have borrowings of £120 million as well as the £25 million to which I referred.  I estimate that interest charges on these combined loans will be over £20 million per year which is an enormous amount.</P>
    <P>In the midlands and in Mayo, Donegal, Galway, Kildare, Westmeath and Meath the people depend solely on Bord na Móna.  This applies particularly to my county where they are the main employer.  Over 50 per cent of the workforce in the constituency of Laois-Offaly are employed by them.  As a semi-State body they have served the country well and served our people well.  Approximately 5,000 people are permanently employed by Bord na Móna and when harvesting operations commence in the spring they employ approximately 3,000 people on casual labour.  That brings employment in Bord na Móna to 8,000. Bord na Móna also give work to other industries.  They are very much involved in spin-off employment.  The commitment of the Government to Bord na Móna must be called into question.  Since we met the Minister for Energy nothing has happened.  Possibly he said to himself at the time that Fianna Fáil would take care of it in the New Year.  If that is the case, so be it.  We will deal with it effectively when the time comes.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, we must look at all aspects of Bord na Móna and their operations. I regret there seems to be a loss of confidence in the workforce at present. They are not sure of the commitment of the Government to Bord na Móna.  The Minister did not spell out his future plans for them.  Bord na Móna should take control of forestry and should take on a programme of drainage and tree planting. By doing so it would create additional jobs which is very important. The forestry department has not expanded in the way it should.  Bord na <Col N="3097" /> Móna have the equipment and the personnel and, together with the employees of the forestry department are very capable of expanding in that area, of giving more employment and carrying out further development.</P>
    <P>Peat is a national resource and we have complete and utter control over it.  We can decide the future and potential of the industry.  Bord na Móna may not produce the cheapest type of energy for the generation of electricity but a few years ago when there was an oil crisis we were very glad to have them.  It was of great benefit then to this nation.  The Government's commitment to the development of Bord na Móna, especially in western regions, must be called into question.  I cannot understand why the briquette factory at Ballyforan was not kept open.  Because of its closure briquettes were rationed. We would have been able to supply the west and the North of Ireland with briquettes had that factory remained open.  There is no point in giving the cost factor as a reason for closing it down, when we take into account the cost of Dublin Gas and the cost of Bord na Móna.</P>
    <P>Bord na Móna, as a semi-State company, managed their affairs extremely well but owing to two bad years they met with production problems.  Everybody knows that.  They are now looking for a small amount of capital to make the board viable again.  I see no reason why the Government should not give the necessary equity capital to Bord na Móna.  Legislation to deal with that should be prepared.  I would not like to see another work study group being set up to look into the affairs of Bord na Móna.  We have all the necessary personnel to expand Bord na Móna and to instil confidence in the workforce.</P>
    <P>I do not think the Government understand how vital Bord na Móna are to all-parts of the country, where they give employment.  I am led to believe that redundancies are about to take place in Bord na Móna in Mayo and I regret that. It has also been brought to my notice that <Col N="3098" /> Bord na Móna want to lay off approximately 400 people on a temporary basis. This would be all right if negotiations took place with the unions, the management and the workforce involved.  As far as I understand no employees are looking for temporary lay-offs in Bord na Móna.  They want to see the board on a sound financial footing.  The Government have an opportunity to do that.  I will be interested to see what plans the Government have for Bord na Móna.  I want to warn them if they do not take the necessary measures in regard to the financing of Bord na Móna a serious difficulty will arise early next year.</P>
    <P>I propose that equity capital of £27 million be put into Bord na Móna in order to put the company on a sound financial footing.  That will give confidence back to the workforce.  Bord na Móna need to carry out a lot of work such as drainage.  I cannot understand why the Government have not made an application to the EC for research and development in regard to the cutaway bogs.  That can be done. Recently I met the vice-chairman of the Energy Committee of the European Parliament. He told me if a proposal was put forward by the Irish Government in that respect they would give very favourable consideration to it.  I should like to know why that proposal has not been submitted. This calls into question the Government's commitment to Bord na Móna.  Will the Minister tell us why that proposal has not been put to the EC? The Government are being called upon to clarify their future proposals in regard to Bord na Móna.  The people in the midlands will be watching the Government's performance very closely and if they fail to live up to our expectations we will have to take over the administration of the country and put Bord na Móna on a proper footing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Our amendment seeks to delete all words after employment and to substitute the following:</P>
      <P>...supports Government policy towards, the semi-State sector, and notes the steps that they have taken to improve the performance of the sector &mdash; including Exchequer investment on a major scale.</P>
      <P>The Opposition have sought to make much of seeking clarification of the Government's position in regard to the development of semi-State companies and I will be happy to give that clarification in the course of my contribution. However, the opposition might like to clarify their position on the matter.  There seems to be a remarkable difference between what Deputy Wilson and Deputy Connolly have been saying in this debate and remarks made recently in the <i>Evening Herald</i> by Deputy Seamus Brennan, his party's nominee as vice-chairman of the Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies.  Deputy Brennan said that Fianna Fáil have no ideological hand-up about the ownership issue and that if they feel that the best way to get State companies working to create employment is to sell a minority stake to the public they will not flinch from that. Deputy Brennan indicated a preparedness to consider selling shares in State companies, in response to that interview.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is interesting to note that Deputy Brennan has not been invited to contribute in this debate and that reference has not been made by the other Opposition speakers to his remarks.  It would be useful if the remarks of Deputies Brennan and Wilson could be set side by side so that we could get some clarification from the Opposition as to what their position is.  Perhaps they might pause in between putting questions to <Col N="3100" /> the Government side to answer a few questions themselves.  That would be very welcome because the workers in Bord na Móna would like to know if Deputy Brennan's idea of selling shares is something that commands general support from Deputies Connolly and Hyland.  It would be useful if Deputy Brennan was brought into the debate so that he could explain the Fianna Fáil position on this issue.  Fianna Fáil Deputies have raised the question and they should answer it as well as making a big song and dance about asking us to answer questions.</P>
    <P>The Government are very conscious of the positive contribution which the semi-State sector has made over the years to the growth and development of the Irish economy.  In many instances this contribution has continued to the present day.  Before considering further the question of State-sponsored bodies it might be useful to mention briefly the historical reasons for the establishment, growth and development of this sector.  The setting up and development of the public enterprise sector since the establishment of the State was not, viewed in an overall context, a coherently planned operation. As I remarked to Deputy Wilson, in many cases the State came into ownership of these companies because they had gone burst in private ownership.  I have no wish to go into a long, historical account about this matter but I must point out that it is only since the early sixties that there has been an attempt to establish a coherent policy as far as State enterprises are concerned.  Since then successive Governments have dealt, with varying degrees of success, with the operations of those agencies and have considered the part which they are expected to play in promoting the economic development of the country.  Times have changed, however, since most of the present semi-State bodies were established.</P>
    <P>No less than the private sector, State bodies have had to grapple with the problems which have afflicted the world's economy in recent years.  Some of these problems have been overcome.  Others have proved more obstinate.  As well as <Col N="3101" /> these general problems many State bodies face particular difficulties in regard to specific sectors which I am sure will be discussed in the course of the debate.  In every instance however the Government have expended considerable resources of energy, time and finance in order to deal with the problems facing those State bodies.  Since the Government took office the trading results on the part of quite a number of State companies have been considerably improved as a result of the coherent and supportive approach that the Government have had towards solving the problems of semi-State companies.</P>
    <P>For example, Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann turned losses of £22 million into profits of £2 million.  Aer Lingus had profits of £19 million compared to £4 million losses in 1982 under the previous administration which included those who have been speaking so eloquently tonight.  Aer Rianta's profits of £5 million in 1982 increased under the Coalition Government to £12 million in 1985.  A number of bodies suffered losses including Bórd na Móna whose profits dropped from £14 million to £5 million but they can be explained by certain phenomena such as the weather.</P>
    <P>The Government have given substantial financial support to semi-State bodies.  In the period 1980 to 1985 the Exchequer provided support by way of equity finance for reconstruction and investment in State bodies to the tune of £884 million of taxpayers' money.  That is a considerable amount of money to be put into the semi-State sector by a Government to improve their balance sheets and assist them to achieve a profitable trading performance.  It indicates in more meaningful terms than any of the words we have heard from the opposite side of the House the Government's continued support for coherently planned State enterprises.</P>
    <P>Obviously, this kind of support cannot go on indefinitely.  There is not an unlimited pool of taxpayers' money for equity injections in State companies.  Harsh decisions have sometimes to be taken and not every development programme put <Col N="3102" /> forward by a State company can be financed.  The State has its own financial problems to consider.  The important thing is that the State should conduct its business with the semi-State bodies on a realistic and informed basis.  One of the things that the Government have done to achieve this is the introduction of corporate plans.  Indeed, that was probably the most significant initiative in regard to the commercial State bodies undertaken by the Government.  They now have a formalised system of corporate planning. It is true that most of the bodies had previously been engaged in some kind of forward planning but this is the first time it has been done on a centralised basis.</P>
    <P>In July 1983 the Government decided that Ministers should request commercial State bodies under the aegis of their Departments to prepare corporate plans for the period 1984 to 1988.  All bodies from whom corporate plans had been sought have submitted them.  Subsequently, commercial State bodies were asked to prepare rolled over plans for the further period 1985 to 1989.  Guidelines for the preparation of the plans, including information on assumptions on GNP growth, price inflators, interest rates and exchange rates were provided to enable them to do this planning on a consistent basis across the entire public sector.  The vast bulk of the bodies have submitted plans on that basis.</P>
    <P>At the beginning of this year, bodies were requested to prepare plans for the period 1986-90.  These plans were to include performance and financial targets. The ultimate objectives were indicated to the bodies as being:</P>
    <P>(i) to reach a measure of consensus, or at least mutual understanding, on key issues such as the proposed policies of bodies, the assumptions underlying plans and financial and performance targets; and</P>
    <P>(ii)  to give prior notice, and afford the opportunity of advance consideration, of significant policy or other issues which could be expected to arise during the period covered by the plans.</P>
    <P>The plans will, therefore, provide the <Col N="3103" /> framework within which a dialogue can take place between Departments and bodies.  Ultimate responsibility for plans lies of course with the boards and managements of the planning bodies.</P>
    <P>In simple English, it means that where previously problems of State companies were dealt with on an <i>ad hoc</i>, willy-nilly basis &mdash; whenever a company had problems there was a crisis meeting of the Cabinet, somebody decided to put money in, to put some form of bandage in place to keep the body's operation in steady continuance &mdash; now there is a formalised system of corporate plan.  All bodies are required to say in advance what they expect their problems to be in the next four years so that action can be taken by them and by the Government to avoid those problems.  Naturally, the bodies that had not been providing corporate plans for the future were the ones that most needed to do it and that is why it is essential to have it done for all bodies instead of taking consolation in the fact that some bodies had them already.  That is why the Government's decision has been so important.  It will affect permanent improvement in the performances of State companies.  It is one of the reasons why the profitability of companies has improved, as I indicated earlier.</P>
    <P>The next development in this area has been through the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Commercial State-Sponsored Bodies.  It is worth recalling that that body were set up through the initiative of the Fine Gael and Labour Parties who put this forward when they were in Opposition in the sixties.  The committee have been a very important instrument of parliamentary administration.  In there fifth report recently they produced a general set of recommendations in regard to the operation of State companies and I am glad to say there is no divergence between Government policies in practice and the recommendations of that committee.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I will come to that.  I want to make an announcement in regard to Government decisions taken in the last week on a very important aspect of the administration of semi-State companies in regard to the format of their annual reports and accounts.  We will all agree that if semi-State bodies do not produce accounts that can be compared one with the other and with similar accounts of competing bodies in the private sector we cannot know how these bodies are actually performing.  There is tremendous facility in the accountants profession not only for revealing but concealing information in accounts.  That is why it is extremely important that there should be, as there will be as a result of the Government decision which I am about to announce, uniformity and clarity in the nature of the accounts of State companies and the process of their provision.</P>
      <P>I want to read into the record the specific decisions the Government have taken on this.  They are not in my circulated speech but I will give them to the House just the same.  I stress that the blanket application of these measures to all State-sponsored bodies may not be feasible or desirable and discussions will be held with the Departments concerned on the practical application of each of the recommendations. It may be that some variations may be necessary in order to cater for individual circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First, the format of the annual reports and accounts of each State body should be examined by the body itself, the parent Department and the Department of Finance, in consultation with each other, in the light of certain comprehensive guidelines which will be circulated in the next few days to the bodies concerned and the particular circumstances of the bodies.  Two, any alterations considered desirable as a result of the above examination to the existing format of annual reports will be implemented in regard to annual reports and accounts for financial years commencing after 31 March 1987. Three, the board of each State body should supply to the Minister, at the same time as they submit their annual report and accounts, a brief report on matters <Col N="3105" /> likely to affect the short term or long term viability of the body which would not be appropriate to refer to in the annual report and accounts.</P>
    <P>Four, the annual report and accounts of each body should be published or when publication is not required submitted to the Government not later than six months after the end of the relevant financial year.  Five, the draft unaudited accounts for each State body should be furnished to parent Departments and the Department of Finance not later than two months after the end of the relevant financial year, but in cases where fulfilment of this requirement would cause unjustifiable difficulties for bodies, the deadline should be extended in exceptional circumstances, subject to the consent of the Minister of the Department concerned.  Six, each State body should provide the parent Department and the Department of Finance with detailed management accounts reconciled with the annual report in cases where published audited accounts do not provide sufficient information to enable Departments to evaluate fully the financial performances of State bodies.</P>
    <P>Seven, each commercial State body should furnish to their parent Department and the Department of Finance, not later than the eighth month of the financial year, interim unaudited reports for the first half of that year together with a statement by the chairman of the body on the performance of the body to date that year and likely developments during the remainder of the year.  Eight, that Ministers should suggest to the State bodies that audit committees be established in the bodies to examine financial statements on internal financial controls, and report to the boards of the bodies.</P>
    <P>This is a very comprehensive set of decisions by the Government to improve the reports of State bodies from the point of view of information, accuracy and comparability and this will prove of great long term benefit to Deputies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not have a copy of that document which the Minister went <Col N="3106" /> through with great speed.  We may wish to comment on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government have also decided that a system of appointing members of State boards should be improved on in the following way:</P>
      <P>(i)  A register of suitable appointees be compiled, in consultation with bodies such as the IDA, CTT, ICTU and IMI.</P>
      <P>(ii)  Ministers should establish, for the board of each State body under their aegis, the range of competences required at board level and, for each new board appointee, to seek to match the requirements of the board with the specific talents of prospective appointees.</P>
      <P>(iii)  Ministers should meet with new board appointees at the time of their appointment &mdash; this is to ensure that the appointees are made aware of what is required from them.</P>
      <P>These measures can only further improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the boards in question and ultimately, of course; the bodies under their control.</P>
      <P>Finally, I would remind the House of another major initiative taken by this Government &mdash; the establishment of the National Development Corporation. This body have wide-ranging functions and the power to invest in many sectors of the economy, including fisheries, forestry, tourism, food processing, marketing services and academic research.</P>
      <P>As an indication of the seriousness with which the Government greeted the establishment of the corporation, the share capital of the body was set at £300 million and the Government provided for the use by the corporation of any moneys on investments they receive and any profits and dividends accruing to it.  The Government are confident that the corporation will be a source of venture capital in cases where profitability is anticipated on a longer time-scale than financial institutions would be prepared to accept.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The corporation have a solid statutory base.  Their terms of reference have been debated and agreed in the House.  They <Col N="3107" /> are a much stronger and more solidly based body, and represent a much more solid commitment by the State than the company incorporated in private law that could be struck off at a moment's notice, namely, the National Enterprise Agency. The National Development Corporation have a mandate from this House to establish and assist in the establishment of new enterprises in the food processing sector, in the information technology area, new companies to provide joint services to existing companies such as joint marketing companies, joint purchasing companies or joint companies for any purpose which individual companies on their own are unable to finance.</P>
    <P>All of this will be done by the State through the NDC on an equity basis.  In other words, if any investment made by the NDC is a success there will be profits coming back to the State in dividends and these will be available for further investment by the State and the NDC in new agencies.  That is a very significant improvement on the position that existed.  Heretofore, the parties in the House were more than happy to see very substantial sums given out in the form of IDA grants to companies.  This was simply free money given to companies from which the taxpayers received no return whatsoever.</P>
    <P>The fact that we now have an equity investment body that will not just give money to companies to help job creation but will be in a position to get a return from that investment represents a major advance.  I should like to know from the party opposite what is their position in regard to the legislation passed by the House to establish the NDC.  Will they go through the charade, if they ever return to office, of repealing the legislation? Will they come to the House to repeal something which the ICTU President described as a very good development? He said clearly that he would be strongly opposed to any attempt to take away this statutorily established instrument in the possession of the State designed to insert equity capital in business. Will the Opposition if they return <Col N="3108" /> to office waste the time of the House dismantling a very important investment agency established by the Government and the House in the past few years? It would be very foolish indeed for any responsible party to contemplate changing that legislation which represents a firm, tangible commitment by the State in this country to being equity into a private company and capital amounts to create jobs.  Let me stress that the corporation investment will be giving a return to the State for investment.</P>
    <P>The corporation have involved themselves in enterprises which no semi-State body up to now have done, for instance fisheries.  Deputy Haughey goes on television and radio talking about investment in technological matters and I do not know where he gets the words he uses. I should like to know where he wants investment made.  Does he want to dismantle any body set up by this House under this Government?  We have Deputy Séamus Brennan's comments in the <i>Evening Herald</i> in complete contradiction of Deputy Wilson's unctuous comments here tonight in regard to Fianna Fáil's commitments on State investment and the fact that they are committed to certain things without giving precise details of what should be done.  There is complete contradiction in their policy in regard to each area on which they have the temerity to express their views.</P>
    <P>I was interested in Deputy Wilson's comments on currency adjustments.  He was repeating Fianna Fáil's obsession in regard to Britain.  When we pass legislation Fianna Fáil say that we are following the British line.  Some time ago Deputy John Kelly said that Fianna Fáil were copying the best of British legislation three or four years after it had been passed.  Deputy Wilson spoke of the effect of devaluation on our competitiveness, <i>vis-à-vis</i> sterling.  Does he realise that only 33 per cent of our trade goes to the sterling area and that another one-third goes to the area covered by our European partners in continental Europe?</P>
    <P>The party opposite &mdash; now that they <Col N="3109" /> are the party more than 60 years old &mdash; would do well to grow up a little, stop having this obsession with the problems that brought about the creation of their party and with the attitudes to Britain which have been so much part of their stock-in-trade of political debate.  They might grow up and realise that we are now a European nation, that now one-third only, and falling, of our trade goes to Britain.  I am talking about currency policy solely in terms of our relationship with sterling&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Seeing that I have summoned Deputy Wilson back into the House &mdash; from whatever lofty place he had ensconced himself in order to avoid listening to my contribution &mdash; I should like to comment on another one of his rather rowdy interruptions when he sought to make reference to the deposit interest retention tax.  If the deposit interest retention tax had frightened money out of the country, as Deputy Wilson, all his imitators and all Deputy Haughey's friends on the far side of the House seems to indicate, then how in God's name did we succeed in getting a bigger yield from the deposit interest retention tax than we had expected?</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the Minister comes into the House and after delaying, opposing, holding up and doing all he could with the NDC, he puts them forward tonight as the reason this Government are really interested in semi-State enterprises. If he had any interest at all in that he would have gone to the trouble of appointing the chief executive; that he has not done.  A temporary appointment of a person from one of the financial management groups settled that.  Unfortunately, the Minister would not want to listen to that.  The Bill was foisted on him at the risk of the Government collapsing for a number of years.  About the only thing the Labour Party managed to do in this Dáil was to force that Bill on this House and the Minister set up the NDC in a halfhearted way.  In all his ranting and raving for the last half-hour he never said at any time what they had done.  He said they had the vehicle, the nucleus, the powers and this and that, but they have been talked about since the programme for Government back in 1982. The Minister in his half-hour, during which he was not interrupted until the last minute or so, brought forward not one thing that they had done.  The record must state that the Minister came in and gave his speech and his only defence of what this Government would do for the semi-State sector was that the NDC &mdash; whom they opposed through the life of this Dáil and for whom he refused to appoint a chief executive &mdash; was set up. That is why this motion is down.  We on this side of the House want clarification of Government policy in relation to the semi-State sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In all the statements made by various Ministers, particularly Deputy Noonan, the privatisation of the semi-State sector is now part of Government policy, is being considered and will be acted upon. My colleague, Deputy Wilson, talked about seeing a further Irish Shipping in the life of this Dáil and the Minister attacked us about not being concerned <Col N="3113" /> about, interested in or being the party who stood over semi-State enterprises. While Deputy Wilson was out we were blamed for that.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that anybody in the country or even in those benches over there and certainly not in the Labour benches believes that Fianna Fáil would have treated semi-State bodies such as Irish Shipping and Ceimicí Teoranta in the way they have been dealt with.  The Land Commission and others have been denuded of their powers, abolished or liquidated over the last four years.  It never would have happened under Fianna Fáil.  Deputy Bruton asked that Fianna Fáil clarify what is their philosophy and then he spoke about planning. Let me mention a few points he made.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil's policy throughout the term of all their Ministers of Finance and Industry and Commerce has been that the semi-State organisations should operate in areas where private enterprise could not or would not be commercially viable or which they could not deal with. That is why Fianna Fáil were involved in so many semi-State organisations throughout the years.  We will continue with that policy.  Deputy Lemass when bringing forward the Development Bill, 1946, that Deputy Connolly mentioned, explained it in great detail.  This party have continued in that philosophy and that ethos to this day over 40 years later. I will not quote from the Official Report on that because I have not the time to do so but I refer Deputies to that report of 27 February 1946, volume 99.  People on the other side should read that because it sets out how a semi-State company can develop the resources of this country and at the same time co-operate and co-ordinate with outside private interests.  That is not by means of shareholding, privatising or takeovers by outside interests. It has been done successfully in numerous semi-State organisations.  I mentioned that one because Deputy Connolly spoke about it at length and the Minister attacked him on that.</P>
    <P>That indicates Fianna Fáil's thinking down the years.  It was the argument that <Col N="3114" /> Deputy Wilson, I and others put forward in all the debates we have had in the life of this Dáil about Irish Shipping, how that matter could have been dealt with in another way and how we continue to develop our semi-State bodies.</P>
    <P>This is not an argument that our semi-State organisations cannot be efficient and effective.  Trade unions leaders were being quoted in vain.  Deputy Prendergast would not like to hear that, but the policy of the ICTU is that private enterprise have had ample opportunity in recent decades.  I agree with that argument. Money has been poured in through various grants, incentives, tax reliefs, manufacturing grants reliefs and so on against employment.  All of these grants were put in to modernise and up-date industry and what happened?  They got the grants, up-dated the plants, on paper they became more competitive and they displaced workers.  The taxpayer continues to pay more money to update private industry so that they can make more people redundant.  That has continued for years.  For years, since I was involved in the trade union movement, I have argued that grants that the State give to private enterprise should be linked to employment and not linked just on the basis of competition.</P>

We have explained our policy on semi-State industries and ventures.  We agree with the ICTU document on the job crisis and how the semi-State sector can be used as a stimulus for creating employment.  That is not to knock private enterprise.  We can work between State agencies and private enterprise.  There is no difficulty about that.</P>
      <P>Tonight the Minister made two very important announcements, as he thinks. Let me welcome the first one for what it is worth.  The Minister merely went through the points outlined in the Fifth Report of the Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies and listed them in a different order.  This was given as a major announcement to the House.  All the talk about the change of accounts is in this document and the only reason I am welcoming the announcement is because I am glad that something has come out of a committee on which our party has spent hours working.  Although the changes that have been implemented are very minor, and almost irrelevant they might be of some help.</P>

      <P>In talking about planning, the Minister said there was great emphasis on planning in the Department of Finance, in other Government Departments and in the Government.  I will quote from a book called <i>Ireland, 1945-70</i> which refers to planning in the early sixties.  The Minister obviously does not know much about what happened in the semi-State area.  This was in 1963 when Mr. Seán Lemass established the National Industrial and Economic Council as an independent body and at that time Mr. Whitaker was chairman.  The quotation is:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>...with a membership including leading representatives of employer and labour organisations, as well as senior civil servants and leading academic economists. The NIEC began an attempt to pull and drag other state institutions, <Col N="3116" /> as well as employers and trade unions, into accepting some sort of responsibility for the longer term implications of planning.  It emphasised that state bodies should plan in the context of the overall national plan, instead of behaving as independent republics.  It had reservations about the quality of leadership in employer organisations and in trade unions, and urged that these bodies should haul themselves into the twentieth century.  It berated employers and workers for trying to grab what they could of the fruits of planning, while shirking responsibility for failures.  It emphasised that pressure groups had their duties as well as their rights.  The ironic situation arose where civil servants who a decade before had been denouncing planning as weakminded, if not inherently evil, now found themselves urging private firms to imitate the state by trying to plan ahead for a few years.</P>
    <P>All of that occurred in 1963.  To say, 20 years later that we are going to plan and that the semi-State bodies will be streamlined is old hat, 20 years out of date.  That is all past history.</P>
    <P>The Minister talked about the NDC and wondered where Mr. Haughey got the words &ldquo;bio-engineering, electronics, high technology&rdquo; and so on.  They are the terms being used by every child in the street.  The Minister is obviously out of touch.  Because of the good work of the Ministers and civil servants over the years we have a highly educated young workforce. It is in the high-tech area that we should be trying to develop.  The IDA are equipped to encourage development in that area and they are working successfully with all the major computer companies.  To say that the NDC will start dabbling in that area is pure lunacy.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister is in his last days and he is probably prepared to say anything. He has been roaring and shouting tonight about what Fianna Fáil will do. However, we have asked the Minister to clarify tonight Government policy on semi-State bodies, in relation to Aer Lingus, Bord na Móna and so on and <Col N="3117" /> to say where the Government stand on privatisation.  What are the Government's views on equity and what investment proposals have they for semi-State companies?  The Minister has talked about our proposals.  We have listed out our proposals in relation to food processing, in relation to Bord na Móna about afforestation and we have issued a policy document, Roinn na Mara on how the sea and industries relating to the sea should be developed.  What more does the Minister want?  We would be glad to do the remainder for the Minister, when the electorate get an opportunity. In the meantime he should at least do us the common courtesy of outlining his Department's policy.</P>
    <P>It is a pity there were not more people here to listen to the Minister during this debate because from beginning to end he did not outline any policies other than to say he would standardise accounts of semi-State companies and that they would relaunch the planning initiatives set up 20 years ago.</P>
    <P>Semi-State companies must become more effective and efficient.  I agree with the statement that Bill Atlee made a few months ago to try to encourage the trade union movement to move forward and prove why they should get State investment and why the political parties and taxpayers' money should go into State companies.  If State companies are efficient and effective and if they are more adaptable they will get the necessary support.</P>
    <P>Perhaps in the Adjournment debate the Minister will spend some time outlining how he sees the legislation on semi-State companies being implemented and perhaps he will clarify where we stand in relation to subsidiaries.  Under the new legislation, parent companies will be allowed to vote for worker directors.  The legislation as drafted says that the subsidiaries of semi-State companies will be allowed to vote.  If the subsidiaries are allowed to vote &mdash; for instance, in a company like Aer Lingus the vast majority of the subsidiaries could outvote the parent company &mdash; the Irish worker directors <Col N="3118" /> could be massively outvoted under this legislation which, therefore, instead of extending the powers to worker directors would limit them.  That is not what was intended in the Bill; it is an error which I would ask the Minister to clarify if possible this week during the course of the Adjournment debate.  Will the Minister also spell out why the commitments given to semi-State companies a number of years ago have been reduced?  That is a very important aspect of the legislation. Perhaps he would clarify these points because they are very relevant to this motion.</P>
    <P>I do not disagree with the argument for more control over the debts of the semi-State bodies and on how they borrow their money.  One of the arguments the Department of Finance continue to put forward and which is put forward in the report of the Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies is that too many State companies can organise their own borrowing. This should be done by the Department of Finance who have a considerable expertise in borrowing.  That would do away with the problems in relation to borrowing by semi-State companies. For instance this report outlines a case where the ESB lost £270 million because of fluctuations in currency.  If all these borrowings were centralised under the Department of Finance there would be more control.  I do not disagree with having a far tighter control over accounts of semi-State bodies so that accounts are scrutinised more closely by the Departments. It is possible to hide a lot in the accounts.  The report of the Joint Committee on Commercial State-Sponsored Bodies shows clearly that the standardisation of the report would help in relation to comparing a lot of the figures that cannot presently be compared.</P>
    <P>It would be extremely helpful if the Minister of State in the Department of the Public Service clarified those points. The legislation was introduced with very little explanation.  It would cause a huge conflict of interest if they were not clarified and I ask the Minister of State to undertake that this week.</P>

    <P>&lsquo;22.  &mdash;(1)  Where extradition is requested for the purpose of proceeding against any person, to whom this section applies, for an offence, the requesting country shall produce signed statements of witnesses, which, if the person were being prosecuted for a similar or corresponding offence under the laws of the State in respect of an act committed in the State, would be required to be tendered at a preliminary examination before a Justice of the District Court, in order that an order returning the person for trial on indictment might be made.</P>
    <P>(2)  An order for committal under section 29 of this Act shall not be made unless the Justice is satisfied on the basis of the said statements and other documents that the person claimed would be returned for trial in the State if the offence had taken place in the State.</P>

      <P>Before we adjourned for &lsquo;Private Members&rsquo; Time I referred to some of the Minister's comments in his contribution. I had asked the Minister if he <Col N="3120" /> would outline for us in some detail the method which he has in mind whereby an official at a high level would certify a request for extradition in the requesting state.  Who is the high official the Minister has in mind?  Is it the Director of Public Prosecutions as was suggested in newspaper reports?  The Minister did not mention the British Director of Public Prosecutions or any Director of Public Prosecutions but the convention deals with a large number of countries and there would be different kinds of officials in the different countries.  Perhaps the Minister would tell us what he has in mind in that respect.</P>
      <P>The Minister also said in an interchange with Deputy Blaney that a <i>prima facie</i> case would not have made much difference in the cases&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Possibly in one.  Now the Minister can say it would have made no difference in any of them.  Possibly in one case it might have made a difference, if I understand the Minister correctly.  The Minister has repeated that now and seems to be quite clear about it.  If that is the case how would the introduction of a <i>prima facie</i> case turn Ireland into a haven for terrorists as was stated by the handler for the Government in this morning's newspaper?  The Minister should have advised that spokesperson of what he had to say in the House so that he will not make misleading statements in the media again.  That would be helpful to everybody and it would remove one of the red herrings which was set about the place during the last few days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister seems to be concerned that our amendment and the related amendments seek to make a special exception with regard to our own citizens. We have said that there are several ways in which this could be done.  Article 6 of the convention states quite clearly that a contracting party shall have the right to refuse extradition of its nationals. At the time of signing the basic convention on extradition we defined national as citizens of Ireland.  If you can, <Col N="3121" /> under the convention, refuse extradition of nationals entirely, then surely you can refuse only nationals where a <i>prima facie</i> case does not exist?  In other words, you would be refusing less than other countries are refusing because in the case of other countries they are refusing to extradite their nationals entirely.  Obviously, if we were to refuse to extradite only those nationals against whom there is no <i>prima facie</i> case, surely that must come within the ambit of Article 6?  If it is not feasible, I have suggested to the Minister that there is another remedy which is the option of denunciation and readmission.</P>
    <P>The Minister seems to suggest that looking for safeguards for our citizens is unusual or extraordinary.  He has pointed out very clearly that he is seeking these changes in the context of the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  In the White Paper of March 1986 on extradition the British Government said that they considered that such reform of UK extradition law will represent an effective contribution to the fight against international crime and that procedures will be simplified but these will be balanced by the preservation of the most effective means of safeguarding the individual.  Once again, I emphasise their concern to safeguard their citizens.</P>
    <P>The White Paper went on to say that this will include the power of the Secretary of State to withold extradition in any case in which he considers it appropriate. The White Paper went on to state that there are other effective ways in which the rights of the fugitive are protected and gives as an example the proper application of the political safeguard.  In the White Paper the British had very much in mind the protection of their own citizens.</P>
    <P>The command document of February 1985 which preceded the White Paper stressed the case for retaining the requirement of a <i>prima facie</i> case.  No doubt this will be argued now in the British Parliament.  Section 2.2 states that the basic justification for the <i>prima facie</i> case requirement is a desire to ensure equality of treatment for all persons who stand before the courts accused of an offence <Col N="3122" /> wherever it was committed.  Equality of treatment is what we are talking about. There should be equal treatment whether one comes before the Irish courts to be extradited or to go on trial here.  The Command Paper goes on to state:</P>
    <P>Abolition of the <i>prima facie</i> rule would thus mark a significant departure from the broad alignment of extradition proceedings with our domestic criminal proceedings which the 1870 Act secures.</P>
    <P>It further states:</P>
    <P>The case for maintaining the <i>prima facie</i> requirement derives some support from the fact that the United Kingdom is, in contrast to some foreign countries, prepared to surrender its own nationals.  This means that British nationals can be extradited to countries where they face criminal proceedings under a legal system which is different from that which prevails in this country. Anyone who has had to face legal proceedings in a foreign country is likely to experience greater hardship than if he faced trial in his own country.</P>
    <P>These are the views of the British as expressed in the Command Paper and in the White Paper.  It is interesting to go on from that and see what they have done in their Bill.  The Minister refers us to the fact that the British are changing their position now and therefore we should change ours, but it would be advisable in the first instance to look at what they are doing.  It is quite clear even from a preliminary examination of the Criminal Justice Bill printed on 13 November last. Part I deals with fraud and Part VIII deals with extradition.  Section 93 (2) states:</P>
    <P>A person who is alleged to be unlawfully at large after conviction of an extradition crime by a court in a foreign state shall not be returned to that state, or committed to or kept in custody for the purposes of such return, if it appears to an appropriate authority&mdash; (a) that the conviction was obtained in his absence;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="3123" /> I would refer the Minister to section 4 (b) of our amendment No. 3 which states:</P>
    <P>Provided always that no person shall be extradited if that person has been tried and convicted <i>in absentia.</i></P>
    <P>They seem to have similar concerns. Maybe we are not such unreasonable people after all.  Maybe we are concerned with the rule of international law, how it applies to different countries and how it should apply to citizens.  The British state in regard to such a conviction that it would not be in the interest of justice to return a person to a foreign state.  There are two conditions in that British Bill to which the Minister has referred us. Section 93 (3) states:</P>
    <P>A person accused of an offence shall not be returned to a foreign state; or committed to or kept in custody for the purpose of such return, if it appears to an appropriate authority that if charged with that offence in the United Kingdom he would be entitled to be discharged under any rule of law relating to previous acquittal or conviction.</P>
    <P>It is explained in subsection (5) that &ldquo;appropriate authority&rdquo; means the Secretary of State, the court of committal, the High Court or the High Court of Justiciary.  Section 94 deals with the authority to proceed with an extradition request.  Subsection (2) states:</P>
    <P>There shall be furnished with any such request&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  particulars of the person whose return is requested;</P>
    <P>(b)  particulars of the fact upon which and the law under which he is accused or was convicted, including sufficient to justify the issue of a warrant for his arrest under this Part of this Act;</P>
    <P>The words to which I should like to draw the Minister's attention are &ldquo;particulars of the fact upon which&rdquo;.  As I understand it, that legal term means that there is a requirement for hard information to enable the person to know what is alleged against him, as opposed to a mere legal <Col N="3124" /> description.  That is a stronger requirement which they are including in their Bill.  Section 94 (3) states:</P>
    <P>On receipt of any such request the Secretary of State may issue an authority to proceed....</P>
    <P>This relates directly back to the Command Paper and to the White Paper.  It said clearly in the White Paper that they would not agree to do away with the <i>prima facie</i> rule unless they saw safeguards for their own citizens.  These safeguards would include the power of the Secretary of State to withhold extradition in any case in which he considered it appropriate.  They said clearly what they had in mind and they have included it in the Bill.  They seem to be doing what many of our European partners are doing &mdash; reserving unto themselves the final decision as to what is or is not a political offence.</P>
    <P>The Minister suggests that we would be departing in some way from the Anglo-Irish Agreement by not accepting his proposals hook, line and sinker and asking no questions about them.  He maintains that by accepting these serious and concerned amendments we would be doing damage to that agreement.  This cannot be so, especially if we look at what the British are doing.  The Bill I have quoted was printed on 13 November for current discussion at Westminster.  They are following a consistent policy spelled out in the White Paper, the Command Paper and the Bill.  It is not as if the Minister were not aware of their thinking in this matter.  That is the key phrase there: &ldquo;On receipt of any such request the Secretary of State may issue an authority to proceed unless it appears to him that an order for the return of the person concerned could not lawfully be made, or would not in fact be made, in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Act.&rdquo;  That would appear to be the position adopted by the British.  Of course, we have yet to see what happens to that Bill; it is not yet an Act.</P>
    <P>It would be very interesting for Members of this House to hear the debate in the British House of Commons <Col N="3125" /> on that whole issue.  I am sure that the speakers would be concerned to protect their own individuals and would not be making apologies to anybody about that. I presume they regard that as their first duty, a duty which the Government here seem to have set aside.  I say the Government because I believe that the Minister is being directed to go through this Bill without any amendments, apart from the minor amendment which, obviously, has come also from the Cabinet table.</P>
    <P>I have listened to the Minister and am even more convinced of the value of the amendment which we have put down and, indeed, the amendment put down by Deputies O'Malley and Harney.  Nothing that the Minister has said so far has convinced me otherwise.  I find it hard to understand how he has departed so totally from the line that was taken previously, the line on which the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act was based, which is the existing legislation.  It is capable of being used in the context of the North and South of Ireland which is where the Minister says he envisages the greatest difficulty.  There is a means, a mechanism for dealing with that.  It is a mechanism which ensures that there is reasonable protection for citizens of this State.</P>
    <P>I should like to hear from the Minister in relation to his new proposed method of certification.  Who will certify and what will be involved?  I cannot see it having any great effect because it will have no statutory backing.  It would, of course, not be a matter for the courts in that event, consequently it would not be acceptable.  Nevertheless, I should like to hear what the Minister has to say in that regard at some greater length.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>On this question of the proposed <i>prima facie</i> requirement, I set out earlier this evening the reasons for my conclusion that it is not an appropriate step to take.  Let me summarise very briefly. I said that the first and in my view the conclusive reason was that to introduce any new requirement of the kind suggested would represent a move in the wrong direction, a move out of step with <Col N="3126" /> our neighbours and with our co-signatories of the European Convention on Extradition.  Nothing that has been said during the course of the debate this evening takes away from that.  I do not for a moment dispute the fact that underneath the proposal there are real concerns but I pointed out &mdash; and will develop this a little further &mdash; how we meet these concerns and what mechanism we have for meeting them.  The fact of the matter is that the <i>prima facie</i> requirement is not one that could be operated under the terms of the Convention on Extradition. It is not one which any of our co-signatories operate.  It is a requirement which the British Government are now intending to do away with and I intend to take up some of the points raised by Deputy Woods in that connection.</P>
      <P>I also made the point that I doubt if it would work.  Deputy Taylor raised a couple of reasonable questions about that.  He did not seem convinced that that would be the case.  To go back to that part of the discussion &mdash; and this is without prejudice at all to my first conclusion, which is that I think it is an inappropriate step, given our circumstances &mdash; I doubt that it could be held that a person whose extradition was being sought from this country, who was going before a District Court in that particular framework could be deprived of the right he would have under our system to question witnesses and that applies not simply to prosecution witnesses but to any witnesses who might be relevant in the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy Taylor pointed out, there could very well be very serious problems as to the compellability of witnesses, as to the means that might or might not be there to ensure the presence of witnesses. If a defendant claims the right, as in our system he could very well do, to have those witnesses present and they were not present, then could a conclusion be drawn from that?  What difference would that make to the view that a judge would take?  Could one say that a district justice would decide, notwithstanding the fact that witnesses were not available and the person had been unable or not in a position to defend himself, that there was a <Col N="3127" /> good case here to return this person for trial?</P>
    <P>I do not think that the House has really given enough attention to those difficulties, nor indeed has the House given anything like enough attention to the problems that could arise in relation to the admissibility of evidence.  I do not intend to go over the whole matter again, but nothing that has been said here has in any way taken away from the argument I put forward in that connection.  That being the case, I take the view that the second reason I gave for being opposed to this step holds.</P>
    <P>There is a very big difference, of course, if we are looking at the obstacles there would be to extradition, between the case, on the one hand, where a legal officer in the requesting country has to form an opinion as to the probability of a prosecution and, on the other hand, the situation as to whether a hearing in a court in the requested State could arrive at a reasonable conclusion, as I say, perhaps based on the written statements of witnesses but in the absence of the witnesses. In our system a district justice who has been called on to make that decision would clearly have to consider the evidence of all the witnesses and not simply those called by the prosecution.</P>
    <P>Deputy Taylor also raised the question as to who the high legal officers would be in the United Kingdom who would have to satisfy themselves as to the sufficiency of admissible evidence and Deputy Woods referred to this just a moment ago.  In order to make it clear, I want to repeat what the system is.  I have already indicated it several times to the House. What we have agreed is that a warrant for the return of a fugitive would be sought only where the Crown Prosecution Service in England and Wales, or the Director of Public Prosecutions in Northern Ireland is satisfied that there is a clear probability of a prosecution founded on a sufficiency of admissible evidence.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="3128" /> In addition, in all cases where warrants are sent to the Garda Síochána for backing, the British Attorney General will send a confirmatory note to the Irish Attorney General stating that he is satisfied that the relevant prosecuting authorities have complied with those arrangements in relation to each offence to which the warrant relates.  Those involved are the Crown Prosecution Service in England and Wales, the Director of Public Prosecutions in Northern Ireland and the Lord Advocate in Scotland. I do not think they could properly be described as simply administrative officers, they have a more substantial function than a purely administrative one and if those officers are satisfied, on the basis of what has been presented to them, that there is a sufficiency of admissible evidence to ground a prosecution, that constitutes a very serious view which is adequate for us to accept the case they put before us.</P>

      <P>This applies to Ireland and the UK only because, in conformity with the Convention on Extradition, we have a separate, specific arrangement with the UK.  Deputy Taylor asked, quite reasonably, how we could be sure that other jurisdictions will not engage in &ldquo;fishing expeditions&rdquo;.  In order to ensure that this does not happen, we adopted the arrangement in relation to the UK and indeed &ldquo;fishing expeditions&rdquo; could not have been very far from the minds of those who framed the European Convention on Extradition.</P>
      <P>Deputy Blaney made a most eccentric intervention, most of it not germane to the amendment.  However, one of the points he raised deserves a comment. Extradition to the UK does not involve dispensing with the requirement for a committal hearing.  Extradition to the UK or the reciprocal backing of warrants delivers a person to the UK jurisdiction and that person must go through all the steps required in the UK jurisdiction, which include a preliminary committal hearing.  There is no sense in which it can be said that the arrangements in operation &mdash; which will continue when the Bill is enacted &mdash; will in any way dispense with that kind of preliminary examination. It is not sufficient &mdash; there is no doubt about this &mdash; for a supergrass or a police officer to make a request to bring about the extradition of a person from this jurisdiction.  Most of what Deputy Blaney said was a speech which he would have liked to make instead of a comment on the amendment or the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Woods, having got reconfirmation from me that there has been no case of extradition to Council of Europe countries since 1965, did not seem to get the real meaning, which is <Col N="3134" /> that the proposal for a <i>prima facie</i> procedure would be relevant only in the case of extradition to Northern Ireland or to Britain.  This is where the points I made earlier this evening and on Second Stage about citizenship comes in.  If we were to say we will not extradite citizens, that would mean that there would be no extradition virtually to Northern Ireland or the United Kingdom.</P>
      <P>Deputy Woods referred today and on Second Stage to the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act, 1976, and attempted to suggest that in some way this Act has been left aside since 1982.  He seems to draw some kind of conclusion from the fact that apparently under Fianna Fáil Governments people were dealt with under this Act and they have not been dealt with under this Act in the last couple of years.  I suggest that Deputy Woods look back again at that legislation and all that it does and he should also look at the procedure that is in operation under the 1965 Act because it is not the Government of the requested jurisdiction that starts any procedure under that Act, it is the requesting State.  I would find it a most extraordinary suggestion, or perhaps even admission, on Deputy Wood's part if he were actually saying to the House that a previous Fianna Fáil Government up to the middle of 1981 conspired or acted in such a way as to provoke the application of this Act, because it is not in the hands of the requested Government, it has to be started by another jurisdiction making the request.  Whatever conclusion Deputy Woods thinks he can draw from the figures in relation to the conduct of Government, I think he must be just plain wrong unless he is saying that a former Administration did something very dubious indeed.  I do not believe that is what he is saying.  He just got the wrong end of the stick.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and if I thought for a moment that he was suggesting something else, I would have a different reaction, but I do not think that is what he is saying.  I think Deputy Woods is using a nice little argument of circumstance to make a debating point that is not relevant to the issues before us.</P>
      <P>Deputy Woods also asks, if a requirement for a <i>prima facie</i> case would not have made any difference in the number of cases I referred to earlier, how that would make this country a haven for terrorists or a place where it was less difficult for criminals to evade justice.  The Deputy should think a bit longer before he asks that question because I said that in those particular cases there was in fact <i>prima facie</i> evidence and had we had that requirement, those people would still have been extradited.  That does not say anything about the fact that in other cases it would produce an obstacle.  I intend to read a little more of what Deputy Woods was putting before us as British wisdom on the matter because his quotations from the Command Paper and the White Paper were selective, to say the least, although it may be that he was not given the full picture.</P>
      <P>As regards what has been happening about extradition, I would like to give the House a few figures.  The number of persons returned to this country each year from 1982 on were as follows: from England, in 1982, 21; in 1983, 26; in 1984, 43; in 1985, 27; and in 1986, to date, 12. The numbers who returned here from Northern Ireland in those same years were: 1982, seven; 1983, five; 1984, seven; 1985, one and 1986 to date, five. I note the years and I am drawing no conclusion whatsoever about the numbers that were returned in any year when a given Government were in office.  We made requests and those people were returned to our jurisdiction on foot of the procedure now in operation under the Extradition Act, 1965, and reciprocally in the UK during that period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the period 1982 to 1986 we requested <Col N="3136" /> the return of 170 people.  Under the procedures in force 129 people were returned. In the same period we requested the return of 35 people from Northern Ireland; 25 were returned and four or five others opted to return here while on bail. In the last five to six years &mdash; exact information on other countries is difficult to come by &mdash; about eight people have been returned to us from other countries. I give those statistics to bring to the attention of the House that the system we operate, and that will continue to operate after the enactment of this Bill, is a reciprocal system and one which we use as well as other jurisdictions.</P>
    <P>It has been proposed that in order to try to give effect to the amendment before us we should denounce the 1957 convention and re-ratify it, making some kind of a reservation or qualification.  That would be an extraordinary procedure.  I think it would rightly be regarded by our partner countries as an immensely cynical manoeuvre.  I would not recommend it because I do not believe we need to change the procedures in that way.  It is certainly not the kind of manoeuvre that would commend us as serious people to other countries with which we have dealings, countries in relation to whom we request extradition from time to time.</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods referred to the UK White Paper and to the Home Secretary's powers proposed under the draft legislation put forward &mdash; to withhold extradition in any case in which he considers it appropriate.  Deputy Woods seemed to think that this showed a much stronger concern on the part of the UK authorities with its citizens than is the case here.  He is looking at only one side of the picture. The corresponding power is vested in the Minister for Justice here, together with the courts, by section 50 of the Extradition Act, 1965.  If I remember correctly, it is that power of the Minister referred to in the Bill that seemed to give Deputy Woods a great deal of worry on Second Stage.  He seemed to be under the impression that the Minister for Justice, under this Bill, was taking onto himself some new and comprehensive powers of <Col N="3137" /> which Deputy Woods was highly suspicious. It now turns out that what Deputy Woods finds entirely laudable in the UK legislation he has overlooked in ours.  I do not know why that Part of the Act and of the UK proposals should be trotted out here as something novel.  As I said, it is part of a reciprocal procedure.</P>
    <P>It is perfectly legitimate and is the objective of this Bill to bring more clarity and certainty into the law in relation to the scope of the political defence.  That is what this Bill is all about.  Since we are on this amendment, I do not intend to go into that at any great length.  Deputy Woods quoted from, UK publications. For example, he quoted from Command Paper 9421 on Extradition of February 1985 a section which deals with the case for retaining the <i>prima facie</i> requirement. It is a very interesting paper.  There is a section entitled The Case for Discarding the Requirement.  I do not know whether that part was brought to Deputy Woods' attention but there are some very interesting things in it.  It states:</P>
    <P>The case against the requirement arises mainly from the concern that it may have the effect of enabling some criminals who take refuge in the United Kingdom to escape justice.  The existence of the requirement, together with our rules governing the admissibility of evidence, is regarded as constituting a significant obstacle to extradition from this country.  It is a fact that many countries, including those European states with which our extradition traffic is heaviest, find it difficult to meet this requirement &mdash; even in cases in which they claim there would be ample evidence to secure the fugitive's conviction in their own courts.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to read it all.  I admit immediately that I will be somewhat selective in reading from it.  I am sure the House will have access to this document and will find that my selection is a little more representative than that of Deputy Woods.  Another selection states:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="3138" /> It should, in principle, be for the requesting state to judge the sufficiency of the evidence for a trial of the fugitive.  Moreover the requirement&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>that is, the <i>prima facie</i> requirement</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;confers on the fugitive a right which he would not have had if he had been arrested in the requesting state before flight, and which any associate who has not fled will not receive.</P>
    <P>The case for and against was examined fairly comprehensively.  The conclusion that was arrived at by the time the White Paper entitled Criminal Justice Plans for Legislation, Command 9658 of March 1986, was published, there having been a process of comment and examination of submissions in relation to the previous Green Paper, was that the <i>prima facie</i> requirement should be deleted from UK legislation.  It is quite instructive to find that a number of the concerns set out in the examination of the case for and against the <i>prima facie</i> requirement are very similar to points that have been made here.</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods read a section from the White Paper.  I would like to invite the House's attention to what follows on that.  It states:</P>
    <P>The question of whether the <i>prima facie</i> requirement should be discarded was discussed in paragraphs 2.1 &mdash; 2.13 of the Green Paper.  Having considered carefully the responses on this question, the Government believes that the <i>prima facie</i> requirement should be abolished.  The requirement does not offer a necessary safeguard for the person sought by the requesting state; it does, however, present a formidable impediment to entirely proper and legitimate extradition requests.  There are other effective ways in which the rights of the fugitive are protected &mdash; for example, by the double criminality rule and by the proper application of the political safeguard.</P>
    <P>That seems to be germane to the debate we are having.  I would not normally read <Col N="3139" /> that into the record of the House were it not for the fact that Deputy Woods quoted sections that seemed to point to conclusions that are different from mine.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>According to that White Paper it is also the Government's intention to preserve the Secretary of State's overriding discretion to withhold extradition and this enables him to refuse his consent in cases where it seems to him that it would not be in the interests of justice to allow a person to be extradited. I should like to remind the House that the mirror image of that provision is to be found in our 1965 legislation.  It will continue in force after the enactment of the Bill because I am not proposing to change it.  The only place where it arises in the Bill, where Deputy Woods seemed to find fault with it, was a necessary reference to the fact that the provision is in our 1965 legislation.</P>
      <P>A reference to some of the contents of the UK Bill was made by Deputy Woods but I do not intend to pursue it now because I have dealt adequately with the background.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy wishes I will say a few words about it.  Deputy Woods referred to section 94 of the British Bill. The reference in that section to particulars of the facts upon which the accused person is accused or was convicted is not a requirement to produce evidence as Deputy Woods seemed to think.  It is designed to ensure that there is enough information on which to apply the double criminality test for extradition. It is there to ensure that there is enough information so that the requesting jurisdiction can satisfy itself that the act of which the person is accused is an offence in the requesting State and is also an offence in its own jurisdiction.  This principle of double criminality is an important one underlying extradition <Col N="3140" /> arrangements and that is why that provision is in the UK Bill, not for the reason Deputy Woods seemed to indicate.</P>
      <P>The other provision in section 94 (3) of the British Bill about the Secretary of State being able to refuse authority to proceed with an extradition is a power that is similar to that granted to a Minister for Justice here by section 50 of the 1965 Act.  The argument that Deputy Woods was making in which he seemed to think he was making a case for a <i>prima facie</i> requirement is in fact an exposition of the reasons why the UK is moving away from the <i>prima facie</i> requirement and why the UK believe that the kind of protection which we already have in our system are ones that produce, taking all things together, a better result in terms of a system for dealing with extradition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;it has got to the stage where it has got lost in myriads of unimportant detail.  We have got away from the basic principles that should apply in relation to this matter.  I listened carefully to the Minister when he replied earlier and I was glad to hear him again say much the same thing in his latest reply because it confirmed what I had in my notes of what he said earlier.  I should like to make some comments on what the Minister said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said that his basic reason for not accepting this amendment, and the associated amendments, was that any new requirement of this kind would be a move in the wrong direction and would be a move away from our neighbours. The requirement we are talking about is one for a <i>prima facie</i> case in relation to requests for extradition.  Half our neighbours will not extradite their own citizens <Col N="3141" /> at all but we are offering to extradite our own citizens.  We are offering to do it, as we are perfectly entitled to do &mdash; the Minister has not argued otherwise &mdash; on condition that if somebody wants to take one of our citizens away from this country he will have to show some reasonable level of evidence against such a citizen. How we are moving away from our neighhours in what they are prepared to do when we are far more generous with our citizens and more willing to give them away I cannot understand.  The Minister has this ability to go on and on to the extent that people forget what we are talking about.  This frightens me.  I can see now in legal matters just how the Minister clouds the issue like some large octopus sending up squirts of black ink. It frightens me to think that for three and a half years that man did the same thing in economics.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Economics is something that one cannot tie down to the same extent because there are not Acts on economics in the same way that there are legal Acts.  The Minister got away with it in that area and it is even more dangerous there than it is in the legal field.</P>
      <P>The Minister's point that this is a move in the wrong direction and away from our neighbours is ridiculous because most of our neighbours will not even go half the distance we go.  As I pointed out on Second Stage, a lot of countries in Europe refuse to extradite their citizens under any circumstances and there are others who will only extradite people out of their jurisdiction, including three signatories of the 1957 Convention, provided a <i>prima facie</i> case is shown.  They have been glossed over too because officially they do not exist; it does not suit the book here at the moment.</P>

      <P>The Minister made the point that in practice the <i>prima facie</i><Col N="3142" /> requirement cannot be operated under the convention and that the British are doing away with it.  It appears that is more or less the be all and end all of it.  When he was asked why it could not be operated he said that in practical terms, particularly under subsection (2) of our amendment, a person could not or should not be deprived of his right to question witnesses at the preliminary hearing.  I do not have access to as much wisdom as the Minister has ready access to but I have been informed that there was a case reported in the <i>Irish Law Times Reports</i> for 1985, the name of which is, strangely enough, <i>Sherry v. Wine</i>, in which the Supreme Court here held that a defendand does not have the right to cross-examine witnesses at a committal hearing.</P>

      <P>Yes.  The Minister has solemnly told us that it would be a grave injustice to deprive somebody whose extradition was being applied for here of that right but that person does not have that right.  I cannot understand the Minister's reasoning, which is absolutely wrongly based, when he says that we would be doing wrong to people whose extradition is claimed from here if they did not have the right to examine witnesses and so on when we are giving them the right to have the evidence against them shown to them and allowing them and the district justice to read it.  In accordance with what the Minister wants they will never know the evidence against them and the Minister thinks they should not know it.  How can the Minister want to retain a system whereby persons sought to be extradited from here are never entitled to know the evidence against them and never see a statement of a witness against them but are being extradited on a warrant, on a slot machine basis which the Minister wants to retain?  How can he say that the defendants are at a disadvantage here, when they can go through the signed statement of evidence and make submissions to the district justice?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An Irish defendant brought up here <Col N="3143" /> and sought to be sent for trial before an Irish court does not have the right to cross-examine witnesses.  Why, therefore, should a defendant to be sent elsewhere have it?  I never suggested that somebody being sent out of the jurisdiction should have such a right.  My amendment makes it clear that in the case of extradition a witness cannot be brought.  All a defendant can do is to operate on statements.  Relying on statements for a district justice to decide whether there is a <i>prima facie</i> case is far better than simply relying on a warrant and some kind of certificate from the British Attorney General that the mechanics of the thing have been done properly &mdash; that is all it amounts to.  The Minister's example is completely ill-founded and misconceived.  He complained about the absence of a right that an Irish defendant would not have anyway.</P>
    <P>There is a distinction of some significance between the amendment in Deputy Harney's and my name and that of Deputy Woods.  Deputy Woods refers to evidence but our amendment refers only to statements.  We deliberately confined it to statements because I do not think you can talk about evidence in an extradition application.  When talking about evidence you may be talking about actually bringing people there and that is not feasible in many cases.  Apart from statements, you are talking about bringing exhibits to court and that is not feasible in cases of extradition.  One of the exhibits could be a motor car used for a car bomb.  I do not see how you could bring that along to a foreign country. That is why we clearly confine the amendment to statements.  It is not as advantageous to the defendant but at least it is practical.</P>
    <P>Another error I respectfully submit that the Minister has made &mdash; he read it out two or three times because Deputy Taylor, who expressed some reasonable reservations about the Bill, asked him to repeat it, and he wrote it down &mdash; is that what will be required from the Lord <Col N="3144" /> Advocate in Scotland, the Attorney General in England or the DPP in Northern Ireland will be a clear probability of a prosecution based on a sufficiency of admissible evidence and that if that were there there would be certification.  There is a world of a difference between evidence that will ground a prosecution and evidence that would satisfy a <i>prima facie</i> requirement for the return of somebody for trial and the sending of somebody abroad on extradition.  I do not think the Minister knows that or understands the significance of the big gap there is between the two.  He can take my word for it that there is a considerable difference. The kind of evidence needed to found a prosecution falls well short of the kind of evidence you would need to have somebody sent for trial.  You could be quite justified in taking a prosecution on evidence that would fall short of that which a district justice might require in order to send somebody for trial.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the Minister's reply on that point, and his assurances, are not of any value.  Towards the end of his second reply he spoke of the undesirability of denunciation and reratification of the 1957 Convention.  In my Second Stage speech I said how undesirable that was and that we should not do it that way.  We do not have to do it that way.  We have a way to do it under Article 6 of the 1957 Convention. What is proposed in this amendment does not conflict with our law, does not conflict with our practice and does not conflict with any of our international obligations.</P>
    <P>I made those points to the Minister when I spoke first this afternoon and in his reply he did not refute any one of them.  He has not refuted them in his second reply &mdash; they remain valid &mdash; that is the case.  It does not conflict with any of our international obligations.  It is perfectly evident that it does not because we would be within our international obligations if we said we will not extradite our citizens at all.  It is not like the Minister.  I have said already on Second Stage that it would be outrageous for us in our circumstances to say so; even though it appears to be all right for France and <Col N="3145" /> half of Europe to say it, it would be outrageous for us and I do not think we should do so.  What we should do is opt for that halfway house which we can do without conflicting with our own law or our international obligations.  I do not think any reasonable person can object to that.  Nor has any reasonable case been advanced in this House that would cause anyone to feel that this is not the proper course to be followed.</P>
    <P>In his original reply the Minister spoke of the importance of Part III of the 1965 Act which reflects our close ties with the United Kingdom.  I have told him already &mdash; and he does not seem to understand its significance &mdash; that Part III is not something that was dreamed up in 1965. It is not, as the Minister has said, something that has existed since the foundation of the State.  It existed long before the foundation of the State &mdash; that is where its weakness lies &mdash; because it was an internal procedure within the then, old, United Kingdom for moving people around within the sub-jurisdictions of the then United Kingdom.  It is no longer appropriate where two sovereign independent countries are concerned.  Their relationship should not be based on this slot machine methodology which is appropriate within a country but which is not appropriate as between two sovereign states.  I would not care very much if there was a kind of slot machine system for moving people from Munster to Connacht or from Leinster to Munster; that is about how significant it was.  That procedure was introduced here and in the remainder of the then United Kingdom in the 1870 and 1873 Acts.  It is not appropriate today.  The Minister should not try to hide behind it because it has as much significance as moving people from Munster to Connacht or <i>vice versa</i>.  It means no more and should not be sought now to cover the relations that should exist between two sovereign independent states.</P>
    <P>The Minister tells us that it would be invidious to change this backing of warrants system.  I suggest to the Minister, with respect, that it would be invidious not to.  The entire weight of the argument <Col N="3146" /> in this House today, in the media and elsewhere, is in favour of this sort of amendment, of doing what has been suggested here by speaker after speaker. There is almost nobody who agrees with the Minister.  Hovering over all of this is not really the value, propriety or otherwise &mdash; with which I totally agree &mdash; of ratifying the 1977 Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism or of amending our extradition laws, as laws.  What is hovering over all of this is that this is one small bargain in a much bigger scenario. The Irish Government are fearful that if they are seen not to deliver this particular portion of a much larger bargain, then other larger and more important things will not be delivered by those whose pressure is hovering over this and is causing it not to be amended.</P>
    <P>I would remind the Minister that those reasons may well be short term ones.  We would be very foolish to leave our law in a very unsatisfactory state simply because there were overriding or compelling reasons of State, in the Government's view, to make us do something we knew was wrong because the external pressure on us was too great.  One cannot but get bad law from such an exercise.  The Minister should recognise that and ensure that he and this House do their duty which is, first, to ensure that the law is right and reasonable and, second, that we do not enact law for a purpose which has nothing to do with this Bill, which may be worthy in its own way in a different context, but which should not be used as a lever on this Government and on this House to enact law that this House knows in its heart is not right.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Harte when contributing earlier was making the point that there was an element of playing politics involved in this, that it is about getting votes and matters of that nature.  It may be that the issue that is involved here involves vote-getting in the Donegal constituency. I suppose it has major influence there.  Certainly that would not pertain in my constituency in Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I see this Bill from the point of view of a backbencher in this House.  I look at it <Col N="3147" /> for what it is and on its merits.  I try to do the best I can with it on that basis and make comments on it fairly as I see them. That is the task allotted me as a backbencher.</P>
    <P>The point has been made that essentially the Bill is not new, that it involves no major variation of the warrant-backing procedure and the special position we have had with the United Kingdom for a very long time now.  That is partially true only.  There are new provisions in the Bill, some of which I welcome and very strongly support.  For example, there is the cutting back on the concept of what would be regarded as a political offence and consequently not the subject of extradition and so on.  That is very necessary and, if anything, long overdue in our legislation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Harte also said he would find it objectionable that anybody who was wanted in Northern Ireland for serious crime &mdash; murder and so on &mdash; should walk free in this jurisdiction.  I agree with that 100 per cent.  That is absolutely right, provided that that is the person, that there is a base for saying that that is the person.  There has to be some formality involved in an extradition exercise.  I suppose everybody would agree with that. For example, nobody would suggest that a telephone call ought to be sufficient or that one would send a letter saying: right, send over Mr. So and So, he has committed an offence and is wanted.  There has to be a certain degree of formality and the case must be examined in some form in some location.  I would think that that ought to be a judicial decision, not an administrative one, that it should be a decision taken by a judicial officer.  I say that irrespective of how high up the ladder, how senior, the administrative officer concerned might be.  Whether he be a senior or junior does not affect the nature of the decision he makes in initiating an extradition procedure.  There are some administrative officers who occupy very high posts.  The Minister himself is an administrator and occupies a very high post, although admittedly he does take some judicial decisions also <Col N="3148" /> in the course of his work.  One has to determine whether a decision to seek an extradition from a requesting State should be done by an administrative officer or by a judicial officer.</P>
    <P>The second point that has to be determined is whether the officer concerned, whether he be administrative or judicial, should be in the requesting State or come for final decision in the receiving State, that is to say, this country.  What we are faced with here is in a sense, the worst of both worlds.  First, it is an administrative decision and, second, it is in the requesting State.  I am still unhappy about the matter.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the fact that in the cases of the Birmingham Six, the Guildford Four and so on the probability is that not even one of them would have been affected if the <i>prima facie</i> rule had been introduced.  I agree with that, I take the view that none of those cases would have been helped had the <i>prima facie</i> rule been in operation here.  I think they would all have been sent back even if the <i>prima facie</i> rule had been in operation here.  However, I do not think that is an argument against having the <i>prima facie</i> rule in operation.  If anything, it demonstrates how mild and modest a safeguard it is.  I contend it would have been shown up to have been inadequate in some cases where it was necessary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think any of the people involved in the cases the Deputy referred to were extradited at all, so the point does not arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>No, quite so, I know that. But the point was being made that, had we had the <i>prima facie</i> rule in operation at the time, they would have been extradited. The point was made that, in all probability, all of them would have been extradited.  I accept that they all would, thereby showing that, as a safeguard, the <i>prima facie</i> rule, at best, is a very modest one.  There could be much more stringent provisions suggested, for example, that contravening statements would be admissable from the defence and that the justice would have to decide which of them <Col N="3149" /> he would accept.  One could have a much stronger test applied if one were so minded.  Therefore, it is a very minor and modest suggestion; there is nothing extreme about it.  Once those statements were submitted, saying that the particular offence had been committed, for practical purposes, that would be the end of the matter and the question of contravening evidence would not then arise. Therefore, it will be seen to be little enough in itself.</P>
      <P>I asked the Minister to repeat the statement of the apparent agreement which has been arranged on this because it did contain the quotation I thought it did.  I wanted to be sure about that and that is why I asked him to repeat it.  I am troubled by it too because what it says is that the Director of Public Prosecutions. the Attorney General or whoever must be satisfied that there is a probability that there will be a prosecution.  I really do not think that is good enough.  I would have thought, before a requesting State or an officer such as a Director of Public Prosecutions or an Attorney General would decide to initiate this procedure, the test would have to have been rather higher than that &mdash; not just a probability that there would be a prosecution.  I would have thought appropriate wording would have been that he would have determined or decided that on the evidence and statements before him there would be a prosecution.  When a prosecuting authority is examining a case he looks at the papers, examines the evidence before him and decides whether he will prosecute.  That is a certain point that passes in the investigation of criminal offences.  At a certain point the officer concerned, be it the DPP or the Attorney General decides: right, the point has now been reached and I have to determine on a prosecution.  One is at a less advanced stage than that when one says: I have decided that there is a probability that there will be a prosecution, in other words, probably there will be but there is still the possibility that there will not be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unless one has decided that the evidence <Col N="3150" /> available before one at this point warrants and has determined one to decide that one is prosecuting in this case, the degree of test there gives me some unease.  I do not think it is sufficient to say that there is only a probability that there will be a prosecution.  I could accept the fact that perhaps something new might transpire in the meantime which might change an officer's mind, which would alter the determination he would have formed to bring the prosecution. That would be perfectly understandable and acceptable.  But anything short of saying that the officer concerned has examined the evidence and has decided that there will be a prosecution should not, in my view, be sufficient to warrant the bringing forward of an extradition procedure.  This long-standing easy arrangement that we have with Britain arises out of a special relationship and so on, over the years but that is not necessarily a reason of itself for continuing it on.  We have many of these relationships. Some of these, as we have seen in the old British Petty Sessions Act, recently have given rise to nothing but problems for us. If new arrangements are being entered into in this Bill before the House &mdash; a new dimension is being put into it such as these variations on political offences and so on &mdash; then the whole matter is open for review and all aspects of it should be examined.</P>
    <P>I still find it hard to understand why the requirement for this modest protection is proving so difficult.  It is only a very mild assurance. It will give no protection to any criminal who is wandering about here.  Statements would have to be available in any case on the file of the Attorney General in London or the DPP or whoever, and he ought not to put in a request for an extradition unless he has on his file signed statements from witnesses showning at the very least that there is a <i>prima facie</i> case, never mind overwhelming evidence. Therefore, why should he not send those statements over to Dublin to be shown to a district justice to assess and make the order on them?  The statements are there.  Where is the problem?  I cannot <Col N="3151" /> see where the nub of the point is.  For the life of me I do not see the difficulty.  The statements are there, he looks at them and why should a judicial officer of this country, a district justice who is experienced and skilled in these matters and looks at statements on a regular basis in intending criminal prosecutions to decide whether there is a <i>prima facie</i> case, likewise not determine whether there is a statement there which could ground a prosecution; not in all probability but factually that there will be a basis to bring that prosecution?</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to make a few points as a result of listening to this debate all evening.  Earlier I made a point of order to the Ceann Comhairle.  We have here a very complicated procedure concerning not simply a Bill but the 1957 convention and we must consider how we can implement the convention without derogating from our international responsibilities as the Minister probably sees them.  The statistics which the Minister gave in his last intervention bear out that in practical terms the issues we are dealing with are related virtually entirely to extradition to Northern Ireland or to a much lesser extent to Britain.  Indeed, in relation to the latter, the cases involved are almost all likely to be related to the problems in Northern Ireland and to involve Irish people.  The Minister stated to that effect near the end of his Second Stage speech as reported in the Official Report of 4 December 1986, volume 370, column 1387.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, it is important to put into context what precisely is at issue.  Unfortunately, during the day the debate becomes clouded as to what our obligations are to other countries which have signed the 1957 Convention on Extradition. Now we can deal only with the facts as we find them.  Britain is not a signatory to that convention and we are trying to deal with this legislation on the basis of the facts, not on the basis of statements of intent and the measure of good faith of the British Government. One would have thought that our <Col N="3152" /> Government, having fallen into that trap last December on the Anglo-Irish Agreement, might consider seeing precisely what happens first before they place too much good faith on reforms in the administration of justice or whatever.</P>
    <P>A forcible argument has been made that the insertion of a <i>prima facie</i> case would not mean, <i>vis-à-vis</i>, our extradition arrangements with Britain and Northern Ireland at the moment, that we are derogating in any way from existing conventions we have signed and, more important, existing conventions that Britain have not signed such as the 1957 convention.  The Minister said today that he was &ldquo;not prepared to start on the proposition that we are all in favour of extradition but...&rdquo;.  I am glad to hear that he is not prepared to start on that proposition because that is not the proposition on which he should start.  The Extradition Act, section 14, reflects Article 6 of the 1957 convention which states that we are not in favour of extradition except as that Act prescribes.  In view of the argument that has been put to him from all sides of the House, the Minister comes across as not alone not being prepared to go on the proposition that we are not in favour of extradition except in circumstances prescribed by law, or not being prepared to start on the proposition that we are all in favour of extradition &ldquo;but&rdquo;.  In fact, his proposition seems to be that we are all in favour of extradition, full stop, and that that improved procedure in the 1965 Act should be continued as if nothing has changed since 1965.  I am speaking in relation to the judicial relationship that we should have with Britain and Northern Ireland.  A great deal has happened since 1965.  In 1965 the British legal system was one which we could all look up to as the original common law system from which our own legal system had been developed, but that British system has now been brought into the greatest disrepute and there is shame on that system in view of the cases which have been explained and lobbied by Members of the House more eminent than I.  On Second Stage, Deputy David Andrews <Col N="3153" /> outlined precisely the position in relation to those cases.  In my inarticulate way I tried to set out on Second Stage that those cases changed completely and utterly the whole context in which this debate can be held.  When the Minister says that in any of those cases there would have been extradition anyway, I am inclined to agree with him.  Yes, there would have been extradition anyway, but he failed to follow up on that argument.  He seems to discharge his responsibility by saying that on the face of it under the Extradition Act if there had been a <i>prima facie</i> case we would have extradited, therefore everything would be rosy in the garden. What he is forgetting about and has not addressed at all today is the question of the consequences to that legal system of extraditing.  What has been pointed out as a basic principle which should underlie our extradition laws in this regard is that nobody should be returned for trial to another jurisdiction if he would not be so returned here if the offence had been committed here.</P>
    <P>The second principle is that we are satisfied that the jurisdiction to which we are sending these people will be one in which they will get justice.  Through the powerful medium of television we have evidence which suggests there has been a grave miscarriage of justice.  Apart from trying to ensure that justice in England as it affects Irish people is properly administered, as of now there are cases in Britain where people who are innocent beyond doubt are languishing in British jails and the British judicial system does not seem to have the capacity to refer these cases to the Court of Appeal for retrial.  Until we see the capacity of the British legal system to refer those matters for retrial, on what basis can we say that the British legal system will treat our citizens fairly, even on the basis of a <i>prima facie</i> case?  We do not simply discharge our responsibilities by allowing extradition on the basis of a <i>prima facie</i> case.  We must keep in mind the question whether the person will get a fair trial. Under the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act, 1976, there is a mechanism whereby if we are not satisfied about sending a <Col N="3154" /> person to Britain or to Northern Ireland, we can try them here.</P>
    <P>Until the outstanding cases are dealt with we are entitled to hold back on this. Statements of intent are no good.  We have had statements of intent and Annie Maguire has had statements of intent both here and in Britain but the British legal system has not the capacity to refer these matters to the Court of Appeal. That is what is important.  These cases stand out like a sore thumb in what was up to now one of the most respected legal systems in the world.  Until these cases are dealt with, we will continue to have grave doubts about the propriety of sending anyone to Britain for trial.  For too long we have placed our faith in what we had always believed would be fairminded British administration.  The evidence does not hold up, nor does the evidence of the Anglo-Irish Agreement which was supposed to operate in relation to the fairness of the administration of justice in the Six Counties.  When the Anglo-Irish Conference met on last Monday week sources close to the Government said, as reported in <i>The Irish Times</i>, that the Minister for Foreign Affairs at that meeting was going to use those cases as a <i>quid pro quo</i>, in relation to extradition charges here.  However, that evening in Galway, the Taoiseach said there would not be amendments to the Extradition Bill and the following day Tom King was reported as saying that three judges in the Diplock courts was a non-starter.  Who is codding whom?  We did not have to wait for the British Prime Minister to tell us: the Taoiseach told us from Galway there would not be extradition charges before he could have heard what Tom King was saying about the Diplock courts.</P>
    <P>I have suspicions about the motivation behind bringing this in, not simply because the Taoiseach going into the next general election wants to stand back and say &ldquo;here is another area where I have shown my maturity by co-operating with the British Government on sensitive security matters&rdquo;, but because of what the Minister said here today when he said that he could not accept the amendments <Col N="3155" /> because they moved away from European norms making extradition much more difficult in practical terms but, more importantly, because it would amount to a public unambiguous declaration to the people of Northern Ireland and Britain that we are abandoning the Anglo-Irish Agreement and all that goes with it.  That is an amazing statement.  The Minister said the abandonment of the Anglo-Irish Agreement was what was involved in the amendments put forward by Deputy Woods.  He did not mention the amendment put down by the Progressive Democrats although in effect it is the same as ours.  Was that because they voted for the Anglo-Irish Agreement?  The old ghosts are coming up again.  That does not hold water.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>What is involved in our amendment and in the PD amendment is an amendment to section 22 of the Extradition Act, 1965.  We are proposing this amendment in view of the lack of progress that has been made in relation to the people who are languishing in British prisons and because of the failure of the Anglo-Irish Agreement in relation to the administration of justice in Northern Ireland.  It has been stated that to establish a <i>prima facie</i> case will not involve us in problems with any convention we have signed.  One of the arguments put forward by the Minister today against this amendment related to the inadmissibility of evidence and the Minister gave an example in relation to the hearsay rule and the problems one would have if France were to seek extradition of an Irish citizen.  That is a civil law jurisdiction operating under a different system.  I do not know whether the Minister has a difficulty but on his own admission on Second Stage and on the basis of the figures provided in his last reply, at least 98 per cent of the cases are with our neighbours across the water and up the road.  If the Minister has a difficulty about accepting a <i>prima facie</i> evidence requirement on the basis of the admissibility of evidence perhaps he could come up with a better example than the one he has given, as it has nothing to do with 98 per cent of cases we are talking about which relate to Britain and Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister accepts that the amendments raise legitimate concerns.  I am glad the Minister has agreed that we do have legitimate concerns.  One of these concerns is with regard to extradition merely for questioning.  He said arrangements have been agreed, such as an examination at a high legal level to verify that there is in the opinion of the prosecuting authority concerned sufficient evidence of a kind admissible in court on which to base a charge.  He said there was an understanding between the two Governments that an extradition request <Col N="3157" /> implies a clear expectation that court proceedings will normally follow and that together with the confirmatory note from the British Attorney General, the Advocate General in Scotland, or the DPP in Northern Ireland he will satisfy himself that the relevant prosecuting authority have complied with the arrangements he has described.</P>
    <P>The reason why that is insufficient is because decent Irish people, not those who are ambiguous about violence or those who are half Provos, as a result of the recent publicity about the Birmingham Six and the Guildford Four, have lost a certain measure of confidence in the British legal system's fairness towards Irish defendants.  That has been accentuated by the failure of the British Government to show a capacity to redress what are obvious wrongs against people languishing in British prisons. That is a fact of life whether you or I or the legal people accept it or not.</P>
    <P>In these arrangements the Minister is proposing that the legal people at the highest level be satisfied.  The DPP do not have to be satisfied with regard to those applications.  Once their legal people are satisfied and these arrangements have been complied with we extradite. That will not allay fears and justice will not be seen to be done.  Even with regard to extradition proceedings which have nothing to do with the fairness of the trial across the water, I am convinced that ordinary Irish people do not see that as sufficient because there is a very definite belief that if you bring it to the District Court and the district justice decides it, it will be accepted.  The Minister can quote me cases where it will not be accepted but that is irrelevant.  The point is the Minister will not convince people that the Attorney General in England will do what has to be done properly.  I am not saying those people are politically involved, they are independent officers and have to be respected.  For example, the DPP's office is often accused of political manoeuvrings.  Sir Michael Havers was embroiled last week in a major problem in the House of Commons over the Wright affair.  Therefore, he is involved <Col N="3158" /> in the political scene.  He may be independent but he is involved.</P>
    <P>People now see extradition as being part of the political process.  The Minister sees it as that, he sees it as the most important aspect and said that to accept the amendment would be an abandonment of the Anglo-Irish Agreement. Under Bunreacht na hÉireann the judicial system is independent of political manoeuvrings, secret meetings and internal efforts at co-operation.  The Minister has at his disposal a respected branch of Government who can decide these matters. We are not talking about the merits or demerits of whether the person is guilty or not, we are talking about people being satisfied that that man is going over to answer a charge he should go over to answer.</P>
    <P>The Minister is under estimating the effect these arrangements will have.  They will not allay the fears of people.  It does not allay the fears of the ordinary man in the street that the British Attorney General is satisfied that the warrants were properly begun.  I am sure that those prosecuting authorities were quite satisfied when they requested the extradition of Evelyn Glenholmes, which unfortunately did not work out for them, and I am sure they were satisfied in the Quinn case, when he had no case to answer at all.  The Minister in his Second Stage speech mentioned that he was getting over the problem of technical defects in the warrants and there was now a measure of co-operation to ensure that that does not happen again.</P>
    <P>Just because you have dealt with that case does not mean that everything is rosy in the garden and it will not happen again.  People hope that a debacle such as that will not happen again but what they are interested in seeing is that the request will be seen as having been independently adjudicated upon.  Because it is a sensitive issue and because of the experiences of the Birmingham Six and the Guildford Four, people have major concerns about the efficacy of the British judicial system.  The Government should recognise those reservations particularly in view of the fact that to establish a <Col N="3159" /><i>prima facie</i> case will not go against their obligations under the Convention and international law.</P>
    <P>The thrust of the Minister's argument is that it would go against the European norms but as our relationships with both Britain and Northern Ireland are very sensitive they must be seen to be dealt with fairly by independent people.  The district justice is the man to do that job and no one else.  Even if the Minister were to say that the DPP was satisfied that the warrant was properly grounded it will not satisfy Joe Soap in the street because of the secrecy and confidentiality and because it is not subject to judicial review in this country.  If the Minister has difficulties about inserting the <i>prima facie</i> rule I think he can get over them if he has the will to do so.  The Minister's first obligation is to the Irish citizen.  Everything else must follow from that.</P>
    <P>The thrust of the Minister's argument has been that these things are now in place.  I am not saying there never was extradition before this Bill but the circumstances have changed substantially. If the Minister wants to maintain public confidence in this system of extradition by warrant he must show people that it works and is independently adjudicated upon.  I have referred to several specific cases.  If we had similar people languishing in our jails, would Britain enter into an extradition agreement with us without our having to establish a <i>prima facie</i> case? The British are among the best in the world for standing up for their own. Whatever else is said about Margaret Thatcher, she stands up for her own, whether she is right or wrong.  Many Irish people would like to see us standing up for our own and going about things the right way.  Presumably we will not have a vote before 11 p.m.</P>

      <P>The Minister is a man who moves around his constituency in the same way as the rest of us, or perhaps a little bit more in view of the forthcoming election.  He should realise that a lot of ordinary people who know nothing about extradition have a sense of fairness and they do not see a sense of fairness in the British judicial system in the way it applies to Irish people.  The Prevention of Terrorism Act always seems to apply to us and nobody else.  They would like the Minister to make sure as a minimum safeguard that extradition warrants to Britain or Northern Ireland are independently adjudicated upon and extradition is not carried out simply at the behest of the prosecuting authority in the requesting state.  That is all we are looking for.  We would still be in compliance with international obligations.  A forceful argument has been put to that effect.</P>
      <P>The basis of the whole extradition law is in section 14 of the Extradition Act, 1967, which reflects Article 6 of the 1967 Convention.  There should be no extradition except as we set it out.  That is the basis of it, so let us set it out and protect our own people rather than simply acquiesce, as we have been too prone to do in recent years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be brief at this stage but I hope to get another opportunity to speak later.  I want to voice my feelings <Col N="3161" /> about the specific proposal that we extradite political offenders without any requirement that the applicant country &mdash; for all practical purposes we are talking about Britain &mdash; should have to establish a <i>prima facie</i> case.  I do not like it.  Over three years ago I first indicated that I was unhappy with the situation following what I regarded as a very desirable development in the thinking of the Supreme Court when they allowed that certain acts were of such a heinous, terrorist nature that they could not possibly be regarded as political.  I felt it was appropriate that we should consider imposing the requirement that Britain should have to establish a <i>prima facie</i> case.  Mr. McGlinchey was the first person extradited following that Supreme Court view.  When I saw the evidence brought forward at his trial, although it has to be said that he was acquitted, I felt there were added arguments to support my view that Britain should have to establish a <i>prima facie</i> case in our courts.</P>
      <P>I listened to as much of this debate as possible and I have pondered this matter very carefully.  I want to make it absolutely clear that I will be voting with the Government on this issue.  I am committed to doing so as a member of my party.  I am offering my personal views now but I have no doubt about how I will be voting.  I might say in passing that I regard it as obscene that some members of political parties sign pledges and seek to stand back on particular issues which are of interest to them, seeking to hold their party up to some form of ransom.  I would not dream of doing that but I have troubled myself considerably over this measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not believe that this Government are seeking to do anything to deny Irish citizens any fundamental right and I reject Deputy Cowen's allegations that they seek to do so.  I accept in good faith the argument offered by the Minister, namely that in the context of the Anglo-Irish Agreement there is reason for the Government taking this step.  I also accept his good faith when he says that the general trend in Europe is away from the requirement that the applicant country <Col N="3162" /> should have to establish a <i>prima facie</i> case.  I have to admit that I was somewhat surprised at that.  I have listened to Deputy Woods and the Minister and it seems to me on the balance of what has been said to the House that the Minister's view is manifestly correct.  The trend does appear to be away from that.</P>
    <P>Having said all that, I am still troubled by this.  Most of the people who have offered views to the House are more troubled by this measure at the moment because of the cases referred to by Deputy Andrews, Deputy O'Malley and Deputy Taylor.  These are the cases which have on a number of occasions been the subject of major television inquiries.  Of course the persons in jail as a result of convictions in what are known as the Guildford and Birmingham cases would not have been affected in any way by extradition provisions since none of them was extradited.  But it is the case that there is grave disquiet, not just in this country but in Britain, about the capacity of the British judicial system to deal with cases like that.  Regarding Irish people before a British court on terrorist/political type offences, it is really hard to believe, whatever about the present, that in the past such people received a fair trial.  I completely understand the concern expressed on all sides of this House, given what we now know about these case.  I have to say though that even if all of these people had been the subject of extradition applications in this country, and if there were a requirement that a <i>prima facie</i> case be established, there is no question about the fact that all of the persons involved would have been extradited.</P>
    <P>Further, I am not convinced for a second that the proposal of Deputies O'Malley and Harney deals with the problem.  It is quite clear from what we know about these cases now that senior people on the British investigation or prosecution side had to act in some improper way.  There was no other way that one could square the information we now have about those cases with the evidence brought before the courts and marshalled, presumably, by quite senior <Col N="3163" /> people in very responsible positions in the British prosecution system.  That is very serious.</P>
    <P>However, I do not believe that problem is unique to the British system of justice.  Deputy Cowen suggested that nobody was languishing in our jails who was put there wrongly.  Frankly, I do not believe that either.  I am quite certain that our system of prosecution has caused people to be convicted of crimes they have not committed.  I am not going to detail all these cases as they have been detailed before.  I specifically named the cases and gave details of them in this House on the occasion of the establishment of what was known afterwards as the Kerry Babies Tribunal.  We should not hold ourselves apart as some great race of people above and beyond any question about our own prosecution and judicial system.  I have no doubt but that many people have been convicted here since the establishment of the State who perhaps did not deserve to be convicted either on the evidence or on the basis of evidence that did not entirely square with the truth of the position or the truthful background to those cases.  However, this is a different problem.  I am not sure how we can overcome the distrust that has arisen in this country with the British system of justice because of the Guildford and Birmingham cases, but we have to bear in mind that imposing a requirement that the British would establish&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>I am doing that specifically. Imposing the requirement that the applicant country would have to establish a <i>prima facie</i> case would not solve that problem.  I am not sure what would solve the problem.  My view on this matter at the moment is that if in the context of the Anglo-Irish Agreement this can bring about the aims as set out in the joint communique, specifically improving the confidence of the public in the administration of justice, improving relations <Col N="3164" /> between the security forces in the North of Ireland and enhancing the co-operation between the two communities in the North of Ireland, it is worth while considering it.</P>
      <P>I am glad the Minister indicated today that he proposed to amend.  I think, section 12 of the Bill which would extend the opportunity for this Dáil to alter the Bill, or decide not to proceed with it until December of next year which, in effect, means that there must be a new Dáil that will do that.  The step being taken by us is an important one and one that deserves the most positive of resposes from the British Government.  If this section as proposed by the Minister passes, without the amendments by the Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats Parties, this House and this country deserve a response from the British Government to show that they are prepared to come along the road with us.</P>
      <P>Difficult as I find this proposal at present, I trust the judgment of the Taoiseach in matters of this nature.  I believe that the Anglo-Irish Agreement was an agreement which no other Taoiseach that we have had would have brought about. I am talking now particularly about relations between Ireland and Britain and Ireland and the North of Ireland and the peoples of both communities in the North of Ireland, in saying that the Taoiseach's instincts in these matters are generally good and deserve to be followed.  They are difficult to follow in this instance.  I am just not convinced that the case put forward by Deputy O'Malley specifically would deal with some of the problems that we see with the British judicial system at the moment.  As is quite clear, I shall not be a Member of the next Dáil but if there were not a very positive response from the British Government to this measure as proposed, I would certainly be among those who would advocate that the Bill not be proceeded with.</P>

      <P>We have had a very long debate here and some of the contributions have been exceptionally long Second Stage ones.  We have not <Col N="3165" /> really teased out from the Minister why he or the Government seemed to have in mind at the weekend that some amendment might be made, but he is stone-walling now and not a line will be changed.  The whole discussion for the last five and a half hours has been on the basis of a <i>prima facie</i> case being made.  I am not a legal person; I do not know what the procedure is for presenting a <i>prima facie</i> case in Irish law.  I understand from the contributions that, presumably, you must produce a book of evidence and presumably there are witnesses present, because the Minister says that the witnesses can be cross-examined and so forth.  Not one of these amendments mentions a <i>prima facie</i> case; not one mentions that a book of evidence should be produced; not one says that witnesses should be brought before the court.  The amendments say that sufficient evidence be produced, signed statements of evidence be produced and in our case we are saying that what is in section 22 of the 1965 Act should be followed, that sufficient evidence be produced to satisfy the requirement in the provision.  If there is no amendment whatever to the Bill, does that mean that section 22 of the 1965 Act will not apply to extradition proceedings taken under this Bill?  Could the Minister say if that is so?</P>

      <P>It would not apply to proceedings under this Bill.  All that would be required to insert in the Bill to ensure that the provisions of the 1965 Act would apply would be simply &ldquo;require the production of the requesting country of evidence, any evidence, as to the commission by the person claimed of the offence for which extradition is requested&rdquo;. It does not say what kind of evidence, or how it would be produced, or anything of that nature, whether signed statements, witnesses, books of evidence or so on.  It just mentions production of evidence.  If that is in the extradition proceedings, then section 22 applies, which would mean that extradition <Col N="3166" /> would not then be granted unless sufficient evidence is produced to satisfy the requirement.  That is all anyone is asking, that within this Bill there would be a requirement for production by the requesting country of evidence, any evidence, as to the commission by the person claimed of the offence for which extradition is sought.  Surely the Minister does not intend to extradite people without any evidence whatsoever.  That is the basis of all the contributions all evening. Deputy O'Malley called it the &ldquo;slot machine&rdquo; procedure.  If no evidence is required what is the point of this debate? The matter might as well be settled by a telephone call.  There should be a provision in the Bill requiring the production of evidence as to the commission of the offence.  Surely no one would want to extradite anyone unless there was such evidence?</P>

      <P>So many Acts have been quoted in this debate, from 1870 to the present that we may be in danger of not being able to see the wood for the trees.  There may be shortcomings in the amendments but most people are anxious to ensure safeguards for people on trial in the UK.  We are trying to enshrine such safeguards in the Bill.  The Minister's replies have been framed in legal language and it is easy to lose sight of the main issue.  In this Bill a major change is proposed in our law regarding extradition and all speakers have expressed concern in this regard.  The Minister and the Government seem to be steadfastly against including any provisions in the Bill&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not believe that adequate safeguards are provided in the Bill.  The Bill represents a fundamental change in our attitude to extradition.  We must accept that it is a major change, indeed during the last term of office of the Coalition from 1973-77 they refused to change the extradition requirements here and the <i>quid pro quo</i> in relation to the Sunningdale arrangement was the <Col N="3167" /> Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act, 1976. This Act contradicts the arguments the Government are putting forward in relation to <i>prima facie</i> evidence.  The Act is seldom used but it provided for trying suspects in this jurisdiction for offences committed in another and also for the calling of witnesses to give evidence here. We are now going to the other extreme, no evidence will be required in this jurisdiction in order to extradite a person. The people are not satisfied that Irish nationals who are extradited to the Six Counties or the UK will get a fair trial. We all remember the cases which were mentioned tonight.  I accept that the Minister wants to ensure that we play our part in the suppression of terrorism but the Bill goes too far.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that unless this legialtion is enacted we would be out of step with the rest of our partners on the Council of Europe who are signatories to the 1977 convention.  He further alleged that the convention does not allow for extradition. The Minister indicated that it would be impossible to introduce any changes in the Bill&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The reason the amendments have been put down is that the people want our jurisdiction to have some say before a person is extradited.  It is not too much to ask that there should be adequate safeguards in the Bill.  The amendments, if accepted, would go some way in ensuring that such safeguards are provided.  The Minister said earlier that there would be some arrangement regarding the authorities in Britain and the Six Counties which will be examined at a very high level.  He said that those who examine the matter will have to be satisfied that a person has a case to answer if he is extradited.  However, I am not satisfied with that provision, I am sure that in the cases which Mr. Stalker was investigating there was intense activity regarding the alleged offences.  I am not <Col N="3168" /> satisfied that a person outside this jurisdiction can decide that there is a case to answer, I am concerned as to what happens in this State.  The arrangement to which the Minister referred will merely be one between two Governments, it does not seem to have any legal function.</P>
      <P>I do not know which authority will examine the extradition application or who will satisfy himself that these arrangements have been complied with.  I believe it will be an <i>ad hoc</i> arrangement between two Governments and I am not satisfied with that.  We should not make any apology for enshrining in our law what we consider to be the right way to go about this.  The full judicial process should be gone through.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Griffin</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you for giving me the opportunity to discuss as a matter of urgency the preservation of our national monument sites, especially the Derrynaflan site in Killenaule, County Tipperary, where the Grave of An Gobán Saor has been desecrated.  I have decided to share my limited time with Deputy Seán McCarthy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I come from south Tipperary.  We are privileged that this historical site is situated in my county.  I was appalled to learn that since the High Court decision the site has been plundered and pillaged and the Grave of An Gobán Saor desecrated. I know the site quite well.  I am bringing this matter to the Minister's attention and ask her to use her good <Col N="3169" /> offices to ensure that this and other historical sites are preserved.</P>
    <P>There are approximately 150,000 ancient monuments in Ireland, about 700 under the care of the Office of Public Works and at present 48 to 50 of those are undergoing restoration.  I realise it would be physically and financially impossible to protect each monument and I understand the problems facing the Minister, but I urge her at least to publicise the present penalties which can be imposed if people using metal detectors destroy archaeological sites.</P>
    <P>I will not discuss the High Court decision where the judge said that the finders of the Derrynaflan hoard &mdash; a magnificent chalice, wine strainer, paten and bronze bowl valued at £5.5 million &mdash; should give the hoard to the State and receive £5.5 million compensation. I understand the State will appeal that decision in the Supreme Court and, consequently, the matter could be deemed to be <i>sub judice</i>.  Therefore, I will not discuss that aspect of the matter.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the weakness in the present legislation.  There is a Bill at present going through the Seanad, the National Monuments (Amendment) Bill and I urge the Minister to introduce on Committee Stage suitable amendments to ensure that a similar situation will not arise again, that there will be no confusion about the ownership of archaeological finds and that the State will not be liable to pay huge sums by way of compensation.  This would be the appropriate time to effect such amendments.</P>
    <P>We should bring home to the people the fact that the use of metal detectors is forbidden under existing legislation, although the penalties for defacing a national monument site are pitifully small.  That point is being addressed in the new amending legislation.  Some people might get the impression, because of the High Court finding, that there is open season in the use of metal detectors.  This is what has happened at the Derrynaflan site.  In the hope of finding more treasure, people have attacked the site with spades and shovels and used metal detectors causing great damage to this historical <Col N="3170" /> archaeological site.  It is believed in places like Derrynaflan that there are other hoards waiting to be found.  According to local lore a pair of golden gates and other chalices are still to be found.  I am afraid that in their enthusiasm people will lose all sense of proportion and will attack, dig and destroy these ancient monuments.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to bring it to the attention of the public that the use of metal detectors is forbidden, that if people are caught using them they will be fined and under the new legislation will be liable to a jail sentence.  We should educate the people that these historical hoards are part of our heritage and do not belong to any individual.  If found, they should be handed over as a patriotic gesture to the National Museum for the benefit of all.</P>
    <P>These briefly are my views on this matter.  Once again I thank you, Sir, for giving me the opportunity to raise it and I await with interest the Minister's reply. I urge her to use her good offices to bring home to the people the value of these monuments and to emphasise that they should not be desecrated.</P>

      <P>Derrynaflan Abbey, a 13th century church, and an Gobán Saor's Grave have been in the guardianship of the Commissioners of Public Works since 1935.  With the finding of the hoard close to the Abbey in early 1980 the commissioners decided that it was necessary to bring the entire archaeological site at Derrynaflan under the protection of the National Monuments Act.  Accordingly, they placed a preservation order on the site on 5 March 1980.  An area in excess of 80 acres is involved.  The making of a preservation order makes it unlawful for anybody to interfere with the area involved without the written consent of the commissioners. However, it does not affect the owner's title to the property.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following the reported interference with the site of the Gobán Saor's Grave at Derrynaflan by landowner Mr. Denis O'Brien, an archaeologist from the National Museum travelled to the site on <Col N="3171" /> the morning of Monday, 15 December. Mr. O'Brien told him that he had visited the site on Friday last, 12 December and had noticed nothing out of the ordinary. On the afternoon of Sunday, 14 December, he arrived on the site with a friend, at about 2.30 p.m.  He found that the Gobán Saor's Grave had been vandalised and concluded that he must have surprised those involved as clothing and a shovel were found scattered on the ground close to the grave.  He notified the Garda on Sunday evening.</P>
    <P>The area dug was inside the area fenced off by the Office of Public Works in 1980. A trench 8 ft. long and 2 ft. wide was dug to a depth of 1.5 - 2 ft.  An extension 50 cm. x 50 cm. had been dug at the west end of the north side.  The spoil was thrown up on either side of the trench and contained pieces of human bone.  The medieval grave slabs which had lain on the ground had been turned over before digging began and these had been covered by the upcast from the trench.  Bones which had been removed from the grave seem to consist largely of those of a single child. A few larger bones may be those of a second individual.  The trench will be filled in.</P>
    <P>The Garda are investigating the case with a view to bringing a prosecution. While the Garda are doing everything they can to watch archaeological sites and to bring prosecution where offences are committed, we will not be able to preserve our heritage unless our citizens in general are vigilant and bring anything they see and which appears in the least suspicious to the notice of the Garda.  I would like to pay a special tribute to Mr. Denis O'Brien for the concern he has shown for the site at Derrynaflan and while he did not in this instance succeed in preventing the destruction of the grave, he may have secured material which will lead to a successful prosecution.</P>
    <P>I would urge Deputies to use their <Col N="3172" /> influence to encourage the public at large to be watchful of our heritage sites; if they do so we will defeat the few who would vandalise these sites for monetary gain.  I would also like to issue a warning to anyone thinking of seeking treasure in our archaeological areas.  The Garda have been asked to keep a special watch and anyone found despoiling them will be prosecuted.  In case anyone feels that the present fines are not a real deterrent I would remind them that they could face a jail sentence of six months.  They cannot be sure that this will not be imposed on them.  I would remind them too that in addition to fines they could be liable to very hefty legal costs if found guilty of interfering with a national monument.</P>
    <P>I have just come from the Seanad where we have been debating the Committee Stage of the National Monuments (Amendment) Bill, 1986.  Under that Bill the fines will be increased to a maximum of £50,000 and/or 12 months in jail.  There is a similar penalty for being found in possession of a metal detector in a national monument or in an archaeological area.  This is a measure of how seriously we regard the threat to our monuments.  There is also provision in the Bill which will enable the Commissioners of Public Works to mobilise a large number of concerned citizens to watch our archaeological areas.</P>
    <P>I hope that this Bill will pass through the Dáil early in the New Year.  I know that Deputies on both sides of the House welcome the provisions of the Bill and that they will accord it a speedy passage. I would not like to underestimate the threat there is to our archaeological heritage but I am confident that, with these additional legislative provisions and with the whole-hearted support of the people at large, we will defeat the vandals and preserve our heritage.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 11.15 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 17 December 1986.</P>

      <P>On 3 November I announced the setting up of a special task force to arrange for the establishment of an alternative service to replace that which had been provided by the HOPE hostel.</P>
      <P>The task force submitted their report to me on 25 November.  They recommended that funds be made available immediately to facilitate the provision of a new hostel service for homeless boys and also an associated outreach social work service.  Premises at Percy Place had been identified for the hostel service which, the task force recommended, should be run by a broadly based management committee under the auspices of the Catholic Social Service Conference. It was recommended also that the Eastern Health Board should recruit five additional social workers who would be attached to the board's homeless persons service and would provide, <i>inter alia</i>, support services to the hostel.  On 26 November I informed the Eastern Health Board that I had accepted all the recommendations of the task force and that I would allocate the necessary additional resources to facilitate the immediate provision of both the hostel and social work service.</P>
      <P>The present position is that the broadly based management committee have been formed to run the new hostel and have met on a number of occasions.  Following public advertisement on 30 November the majority of the necessary staff have already been recruited.  I understand that the hostel opened on an informal basis last Monday and the service will be operational from Thursday, 18 December.</P>
      <P>I wish to express my warm appreciation to the fine members of the task force and the management committee for their outstanding co-operation in meeting this urgent social need.</P>

      <P>The allocations notified to health boards for 1986 require that expenditure be contained within the approved levels.  The boards are expected to take all possible steps to achieve this requirement in the year.  Some boards are, however, having difficulty in meeting the targets set, but are continuing to make progress in reducing the overall level of expenditure.  My Department are in regular contact with the boards and are monitoring the budgetary position closely.</P>
      <P>As this position is changing constantly, I am not prepared to comment on the performance of individual boards at this stage.  To do so would be to accept that no further steps can be taken to bring expenditure to within approvals.</P>
      <P>I recently introduced a Supplementary Estimate for a token sum of £1,000.  This was to enable me to use the benefit of additional Appropriations-in-aid (health contributions and receipts under EC regulations) amounting to over £8 million.  I have used this additional sum to provide for the bonus payment of health cash allowances at Christmas, to provide cash for research bodies following the non-continuation of the Hospitals Sweepstakes and to ease somewhat the overdraft requirements of health agencies in 1986.</P>

In recent years the health boards have not reduced their dental staff numbers so that the level of the dental service for eligible children is being maintained. The <i>ad hoc</i> dental scheme whereby adults are referred for dental treatment by private practitioners has been suspended in some health boards and curtailed in others.  However, the dental staff of the health boards provide dental treatment for eligible adults in priority groups such as expectant and nursing mothers, the handicapped and the elderly.  Emergency treatment is available to all eligible adults in all health boards, but eligible adults who require routine dental treatment but do not belong to a priority grouping are placed on a waiting list for treatment when resources become available.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East) Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> I propose to take Questions Nos. 39, 40 and 41 together.  The reports of the Dáil Committee on Public Expenditure which relate specifically to my Department are as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  Review of Shannon Free Airport Development Company Limited and</P>
      <P>(ii)  15th Report of the Committee on Public Expenditure &mdash; Institute for Industrial Research and Standards.</P>
      <P>The following are the recommendations of the Report of the Oireachtas Committee on Public Expenditure on the Shannon Free Airport Development Company which have been implemented:</P>
      <P>(a)  &ldquo;SFADCo should assign the full promotional costs of its commercial tourist activities to those activities and should seek to improve their commercial performance.  Consideration should then be given to inviting equity participation in these projects or to realising the investment with a view to applying the funds in pursuit of SFADCo's regional development brief&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>SFADCo is in the process of assigning its management function in relation to the Historic Castles to a separate subsidiary company, which will effectively implement the first part of this recommendation. The question of equity participation is being reviewed by the Company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b)  &ldquo;That SFADCo undertakes the survey work necessary to measure the effectiveness of its industrial promotions activities compared with the added value arising, having given due <Col N="2851" /> weight to redundancy, displacement and deadweight effects&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>A study has been undertaken as recommended.</P>
    <P>(c)  &ldquo;That SFADCo's annual report and accounts comply in full with the Standard Statements of Accounting Practice, indicating where they are not in compliance and the reasons therefor. That overheads be apportioned as fully as possible between the various operations being reported on.</P>
    <P>(d)  That each commercial activity be separately reported on including building activities, property management and tourism operations.</P>
    <P>(e)  That each subsidiary be fully and separately reported until such time as separate arrangements are made for their funding and reporting.  This applies in particular to the Innovation Centre and the National Micro-Electronics Application Centre.</P>
    <P>(f)  That some suitable arrangement be devised so that IDA grants paid by SFADCo be shown in the SFADCo Annual Report.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The above recommendations are being implemented to the extent considered necessary following a detailed review with the Comptroller and Auditor General's Office of the recommendations themselves, the Standard Statements of Accounting Practice and the requirements of the Companies (Amendment) Act, 1986.</P>
    <P>No action has yet been taken in relation to the implementation of the other recommendations in the report.</P>
    <P>The following are the recommendations of the Report of the Oireachtas Committee on Public Expenditure on the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards which have been implemented:</P>
    <P>(a)  &ldquo;In the implementation of quality standards the Institute should seek to build on the work of the Irish Quality Control Association by giving appropriate exemptions and availing of the <Col N="2852" /> latest quality audit report where this is consistent with complying with international standards.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Chief Executive of the Irish Quality Control Association (IQCA) is a member of the Board of Directors of the Institute and of the National Standards Authority of Ireland.  The Institute encourage companies contemplating certification to IS 300 &mdash; the Irish Standard for Quality System Management &mdash; to consider the IQCA certificate as a preliminary step and the Institute have undertaken to take cognisance of the IQCA Audit Report if submitted and to reduce their audit accordingly &mdash; thus saving cost to the applicant.</P>
    <P>(b)  &ldquo;An appropriate process should be developed providing for consultation with industry before standards are adopted&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Industry and appropriate agencies are fully consulted during the drafting stage of standards.</P>
    <P>(c)  &ldquo;The Government should, as a matter of urgency, authorise the drafting of legislation to allow the enforcement of standards on imports and on goods manufactured in Ireland.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>To do so would be incompatible with EC rules.  Standards can be made mandatory on health and safety grounds only and this is already done.  However legislative proposals are being drafted at present in order to strengthen my powers in relation to product safety.  These proposals are intended to apply equally to imported and home produced products.</P>
    <P>(d)  &ldquo;The Government should direct all those inviting tenders which will be paid for out of public funds to indicate the standards required where approved standards exist.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The booklet &ldquo;Outline of Government Contracts Procedures&rdquo; published earlier this year specifies that:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In general, contract specifications should be performance-based and <Col N="2853" /> drawn up as accurately and comprehensively as practicable.  Irish Standards specifications should be used where they exist, but not to the exclusion of European Community Standards.  The National Standards Authority of Ireland and the Institute of Industrial Research and Standards should be consulted as necessary.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>(e)  &ldquo;The IIRS should establish an internal review group to revise the format of the Annual Report and Accounts:</P>
    <P>&mdash;to ensure its effectiveness as a marketing medium for the Services of the institute.</P>
    <P>&mdash;to increase awareness of the level of public funding provided and the value received in return.</P>
    <P>&mdash;to comply with best accounting practice and particularly to observe fully the Standard Statements of Accounting Practice.</P>
    <P>&mdash;to provide divisionalised accounts and to account separately for grants, public funding other than the grant-in-aid and external activities such as the sale of services through Development Co-operation and to distinguish between development work undertaken with the support of grant in aid and work undertaken at a loss.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Consultancy Unit attached to my Department are reviewing the Institute's accounts and accounting procedures.</P>
    <P>(f)  &ldquo;The Institute's borrowing powers be strictly limited to an agreed working capital provision.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The borrowing powers of the Institute are strictly controlled under Section 2 of the Industrial Research and Standards (Amendment) Act, 1979.  In effect the Institute may only borrow provided they have the consent of the Minister for Industry and Commerce given with the concurrence of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>(g)  &ldquo;The IIRS should press ahead with its own environment programme and in so doing should liaise closely <Col N="2854" /> with the agencies responsible for Fisheries development and An Foras Forbartha.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Institute is pressing ahead with its own environment programme and does liaise with the Department of the Environment, local authorities, Foras Forbartha, the Department of Fisheries and other appropriate bodies.</P>
    <P>(h)  &ldquo;A decision by Government as to where ministerial responsibility for development of the food industry rests before the IIRS either develops its own programme or pursues further the proposed association with An Foras Taluntais in this regard.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>A Minister of State with responsibility for food has been appointed by the Government.  A permanent food committee has also been established comprising representatives of the appropriate Departments and State agencies.</P>
    <P>No action has yet been taken in relation to the implementation of the other recommendations in the report.</P>

The Local Government (Planning and Development) Acts, 1963 to 1983 apply to state projects generally to the extent set out in section 84 of the 1963 Act.</entry>

      <P>In the case of roads which are not in public ownership, certain local authorities, including Cavan County Council, may contribute to the cost of works on these roads under the local improvements scheme.  This scheme applies to farm road projects eligible for EC aid under the western package.  Under the legislation governing the local improvements scheme, the roads, when constructed or improved must be used as a means of access to two or more parcels of land (owned or occupied by different persons) or serve the public.  The cost involved is met from Exchequer grants and contributions from the beneficiaries.  The 1986 Exchequer provision for the scheme of £2.15 million has been fully allocated.</P>

            <entry>The DPS should devote considerable efforts to the achievement of significant tangible productivity improvements in the non-industrial Civil Service.</entry>
            <entry>Expenditure on Exchequer pay and pensions accounted for over 42% of gross supply service expenditure in 1981 but by 1985 accounted for less than 37%.  In real terms the exchequer pay bill declined at an annual average rate of almost 1% between 1981 and 1985.  Numbers in the civil service (over which the Government's control is directly exercised by the Department of the Public Service (DPS) have been reduced by almost 10% since 1981.  Within that overall reduction there has been a very considerable redeployment of posts to areas of need such as Social Welfare and Prisons.  At the same time, the quantity and quality of services have been maintained, or in some cases extended or improved through redeployment and improved procedures.  There has therefore been a considerable improvement in productivity in the non-industrial civil service. The DPS is continuing with a programme of projects in Departments designed to improve productivity either by reducing inputs (staff and others) or having higher outputs produced by existing or lower levels of resources.</entry>

            <entry>Productivity improvement projects should only be approved where the cost-benefit analysis prepared during the feasibility study indicates a return on investment significantly greater than the cost of borrowed funds.  The Secretary of the Department requesting the work should undertake to reflect the anticipated benefits in future budgets for his Department.</entry>
            <entry>In undertaking projects an assessment is made of the nature of the problems to be tackled, the possible benefits to be achieved and the amount of resources required for what period.  The arrangements announced in paragraph 8.11 of the White Paper on the Public Service (Serving the Country Better) for organising and managing management services projects will ensure that the management of the Department in which a project is undertaken will be aware of the implications and required to react rapidly to recommendations for improving efficiency through reducing, or avoiding increases in, staff numbers.</entry>

            </entry>
            <entry>On the computer-related expenditure side the DPS is quite often concerned with (a) computerising systems which are such that they could not effectively be handled manually (e.g. social welfare schemes) and where such computerisation involves significant savings of the staff which would have been needed otherwise or (b) computerising the handling and processing of information where the benefits cannot be quantified in purely financial terms.  Essentially, computer-related expenditure is not sanctioned unless the DPS are satisfied that the cost is justified taking all factors of which the strictly financial benefit is only one, into account.  The requirements to be satisfied in this regard are set out in detail in a circular on computer-related expenditure recently issued to Departments. As regards having Secretaries reflect the expected benefits in future budgets, this is a question that is pursued with Departments at estimates time.</entry>

            <entry>The DPS should establish a rolling five-year programme during which the staffing levels, organisation and clerical procedures of each Department would be reviewed.</entry>
            <entry>While the Department has not drawn up a formal five year rolling programme of reviews, it is currently involved in reviews covering about half the civil service (Revenue, Social Welfare, Agriculture, Industry and Commerce).  Proposals have been agreed for reviews in Department of Education and in the Prison Service.  In addition the DPS undertakes a general review of staffing levels each year in the context of the determination of the estimates for the civil service.  In accordance with the provisions of the White Paper (paragraph 8.9) the staffing level targets to be reached by each Department/Office a year hence are determined.  This exercise involves an assessment of the relative staffing needs of Departments in a general way.</entry>

            <entry>The Minister for the Public Service should give priority to projects which have high expected benefits.  He should seek to develop a portfolio of projects which would achieve, in aggregate, the overall productivity improvements target established by him.</entry>
            <entry>The DPS does seek projects with high expected benefits and give priority to such projects.  The Government have decided that the DPS should review staff intensive areas which might be expected to yield benefits and this is being done (see response to the recommendation in paragraph 32).  The DPS proposes projects to be carried out from time to time, in particular Departments or initiates service-wide studies such as those on stores management and on arrangements for Government printing.</entry>

The main relevant targets set by the Minister for the Public Service are the staffing levels and the DPS recommendations are used to help Departments stay within those levels.</entry>

            <entry>In the CSTC programme of training for 1986, a new suite of development courses was introduced including courses on &ldquo;Managing for Results&rdquo; and &ldquo;Management and Information Resources&rdquo;, which cover the topic areas mentioned in this recomendation.  In addition, seminars are being provided within Departments in connection with the introduction of the new management system envisaged in the White Paper.  Learning groups are being introduced within Departments to develop management in specific topic areas such as Information Technology.  Six such groups are already in operation and more are planned for the coming year.  The CSTC has also developed a packaged Information Technology course for management grades below AP level which will be delivered by Departmental Training Officers with assistance from CSTC.</entry>

            <entry>The requirement in the White Paper that staff development programmes be introduced by all Departments should ensure that all staff, including senior levels, follow a planned development programme including appropriate training (see also response to the recommendation in paragraph 83).  The possibility of expanded training in formats other than the traditional ones.  (e.g. computer-based training) is being examined but no suitable courses are yet available.</entry>

            <entry>This merger has largely taken place.  The Operations Research Unit and the personnel assigned to the Structural Reform programme have been merged with the Management Services Unit.  The advisory service of CDPS has been assigned to a new Information Management Advisory Service (IMAS) in the DPS with a much wider remit. set up as part of the implementation of the report of the Review Body on Computerisation which has been accepted by the Government.  In this context also, the remainder of CDPS (excluding the control function which has been transferred to numbers control section) has been replaced by a new Central Computing Service (CCS) which provides a bureau and systems analysis and design service for departments without their own capabilities in these functions, and certain service wide systems (e.g. payroll, communications networks).  All the advisory services referred to report to the same Deputy Secretary.</entry>

The true costs of services provided to a Department should be paid for by that Department, even if this means that the budget of Departments be adjusted upwards in order to cope with a corresponding decrease in the DPS budget. The Committee further recommends that Government Departments should seek competitive quotations for such services from external organisations, and that the Department's decision as to whether to use DPS or these external organisations should take account of a number of factors, including the relative costs.</entry>

            <entry>The detailed knowledge of Departments/Offices acquired by staff of the central control function of the DPS enables them to identify likely areas of staff surpluses as changes in the nature and range of services provided emerge.  Surpluses are also identified through staff inspection and more fundamental reviews of Departments/Offices undertaken either by the control staff or the Management Services Unit.  The annual determination, within an overall limit, of the staffing level targets for each Department/Office and the requirement on each to operate within the resources resulting for them, provide a further impetus for the identification and utilisation of surpluses.  In recent years, there has been considerable redeployment of surplus staff to areas of greatest need.</entry>

            <entry>In accordance with paragraph 4.15 of the White Paper, each Department is required during 1986 to prepare a staff development plan for its staff.  The CSTC will issue guidelines to assist Departments on the preparation of these plans.  Central to the staff development measures to be adopted is the planned programme of training designed by the CSTC for 1986.  This programme sets out the training measures which are available to individual managers beginning with basic management training and encompassing management development courses.  The appraisal reports will be a key ingredient in the identification of developments needs.  The staff development plans will form part of overall manpower policy within individual Departments (see also response to the recommendation in paragraph 75).</entry>

            <entry>A study should be undertaken to determine whether cost savings or improvements in effectiveness would result from a reallocation of responsibilities for various aspects of public service manpower planning and control, now exercised by several entities including the DPS.</entry>
            <entry>Experience has highlighted gaps in effectiveness due to lack of coordinated responsibility for policy development in these areas. This is being remedied by the assignment to the DPS of statutory authority for coordinating manpower, organisation, pay and personnel across the entire public service.

            <entry>During 1985 the cost, including an estimated apportionment of overhead costs based on a standard civil service costing method, for all of the Department's programmes was established.  Some provisions in the DPS Vote for certain administrative support services were not allocated to specific programmes.  Budgets have also been assigned to individual managers.  The normal monthly expenditure reports are being augumented by the issue of monthly reports on expenditure from the DPS Vote by programme and by individual manager.  The preparation of the 1986 Estimates for the DPS was based on demands from sections on a programme basis.</entry>

      <P>As explained to the Deputy in reply to a similar question earlier this year, my Department some few years back considered a proposal to extend the pier at Ballycrovane. <Col N="2912" /> In view of the level of fishing from the pier it was considered that the substantial costs involved could not be justified economically in the fishery interest.  There has been no change in that situation in the meantime that would justify the extension of the pier.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Fisheries and Forestry (Mr. Kavanagh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 146, 147 and 148 together.</P>
      <P>Two reports of the committee on Public Expenditure relate to the functions of my Department.  These are the Review of State Expenditure on the Forestry and Wildlife Service, and the report on State Support and Services to the Fishing Industry.</P>
      <P>As regards the report on the Forest and Wildlife Service (FWS), some of the recommendations relating to the establishment of a management and reporting system, a review of the marketing of timber and the establishment of new accounting procedures fall to be considered in the context of (a) such reorganisation of the FWS as may be undertaken on the recommendations of the Forestry Review Group which have been under examination by my Department, and (b) implementation of the Government's White Paper on the Public Service.  With regard to the recommendations on private forestry, I had already, prior to the committee's report, decided to continue headage payments to farmers who afforest all or part of their holdings.  During the past year also two pilot projects aimed at increasing private afforestation were prepared in consultation with my Department by ACOT, AFT and the ICOS and submitted to the EEC for consideration for financial assistance.  The remaining recommendations of the committee will where feasible be considered in the context of on-going policy reviews.</P>
      <P>The recommendations of the report on the fishing industry have been under examination in the context of the preparation of the White Paper on the fishing industry which I hope to publish in the new year.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will recall, a meeting took place with a deputation from Clare County Council earlier this year to discuss proposals for the development of the fishing industry in Clare at which it was agreed that the case of Doonbeg be given particular attention for harbour development.  To this end my Department's engineers met on site with the Clare County engineer to discuss the options for the improvement of facilities at Doonbeg.  A proposal has been drawn up and is being examined in my Department in the light of fish stocks available and the type and scale of fleet required to exploit these stocks.</P>
      <P>With regard to Carrigaholt, I have approved a grant for the stabilization of the pierhead and for general improvements and work will commence as soon as weather permits.</P>
      <P>My Department have also received a proposal from Clare County Council for harbour improvement works at Liscannor and I have arranged for a Department's engineer to meet the Clare County engineer on site, to discuss the proposal and any other proposals the County Council might have for harbour development in Clare.</P>

      <P>My Department are currently examining the suitability of systems which use microwave frequencies, for the distribution of television signals in this country.

    <P Just="Center">Note regarding Customs Documentation Processed at Road Stations.</P>
    <P>(a)Information regarding the number of Customs entries processed annually at road stations is not available.  However, details of the number of trade transactions processed are available but only for the years after 1978.  Each tariff code number quoted on an entry represents a trade transaction and while the number of trade transactions on an entry can vary significantly the average number of trade transactions on an import entry is 1.9.</P>
    <P>(b)On 1st January, 1985, the Revenue Commissioners introduced a statistical threshold of £100 in trade statistics from which the details on the above tabular statement have been extracted. Accordingly, the 1985 figures do not include details of transactions less than £100 in value which, although processed for customs purposes, were excluded from the trade statistics, with the exception of transactions relating to (i) imports on which Customs, CAP charges or Excise duty is payable and (ii) imports into Customs bonded warehouses.</P>
    <P>(c)For the year 1979 details of the transactions processed at Carrigans Road Station and Swanlinbar Road Station are not available as these figures were included in the 1979 figures for Bridgend and Clones respectively.</P>

Accordingly, the 1985 figures do not include details of transactions less than £100 in value which, although processed for Customs purposes were excluded for the trade statistics, with the exception of transactions relating to exports subject to charges.</P>
    <P>(c)For the year 1979 details of the transactions processed at Carriagans Road Station and Swanlinbar Road Station are not available as these figures were included in the 1979 figures for Bridgend and Clones respectively.</P>

      <P>The fact that a company pay VAT at the point of entry does not alter the statutory position in relation to timely payment of the tax and relevant interest charges. Value-added tax becomes payable by the 19th day of the month immediately following a taxable period.  Under section 21 of the Value-Added Tax Act, 1972, as amended, simple interest at the rate of 1.25 per cent per month or part of a month is payable on tax remitted after the due date.</P>

In addition to a retirement pension the taxpayers is in receipt of a social welfare old age (contributory) pension.  This pension is paid gross and it is standard practice to collect the tax attributable to it by restricting the aggregate tax-free allowances set against the retirement pension under PAYE.</P>

      <P>The deposit interest retention tax has yielded £5 million more in 1986 than the budget estimate of gross yield from the tax.  This £5 million represents less than 4 per cent of the estimated gross yield and is within normal limits for the estimation of receipts from a new tax.</P>
      <P>I am conscious of the effect of the tax on those aged over 65, and that is why I provided in the Finance Act, 1986, that retention tax may be repaid to persons aged 65 years or over who would not otherwise be liable to tax on the relevant deposit interest.</P>

      <Col N="2950" /> The facts are that in the period 1979 to 1985 the total grant commitments received by Ireland from the European Regional Development Fund amounted to IR£505 million.  Of this amount IR£118 million was in respect of the telecommunications development programme which referred to the country as a whole and which cannot feasibly be identified on a county by county basis.</P>
    <P>Of the IR£387 million which may be identified on a county by county basis IR£83 million was in respect of projects located in Dublin.</P>
    <P>In 1986 the total ERDF grants approved to date amount to IR£66.7 million of which IR£6.1 million is in respect of projects located in Dublin.</P>
    <P>The Deputy is aware that receipts from the European Regional Development Fund are used to increase the overall resources available for the development of the whole of the country through Public Capital Programme.</P>

      <P>The husband is receiving invalidity pension at the rate of £67.10 a week, that is, £47.10 and a special temporary payment of £20.  This special payment is being made as his wife is receiving disability benefit at the rate of £41.10 a week and under the equality provisions for men and women in social welfare matters he is not entitled to be paid for her as an adult dependant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The rate of disability benefit in payment to the wife was increased by £5 a week in May of this year under phase I of the implementation of the equal treatment provisions.  Therefore, the couple are suffering an overall loss of £5.60 a week.  However, the wife would be entitled to claim invalidity pension now <Col N="2968" /> and if her claim were successful she would qualify for a weekly pension of £47.10.  A claim form has been issued to her and her claim will be reviewed immediately it is returned.</P>
    <P>A husband in receipt of invalidity pension could not be paid an increase for his wife as an adult dependant if she were also in receipt of a similar pension in her own right.  However, there was an entitlement to claim an increase in invalidity pension where the wife of the pensioner was on disability benefit.  This of course has now changed as explained above.</P>

      <P>Entitlement to pay-related benefit with flat rate unemployment benefit is subject to the condition that the weekly sum of pay-related benefit, flat rate unemployment benefit and income tax rebate may not exceed 85 per cent of the net average weekly earnings of a claimant.</P>
      <P>The person concerned claimed unemployment benefit on 24 January 1986 and payment of flat rate unemployment benefit was made at the weekly rate of £85 to 9 July 1986 increasing to £87.60 from 10 July 1986 in accordance with the budget increase.  The 85 per cent limit applicable in his case was calculated at £76.45 and, as the rate of flat rate unemployment benefit exceeded this figure, no pay-related benefit was payable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Resulting from the implementation of the second phase of the EC Directive on equal treatment for men and women in social welfare matters from 20 November 1986, an unemployment benefit claimant whose spouse is in insurable employment and earning more than £50 weekly may not be admitted as a dependant of the claimant.  The wife of the person concerned is in insurable employment and <Col N="2978" /> earning more than £50 weekly; as a result, she was considered not to be an adult dependant from 20 November 1986, and the adult dependant allowance, previously payable in respect of her, ceased.  Consequently the flat rate unemployment benefit of the person concerned was reduced to £71 weekly.  This comprises a personal rate of £41.10; £19.90, being the appropriate child dependant increase in respect of two children, and on a transitional basis, £10, to alleviate the loss of the adult dependant allowance. Half of the child dependant increase is being paid on a transitional basis.</P>
    <P>As £71 was below the 85 per cent limit applicable in his case, from 20 November 1986 he became entitled to pay-related benefit of £5.45 weekly, being the difference between the limit figure of £76.45 and £71.  Arrears of pay-related benefit due will be paid this week.</P>
    <P>There appears to be some doubt regarding the amount of income tax paid by the person concerned during the period 6 April 1985 to 17 January 1986 when his employment terminated. Inquiries are being made to ascertain the correct amount of income tax which was payable in his case.  When these inquiries are completed his entitlement to pay-related benefit will be reviewed.</P>

      <P>The Department's records show that the person concerned had 472 reckonable contributions in the average test period which, in his case, is from January 1953 to April 1982, This is equal to a yearly average of only 16 and, therefore, he does not qualify for an old age contributory pension.</P>

The liquidator of the company applied to my Department under the Protection of Employees (Employers' Insolvency) Act, 1984, for funds to pay the person concerned the compensation which had been awarded by the Employment Appeals Tribunal.  A payment totalling £1,383 was issued to the liquidator from the redundancy and employers' insolvency fund on 6 November 1986 to enable him to pay the person concerned the awards made by the Employment Appeals Tribunal, in accordance with Statutory Instrument No. 356 of 1984.</P>
      <P>I understand that the liquidator has so far failed to make the payment to the person concerned.  Because of the liquidator's delay in making payment in this case my Department have referred the matter to their legal advisers.  It is a cause of concern to me that the liquidator has so far failed to pay over the money issued to him on 6 November.  I can assure the Deputy that I will take whatever action is necessary to ensure that this money is paid over to the person concerned as soon as possible.

    <P>I am satisfied that employment and training schemes are effective in meeting their objective.  The establishment of the new National Employment and Training Authority in the near future will bring about a more co-ordinated approach to the services currently provided by AnCO, CERT and the NMS.</P>

      <P>The person concerned applied to participate in the enterprise scheme on 7 July 1986 and duly commenced on 21 July 1986. Before entering the scheme, he had been drawing pay-related benefit and he had not exhausted his entitlement to it. Under the enterprise scheme, he applied on 9 September 1986 to capitalise this benefit for the purpose of assisting him in financing essential start-up costs of his enterprise.  The application has now been approved and payment will issue shortly.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Labour if he will make regulations forthwith under the European Communities <Col N="3009" /> Act, 1972, for the purpose of better applying the EC directive under the Protection of Employees (Employers' Insolvency) Act, 1984, with effect from 22 October 1983 and if he will make other regulations under that Act and under other enabling legislation for the following purposes: (1) the repeal of section 3 (1) (f) of the Minimum Notice Act, 1973, and section 7 (2) (d) of the Protection of Employment Act, 1977 (marine employees); (2) for full implementation of tribunal awards made under the Minimum Notice Act, 1973; (3) for implementation of Labour Court recommendations on final rates of pay and on terms for redundancy compensation agreed for mariners and other employees prior to a date of insolvency; (4) the application of the Act of 1984 to employees between age 16 and 18 to prevent exploitation of juvenile employees; (5) the application of the Act to employees presently excluded under section 3 but to protect pension contributions; and (6) to enable trade union members to recover trade union contributions retained by an insolvent employer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>The provisions of Council Directive No. 80/987/EEC, which is designed to protect statutory and contractual entitlements of employees whose employers have become insolvent, are already fully implemented under the Protection of Employees (Employers' Insolvency) Act, 1984.</P>
      <P>The position in regard to each of the specific amendments suggested is as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(1)  The question of repeal of section 3(1) (f) of the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act, 1973, and of section 7(2) (d) of the Protection of Employment Act, 1977, would be appropriate for consideration as part of more general reviews of those Acts. It would not be feasible, in any event, to repeal them retrospectively as suggested by the Deputy since this would <Col N="3010" /> impose retrospective obligations on the employers concerned.  In relation to the amendment of the Protection of Employment Act, 1977, it is relevant to mention also that EEC Council Directive No. 75/129/EEC of 17 February 1975 to which that Act gives effect specifically excludes &ldquo;the crews of seagoing vessels&rdquo; from its scope.</P>
    <P>(2) Presumably, this refers to the upper wage limit applied to payments under the Protection of Employees (Employers' Insolvency) Act, 1984, in respect of awards made by the Employment Appeals Tribunal including awards made under the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act, 1973.  The inclusion of a limit of this kind, which is normal in benefit schemes, is specifically provided for on cost grounds in Council Directive 80/987/EEC relating to insolvency payments. The amount of the limit is reviewed periodically in the light of movements in wages and other relevant considerations.</P>
    <P>(3) This proposal raises issues of free collective bargaining which would not be appropriately dealt with in the context of the Protection of Employees (Employers' Insolvency) Act, 1984. Any disputes between employees and employers concerning the appropriate rates of pay at the date of insolvency for the purpose of the 1984 Act or of the amounts of statutory redundancy lump sums under the Redundancy Payments Acts can be referred to the Employment Appeals Tribunal for determination under existing provisions.</P>
    <P>(4) Employees between the ages of 16 and 18 are eligible for payments under the Insolvency Act, 1984, subject to the same conditions as other employees and specifically provided that they are &ldquo;employed in employment which is insurable for all benefits under the Social Welfare Acts, 1981 to 1984.  There is, therefore, no basis for any suggestion that young workers are open to exploitation on that account.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="3011" /> (5) I am not aware that any specific problem has arisen as regards reimbursement of pension contributions under the 1984 Act solely because of the operation of section 3 of that Act, which relates to employees in employment which is insurable for all benefits under the Social Welfare Acts, 1981 to 1984.</P>
    <P>(6) I understand that the issue of application of section 6 of the 1984 Act to trade union contributions deducted from wages of employees of insolvent employers but not paid over to the trade unions concerned is at present the subject of an appeal before the Employment Appeals Tribunal and that the question of reference to the courts for determination of the issue may arise.  In the circumstances, I feel that it would be better for me to withhold comment at this stage.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 300, 301 and 302 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report of the Dáil Committee on Public Expenditure entitled &ldquo;Proposals to establish a centralised State agency for persons registering for employment or training&rdquo; issued on 31 May 1984 concerning possible action to streamline the various manpower services and programmes relates to my Department.  The <Col N="3016" /> report was discussed in the Dáil on 28 June 1984.</P>
    <P>Since June 1984 the White Paper on Manpower Policy was published.  The White Paper responds to the following recommendations of the report: 9.1 &mdash; co-ordination between Departments and agencies involved in employment/ training programmes; 9.4 &mdash; links between the Department of Social Welfare and the National Manpower Service to be strengthened by introduction of compatible computerised records; 9.6 &mdash; the establishment of the National Manpower Service as a single user point of contact for all services available; 9.9 &mdash; the Department of Education should have primary responsibility for educating and training young people and AnCO should not, in principle, duplicate such courses; 9.12 &mdash; lack of clarity between the Youth Employment Agency and the Department of Labour; 9.14 &mdash; the rearrangement or rationalisation of the existing agencies into one multi-faced entity to administer the full range of recruitment, training and employment related issues.</P>
    <P>Recommendations number 9.1, 9.12 and 9.14 have been further progressed with the introduction of the National Employment and Training Authority Bill in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>The other recommendations are mainly of an operational nature and in the context of ensuring a more efficient and effective delivery of services will be examined by the new authority when it is established.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>Information in the precise form requested by the Deputy is not readily available.  The following data in relation to schemes operated by the National Manpower Service in my Department most closely approximates that sought.</P>
      <P>Teamwork Scheme: Teamwork is a community managed scheme designed to help local voluntary organisations provide temporary community based employment for the mutual benefit of the under 25s and their community.  Since January 1983 to date, 13 projects have been sanctioned in County Louth providing employment for 96 young workers and 12 supervisors.  Grant aid totalling £365,105 has been sanctioned in respect of these projects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="3018" /> Enterprise Allowance Scheme: The EAS is designed to encourage unemployed persons to establish a business. Since January 1983 to date 770 persons have participated on the enterprise allowance scheme in County Louth involving expenditure in the region of £1,190,800.</P>
    <P>Work Experience Programme: The work experience programme is designed to provide young people with access to the world of work and exposure to the working environment.  Since January 1983, approximately 1,723 people in County Louth have availed of the work experience programme involving expenditure of £1,027,808.10.</P>
    <P>Employment Incentive Scheme: The objectives of the employment incentive scheme are to create new permanent jobs and to increase economic activity by offering to employers financial support to increase employment in their business. Recruitment statistics are not compiled on a county basis.  Available figures relate to the North-East Region of the National Manpower Service (comprises Cavan, Monaghan and Louth).  Since 30 April 1984, 1,269 notified recruitments have taken place.  This represents approximately 6-6.5 per cent of the national total.</P>
    <P>Social Employment Scheme (SES): Under the social employment scheme, public sector and voluntary organisations may sponsor work projects which are of benefit to the community.  The scheme is aimed at helping the long term unemployed who are over 25 years of age by placing them in employment on such projects.</P>
    <P>Statistics relating to the social employment scheme are compiled on an NMS regional basis.  The first projects under SES came on stream in April 1985.  In the North-East Region of the NMS (Cavan, Monaghan and Louth), 91 projects commenced operation in 1985 providing employment for 446 persons.  Grant aid amounting to approximately £2.36 million was allocated for the operation of these projects.</P>
    <P>In 1986, an additional 97 projects commenced in the North East Region employing a further 668 persons.  Grant <Col N="3019" /> aid amounting to approximately £3.54 million has been allocated for the operation of these projects.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>The most detailed information available on the number of people who received training on training schemes in County Louth under AnCO and YEA and on costs is as follows:</P>
      <P>AnCO: The training centre at Dundalk was responsible for training 1,452 people between January 1986 and end November, 1986.  This figure includes direct training and programmes such as CYTP supervised from the training centre.  In addition a further 204 people will have been trained by AnCO's external training division in 1986.</P>
      <P>It is not possible to give a breakdown of AnCO costs as between wages, administration etc.  The total costs for AnCO in County Louth are: Training centres to end-November, £3 million approximately; External Training projected to end-December, £340,482.</P>
      <P>YEA: The major YEA programmes relate to employment.  However, 47 persons are being trained at present by ACOT on a scheme funded by YEA at a cost of £8,400.  In addition 440 persons received training under the vocational preparation training programme (VPTP) and the total cost came to £132,000.  This scheme is the responsibility of the Department of Education and receives support from the youth employment levy.</P>

The most detailed information relating to counties, training centres and type of courses is set out below, disaggregated on the basis of AnCO training centres, AnCO external training, CERT and YEA.</P>
      <P>With regard to AnCO training centres, Table 1 outlines participants on courses and individual training centres at end November, 1986.  A county breakdown is not available.  With regard to AnCO external training, Table 2 summarises participants on courses by county in November 1986.</P>
      <P>With regard to CERT, it is not possible to give a breakdown by county. However, the following breakdown is by location for persons under 18 on school-based programmes.</P>
