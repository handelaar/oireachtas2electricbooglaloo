      <P>I hope it will not take us as long to discuss this matter as it did the question of failure or breakdown yesterday. The purpose of the amendment is to delete &ldquo;possibility&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;likelihood&rdquo;. Use of the word &ldquo;possibility&rdquo; may prove very difficult when courts are discussing whether it is possible that two people can be reconciled.  Anything that is not impossible is possible.  I wonder could we have some order in the House.</P>

      <P>Use of the word &ldquo;likelihood&rdquo; would prevent people from dreaming up fanciful arguments to advance their case.  The word excludes any contrived possibility.  There is always the possibility of a possibility.  &ldquo;Possibility&rdquo; is not very definite.  I understand that generally in law the words is never used, that words like &ldquo;likelihood&rdquo; are used instead.  &ldquo;Likelihood&rdquo; would be a more acceptable term and it would allow the courts to establish more clearly whether two people would be likely to be reconciled.  Many lawyers, arguing for the party against a divorce would be able to advance very fanciful arguments to suggest that it is not impossible that the two people would be reconciled and therefore, if it is not impossible, it must be considered to be reasonably possible.  It is in order not to make divorce totally impossible, in order to provide for dissolution and to allow people to remarry that I believe the substitution of this word is desirable and more acceptable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Whereas I had some <Col N="1754" /> measure of agreement in regard to Deputy Harney's amendment yesterday, I find myself at variance with the Deputy this morning.  I reiterate my view that the Government, in deciding on this form of words and deciding to put it into the Constitution by way of amendment as distinct from merely removing the constitutional ban on divorce, wish to win over a large section of the people who favour divorce and would approve of it only in very restricted, limited circumstances.  If that is the objective of the Government &mdash; and I believe it is &mdash; then the words used here are of paramount importance.</P>
      <P>I wish to clear up some apparent difference between my position and what I think the Minister thinks is my position. When I speak of a majority of people in this regard I am speaking of a majority of people who favour divorce as distinct from a majority in the community.  I am speaking of a majority of those who have indicated in some form or other in one of the many surveys and polls that they would be prepared to accept divorce.  The majority of those people have indicated they would accept divorce only in very stringent, limited circumstances.  I believe these words have been put into the amendment in order to seek approval of that section.</P>
      <P>Yesterday I asked that we should look at each of the four paragraphs separately and each on its own merits.  The court will address itself to each of the four criteria.  Here I differ considerably from Deputy Shatter, the Minister and others who spoke yesterday who wished to amalgamate the four paragraphs and read them as one.  My view is that each is a separate question to which the court will address itself.  These are four separate criteria and the court will address itself to each one separately and indicate a yes or no in regard to each of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The words in paragraph iii are of such vague character as to be rather meaningless. The Minister differs totally with me on this and he relies very heavily on paragraph iii to support his approach.  Most of us agreed yesterday that the word &ldquo;failed&rdquo; is not a satisfactory word, that it does not have the quality of finality most <Col N="1755" /> of us would wish to have included here. However, in response to that the Minister said that whatever about the virtue of the word &ldquo;failed&rdquo; we must also look at paragraph iii, that between them they make for a very strong position.  I think that is a fair summary of his position. Therefore, it behoves us to look closely at paragraph iii.</P>
    <P>The first word I would look at there is &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo;.  I cannot understand why that word is inserted.  If the Minister wishes to rely on paragraph iii as something very strong and powerful in support of his position, surely the word &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; should be left out and paragraph iii should read, &ldquo;there is no possibility of reconciliation between the parties to the marriage&rdquo;.  By introducing the word &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; we throw the gates wide open.  Again, we are back to the subjective situation that Deputy Harney and others spoke about yesterday, where on person's interpretation of &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; can be very different from somebody else's interpretation.  If the Minister is trying to persuade us that this is a very strong, powerful and restrictive provision, he should have left out the word &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; altogether.  There is a corollary between the argument on this amendment and that of yesterday. Deputy Harney wishes to substitute the word &ldquo;likelihood&rdquo; for &ldquo;possibility&rdquo; but I should prefer to remove the word &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo;.  In that case the paragraph would be definitive.  It would deal with a position of finality &mdash; a marriage has broken down and there is no possibility, hope or prospect of its ever being put together again.</P>
    <P>I should think that is something that would commend itself to most of the Deputies here who favour divorce in limited circumstances.  They would favour the situation in which divorce would be permitted where it was clear beyond any possible doubt that the marriage could not be put together again, that it had failed finally and completely.  From that point of view I argue that rather than substituting the word &ldquo;likelihood&rdquo; for <Col N="1756" />&ldquo;possibility&rdquo; we should remove the word &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; from the sentence.</P>
    <P>In this amendment Deputy Harney may be going against the thrust of her arguments yesterday.  Yesterday she wanted the phrase &ldquo;irretrievable breakdown&rdquo; because it was a stronger, more definite and more conclusive phrase than the word &ldquo;failure&rdquo;.  However, this morning she seems to be going in the opposite direction, weakening the form of words in the amendment.  There is no doubt that in this connection &ldquo;likelihood&rdquo; is a much weaker word than &ldquo;possibility&rdquo;.  If the Minister wishes to get approval for change from that section of the community and Deputies here to whom I have referred, the most persuasive thing he could do would be to remove the word &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; from paragraph iii.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>We discussed paragraph iii yesterday in the context of the word &ldquo;failure&rdquo;.  In case there is any other impression given in the media, I must repeat that I regard the word &ldquo;failure&rdquo; as a weak word and one that sets a low threshold.  Last night I set out the reasons why I thought the word was so weak.</P>
      <P>In discussing the matter the Minister drew our attention to paragraph iii and he pointed out that there was the added clause of &ldquo;no reasonable possibility of reconciliation&rdquo;.  We spent some time discussing what that might mean in practice, when the phrase could become an empty form of words.  Following what the Minister said yesterday, I have checked with legal people and there is no doubt in my mind that in practice that form of words is very weak and will not have the effect the Minister expects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having said that, I recognise that if the term &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; were deleted there would have to be something more definitive, that is, &ldquo;no possibility of reconciliation&rdquo;. I also recognise that to replace &ldquo;possibility&rdquo; with the word &ldquo;likelihood&rdquo; would put an extra onus on the defending spouse to show the likelihood or possibility of reconciliation.  In that sense it would give less protection to the existing marriage.  While in my view the protection for existing marriage is very weak as <Col N="1757" /> it stands, I would concede to the Minister that the amendment proposed by Deputy Harney would give even less protection because it would mean that the defending spouse would have to show probability of successful reconciliation.  The proposed use of the word &ldquo;likelihood&rdquo; is not desirable.</P>
    <P>The section itself is very weak.  It does not give the strength the Minister believes it to give.  That can only be seen in practice in the long run but it is there to be seen in most of the jurisdictions which have divorce.  Having participated in the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown for quite a period, it was very clear to us that such terms are an empty form of words.  I know they are well intended but in practice that is how it works out.  The fact that it is in the Constitution will not change its application.  I accept that it cannot be set aside but it will not change the normal interpretation or usage of those words.  Consequently, it is very weak as a safeguard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Dukes) Alan Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Dukes)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would remind the House that each and every one of the conditions in this proposed amendment is governed by the first sentence which states:</P>
      <P>Where, and only where, such court established under this Constitution as may be prescribed by law is satisfied that&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>In this case the court would have to be satisfied that there is no reasonable possibility of reconciliation between the parties to the marriage.  I find it a little bit out of keeping with the spirit of the debate that we should spend a lot of time with Deputy Woods simply making assertions that take no account of any discussion we have had over the past couple of days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The third condition is governed by the requirement that the court be satisfied that there is no reasonable possibility. The court, looking at the matter in a reasonable way, must decide that there is no possibility in any practical sense that <Col N="1758" /> the parties to the marriage will come together again.  In approaching this we would all distinguish between a reasonable possibility and a remote or fanciful possibility.  If the court believed that any possibility of reconciliation that might be represented to the court was remote or fanciful, it would conclude that there was no reasonable possibility.  It would exclude such remote or fanciful possibility from its consideration.</P>
    <P>If we were to substitute the word &ldquo;likelihood&rdquo; for &ldquo;possibility&rdquo;, as Deputy Harney has proposed, that would impose a less strict requirement on a person seeking divorce.  On that, if on no other point, I am in agreement with Deputy Haughey and Deputy Woods.  Such a substitution would weaken the provision.  It would be sufficient to show, for example, in order to get a divorce that it would be highly unlikely that there would be a reconciliation of any kind.  That would be much easier to show than that there was no reasonable possibility.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Not even highly unlikely, just unlikely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am putting the argument in its darker colours to give it emphasis. If we were to remove the word &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo;, which has been proposed, although I note that there is no amendment to that effect, no divorce would ever be granted because it would be impossible ever to show conclusively that there was no possibility of something coming about.  In that case I do not think a court could ever be satisfied, as it is required to be by this amendment, that there is no possibility whatever and it would therefore find itself in the position of never being able to grant a divorce. Absolutes in those terms are very rarely found in human behaviour.  I would not accept Deputy Harney's proposal because it would weaken the provision I have proposed.  Nor could I accept Deputy Haughey's proposal because that would make the condition inoperable and bring about a situation where we could not in any circumstances see a divorce being granted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1759" />
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. D. Andrews Mr. D. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I would again like to pay tribute to Deputy Mary Harney for introducing the &ldquo;unlikely&rdquo; amendment.  I appreciate that she has again given us an opportunity to hang our arguments on some formula of words.  I do not agree with the amendment.  As has been argued by the Minister, by Deputy Haughey and by Deputy Woods, the intrusion of the word &ldquo;likelihood&rdquo; would make the requirement less strict and would dilute to some considerable degree the provision before us.  It would weaken the provision.  I say that with respect to Deputy Harney's amendment.  It is important that we have the amendment and the opportunity of teasing out the meaning of words.  We also have to take account of the likely effect of the words on the provisions before us.  I agree too with Deputy Haughey that if the Minister seeks to achieve what he wants to achieve, the passage of this Bill and the putting of it into effect, the removal of the word &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; is a proper suggestion. The third paragraph would thus state that &ldquo;there is no possibility of reconciliation between the parties to the marriage&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>While the Minister is entitled to make the point that the courts would have difficulty in interpreting the section with the word &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; removed, that is a matter of opinion.  We return then to the first sentence which states:</P>
      <P>Where, and only where, such court established under this Constitution as may be prescribed by law is satisfied that&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a matter of satisfying the court and convincing the presiding judge of the efficacy of the law interpreted against the amended Article in the Constitution.  I would see absolutely no reasonable grounds for the Minister's suggestion.  I think it would give finality.  There is an air of finality about the phrase &ldquo;There is no possibility&rdquo;.  I want to see the amendment passed and I want to see the referendum succeed.  But, in achieving that, I want to present to the people a reasonable, understandable and comprehensive amendment.  So I would suggest that the <Col N="1760" /> proposal by Deputy Haughey is a reasonable proposal, that it introduces finality where, after all, finality is sought.  When we are talking about Church annulments we are talking about a situation where the Church says a marriage never existed. If we are talking about State law, we are seeking to introduce divorce where, while a marriage has existed, it now ceases to exist, and that is what finality is all about. Therefore I would ask the Minister to have a new look at the removal of the word between now and the Report Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. J. Doyle Mr. J. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not look forward to a society in which one can abandon one's partner who has put total trust in one and in whom one stakes so much of one's life. I do not look forward to a society in which a wife or husband or children can be easily abandoned and left in difficult circumstances and wounded in their personalities. But life is difficult and all things do not always work out as we had planned. We are faced with marital breakdown and we have to address ourselves to that problem.  In doing that we have to find a form of words which will not destabilise society.  That form of words has to be as restrictive as possible.  The Irish people showed in the polls that that is the kind of legislation they will vote for.  If these words can be improved upon I will be happy about it.  But certainly the introduction of the word, &ldquo;likelihood&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;possibility&rdquo; is a watering down of the meaning and for that reason I could not support the amendment of Deputy Harney.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned that the drift of the debate so far, in relation to the teasing out of the legal definitions of these words, is towards a hardening of the view that we should make this amendment so restrictive that it would be virtually impossible for a person whose marriage has genuinely broken down to actually get a divorce. The purpose of the exercise we are engaged in should be to assist those whose marriages have broken down.  The remarks of Deputies Haughey, Woods and Doyle and of the Minister would seem to indicate that we should make this <Col N="1761" /> thing so tight that it would only be the very rare case that will succeed in actually achieving a divorce in our courts.  That seems to fly in the face of the opinion expressed through opinion polls, certainly by my own constituents, who see the need in their day to day lives for a situation where a person can go to court if necessary and declare that his marriage has broken down and that the various legislative strictures which are being proposed in the legislation later on have been met and that the court will grant them a dissolution of their marriage.</P>
      <P>If we continue on the lines of arguing that the words &ldquo;possiblility&rdquo; and &ldquo;reasonable possibility&rdquo; and &ldquo;failed&rdquo; will provide for an extremely restrictive access to divorce, then we are defeating the purpose of bringing in an amendement to the Constitution at all.  I would like the Minister therefore to indicate to us examples of the kind of reasonable possibility which would be acceptable as grounds for divorce when this amendment goes through.  It seems &mdash; and it has been said before in the course of this Committee Stage debate &mdash; that what we may be doing by giving too restrictive an interpretation of this amendment is creating a legal quagmire that the legal profession on both sides will spend possibly years trying to tease out.  I have heard it said that in many cases judges take into account the views expressed in the Dáil when legislation is going through.  I do not know whether that is correct or not &mdash; it is just a layman's reading of the situation.  But, if that is so, I would be extremely concerned that we are setting a headline here which would make it virtually impossible for those who need divorce to actually get divorce, despite the fact that the people may have passed the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say a few words in support of Deputy Harney's amendment.  I am disappointed to see the reaction to it from the Minister and from others.  It would seem to me to be an amendment that on the face of it should be acceptable to people taking a reasonable <Col N="1762" /> view of this whole question.  Indeed, I am disturbed by attitudes which seem to be coming through in this debate which would seem to suggest that there are Deputies who, while accepting the basic principle that the question of repeal on the ban on divorce should be put before the people, are ensuring that in the Bill there are conditions which are so extremely restrictive that, quite honestly, I wonder how this is going to operate in practice.</P>
      <P>Of the restrictions of which there are many, I think this word &ldquo;possibility&rdquo; may well be one of the most important, because if a judge reads this provision literally, as he must and he cannot take account of views expressed here or elsewhere, he could quite easily come to the conclusion in his own mind that only in the most exceptional circumstances is there no reasonable possibility of reconciliation at some time in the future.  The word &ldquo;likelihood&rdquo; is a less extreme word. I would suggest that it is a more normal word in this context and it is the kind of word that one would more normally get in a provision of this kind.  I cannot think offhand of many occasions in legislation where the word &ldquo;possibility&rdquo; is used in this way.  There is a good reason that it is not used.  It is because it is a word which leaves open an enormous number of possibilities &mdash; I know not using the word itself is not a very good way to define something but it is an indication of the extremity of the word and the difficulty of getting oneself outside the category of &ldquo;no reasonable possibility&rdquo;.  Clearly, the word &ldquo;likelihood&rdquo; is preferable in all the circumstances because it allows the court some reasonable discretion based on the facts of the marriage breakdown which is before it.  The word &ldquo;possibility&rdquo; leaves very little discretion.  It is possible that judges will take the view that only most extreme cases of breakdown and incompatibility are covered by this, and I do not think that is reasonable.  For that reason I believe the Minister should think about this again and try to weigh up the advantages of using a less extreme word like &ldquo;likelihood&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know it is a strategy of the Government <Col N="1763" /> to put fairly onerous conditions on this proposal and that it is being done for what are probably valid political reasons; but in this instance I believe they are going beyond what is reasonable in terms of conditions and that it will make it extremely difficult to comply with this provision.  If the word &ldquo;likelihood&rdquo; were used in the constitutional amendment, that does not preclude the word &ldquo;possibility&rdquo; being used in the legislation; but, unfortunately, we could not use the word &ldquo;likelihood&rdquo; in the legislation if the word &ldquo;possibility&rdquo; is used here.</P>
    <P>I do not believe as a general principle that a Constitution should be so incredibly detailed, precise and unusually limiting as this provision is.  Some sort of discretion should be allowed to the Legislature and to the courts but they have very little discretion under this provision. I can see long arguments being made about the existence of some possibility of reconciliation even in the most unlikely circumstances.  A court might come to the conclusion that it is not satisfied that there is no such reasonable possibility because there is a double onus on the court &mdash; it has to be satisfied and it has to hold that there is no reasonable possibility. In those circumstances, and to prevent this provision being so extraordinarily restrictive as to make any possible future law almost unworkable, I think very serious consideration should be given to the use of the word &ldquo;likelihood&rdquo; here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Malley and Deputy De Rossa said they felt that the words I spoke about would mean that no one would be able to avail of this facility. That is not true, but we are concerned that divorce will not be easily available. There is a difference between those two things.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley spoke about a valid political reason for these words.  It annoys me when I hear the word &ldquo;political&rdquo; brought into issues regulating human relations.  The word &ldquo;political&rdquo; should not be mentioned.  What we are trying to do is to find the right wording in the best <Col N="1764" /> interests of society.  Deputy O'Malley put his finger on the issue which concerns me and many other people who would like to see a restrictive form of divorce.  He asked how this will work in practice.  That is the question I, too, am asking.  How will the courts interpret this?  I do not want to give further discretion or latitude to the courts or to the Legislature than is in these words.  I believe the words we are speaking about are the most positive we can find to have a form of restrictive divorce in Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>In my contribution I was not imputing any ulterior motives to the Minister, to Deputy Doyle or to the Fianna Fáil speakers.  My concern was that they were expressing anxiety that the wording would be restrictive.  The effect of that would be that the people for whom we are supposed to be passing this amendment would be unable to get a divorce because of the restrictive nature of the words we are using.</P>
      <P>I am not a legal person and I do not pretend to understand the legal niceties between &ldquo;reasonable possibility&rdquo; and &ldquo;likelihood&rdquo;, &ldquo;likely&rdquo;, &ldquo;failure&rdquo; and &ldquo;breakdown&rdquo;.  There are lawyers who could probably spend the rest of their lives debating these issues without coming to a conclusion.  But, when this amendment is passed by the people and when the legislation is passed by this House as a follow up to that amendment, the courts will have to decide the interpretation of the words we use.  I want to be clear in agreeing to this amendment that the words are not so restrictive that it would be virtually impossible to get a divorce.</P>

    <P>It has been estimated that there are about 70,000 adults involved in marriage breakdown.  Deputy Shatter indicated that the figure is higher, while others have argued that it is lower.  Irrespective of how high or low the figure may be, we all know there are people involved in marriage breakdown who have created second families. It would be intolerable if we created a position where they could not approach a court to have their position legalised.  My sole concern is that the <Col N="1765" /> people who need a divorce to regularise second relationships will be enabled to go to court and have that done.  Perhaps if the Minister would tell the House how he foresees the wording used being interpreted in the courts that might clarify the position and we would see if our fears are well founded.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not intend to intervene again but some of the remarks that have been made require me to do so. First, I want to make it clear what I see as my duty in the Dáil today: it is to help inform public opinion exactly on what they will be voting.  Much of the argument going on here today it seems would be much more appropriate and relevant to divorce legislation if such were ever to come before this House, but that is not what we are dealing with.  We are dealing with a proposition asking the people to put an amendment into our Constitution. It is a different issue.</P>
      <P>They may at the end of the day, sometime in the future, come to a specific conclusion, but at this stage we are concerned only with amending and putting certain words into the Constitution, and it is to try to help the voter to form a balanced and mature judgement on that issue that I intervened, not specifically in favour of more restrictive or less restrictive words, but simply to try to tease out exactly what the words before us are. Therefore, I am not advocating by way of amendment any change or form of words.  I am confining myself simply to teasing out and examining the words that are here and their implication, so that when the people go to the polls they will, to the greatest possible degree of human certainty, know what they are proposing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I come back to the point of trying to elucidate for one section of the community what exactly is in this amendment.  It is that section of the community who I believe are in the majority of those who would be prepared to have divorce introduced in certain circumstances.  I believe that section of the community would wish to know that the constitutional amendment <Col N="1766" /> would restrict to the greatest possible extent circumstances in which divorce would be allowed.  I may be wrong, but I think that is the wish of a considerable section of those who are in favour of divorce.  Therefore, it is important that we try to show to that section of the people whether the form of the words here which it is proposed to put into the Constitution achieve that the dissolution of marriage will be permitted only where that marriage has totally, finally and completely broken down and failed irretrievably. That is the main purpose of my examination of these words.</P>
    <P>Does this amendment bring that about?  Deputy O'Malley, Deputy Harney, Deputy De Rossa and others may argue that that is not what they want. I thought yesterday from the amendment supported by Deputy Harney and Deputy O'Malley in regard to irretrievable breakdown that they wanted very close wording, but if that is not what they want then &ldquo;likelihood&rdquo; is probably a better word than &ldquo;possibility&rdquo;.  If they want more flexibility, they are perfectly entitled to argue for that.  If the Government case here is that these words will ensure that divorce and dissolution of marriage will be permitted only when the first marriage has totally, completely, finally and irretrievably broken down, these words will not achieve that.</P>
    <P>The word &ldquo;failed&rdquo; we fairly generally agreed here yesterday has not the element of finality in it.  Add to that the words &ldquo;reasonable possibility&rdquo;, and between them, taking those two things together, there is a flexibility, a lack of finality or certainly in this form of amendment. I am concerned just to try to examine fully and completely whether this form of words here, these four criteria when they come into operation, will have the effect of ensuring that dissolutions are granted only in the sort of circumstances to which I think the majority of people on the divorce side would wish divorce to be restricted.</P>
    <P>One important point about this is how it will work out in practice, and a number of Deputies asked that.  That really is the key to a great deal of what we are saying. <Col N="1767" /> Of course we cannot know.  We are trying to legislate for a future situation about which we cannot have any certainty. Judges have different point of view. They have their idiosyncracies, peculiarities, views and preferences and likewise dislikes, so it is very difficult for us to visualise how this new situation will work out in practice.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of it is that this set of words will govern legislation.  How will the Parliament of the day decide whether some form of legislation fits in with these words?  The Supreme Court will probably have to decide whether the Parliament is right in deciding that the legislation is in conformity with the principles laid down in this amendment.  It is all very doubtful and uncertain and none of us should be foolish enough to try to assert with any certainty how it is all going to work out in the end.  All we can do is address ourselves to it and try to ensure by close examination and honest discussion here, which I think we are having, that we are as clear as we can be in our minds as to what exactly we are putting before the people.  We owe it to the people.</P>
    <P>The constitutional process is there.  The people who framed the Constitution and the people who adopted it have made it very clear that before we make any change in the Constitution this process must be gone through.  They wanted to ensure that this House would examine fully what the proposed change was, its implications and so on, before it would go before the people.  That is the process we are engaged in.  It is a necessary process and all aspects of it must be examined. If Deputy Woods, I and others on this side of the House feel that this amendment in the way it is worded at present does not provide that in future dissolution will be granted only where a marriage has failed beyond redemption, then we have a duty to say so and to ask the people to take that into consideration when voting.</P>
    <P>The people in their wisdom may say: &ldquo;We do not want to confine the situation to incidents where marriage has completely, irretrievably and finally broken <Col N="1768" /> down; we are prepared to be more lenient about it&rdquo; but our duty here today in looking at these words is to try to make it absolutely clear to the people whether a form of words they are voting for does one thing or the other.  In regard to the form of words here, the words &ldquo;failure&rdquo; and &ldquo;reasonable possibility&rdquo;, as distinct from naked &ldquo;possibility&rdquo;, I do not think we are creating a situation where there has to be an irremediable, total and final breakdown of marriage beyond any possibility of ever putting it together again.</P>

      <P>Deputies Harney, O'Malley and De Rossa are worried by what they regard as the excessive rigidity of they conditions under which divorce would be granted under the proposals here.  I set out the Government's view as to what those conditions should be in the text before us.  We have a view from Deputy Woods and Deputy Haughey to the effect that they would like to see more restrictive conditions than those in the amendment. I know I am probably inferring a view there because Deputy Woods, in spite of a pressing invitation last night, did not say what his position was&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a pity that Deputy Haughey left, although I am not making a point about it.  Since last evening we have a view of what his position might be since it appears he made the statement which he might have made on Second Stage if he had been here.  It is fair to say that one can infer a position from what Deputy Woods has been saying over the last day or so and from what Deputy Haughey said last night.  I find that I occupy the middle ground in that discussion. I can understand why Deputy Harney, Deputy O'Malley and Deputy <Col N="1769" /> De Rossa might wish to take a less rigorous view of the conditions than that set out here, although I do not happen to agree that that is what we should do in present circumstances.</P>
      <P>I have more difficulty in understanding the position adopted by Deputy Woods and Deputy Haughey which seems to be, in spite of the very analytical stance of Deputy Haughey, not simply that they want to tease out the implications but that they would prefer to see a much more restrictive approach than that proposed in the Government amendment.  It is important to make that point, not just for the purposes of debate, but for the information of the people watching this debate.</P>
      <P>Deputy De Rossa asked for some examples of the kind of circumstances in which a court might be satisfied that there was no reasonable possibility of reconciliation. It is a fair question.  I must now apologise to Deputy Harney because I think I misunderstood the drift of some of her remarks last night in this regard. She mentioned the situation of a couple separated from one another who had been married for some time and who might have three children.  She said that they might take their holidays every year together with the children and have a reasonable level of communication.  If that couple were seeking a divorce, having gone through the previous procedures, the court in any case has a constitutional obligation to satisfy itself as to whether there is a reasonable possibility of a reconciliation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Harney would agree with me that, where the kinds of conditions she described exists, it would take some care on the part of the court and of the couple applying for a divorce to show that there was not a reasonable possibility of reconciliation. In those circumstances they would make the case that they felt that they should behave in that way, with a reasonable level of communication and some community of activity between them, for the sake of the children and because they did not want to be enemies for the rest of their lives.  However, they would say that it was their clear wish that <Col N="1770" /> they did not want to go any further in a relationship than that and that it was not their intention to do so.  In those circumstances a court could conclude that there was not a reasonable possibility of reconciliation.</P>
    <P>If we take one of the other cases, such as that instanced last night by Deputy Shatter, of a relatively young woman who after some years of marriage was the victim of violence on the part of her husband and who had been through the whole procedure of barring orders and separations only to find that the husband had entered into another union with someone else and was opposing a divorce.  In that case a court could probably quite easily be satisfied that there was no reasonable possibility of a reconciliation.  I still take the view that the word &ldquo;possibility&rdquo; is a stronger word than &ldquo;likelihood&rdquo;.  I dispute Deputy O'Malley's contention that it is difficult to understand the meaning of the word &ldquo;possibility&rdquo; because, in commenting on its possible interpretations, Deputy O'Malley said that the use of this word gives rise to all sorts of possibilities.  He did not say &ldquo;likelihood&rdquo;; he said &ldquo;possibilities&rdquo;. I do not think there is any great difficulty in comprehending the meaning of the word &ldquo;possibilities&rdquo; which also has the connotation of something that can actually happen, that will work, that is possible.  The court must look at the circumstances of the couple before it and satisfy itself on a view as to whether it is possible for these two people to effect a reconciliation.  One could think of circumstances in which a reconciliation might come about, but if there is no possibility that those circumstances would come about then there is no reasonable possibility of reconciliation taking place. While being a strong word, nevertheless it can be comprehended and effect can be given to it by the court.</P>
    <P>I wholeheartedly agree with one sentiment of which Deputy Haughey delivered himself just before he left, and I hope his colleagues in the House will take it to heart as their text for the day.  He said &mdash; I think I am quoting his exact words &mdash;&ldquo;We should not be foolish <Col N="1771" /> enough to assert with any degree of certainty how it would work out&rdquo;.  If we take that view, we will have a much more reasonable debate than some of the passages we have had over the last few days.</P>

      <P>The Minister said that he occupies the middle ground between more rigorous views on the one hand and weaker views on the other.  We know that the words the Minister is suggesting can be seen in operation.  There is no mystery about them, although we do not have them functioning in the Irish courts.  The British Matrimonial Causes Act, 1973, section 6 (2), states that if at any stage of the proceedings for divorce it appears to the court that there is a reasonable possibility of a reconciliation between the parties the court may adjourn and do what it thinks fit.</P>

      <P>The term being used is not extraordinary or unusual.  The Minister may want to connect them to other terms and I accept that they are connected with other terms such as that the court must be satisfied.  However, I am sure the courts in Britain have to be satisfied. There is not a Constitution in Britain but we are proposing to put divorce into our Constitution and in doing that we will be one of the few countries in the world that will have constitutional divorce.  We are putting a positive provision for divorce into the Constitution.  It is not simply a question of saying &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo; to divorce here or of removing the ban from the Constitution.  We are talking about amending the Constitution to give every citizen the constitutional right to divorce <Col N="1772" /> and the people need to understand that. It is in that context that the words are being fitted in.  Those words are the same as those used by the courts in Britain and I do not think there is any great mystery about them.  I do not think we should try to attribute to the words, &ldquo;a reasonable possibility of reconciliation&rdquo;, something that does not apply to them.  Those who want to see how they work should go to Britain where they are applied in the courts there.  The word &ldquo;likelihood&rdquo; will give less protection to the existing family and, therefore, puts an onus on the spouse who is defending to show the probability and likelihood rather than the possibility of reconciliation.  For that reason I do not think it is a better word.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. D. Andrews Mr. D. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Following what my colleague, Deputy Woods, has said, I have argued, in relation to the existence or non-existence of a constitutional provision here and elsewhere, that the 1937 Constitution should not have had a ban on divorce.  That ban since then has caused a number of problems which are self-evident.  I have been arguing for the referendum, hopefully from the basis of compassion.  There is no compulsion on Catholics to divorce.  I am a practising Catholic, and I do not make any apology for that, but I do not see myself in the role of a Catholic legislator for Catholic people.  That is where I part company with a number of speakers on this proposal. I believe in giving my co-religionists whose marriage has broken down a second chance if they seek it.  How dare I suggest that such people should not have a second chance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want divorce for myself; I am one of the lucky ones.  But I am not going to deprive other people, after the referendum, of their constitutional entitlement. It is my argument that the provision should not have been in the Constitution in the first instance.  At present we are discussing sanely and, hopefully, dispassionately the meaning of words.  It is my view that most words have the meaning we give to them or the meaning we want from them.  Deputy Haughey is correct in saying that we will <Col N="1773" /> have to be careful about this aspect of the debate.  In order to give some idea about the confusion and various meanings of the words I should like to refer to the <i>Concise Oxford Dictionary</i> published in 1929 &mdash; the Oireachtas should bring itself around to getting an up-to-date edition of that dictionary; I say that by way of suggestion and not by way of criticism. The definition of the word &ldquo;likelihood&rdquo; in the Oxford Dictionary is, &ldquo;being likely, probability in truth itself&rdquo;.  The meaning of the word &ldquo;possibility&rdquo; is, &ldquo;state, fact of being possible&rdquo;.  The meaning of the word &ldquo;probability&rdquo; is, &ldquo;quality of being probable, in all probability, most likely, there is no probability (likelihood) of his coming.</P>
    <P>I am all in favour of debates of this nature, but on occasions they take a circular and repetitious form.  One argument becomes the same as the last.  We are sorry about that, but that is one of the weaknesses of democracy.  To return to my original tune, as played last evening, I must say that in the final analysis we are engaging in a piece of semantics because if one addresses oneself to the meaning of the words in Chambers Dictionary, as I did yesterday, and today revert to the meaning in the Oxford Dictionary, one will see that they have apparent different meanings and different emphasis.  We can give the meaning to words that we want.</P>
    <P>The Minister, or a Member on his side of the House, raised the question of bringing a case before a judge arising from the legislation that will be based on the constitutional amendment.  A lawyer for the plaintiff or the respondent will seek to give the meaning he or she wants to the benefit of his or her client.</P>
    <P>On the other side, the case on behalf of the other party, that lawyer will seek to give the meaning he wants, to convince the judge in the interests of his client's case.  That is what it is all about.  Taking account of what is said during the course of this debate, the judicial function will be to interpret the meaning of the words in the legislation so constructed out of this amendment, assuming that it is passed by the people, I cannot stress often enough <Col N="1774" /> that I hope this referendum is passed by the people and I do so out of a genuine conviction of charity and compassion. How dare we, as legislators, set down moral guidelines for those who may be of different religions from us?  We cannot do that.  We are living in a Republic.  I take the reference to the Republic from the credo of an Irish Republican.  I believe in Irish republicanism as enunciated by Wolfe Tone; I believe in liberty, equality, and fraternity within the Irish nation; I believe that our citizens are entitled to religious and political freedom. The credo then goes on to deal with other matters in relation to the Six Counties.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say a few brief words in reply to points made by Deputy Woods.  I must first apologise for being a little bit disorderly a few minutes ago. Deputy Woods raised last evening the question of the meaning, in divorce proceedings in other jurisdictions, of the concept of a reasonable possibility.  In fact, if the Deputy would think a little more about it, he is not talking about the meaning of words at all, nor can he draw any conclusion about the meaning of the words.  What he is drawing to the attention of the House is not the meaning of the words but the structures, the procedures which are used in courts of other jurisdictions.  As I pointed out last night and again today, although Deputy Woods does not take account of any of this, the particular piece of British legislation to which he has referred provides, as I said before, that rules of court may be made requiring the solicitor to certify to the <Col N="1775" /> court whether he has discussed the possibility of a reconciliation with his client. It also provides that if, at any stage in the proceedings it appears to the court that there is a reasonable possibility of reconciliation, the court may adjourn the proceedings to enable attempts to be made.</P>
      <P>That is a provision which is totally different in nature from the one we are proposing here in this constitutional amendment.  We are not saying in that constitutional amendment that we might require a solicitor to certify that he has talked about the possibility of a reconciliation, nor are we saying that the court may adjourn if it believes there is a possibility of reconciliation.  We are not saying anything like that.  What we are saying here is that, before it can grant a decree of divorce, the court must be satisfied that there is no reasonable possibility of a reconciliation.  I want to put it on the record, for the benefit of the House and of the general public, that Deputy Woods is comparing with a constitutional provision something which is not in any way comparable.  He is pretending that what he is comparing is a meaning of the words as used in different jurisdictions when, in fact, the point he is making has nothing whatever to do with the meaning of words.</P>
      <P>If our Constitution did not include a provision banning divorce, it is entirely conceivable that we might be here today discussing, not a constitutional amendment permitting divorce, but legislation covering divorce.  My firm view &mdash; of course, it is hypothetical &mdash; is that if that provision were not in the Constitution we should have been discussing divorce legislation quite some time ago.  My far less hypothetical view is that we should have been having this debate on a constitutional amendment quite some time ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are dealing with a situation where there is now a particular provision in the Constitution.  We are dealing with a situation also where in order to achieve a certain result we are not simply deleting a provision from the Constitution but <Col N="1776" /> replacing it by something else.  I do not know whether Deputy Woods plays table tennis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Good, that explains a lot. Sitting here as I have been for the last few days, I have been admiring the kind of side spin he gets on the ball when he puts it out.  Because we are not simply talking about deleting a provision from the Constitution, Deputy Woods is able to get this little bit of a spin on the ball and say we are providing for constitutional divorce &mdash; another nice litle spectre or monster of some kind.  We are not providing for constitutional divorce.  We are putting a provision into the Constitution that allows legislation to be passed to permit divorce and sets out the parameters within which that can be done.</P>
      <P>The suggestion for the public and for the headlines of constitutional divorce is very much more emotive than what we are doing.  I utterly reject that style of argument.  That is headline politics of the worst type.  Far from informing people, it is the kind of thing of which Deputy Woods accused me last night quite in the wrong, because that was not my intention &mdash; something which confuses and obscures the debate rather than enlightens. I would also make a plea to those who write the headlines that they should not fall for this type of side spin but perhaps they have other things to bat.  I know it is not those who write the articles who write the headlines.  Perhaps they all should get together for a game of table tennis with Deputy Woods at some stage and find out how the bounce is.  It is totally out of keeping both with the quality and substance of this debate to raise this scare of constitutional divorce.  I reject this further ploy with words.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">

      <P>It is another ploy with words which is used by people who want <Col N="1777" /> to give the impression that they are not taking a position when, if the truth were known, they are taking a position but do not want to say what it is.</P>
      <P>To conclude on this point, the provision we are making, coming back to the condition about which we are talking, requires the court to be satisfied, in each case that comes before it, that there is no reasonable possibility of a reconciliation. We provide that because we believe we should guard against the possibility that people would divorce for reasons which have not to do with a fundamental failure of their marriage.  It is, in my view, an essential part of any provision that we would make in relation to divorce.  As I said earlier on, the determination as to whether there is a reasonable possibility of reconciliation is a stricter test than the suggestion that the court should be satisfied that there is no reasonable likelihood. That stricter test is far more in keeping with the wishes, as we know them so far, of people in this connection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to draw the Minister's attention to the fact that we are discussing a Bill which is called the Tenth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1986.  The section we are discussing is to become part of the Constitution if supported by the people.  I fail to see the Minister's point when he disagrees with me that we are making a positive provision in the Constitution which will provide for divorce.  That is what we are doing.  We are talking about legislation which can be altered in the House afterwards. We have to be honest with people. The Minister seems to think that this constitutional amendment is some sort of monster or monstrosity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problem is the nature of the amendment and how it will be used and applied in the future and the extent to which this House or anyone else who is concerned will be able to modify or affect the situation subsequently.  That is why the formula of words is so important.  The House can only subsequently make laws which come within the ambit of what is in the Constitution.  Individuals within <Col N="1778" /> the State can insist that the House provide for them in accordance with the right which they would then have under the amendment which it is proposed to put in the Constitution.  My only point in relation to this amendment is to suggest that the formula of words which is being used &mdash; the amendment is about this formula of words &mdash; is similar to the formula of words which is used in other jurisdictions.</P>
    <P>The Minister wants to point to other aspects in this section which in his view-strengthen the formula of words.  They are in the section and he is entitled to refer to them now while we are talking about the words specifically.  Having said what I had to say about the word &ldquo;possibility&rdquo; in the first instance, the word &ldquo;likelihood&rdquo; would cause more problems. The only point that needs to be made clear is that there is nothing draconian about the wording which the Minister is using.  It is a wording that is used as a general formula of words in divorce legislation.  Any advice I can get on it is that as a formula of words it is not strong in protecting the rights of the first family.  That is fair enough and the Minister may not agree with that.  That is a matter which will be borne out in time if the amendment is passed.  We can come back and look at it in time and see how it worked out.  I cannot say any more than that.</P>
    <P>The Minister cannot criticise me for raising these points in relation to such an important constitutional amendment. We have a duty in this House, and as Opposition spokesman I have a duty, to tease out and raise these points and try to have them discussed as fully as possible.  I will have more to say on the section as a whole but as far as that word is concerned and as far as the suggestion of using the word &ldquo;likelihood&rdquo; is concerned I do not think &ldquo;likelihood&rdquo; will be an improvement. It will be a distinct disimprovement from the point of view of its lack of protection for the existing marriage.</P>

      <P>I am sorry Deputy Andrews has left the House.  In his opening remarks he spoke about the religious <Col N="1779" /> attitude of people in this matter as well as speaking for himself.  I would like to put on the record of the House the quotation Canon O'Callaghan, a leading theologian, gave to the committee examining this question and I quote:</P>
      <P>Those who insist on seeing the issue purely in terms of the State enforcing or not enforcing Catholic moral teaching are missing the point.  The question to be decided as far as State law is concerned is the impact on society which a given law would be likely to have.  Therefore, any suggestion or proposal should be debated strictly on its merits, not whether it is for or against the religion or the conviction of a particular denomination, even a majority.</P>
      <P>Many people are missing the point here today.  The Minister for Justice used the analogy of table tennis.  I would go a bit further and use the larger game because I find Deputy Woods' service faulty to say the least.  He takes out a red book now and then and quotes from English law, which is quite different from the situation we are discussing.  He said the law we will enact and the law Canon O'Callaghan spoke about will have to come within the ambit of constitutional law which this House will now put before the people.  We should try to keep our discussions within those confines.</P>

      <P>The choice of wording, and I would submit the choice of words is very important, is determined to a large degree by our own views and perceptions. Our people should be entitled to have their marriages dissolved and have the right to remarry.  Although there was some agreement yesterday on the context of failure between Deputy Haughey and Deputy Woods and me, I find this morning there is no room for manoeuvre. Some of the Fianna Fáil spokespersons would wish to see phrases such as &ldquo;where there would be no possibility at all&rdquo; or &ldquo;where it would be totally impossible&rdquo; introduced instead of &ldquo;reasonable possibility&rdquo; or &ldquo;reasonable likelihood&rdquo;.  They <Col N="1780" /> would wish to see it made absolutely impossible for people to have their marriages dissolved.  That is where we differ fundamentally.  If that is the case, it is dishonest to be merely playing around with words because if that is what they believe fundamentally they should be seeking to change the provision in a wholly different way.</P>
      <P>I do not accept Deputy Woods' point that this will provide for constitutional divorce and I do not think many others would either.  I take the point made by the Minister that those kind of remarks which inevitably lead to headlines and to all kinds of interpretations being placed on what we are trying to do in this debate are very unhelpful.  Much of what went on last week, and may be going on again this week, is not helpful in the context of the debate.  Deputy Haughey referred to the need to inform the public and I would agree with him, but I do not want to seek to spread misinformation, or to seek to frighten the public, or to seek to introduce a provision which would be so meaningless that there would be no point in going down the road of having a constitutional amendment at all.  I would worry about future divorce legislation if it were to be introduced and were to be successful, as to whether or not it would be declared unconstitutional.</P>
      <P>One of the first things we will have to do following the passage through the Oireachtas of divorce legislation is to refer it to the courts to ensure that it is constitutional and that it will not prove unnecessarily difficult or expensive for couples who may have to take a constitutional case themselves.  The President may well do that, but it would be a worthy task which should be done at an early stage rather than have individual citizens having to go down that road alone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There may well be situations where courts, having heard all the evidence submitted on behalf of both parties to the marriage, may not be in a position to say whether or not it is reasonably possible that the two could be reconciled.  That is where the difficulty could arise.  I am told that in legal terms the word &ldquo;possibility&rdquo; is rarely, if ever, used because of the <Col N="1781" /> difficulties or the contrived situations it can lead to.  I can foresee a situation where people would dream up many fanciful arguments and argue that two people had been apart for ten to 15 years. Because they had not seen each other and because they had not met each other, one could not say there was no reasonable possibility of reconciliation because if they had met, or if they had been residing together, there might be a reasonable possibility of reconciliation.  All kinds of crazy situations could emerge but I am not saying that they will.  We are leaving far too much flexibility to the individual views of particular judges.</P>
    <P>I saw fit last week to refer to the role women are playing throughout this legislation and the manner in which some people sought to frighten them.  When people talk about courts they say &ldquo;he&rdquo; when talking about the judge.  It is a male dominated area but I hope that will not continue in the future.  I hope, in the context of these cases, that we will have much younger judges and also a large number of female judges.  What will be required is that the person will have understanding and compassion and will be caring.  Those qualities will be vital if couples who come before these courts are to have a fair hearing and if the matter is to be handled in a dignified way and not be offensive, too adversarial or too difficult on the parties involved.</P>
    <P>I did not press my amendment last night but I feel so strongly about this wording that I will press this amendment. I see difficulties and the Minister is not being reasonable when he refuses to accept the change.  I do not see the point in introducing a provision that is so stringent that perhaps nobody except the most extreme hardline cases would benefit.  I do not agree with Deputy Haughey.  I do not think that is the view of the vast majority of people who wish to see divorce legislation introduced.  They feel that in reasonable situations where every effort has been made and where couples have tried very hard to reconcile their difficulties, they should allow them the right to have the marriage dissolved and to remarry.  They do not want divorce <Col N="1782" /> just for people who have been beaten up or deserted.  The ordinary public are much more reasonable in their interpretation of what they want to see than some of the views expressed here this morning on their behalf.</P>

      <P>Níl anseo ach iarracht a dhéanamh chun dhá fhocal a thabhairt le chéile.  Ní chreidim go bhfuil an t-aistriú ceart ar an bhfocal &ldquo;comhréiteach&rdquo; ar a n-aistriú chuig an Béarla nó má thosnaíonn tú ar an mBéarla, ní dóigh liom go bhfuil an taistriú ceart ar an bhfocal &ldquo;reconciliation&rdquo; i mBéarla go dtí &ldquo;comhréiteach&rdquo; i nGaeilge.  Glacaim leis gurab é an Ghaeilge and chéad teanga sa Stát agus dá mbeadh aon chás os comhair na cúirte gur chuig an leagan Gaeilge a rachadh siad chun a fháil amach cad é díreach a bhí i gceist ag an Dáil.  Tá mise lánsásta leis an focal &ldquo;reconciliation&rdquo;.  Focal Béarla atá anseo agus tá brí an fhocail sin i gcúrsaí pósta leagtha amach go beacht anois agus tá sé á usáid go minic i gcúrsaí faoi chleamhnas, deacrachtaí atá acu agus mar sin de.  Is é an focal &ldquo;reconciliation&rdquo; a bhíonn á úsáid i gcónaí sna cásanna sin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1783" /> Maidir leis an focal &ldquo;comhréiteach&rdquo; tá mise ag moladh rúin go scriosfar amach an focal &ldquo;comhréiteach&rdquo;.  Má théann tú chuig Dinneen chun brí an fhocail &ldquo;comhréiteach&rdquo; a fháil ní bheidh tú in ann í a aimsiú ar chor ar bith.  Níl an focal &ldquo;comhréiteach&rdquo; ag Dinneen ar chor ar bith.  Níor chuala sé ariamh é.  Anois tá mise ag baint usáid as an leagan den bhliain 1927.  Nuair a scríobh Dinneen an aige anseo ná &ldquo;harmonisation&rdquo;, b'fhéidir &ldquo;comhréiteach&rdquo;.  Caithfimid glacadh leis gur focal nua-aimseartha é ó aimsear Dinneen a tháinig ón bhfocal &ldquo;réiteach&rdquo; agus anois tá daoine ag caint faoi &ldquo;comhréiteach&rdquo;. Níl aon ghá an &ldquo;comh&rdquo; i dtús báire.  Níl an focal &ldquo;comhréiteach&rdquo; ag Dinneen ar chor ar bith.</P>
    <P>Má théann tú chuig an foclóir Béarla le Niall Ó Dónaill, 1977, tá an focal &ldquo;comhréiteach&rdquo; ansin ceart go leor, Bhí sé sin 50 bliain i ndiaidh an fhoclóra eile. Is é an bhrí atá aige leis an focal &ldquo;comhréiteach&rdquo; ná: &ldquo;compromise, settlement, agreement, harmonisation&rdquo;.  Ní féidir linne a rá gur ionann na focail sin agus an focal &ldquo;reconciliation&rdquo;.  Tá sé furasta compromise a dhéanamh gan aon reconciliation a bheith ann agus is furasta settlement de shaghas éigin a dhéanamh idir an bheirt a bheadh i gceist.  Sin a deintear nuair atá siad ag scaradh ón a chéile: deineann siad compromise, settlement, agreement agus, an focal deireannach atá aige anseo ná &ldquo;harmonisation&rdquo;, b'fhéidir go bhfuil sé sin níos cóngairí don bhfocal &ldquo;reconciliation&rdquo; ná na trí fhocail eile ach ní mar an gcéanna é.  Is é sin an bhrí atá aige leis an bhfocal &ldquo;comhréiteach&rdquo;.  Má théann tú chuig an focal &ldquo;réiteach&rdquo;&mdash; tagann an focail ón bhfocal &ldquo;réidh&rdquo;&mdash; even, level, réidh&rdquo;&mdash; deireann sé &ldquo;clearing land from furze, clearing a passage of obstructions, smoothing, settling, unravelling, setting free, salving, relieving, settling with, preparing one, a plain, a level, a solution or explanation or analysis, a reading, a reconciliation, peace, concord, settlement&rdquo;.  He gives many other examples.</P>
    <P>Tagann siad sin ón focal &ldquo;réiteach&rdquo;. Tá na focail &ldquo;settlement&rdquo;, &ldquo;agreement&rdquo;, iontu go léir.  Deireann Ó Dónaill faoin <Col N="1784" /> bhfocal &ldquo;réiteach&rdquo;: &ldquo;clearance&rdquo; of way&rdquo;, &ldquo;smoothing of path&rdquo;, &ldquo;clearance of land&rdquo;, &ldquo;forest clearing&rdquo;, &ldquo;plain and mountain&rdquo;, &ldquo;disentanglement&rdquo;, &ldquo;unravelling of thread&rdquo;, &ldquo;solution&rdquo;, &ldquo;adjustment&rdquo;, &ldquo;agreement&rdquo;, &ldquo;solution of difficulty&rdquo;, &ldquo;answer to question&rdquo;, &ldquo;to settle matters between people&rdquo;&ldquo;réiteach a dhéanamh idir dhaoine&rdquo;.  &ldquo;Teacht chun réitigh le duine, to come to an agreement with somebody&rdquo;.  Ó Dónaill defines &ldquo;chuaigh an chúis ó réiteach orainn&rdquo; as &ldquo;we failed to decide the issue, to come to terms&rdquo;.  &ldquo;Ní théann rogha ón réiteach &mdash; peace is everything&rdquo;; &ldquo;bord réitigh, conciliation board&rdquo;.  Sin é an ceann is feiliúnaí.</P>
    <P>Ansin caithfidh tú dul chuig De Bhaldraithe chun a fháil amach cén bhrí, cad é an Ghaeilge atá ar an bhfocal &ldquo;reconciliation&rdquo;. Tá sé simplí go leor: &ldquo;réiteach, athmhuintearas&rdquo;.  Níl ach an dá fhocal ann.  Ansin, deireann sé &ldquo;réiteach (idir dhá thuairim)&rdquo;&mdash; an agreement between two opinions, a settlement between two opinions.  Má thógann tú an focal &ldquo;reconcile&rdquo;, deireann De Bhaldraithe &ldquo;déanaim réiteach, síocháin athmhuintearas idir (bheirt)&rdquo;; &ldquo;to become reconciled&rdquo;: &ldquo;mórtachas a dhéanamh le chéile arís&rdquo;; &ldquo;to reconcile somebody to something&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;duine a thabhairt chun sástachta i dtaobh ruda&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Ansin, tá againn: &ldquo;to reconcile oneself to something&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;do thoil a chur le rud&rdquo;; &ldquo;déanaim réiteach idir (dhá thuairim)&rdquo;; &ldquo;tugaim (dhá thuairim) le chéile&rdquo;.  Mar sin, tagann an focal &ldquo;athmhuintearas&rdquo; isteach, agus má théann tú ar ais go dtí Dinneen agus Ó Dónaill sílim go bhfuil an cheist réitithe.  I Dinneen is é an bhrí ata le &ldquo;athmhuintearas&rdquo; ná &mdash; focal amháin &mdash;&ldquo;reconciliation&rdquo;.  Níl aon rud eile le rá aige faoin gceist.  Má théann tú chuig Ó Dónaill, tá an scéal díreach mar an gcéanna &mdash;&ldquo;athmhuintearas,&rdquo;&ldquo;reconciliation&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Mar sin, deirim, siad na focail ba chóir bheith sa leagan Gaeilge anseo, in ionad &ldquo;nach féidir le réasún bheith ag súil le comhréiteach idir na páirtithe sa phósadh,&rdquo; ná &ldquo;nach féidir le réasún bheith ag súil le athmhuintearas idir na páirtithe sa phósadh&rdquo;.  Caithfidh an bheirt sa phósadh <Col N="1785" /> dul os comhair cúirte agus caithfidh siad a thaispeáint nach féidir le réasún bheith ag súil le athmhuintearas, bheith ag súil le settlement, compromise, agreement. Tá súil ag chuile dhuine go mbeadh settlement sul a scaraidís, agreement faoi airgead, an teach, faoi na páistí, agus chuile rud mar sin.  Tá go leor réiteach, go leor compromise, déanta idir an bheirt, ach níl aon athmhuintearas.  Tá sé an-tábachtach go gcuirfear an focal ceart isteach anseo.  Sílimse go mbeadh sé an-deacair do dhaoine fianaise a chur os comhair na cúirte chun a thaispeáint gur féidir le réasún bheith ag súil le comhréiteach a dhéanamh idir na páirtithe sa phósaidh. San dá fhoclóir seo deireann siad &ldquo;réiteach idir dhá thuairim&rdquo;.  An mbeidh na páirtithe in ann comhréiteach a dhéanamh faoí chuile rud?</P>
    <P>Má tá sé i gceist againn an bhrí chéanna a bheith againn leis an leagan Gaeilge agus an leagan Béarla, &ldquo;that there is no reasonable possibility of reconciliation between the parties to the marriage,&rdquo; caithfimid an focal san leasú, &ldquo;athmhuintearas&rdquo; a chur isteach.  Má táimid chun aistriú beacht a dhéanamh ar an leagan Béarla atá againn sa Bhille, caithfimid an focal &ldquo;athmhuintearas&rdquo; a chur sa Bhille.</P>
    <P>We should have in the Bill &ldquo;there is no reasonable possibility of compromise&rdquo;, or &ldquo;there is no reasonable possibility of settlement&rdquo; between the two parties to the marriage, or &ldquo;there is no reasonable possibility of agreement&rdquo; between the parties.  Of course there will be all sorts of reasons for settlements, the children, agreement about the house, the money and so on &mdash; all sorts of agreements and compromises will be made.  Therefore, one should not want to prove in a court that there is no reasonable possibility of agreement or compromise.  I agree with the English version of what must be proved is that there is no reasonable possibility of reconciliation between the two persons.  Más é sin atá i gceist againn sa leagan Ghaeilge, ba chóir dúinn an focal &ldquo;chomhréiteach&rdquo; a scriosadh agus &ldquo;athmhuintearas&rdquo; a chur ina ionad.</P>

      <P>I dtosach, táim buíoch <Col N="1786" /> den Teachta Mac Giolla faoin leasú seo a chur os ár gcomhair.  Tá sé tábhachtach an leagan ceart Gaeilge a chur os comhair na ndaoine.  I ndeireadh na dála, is é an leagan Gaeilge an príomh leagan agus má bhíonn aon difríocht idir an leagan Gaeilge agus an leagan Béarla is é an leagan Gaeilge an ceann is tábhachtaí. Ach ceapaim féin gur &ldquo;comhréiteach&rdquo; an focal ceart anseo agus rinne mé beagáinín staidéir ar an gceist.  Míníonn &ldquo;muintear&rdquo;&mdash; agus mar adeir an Teachta Mac Giolla, is daoine atá i gceist anseo &mdash; daoine atá gaol acu le chéile, sa chéad áit; &ldquo;mo mhuintir féin&rdquo;&mdash; daoine a bhfuil gaol agam leo agus, an dara míniú, daoine atá cairdiúil lena chéile, daoine a bhfuil athmhuintearas eatarthu, is é sin, daoine atá cairdiúil lena a chéile.  Ach is féidir athmhuintearas a bheith idir daoine i gcomhthéacs an Bhille seo gan comhreiteach nó teacht le chéile a bheith ann.  Is é an rud atá i gceist anseo ná teacht le chéile arís, rud a chur ar bun arís. D'fhéadfadh beirt duine a bheith muinteartha lena chéile ach a bheith scartha óna chéile.  Sin é an príomh rud atá i gceist anseo.  Má bhíonn daoine scartha ón a chéile is féidir leo bheith cairdiúil lena chéile.  Uaireanta bíonn daoine i bhfad níos cairdiúla lena chéile nuair a bhíonn siad scartha ón a chéile.  Mar a deirtear as Béarla go minic, &ldquo;My wife and I are divorced but, of course, we are perfectly good friends&rdquo;.  Sin é an rud atá i gceist nuair a bhítear ag caint mar gheall ar mhuintearas nó athmhuintearas &mdash; cairdiúlacht &mdash; ach an rud atá á chloisteáil ón mBille agus ó théacs an Bhille ná &ldquo;comhréiteach&rdquo;, an pósadh a chur le chéile arís.  Tá mé cinnte san comhthéacs sin gur &ldquo;comhréiteach&rdquo; an focal ceart.  Is féidir le daoine a bheith an-mhuinteartha lena chéile nó go mbeadh athmhuintearas eatarthu ach nach mbeadh siad toilteanach teacht le chéile agus an pósadh a chur ag obair arís.  I gcás easaontas a bheith ann nuair a scarann lánúin phósta, is é sin, gan mhuintearas a bheith ann, is féidir ina dhiaidh sin athmhuintearas a bheith ann, is é sin, bheith cáirdiúil arís, gan aon chomhréiteach a bheith ann.  Ní húsáidfidh mé mar shampla, mé féin agus fear eile &mdash; beirt duine &mdash; fear agus bean, <Col N="1787" /> atá i gceist anseo.  Is féidir le beirt a bheith an-chairdiúil lena chéile agus a bheith scartha.  Ceapaim gur comhréiteach atá ag teastáil ón téacs seo mar, d'ainneoin a deireann na foclóirí sin go léir, is léir gur &ldquo;comhréiteach&rdquo; atá i gceist, teacht le chéile arís, an pósadh a chur le chéile arís.  Sin iad na deacrachtaí atá ann agus chun aon difríocht atá ann idir na daoine a réiteach agus go mbeadh comhréiteach de na deachrachtaí.  Ceapaim nach bhfuil aon dabht ach gurb é &ldquo;comhréiteach&rdquo; an focal ceart anseo, go mór, mhór, mar a deirim, gur féidir, agus tarlaíonn sé go minic, le beirt duine a bheith muinteartha lena chéile ach nach mbeadh aon seans ann go dtiocfadh siad le chéile arís chun an pósadh a chur ar bun arís.</P>

      <P>Caithfidh mé a rá go raibh mé oscailte maidir leis an leasú seo mar mothaím go bhfuil tábhacht áirithe ag baint le &ldquo;muintearas&rdquo; nó le &ldquo;athmhuintearas&rdquo; ach chuaigh mé i gcomhairle leis an Rannóg Aistriúcháin anseo agus le Oifig an Ard-Aighne chun an dá théarma a luacháil agus is é an chomhairle atá faighte agam ná gur chóir an focal &ldquo;comhréiteach&rdquo; a úsáid ar chúpla cúis.  Ó thús báire, tá tábhacht ag baint leis an gceist seo sa chás go samhlaíonn sé go bhfuil difríocht idir an téacs Gaeilge agus an téacs Béarla agus is sa chás sin amháin go n-éiríonn an deacracht.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Bhí mé ag smaoineamh agus mé ag éisteacht leis an Teachta Mac Giolla go bhfuil gá eile ann, is é sin, go mbainfimís amach comhréiteach áirithe sa bhrí &ldquo;compromise&rdquo;, &ldquo;settlement&rdquo;, &ldquo;agreement&rdquo; nó &ldquo;harmonisation&rdquo; idir na foclóirí agus dá mbeadh comhréiteach againn idir Dinneen agus de Bhaldraithe agus Ó Dónaill go mbeadh sé i bhfad níos fusa ár gcuid oibre a dhéanamh.  Ach nuair atá mé ag teacht chuig an pointe sin anois, ag breathnú ar eagrán 1979 de Dinneen, feicfidh tú ansin &ldquo;comhréiteach&rdquo; leis an bhrí &ldquo;reconciliation&rdquo;.  Más rud é gur féidir linn an bhrí sin a chur ar &ldquo;comhréiteach&rdquo; agus gur ionann an smaoineamh sa dá leagan ar bhrí amháin den fhocal, réitíonn sé sin an deacracht. Cé go raibh mé píosa oscailte ar an leasú <Col N="1788" /> seo i dtosach, is ar an gcúis sin a deirim gurb é &ldquo;comhréiteach&rdquo; an focal is cuí agus an focal is cóir a úsáid sa chás seo.</P>

      <P>Is féidir argóint a bheith againn faoin cheist seo ar feadh an lae agus táim cinnte go mbeidh an argóint seo ag na breithimh má thagann an cheist seo os comhair na cúirte.  Tá súil agam go dtiocfaimid chuig an breithiúnas ceart faoi na focail seo mar is daoine atá i dtrioblóid a bhéas ag dul os comhair na cúirte.</P>
      <P>Ní aontaím ar chor ar bith leis an Teachta Haughey nuair a deireann sé gur ionann &ldquo;athmhuintearas&rdquo; agus &ldquo;muintearas&rdquo; agus gur ionann &ldquo;muintearas&rdquo; agus &ldquo;cairdiúlacht.&rdquo;  Ní hionann.  Níl ach an t-aistriú amháin ag an dá fhoclóir don fhocal &ldquo;athmhuintearas&rdquo;.  Tá an t-aistriú amháin ag an bheirt acu agus is é sin &ldquo;reconciliation&rdquo; ach maidir leis an focal &ldquo;muintearas&rdquo; tá difríocht mhór idir é sin agus &ldquo;cairdiúlacht&rdquo;.  Deireann Niall Ó Dónaill maidir le &ldquo;muintearas&rdquo;: &ldquo;Membership of household or community, association, fellowship, familiarity&rdquo;.  Nuair a bhíonn daoine muinteartha le chéile, deireann an foclóir seo, &ldquo;related to&rdquo; agus is dócha gur eol dúinn go léir daoine faoin dtuaith a deireann &ldquo;We are friendly with them&rdquo;, agus is é an bhrí atá leis sin ná, &ldquo;We are related to them&rdquo;&ldquo;friendly with them&rdquo;, &ldquo;related to them&rdquo;.  Tagann sé ón fhocal &ldquo;muinteartha&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Táimid muinteartha le chéile&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ach tá i bhfad níos mó le &ldquo;muintearas&rdquo; ná mar atá le daoine a bheith cairdiúil nó in a gcairde.  Usáideann Dinneen an focal &ldquo;cohabitation&rdquo; faoi &ldquo;muintearas&rdquo;.  Ní fhéadfadh le héinne a rá gur ionann &ldquo;cairde&rdquo; agus &ldquo;cohabitation&rdquo;.  Muintearas: alliance, relationship, cohabitation; úsáideann sé an focal &ldquo;cohabitation&rdquo; i gcomhair &ldquo;muintearas&rdquo;.  Athmhuintearas, dá bhrí sin, teacht le chéile, &ldquo;reconciliation&rdquo;&ldquo;reconcile&rdquo;.  Tá siad beirt, caoga bliain óna chéile, ar aon aigne faoi sin, faoi athmhuintearas mar an fhocal ar &ldquo;reconciliation&rdquo;.  Muna bhfuil sibh sásta leis an focal &ldquo;reconciliation&rdquo; tá sé sin ceart go leor ach caithfidh sibh ansin, má tá sibh ag rá gurb é an focal &ldquo;comhréiteach&rdquo; an focal ceart, dul chuig an leagan <Col N="1789" /> Béarla agus aistriú a dhéanamh air sin chun iad a thabhairt le chéile.  &ldquo;Let there be no reasonable possibility of settlement, compromise, harmonisation&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Is dócha nach n-aontódh an tAire leis sin ar chor ar bith.  Tá sé cinnte gurb é an focal &ldquo;reconciliation&rdquo; an focal ceart agus nach mbeadh compromise ceart, nó settlement ceart, nó agreement nó harmonisation &mdash; ní bheadh sé sásta le haon cheann díbh.  Ní féidir liom a fháil amach ansin cén sórt argóna nó cén sórt réasúin a bhí ag na haistreoirí adúirt leis gurb é an focal &ldquo;comhréiteach&rdquo; an focal ceart sa cheist seo nuair atáimid ag caint faoi bheirt nach n-aontaíonn lena chéile, atá, b'fhéidir, scartha óna chéile nó nach féidir leo labhairt nó caint lena chéile.</P>
    <P>Táimid ag caint faoin muintearas a thabhairt arais eatarthu.  Nílimid ag caint faoi &ldquo;settlement&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I get the breakfast, you get the dinner &mdash; you sit down there, I sleep up here&rdquo;&mdash; settlement, agreement, compromise.  Is féidir linn settlement, agreement, compromise a fháil gan aon reconciliation agus tá sin á dhéanamh cheana féin.  Tá a fhios againn go léir faoi theaghlaigh ina bhfuil an fear agus an bhean agus iad gan a bheith fiú ag labhairt le chéile agus is dócha go bhfuil agreement, compromise nó settlement leagtha amach acu sin.  Ní itheann siad le chéile agus ní chodlaíonn siad le chéile agus tá sé sinn leagtha síos, b'fhéidir, i settlement, agreement, compromise.  Ach níil an reconciliation ann, níl an athmhuintearas ann, níl siad ag teacht le chéile ar chor ar bith.  Níl an &ldquo;cohabitation&rdquo; ann.</P>
    <P>Sílim féin go bhfuil níos mó ná &ldquo;semantics&rdquo; sa cheist seo agus is dócha go dtuigeann an tAire agus an Teachta Haughey go bhfuil ceist tábhachtach á plé anseo. Agus sílim féin nach bhfuil aon argóint gur féidir a chur faoin bhfocal &ldquo;comhréiteach&rdquo; chun a thaispéaint do bhreitheamh go bhfuil an bhrí céanna le &ldquo;comhréiteach&rdquo; agus atá le &ldquo;reconciliation&rdquo;.  Ní dóigh liom gur féidir le héinne é sin a dhéanamh &mdash; a thaispéaint go bhfuil an bhrí céanna ag comhréiteach agus atá ag &ldquo;reconciliation&rdquo;.  Tá go maith, déanfaidh sé an gnó &mdash; déanfaidh aon rud gnó sa Ghaeilge na laetheanta seo; níl ann ach an leagan Gaeilge agus níl mórán suime <Col N="1790" /> ag éinne sa mhéid sin.  Is é an rud is tábhachtaí ná &ldquo;there be no reasonable possibility of reconciliation&rdquo; agus sin an rud a bheidh na daoine ag caint faoi nuair atá siad ag vótáil.  Beidh an argóint agus an pholaitíocht agus chuile rud ar theilifís, raidió agus os comhair na séipéal, an chaint go léir faoi go gcaithfear a thaispéaint &ldquo;that there was no reasonable possibility of reconciliation&rdquo;.  Agus ní bheidh éinne ag caint, fiú sna Gaeltachtaí, faoin leagan Gaeilge atá air sin.  Dá mbeidís, b'fhéidir go mbeadh ceist eile faoin bhfocal &ldquo;comhréiteach&rdquo; agus &ldquo;réiteach&rdquo; agus cad é an bhrí atá ag daoine thíos ansin sna Gaeltachtaí leis na focail sin.</P>
    <P>Is dócha go bhfaighidh an Teachta Haughey é sin amach nuair a théann sé síos ag an deireadh seachtaine.  Cén bhrí atá acu siúd, síos i nDaingean Uí Chúise, nó amuigh in Arainn nó aon áit eile le &ldquo;réiteach&rdquo; nó &ldquo;comhréiteach&rdquo; nó le &ldquo;muintearas&rdquo; nó &ldquo;athmhuintearas&rdquo;. Agus tá an-chiall le &ldquo;muintearas&rdquo; agus le &ldquo;athmhuintearas&rdquo; sa Ghaeilge.  Tá sé deacair aistriúchán díreach a dhéanamh ar &ldquo;muintearas&rdquo; agus &ldquo;athmhuintearas&rdquo; mar baineann sé le clann agus le, mar adéirtear i mBéarla, &ldquo;the expanded no extended family&rdquo;.  Sin atá an muintearas ag caint faoi.  Tá daoine muinteartha le chéile &mdash; far-out cousins de shaghas éigín &mdash; ach athmhuintearas, sin teacht le chéile, &ldquo;reconciliation&rdquo;.  An t-aon aistriúchán atá air ná &ldquo;reconciliation&rdquo; agus iarraim ar an Aire féachaint ar an bhfocal arís mar táim deimhin de nach bhfuil an bhrí céanna leis an dá fhocal ansin, &ldquo;comhréiteach&rdquo; agus &ldquo;reconciliation&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom a rá arís go bhfuil mé sásta leis an bhfocal &ldquo;comhréiteach&rdquo; mar ceapaim, ainneoin a deireann an Teachta Mac Giolla, go bhfuil na focail &ldquo;muintir&rdquo;, &ldquo;muintearas&rdquo;, &ldquo;athmhuintearas&rdquo; ag baint le daoine don treibh céanna agus an dara míniú ná cairdiúlacht, agus ní dóigh liom go bhfuil sé oiriúnach don chás seo. Ach níl aon deacracht agam leis an bhfocal &ldquo;comhréiteach&rdquo;.

Dúirt an Teachta Mac Giolla go bhfuil ciall speisialta ag &ldquo;muintearas&rdquo;.  Tá sin fíor ach ciall eile atá ann agus ceapaim go bhfuil sé i bhfad níos mó dírithe ar an gcairdiúlacht ná mar atá sé dírithe ar theacht le chéile agus rud a chur ag obair arís, agus ceapaim san chomhthéacs sin gur &ldquo;comhréiteach&rdquo; an focal ceart.</P>

      <P>The purpose of the section is to allow for the dissolution of marriage and re-marriage.  It will, of course, place a positive provision in the Constitution to allow for divorce.  It will have a profound effect on the position of the family in Irish society.  It is a question that must and can only be answered by the people. We in Fianna Fáil want to see the issues <Col N="1792" /> fully assessed so that the people can make an informed judgment on this proposal.</P>
      <P>As we have stated very clearly, we will not campaign on a party political basis on this matter.  We are concerned that the family, the fundamental unit of our society, should be fully protected.  While there is in this House general consensus that the people should be consulted about the proposed introduction of divorce by way of amendment to the Constitution, neither individual Deputies nor the political parties are relieved of their duty to debate the Bill and refer to both the merits and the demerits of the proposed alteration in the Constitution.  Some media critics and their editors felt that I placed too much emphasis on the position of the spouse and children of the first family in my contribution.  But I would point out that the amendment clearly meets all the needs of the second family. I have listened repeatedly to arguments made by people who seek to have a divorce jurisdiction.  One of the principal reasons that comes through again and again is that they want to have a legal recognition of their new situation.  I spelt that out on Second Stage.  I put down the pros and cons, the arguments made by those in favour of divorce and the arguments made by those who are against it. As I see it, this amendment which is proposed clearly meets all the needs of the second family and it gives not only legal recognition and a legal status to a re-marriage but will also give a constitutional status in addition to a legal status.</P>
      <P>Having put the points of view of those who want to have divorce and those who are against divorce, one finds that the questions that arise in relation to this amendment are questions relating particularly to the first family and its position if this amendment is made to the Constitution. They become critical questions at that stage because the question then is what degree of protection is left to the first family, what is their position constitutionally once we move into the new situation.  A very forthright and clear debate on this matter is essential if the people are to understand fully the issues and the implications of the proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1793" /> The basic controversy here on this issue stems from the commitment of the State and its institutions to protect the family and to guard with special care the institution of marriage and protect it against attack, and the desire to make provision for the real human needs of that minority of people whose marriages have broken down and who wish to re-marry.  That is the question that is before us.  We must find a balance between these two things. We hear the Taoiseach saying every so often that in this amendment he has got the balance right.  I presume that is the balance he is talking about, the balance between these two elements.</P>
    <P>Divorce and the extent of its availability has indeed been a contentious issue in virtually every society where measures such as this have to be dealt with.  It is not unusual, therefore, that it should be contentious here in our society.  The reason is that there is an inherent conflict between guaranteeing the protection and stability of the family as the natural, primary and fundamental unit group of society, and making legal provision for the dissolution of that marriage with the right to re-marry when one or both of the partners feel it must be brought to an end.  So there is a conflict in this situation, no matter how one approaches this question. Ranged on one side of this conflict are those who say that in principle divorce must never under any circumstances be introduced and, on the other side, those who say that divorce is a civil right which must be available under any circumstances. Those different arguments have been put here in the House.  From the point of view of the State, I believe both these approaches are inadequate.</P>
    <P>As I said on Second Stage, the first question people have to decide is whether the nature and extent of the problem of marital breakdown in our society is of a sufficient degree and magnitude to justify the introduction of divorce with its inevitable ill effects on the status and stability of the institution of marriage.  There are Deputies who argued that it will have no effect on the stability and status of marriage in our society, but I cannot <Col N="1794" /> understand that argument and it has not been proved in contributions made so far. This is a reality and should be taken into account when weighing the balance of this question.</P>
    <P>As I also said on Second Stage, it is a question of judgment for each individual voter as to whether the benefits accruing from the alleviation and remedying of the human needs of those who wish to remarry are or are not outweighed by the destabilising effects which flow from the change in the status of marriage from being a permanent and lifelong bond to one which can be terminated if one of the parties is determined to set it aside.  Some people have said that this will not be the case, that it will not affect the permanence of marriage, and that is a subject which will be debated more fully.</P>
    <P>In short, it is a question of the people judging where the interests of the common good of society lie.  I was glad to notice the Taoiseach agreed with this approach when he said the voters in this referendum should direct their primary attention to the question: where lies the social or common good in this matter? Although he accepts that with divorce one must allow for the possibility that some marriages will fail which otherwise would not have done so, his assessment is that the number of such marriages will be few and far between.  He dismisses them as being of little account in weighing the balance as to where the interests of the common good of society lie.  That is a point of judgment from the point of view of politicians and ultimately from the point of view of the people who will have to give their considered view.</P>
    <P>It is at this point in his assessment that I part company with the Taoiseach, because I believe it is an assessment which is wrong and misleading.  It is simplistic and fails to answer many questions which the reality of divorce will pose for society if it is introduced.  It is not the kind of informed debate which will help the people to appreciate all the issues involved.  For example, the Taoiseach and others have approached the issue as if society attitudes towards and understanding <Col N="1795" /> of the institution of marriage will not change if divorce is introduced. The fact is our human perceptions and response to the institution of marriage have been conditioned by its permanence and indissolubility in civil law.  I am talking about its indissolubility in civil law; I have not at any stage mentioned the Churches or their views, although they were taken into consideration by the Oireachtas Joint Committee.  I believe this is a matter of deciding on a major social issue and how it should be approached.</P>
    <P>With the introduction of divorce it is inevitable that the status and social function in society of the institution of marriage as an indissoluble, permanent and lifelong contract or bond will change considerably and with it the attitudes and commitment of a significant proportion of our society.  Notwithstanding that, I believe it is for the Dáil to outline the social issues and the elements involved and it is for the people to decide on the moral issue involved in this referendum.</P>
    <P>I am in favour of the issue being put before the people so that they can give their decision.  If a sufficient body of the population vote in favour of the referendum, then the legislation should be introduced; but it is still very important that the issues be teased out and discussed fully here because then we can give the people the facts.  Those who will campaign for or against divorce will have a lengthy period to put their views when this debate is concluded.  We debated this subject for three days last week but some Deputies said they did no get an opportunity to contribute because there was not enough time since the Government had already set a date for the referendum and that put a constraint on the debate.</P>
    <P>Having listened to the Minister's Second Stage reply, I am not reassured on a number of points.  We debated last night and again to some extent this morning the use of the word &ldquo;failed&rdquo; and the way it is being used in this amendment. The Minister considers that not only is it fairly restrictive, but it is supported and <Col N="1796" /> strengthened by a number of other elements in the section.  My understanding of the wording is that it still sets a low threshold for deciding on a divorce.  I believe it is a subjective term and will make it difficult for the courts to reach a decision.  I listened carefully to what the Minister had to say about this, but I still feel that &ldquo;failed&rdquo; is a subjective word.</P>
    <P>The Minister does not like me to talk about unilateral divorce.  He agrees that there can be a unilateral divorce but, as Deputy Shatter said, that is the case when any marriage breaks down.  Last night Deputy Shatter mentioned the hardest cases he knew, but what are the simplest cases where people can just walk away from a marriage?</P>

      <P>I am trying to understand the possible implications of the words and how they will be interpreted subsequently. I listened to what the Minister said in relation to this section and its <Col N="1797" /> impact and I find that it will allow for divorce once a couple have been married for five years.  That is the bottom line as it stands in the amendment before us now.  I recognise that the Minister said he intends or some of his successors intend to bring in legislation which will consolidate that and will provide for periods of separation or whatever else, but it is quite clear that the words which are to be included in the Constitution will provide that after five years of failure, if there is no other provision, if no condition is added to that, or if the condition which is added is reduced in future or whatever, the basic bottom line is five years in which a marriage&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, in which a marriage is deemed to have failed for five years. We spent a great deal of time talking about what it will constitute.  We have agreed that &ldquo;failure&rdquo; is a word which is not particularly final or definitive.  The provisions in the section are particularly inadequate in providing financial support and security for a divorced spouse and the children of the first marriage.  There is no provision in the Constitution for any further allocations or arrangements for the first family as a right, so nothing is being put specifically into the Constitution as a right to cater for the first family after the divorce.  The Minister and others here say, and will say again: &ldquo;Well, what do you expect in divorce?&rdquo; Under our Constitution as it stands the family have clear and unequivocal constitutional support.  Once this amendment is approved and goes into the Constitution, then what clearcut, positive constitutional provision will be there for the first family as a family?</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to put the Minister back into his little box and let us speak reasonably as we wish to do.  The Minister will have his opportunity to reply.  He seems to think there is something formal, definite and secure in this amendment which will provide financial support and security for the divorced spouse and the family who may be residing with that spouse.  I do not think it is here.  This is a crucial element in this provision and there will be no opportunity subsequently, as far as I can see, for the family in that instance to appeal to the Constitution for their right as a family.  Certainly they will have personal rights under the Constitution.  They were a family previously and lawyers can argue that they were founded as a family once and that there was a foundation there sometime. Why not be clear and explicit?  Then such a family could rely on the Constitution for protection subsequently as a family. We must address ourselves to that question in the course of this Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A point I raised to which I have got no <Col N="1799" /> answer so far is that this amendment gives no constitutional protection whatever to a spouse who is considered not to be a dependent spouse on seeking a divorce. What is a dependent spouse and what, therefore, is a non-dependent spouse?  I would like the Minister to explain.  For instance, if the husband is a farmer and the wife a teacher, is the wife then regarded as a non-dependent spouse and is she therefore to have no constitutional protection under this measure?  A non-dependent spouse is omitted.  It is the other side of the coin.  The spouse mentioned is the dependent spouse only.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister when speaking on this section to explain what the dependent spouse is and how he would define a dependent spouse now and in his calculations in relation to the future.  Is a wife considered to be a non-dependent spouse because she is capable of working although she may not even be working at the time?  I will be interested to hear the Minister on that aspect.  Because the amendment which the Minister is proposing is so silent in relation to a non-dependent spouse I am very concerned about the situation in relation to that non-dependent spouse.</P>
    <P>If we are to take the non-dependent spouses as wives who are working, the figure is approximately 100,000 working women who, presumably, according to the definition provided by the Minister here of a non-dependent spouse, would be excluded by this section.  The dependent spouse is considered, of course, but it seems as if 100,000 working women are excluded from this section.  Certainly they are not explicitly and clearly included and they are left out by virtue of the fact that only dependent spouses are specified.  There are two questions there.  First, what is a dependent spouse? What sort of spouse would be considered to be dependent?  How has the Minister defined that in arriving at his decision to exclude the non-dependent spouse?</P>
    <P>Second, how would the non-dependent spouse be defined subsequently?  Could the fact that the spouse was capable of working be taken as a criterion in judging <Col N="1800" /> whether a spouse should be regarded as dependent or non-dependent?  That is a very important aspect of the proposed amendment, but there has been deafening silence in the media regarding non-dependent spouses and how the amendment affects them.</P>
    <P>I also said that the proposed amendment provided little protection for assets or sources of income like a shop or farm. The Minister said that the amendment says that proper provision must be made and that such provision should take into consideration the fact that a wife had been working on the farm and had contributed in that way.  If that is the case, should the Minister not have included the word &ldquo;compensation&rdquo;, which is a different thing in law?  Decisions would have to be very clear cut in regard to compensation. I know that the Minister may have in mind bringing in legislation which would ensure an even-handed approach and balanced arrangements in relation to property.  Will the Minister be constrained by the words in the amendment because the legislation will have to have recourse to the constitutional position at that stage?  That will have to be dealt with fully.</P>
    <P>I also raised the question of inheritance rights of the spouse and of children in relation to the moral duty of parents and whether that moral duty under section 117 of the Succession Act would continue. I should like the Minister to state the position clearly in that regard.  It seems to be agreed that it would be diminished and diluted and that it would be necessary to pursue it in the courts, but that is an obvious feature.  If there are children of the second marriage there will be a dilution&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 117, to which I referred last Friday, has to be pursued in the courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that.  I referred to social welfare benefits and it seems that they will apply to the second wife.  The Minister said that a suitable scheme could deal with that situation but he accepted that the benefits would <Col N="1801" /> transfer to the new wife.  If the husband died the second wife would become the widow and, therefore, would be eligible for the widow's pension.  The Minister will probably say that social assistance schemes are in existence to deal with it or that other schemes could be modified to deal with the problem.  Nevertheless, the State will have to assist the divorced wife and children on a means-tested social assistance basis.  From statements made by various Ministers that seems to be the case.  However, it has implications from the point of view of the first family. There is no problem in regard to the second family in that respect because they will be entitled to the benefits involved. At present the benefits stay with the wife because, even if there is a judicial separation or some other agreement, the widow's pension and so on will go to the first wife.  In the amendment before us it is clear that that will not happen and if the Minister thinks otherwise he should have said that provision will be made for the first wife.  I accept that the Minister intends to make provision in this regard, but such provision will become a means-tested social assistance provision unless the Minister intends to have benefits paid to two widows, deserted wives and so on. Obviously the costs would be very high and I am sure the Minister has done some calculations in that area.  The Minister is nodding his head so I presume it would be social assistance schemes which the State would normally provide in those circumstances.</P>
      <P>The final point which I made in relation to this amendment on Second Stage was that the rights and protection enshrined in the Constitution, designed to protect the family based on marriage, would be transferred to the second marriage and that the position of divorced spouse and children of the first marriage would be at least questionable.  The Minister seemed to think that this would not be the case and we should not be worrying about them&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>If the Minister believes that there should be protection for the first family, why not include that protection in the amendment so that it is clear, specific and can be seen clearly?  That does not take into account financial considerations or the benefits lost because the position of the first family will be questioned by legal people subsequently unless the position is very clear.  If the Minister intends that the first family should still be regarded as a family based and founded on marriage, he ought to say so.  He should not be ambiguous in this regard.  I will be very interested to hear what the Minister has to say.  I raised major questions on Second Stage about the amendment and I have a great deal more to say about them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Deasy) Austin Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Deasy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take oral Questions Nos. 1, 23, 28, 35, 36 and 40, priority Question No. 52 and written Question No. 93 together.</P>
      <P>While domestic and international influences favour further early reductions in interest rates, the Government have decided to introduce two exchange rate guarantee schemes.  The schemes, which will operate through the ACC and associated banks, will provide working capital finance for farmers of up to £135 million in EMS currencies at favourable interest rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am confident that the ACC and associated banks will provide these funds at the lowest possible commercial rates of interest and will endeavour to ensure <Col N="1804" /> that those farmers who are in greatest need will receive priority treatment in the allocation of funds.</P>
    <P>These two schemes represent a significant contribution by the Government in helping farmers overcome difficulties caused by the adverse weather since last summer, the current level of commercial interest rates and recent developments in the Common Agricultural Policy.</P>
    <P>The general outlook for Irish agriculture in the years ahead is one of cautious but not completely restrictive prices based on a Community policy that gives an assurance of reasonable returns to producers and fair prices to consumers for a given level of production but which is less supportive above that level.  Thus, there must be a continuous adaption at producer level towards a more market orientated operation with particular regard to the development of new and higher quality products and a reduction in our dependence on EC support mechanisms such as intervention.  I am confident that the new exchange rate guarantee scheme will give substantial encouragement to such developments and in particular will stimulate initiative and enterprise in new lines of production.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the scheme, but will the Minister agree that £135 million is a small sum of money in view of the total indebtedness of the farming community which, I understand, amounts to £1,500 million.  I note from the Minister's statement that only £100 million will be available to cereal farmers and beef producers and I should like to know if it is the Minister's intention to take steps to make more money available under the scheme.  Will the Minister tell the House what the &ldquo;favourable interest rates&rdquo; will be?  I understand that they will be in the region of 9 per cent which is twice what other farmers in the EC have to pay for money.  What steps is the Minister taking to have the overall level of interest rates, at present in the region of 15 per cent to farmers, reduced by the commercial banks and the ACC?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Contrary to the Deputy's <Col N="1805" /> statement, the loans we have announced have been welcomed generally, particularly by the farming organisations.  The amount involved is considerable and I have no doubt it will do a lot to help farmers who are in financial difficulty. With regard to the general rate of interest, I must point out that the Minister for Finance made an announcement in that regard today.  We are all very concerned that the general interest rate should drop much further as time progresses.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> Has the Minister made an assessment of the position of farmers following stock and other losses as a result of last year's weather?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I make assessments at the end of each year.  The position is kept under constant review and as part of that review we decided to make Euro loans available because as everybody recognises, farmers had to endure dreadful hardships due to the bad summer last year and the bad weather throughout the spring.  We bear all factors in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick West) Mr. Noonan (Limerick West)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> The package has been welcomed as a step in the right direction, but will the Minister accept that it is restrictive in its scope in the long term?  Is the Minister aware that, as far as the package is concerned, farmers cannot plan ahead because they do not know what capital will be available for agricultural development 12 months hence?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>The package is deliberately restrictive because were it not the effects would be so diluted that they would not help those in serious difficulty.  The package is restricted to cereal growers, winter beef fatteners and small scale milk producers as well as providing an incentive for farmers to enter into new lines of production.  The latter is a very attractive part of the package.  If the package was open to all those involved in the agricultural industry it might affect the availability of money to those most in need who were our primary concern at the outset.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>If the 2½ per cent exchange surcharge is not availed of because of the exchange risk will it be returned to the farmers who borrowed the money when the loans are paid?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>The risk element involved is 2 per cent for the first phase of the package and 2½ per cent for the four year scheme.  I do not believe it will be returned, but that is a matter for negotiation with the banks.  In fact, the whole scheme is being negotiated with the banks.  The banks have indicated their willingness to operate it and their goodwill towards it.</P>

      <P>The package covers cereal growers, winter beef production and dairy farmers, but will sheep farmers qualify?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Existing sheep systems will not qualify but those who wish to get into sheep production will qualify under the £35 million scheme over a four year period.  One of the elements of the package is to encourage the production of products which are not in surplus in the Community and sheep is one of those commodities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the huge losses that sheep farmers suffered it is discriminatory to exclude them from that package.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to point out to the Deputy that we pay out £50 million in grants and subsidies to sheep farmers. So far this year we have paid out £30 <Col N="1807" /> million of that £50 million.  That £50 million is paid to sheep farmers by way of a ewe premium of £16.74p in extent and a headage payment in disadvantaged areas of £9.60p.  The sheep farmer in the disadvantaged area gets, in aid alone, something in excess of £26 per head whereas, in an area which is not disadvantaged, the sheep farmer will get £16.74p per head.  That £50 million is a tremendous amount of money and, as I said, we have already paid out £30 million because of the particular difficulties experienced in the current year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. J. Leonard Mr. J. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that the greatest problem facing farmers over the past number of years has been the very high interest rates on loans?  Until we become competitive with other countries and have rates 50 per cent lower than that referred to by the Minister, we shall not be in a position to compete.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but I think the Deputy will agree that it is a good start.  We are endeavouring to bring down interest rates nationally and through the Euro loan scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanByrne" hpid="Mr. S. Byrne Mr. S. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the statement made by the Minister.  However, is he aware of the large number of sheep dying in the hill areas?  While we may talk about headage payments for which sheep farmers qualify, there is the question of the number of sheep that will be alive at the end of the day.  Livestock are dying in the lowlands, but in the hill areas the numbers dying of semi-starvation and malnutrition are rather high.  Perhaps these farmers would need some special assistance, as they have gone through a very bleak period over the past couple of months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that sheep and cattle breeders have had a particularly tough spring and more so their animals because of the problem of hunger.  We give out substantial grants by way of headage payments and ewe premiums. <Col N="1808" /> We cannot compensate people for every eventuality.  We appreciate that there are difficulties, but one just cannot cope with all of them.  There will be abuses of schemes if one tries a blanket operation. One will end up often compensating not the genuine person but the person who claims to have a tough case but whose case is not as genuine as he would like us to believe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. D. Gallagher Mr. D. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister accept that most people who owe money at present will find it very difficult to repay these loans?  They have already spent substantial amounts in trying to maintain their present stocks because of the bad spring we have experienced.  For that reason, would the Minister accept that it is necessary to introduce some other measures which would be of help to the farming community at this time, along with the suggested measures which he has mentioned here today?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>We have brought forward a certain component of a suckler cow grant payment.  We are paying £15 a head in advance, to try to alleviate the difficulties. Secondly, these Euro loans do apply to existing debts, so they can be offset against them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I call Deputy Walsh and Deputy Moynihan and then I think that we should move on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that the real rate of interest and the overall indebtedness of farmers are crippling the farming community at present?  It is, at 12 per cent, at least three times the rate of interest on indebtedness by German, French and other farmers in the Community.  Has the Minister had any negotiations with the banks to reduce the overall interest which is exorbitantly high?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>We always think of the countries whose economies are particularly strong and compare ourselves with them.  We should look at the overall situation within the European Community. <Col N="1809" /> We will find that our interest rates &mdash; and particularly our rate of inflation &mdash; are not as great as those in some countries. People are very slow to admit that that is the case.  We are not the worst as far as interest rates are concerned and certainly not the worst concerning inflation.  Some countries are in a much worse position than we are.</P>
      <P>As regards the Deputy's question about overall rates of interest, as I pointed out earlier on, the Minister for Finance and the Government are actively pursuing this matter.  It is probably one of our chief priorities to get general interest rates down because that will improve the economy most quickly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonalMoynihan" hpid="Mr. D. Moynihan Mr. D. Moynihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Moynihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Considering the losses undergone by the sheep farmers, they will not qualify for the £26 headage payment and ewe premium mentioned by the Minister.  Those farmers will have to replace the stock they have lost over the winter.  Would it not be appropriate that they should be allowed to qualify for this loan?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a certain qualifying date.  I am sorry, but people would have to have the sheep on that particular date.  We cannot compensate people for every difficulty that arises.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Hegarty)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the legal quality standards operating in this country, imported fruit is required to have an indication of the country of origin on the packaging.  In retail shops the produce may be removed from the packaging for display, in which case a label must be <Col N="1810" /> attached to the place of display indicating the origin.  In the course of inspections it is sometimes found that retailers omit to carry out the required labelling, but it is unusual to find a case of incorrect labelling. Where produce is not correctly labelled, the matter is brought to the attention of the management.  This is generally sufficient to have the matter corrected but, in the case of persistent offenders, legal proceedings are instituted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if in view of the ban on imports of contaminated foods from eastern Europe he will now escalate the promotion of Irish food products, generally accepted as being the purest food in the world, including meat and dairy products; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. J. Leonard Mr. J. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture the action he proposes to take to maximise the advantage of Ireland's status as a non-nuclear country, in the marketing of our produce abroad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 and 92 together.  State funds for the promotion of exports of agriculture and food products are provided through Córas Beostoic agus Feola in respect of the beef and sheep meat sectors and through Coras Tráchtála in respect of all other sectors.  These supplement the funds for export promotion made available through levies on producers and from the resources of the various agricultural bodies and firms involved in the export of food.</P>
      <P>As Deputies are aware, Ireland already has a good reputation as a producer of wholesome natural food in a relatively pollution-free environment and I have no doubt that the various promotion agencies, as well as, of course, individual firms will highlight the additional advantage of our status as a non-nuclear State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanByrne" hpid="Mr. S. Byrne Mr. S. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied with the present performance of the semi-State bodies promoting our beef and dairy products, which are Córas Beostoic agus Feola and Córas Tráchtála?  Is he satisfied with their efforts within and outside the EC?  One must take into consideration the present limitations put on farmers who are trying to gain a livelihood off their farms.  The dairy business is limited and there is also the reduction in grain price in the coming year.  I am not at all happy with the situation.  Would <Col N="1812" /> the Minister give his views on this?  He may say he has no control over the situation but he must have.  A lack of interest is being shown by the two bodies I have mentioned.  I especially would like the Minister's views on their lack of interest with regard to the latest World Food Fare in Barcelona, where 90 countries were represented and we had to display our meat on British stands due to the lack of effort on the part of those bodies.  Could the Minister state why those bodies were not out there promoting Irish products? There is also the danger to intervention at the fall of the year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>One could say that one is never satisfied.  If one is satisfied, there would be complacency.  We cannot afford to be complacent.  With regard to Coras Tráchtála, they provide assistance to industry generally including sectors of the food industry not already catered for by bodies such as CBF, Bord Iascaigh Mhara and Bord Bainne.  By and large, they are doing a good job as are CBF. CBF are promotional rather than marketing. The marketing of meat and meat products is carried out by private enterprise. I have to say they are doing a good job.</P>
      <P>Bord Bainne are not a State company. They are the major marketing body involved in the export of dairy products. Recently, they established a market development fund to be financed by a levy on producers.  Some of this fund will be used to promote exports of dairy products.  Incidentally, for the information of the House there are no specific plans to cash in on our distance from the site of the nuclear accident at Chernobyl or the fact that we are a non-nuclear State.  It can be assumed that various promotional bodies involved in the export of food will try to exploit these facts in addition to our existing reputation as a producer of natural food.</P>

      <P>I am sure that will be the case.  As a matter of fact, we have a lot of processed food in cold storage.  I was informed this morning that there were unexpected inquiries from overseas sources for this food.  Another point for the Deputy's information: we used our arguments about our distance from Chernobyl to help to prevail upon the Saudi Arabian authorities not to ban imports from our country following the nuclear disaster.</P>

      <P>By providing a greater degree of security and profitability for sheep production, the EC common organisation of the market for sheepmeat &mdash; introduced in 1980 &mdash; has been the major influence in bringing about a significant increase in the national sheep flock in recent years.  This policy, along with national policies aimed at improving breeding, carcase quality, marketing and presentation, will continue to provide scope for further expansion.  Expansion must, however, be on an orderly basis entailing a greater awareness by producers and factories alike of the need to respond to market requirements.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I must point out that there are no quotas on beef.  We can produce as much as we want.  I hope there will not be in the foreseeable future.  However, there are quotas on milk.  Might I point out that it is not a case of quantity in the sheep industry?  It is just as important and probably more important that it should be a case of quality.  We have tremendous export potential and tremendous markets if the quality is right.  Far too often in the past it has not been right.  We have a tremendous potential in the French market, in particular, which we cannot take up fully because the quality is not up to the French demand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1816" /> As regards quantity, the number of sheep has increased by 23 per cent since 1980.  That, surely, is a dramatic and very significant increase but at this stage we should be more concerned with quality rather than quantity.</P>

Unfortunately, they have not seen fit to agree to their contribution.  The bringing in of that classification scheme has been held up because of that.  We feel it is in the producers' own interests that there should be a classification scheme.  Therefore, the producers should be willing to make some contribution.  It is unfortunate that they have not agreed.  I believe they should and will.  The sooner the better.</P>

      <P>I purpose to take Questions Nos. 7 and 44 together.</P>
      <P>As the Deputies are aware, I have been recently appointed as Minister of State at the Departments of Agriculture and Industry and Commerce with special responsibility for the food industry.  In order to help me in my task of ensuring the proper and co-ordinated development of the food industry, I have decided to establish a permanent food committee, comprising of representatives of the Departments of Agriculture, Industry and Commerce and Tourism, Fisheries and Forestry, together with representatives from various State agencies and Bord Bainne to explore ways and means of assisting this development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a range of facilities and incentives available from the State to <Col N="1820" /> help the food industry to expand and diversify into value-added products.  Substantial grant aid is also available from the EC Commission through Council Regulation 355/77 and in this connection my Department has recently submitted to the EC Commission development programmes for the various sectors in order to provide the framework for the assessment of applications from the Irish food industry for grant aid.  I should also point out that, in the recent price negotiations, the Commission agreed, following pressure from Ireland, to lift its ban on grant aid for the dairy sector under this regulation.</P>
    <P>Broad proposals for the establishment of a food research centre, amalgamating the food research facilities of AFT and IIRS have been under discussion between these two bodies, but specific arrangements have as yet to be worked out and put to the Ministers concerned.  I am satisfied that the range of State facilities for research and development, including those at UCC, are adequater for the needs of the industry.  In fact the problem up to now has been the reluctance of the industry to make full use of these facilities.</P>

The Commission would not agree and none of the other States would agree.

That is the sort of scene I inherited in regard to the potato industry.  Since then we have set up the National Potato Co-operative. We put a Bill through the House for the registration of potato growers in order to get information as to who was growing what and in what quantities.  We had a very poor response in some areas to the registration of growers.  I should like to see many more people being registered. It appears that when the going is good nobody bothers very much.  There may have been a glut but that does not prevail at present.

      <P>The EC ban comes into effect on 1 January 1988.  From that date intra-Community trade in implanted livestock and meat derived from such animals will be prohibited.  In view of the beef production pattern in this country and the vital necessity to maintain export outlets for our cattle and beef, the use of hormones for growth promotion purposes must now be prohibited so that we can comply with the EC deadline.  I propose to introduce the prohibition on a phased basis.  The administration of growth promoters to calves will be prohibited shortly and the ban extended to adult cattle at a later date.</P>

        <i>(Limerick West):</i> asked the Minister for Agriculture if he will indicate precisely how the recently concluded European common measures for cereals will be implemented in this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>The measures in relation to cereals decided upon at the meeting of the Council of Ministers in Luxembourg in April fall under four headings &mdash; price reductions, quality criteria, delayed access to intervention and a co-responsibility levy.</P>
      <P>The price reductions decided upon by the Council will be applied to cereals offered to intervention.</P>
      <P>As regards quality, the price for cereals offered to intervention will be based on criteria laid down by the Council of Ministers.</P>
      <P>Intervention will operate from September to April inclusive.  A decision has not yet been made by the Community on the arrangements for paying for cereals taken into intervention.</P>
      <P>A co-responsibility levy of 3 per cent will apply from 1 July next in respect of cereals processed, taken into intervention or exported to third countries.  There will also be a scheme of aid for small cereal producers.  Detailed rules for the implementation of these measures have still to be finalised by the Council and the Commission.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> Since it is now late in the growing season and cereal producers and traders cannot plan ahead without exact information on EC rules, would the Minister make an immediate approach to the EC to have the proposed changes suspended.  At least for this year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be delighted if that could be the case.  I would not be averse to making that suggestion, particularly <Col N="1833" /> as a lot of cereals produced within the Community will be ready for harvesting in three or four weeks' time, particularly in Spain, Portugal, Greece and even the south of Italy.  If the Commission's proposals do not come into being within the next few weeks, it may well be that the regime may not penalise everybody equally and that some of these countries could evade it.</P>

      <P>I would not like to build up hopes that there will be complete exemption, but nevertheless if some people are to be exempted everybody should be considered for it.

      <P>Apart from any other consideration I do not think it would be appropriate for a State-sponsored body to become involved in commercial selling in competition with the private sector which is currently exporting some £950 million worth of livestock and meat annually to a wide range of markets within the Community and in third countries.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister responsible for CBF I occasionally have discussions with their chairman and I am quite satisfied that they are doing an excellent job. We increased their subvention from national funds this year by almost 40 per cent, while other bodies were suffering cutbacks.  The meat trade itself is doing an excellent job in selling abroad through promotion and marketing.  I do not think there is any other single industry in this <Col N="1835" /> country where such progress has been made in recent years.  On joining the Community 70 per cent of our beef was exported in the form of live cattle but now that figure is closer to 10 per cent. We are getting a vast amount of value added because of the way in which the processors are selling.  I am very aware of the role played by CBF.  They co-ordinate the markets and I do not believe their immediate vocation lies in directly selling.</P>

        <i>(Limerick West)</i> asked <Col N="1836" /> the Minister for Agriculture when the EC milk cessation scheme will be introduced; and if he has any plans in his Department to introduce a national scheme so as to ensure that there will not be a further reduction in our milk quota.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 24, 55 and 103 together.  The new Community cessation scheme will be introduced as soon as the EC Commission have finalised the detailed rules for its implementation.</P>
      <P>In regard to national cessation and quota leasing arrangements, a commitment was given by the Commission in the recent prices package that they would put forward a proposal for more flexible quota arrangements which would enable the restructuring of production to take place at the level of co-operatives and dairies.  The categories of farmers to benefit from such new arrangements will be decided following discussions with the appropriate organisations here.  Pending the introduction of these arrangements, quotas can be transferred, whether by lease or otherwise, only when the land to which they are attached is transferred.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> Is it the position that the Minister has no plans to relieve the bad effects on the dairying industry of the increased quota restrictions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly have.  The national cessation scheme which I spoke about in my original reply will give the industry a tremendous opportunity to restructure the whole production of milk. It may be remembered that the umbrella organisation for the creameries, the co-operatives or the ordinary dairies known as ICOS, tried in vain about six months <Col N="1837" /> ago to have a national cessation scheme but their efforts were thwarted by the fact that smaller co-operatives, particularly in the north-east and the north-west were worried that the national cessation scheme would lead to an outflow of milk from those small co-operatives to the larger co-operatives in the south.  We got a commitment from the Commission &mdash; and the commitment is at our instigation &mdash; that they will now allow cessation schemes to work on a co-operative basis.  In other words, each individual co-operative will operate its own scheme and any milk which is given up will go only to other producers within that co-operative area. That is a tremendous concession which will help people to restructure the industry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>Special measures are already in operation to improve the competitiveness of glasshouse growers in the production and marketing of their crops, namely, a scheme of grants for the conversion of heating systems from oil to solid fuel and financial aid towards the cost of improved market co-ordination for glasshouse crops.  The fall in oil prices and bank interest rates should also help them considerably.  They are further helped by the fact that their products <Col N="1838" /> are looked for in places as far away as Holland and that is a turnabout.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree with me that even with the grant scheme that was introduced to encourage people to change from oil fired burners to solid fuel burners, given the financial difficulties and poor cash flow that has been the order of the day particularly for tomato growers over the last seven or eight years, the capital borrowings that would be needed to install the solid fuel burners is beyond the capability of many of those growers because the interest rates applying to borrowings is too high?  The amount of glass that is lying idle or underused at present is indicative of the problem that exists.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps they would qualify for the European loan over a four year period.  This is something I would like to have investigated because that would be a significant help.  I accept that solid fuel boilers and other boilers are expensive and that double cladding is equally expensive.  But at the moment trading is quite good and people, for some reason or another, are turning very much towards hot house food such as lettuce and the full range of hot house plants.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister of State seriously consider my suggestion that he should examine the acute difficulties of the glasshouse growers at present?  They are really on their knees financially and it is the one area where there is potential for development and for import substitution. Will the Minister of State, as part of a package, look at the possibility of reducing the level of taxation both on oil and on solid fuel even for a short period of perhaps two years?  This would be a dramatic measure that would turn the position around for these growers.  The simple fact of the matter is that if there is not a package introduced they will simply go out of business.  There are huge amounts of capital involved; there are people with acres of glass underutilised or left derelict.  They are up to their ears <Col N="1839" /> in debt to the bank and to the Agricultural Credit Corporation and they are not able to meet their commitments.  If the Minister decided to introduce a suitable package it would be money well spent because there would be a return on the investment.</P>

      <P>It is a fair point but, at the same time, I have to say that in conjunction with these glasshouse growers we have, at their behest, introduced a market co-ordinator.  The Deputy will accept that, apart altogether from our being able to supply the market, we have to be very careful not to oversupply the market which has been happening for parts of the year.  We have now succeeded in implementing a few of their suggestions. Another matter that I did not mention is the setting up of a national horticultural co-operative.  We are helping to fund that co-operative.  Admittedly, it is now involved in only a few counties, the Deputy's own, Dublin and Meath.  Initially it is targetted at the Dublin market and they are trying to get a percentage of the produce from a number of growers that they are prepared to offer to the co-operative.  Certainly, I am prepared to look at any schemes or packages that the Deputy submits.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the break I had <Col N="1882" /> been dealing with a number of questions that arose in relation to this section on the Second Stage and have carried on into the Committee Stage.  I had pointed out that as far as I could see a number of these questions have not been answered satisfactorily by the Minister and I look forward to hearing his view in the course of the debate this afternoon.</P>
      <P>As a final point in the list of points, I raised the question of the family based on marriage and the position which would exist under the terms of the amendment. I want to know what the position of the first family will be and how their rights will be determined if the amendment as proposed by the Minister is included in the Constitution.  It is also clear to me that the amendment affects every single family in the country and that there would no longer be a permanent contract; every marriage could be set aside in future, albeit under the terms that the Minister has mentioned which we have discussed in some detail earlier.  It seems quite clear that every marriage in the country is affected and that in making a decision on the question people should understand that that is what is involved.  I want the people to be aware of the issues that are involved.  They should be aware of the implications before they make their decision.</P>
      <P>I was particularly interested in the Second Stage contribution by Deputy Kelly.  He seemed to be very clear about a number of issues which are not being presented clearly outside this House and, after today there possibly will be more confusion as the for and against campaigns go into action.  It is our duty to establish the factual position.  Deputy Kelly said he accepted that divorce is a dreadful event for children.  He also accepted that the introduction of a divorce jurisdiction would be progressive and that even though we may be introducing something which is quite restrictive, the measures will be relaxed progressively. These are the worries we were trying to tease out this morning.  We were worried that the wording proposed by the Minister would leave itself open to that kind of interpretation in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1883" /> Deputy Kelly went on to say that once we had a divorce jurisdiction it changed radically the concept of marriage. Deputy Kelly is a professor of constitutional law and very honestly and openly says what he thinks will happen.  If the Government say honestly and openly what the facts are, the people will be in a position to make their own decisions and, on such an important moral question, it is the people who must decide.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kelly went on to say that as the law stands the word &ldquo;married&rdquo; cannot be defined except by reference to indisslolubility. It is nothing if it is not indissoluble. He said he accepted that it will undergo a kind of chemical transmutation and that is undeniable.  There will be a change in the status of the family in society and there is no point in Deputies suggesting that there will not be.  We have to weigh this change against finding a compassionate and humane way to deal with the problems which might arise but it does not help if the Government are not forthright and honest about these matters.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kelly then said that marriage would become an arrangement, although in the vast majority of cases it would be a permanent arrangement.  As I said, that is a very honest and objective appraisal of the fundamental nature of the change we are considering.  In this regard Deputy Kelly's view is particularly relevant since, as I said, he is a professor of constitutional law and is not confused between the statutory provisions and the constitututional position.  As he knows, the constitutional position will override any subsequent statutory proposals and any proposal brought forward must have regard to what is contained in the Constitution.</P>
    <P>He said he did not see this matter in terms of a civil right.  He went on to say that he did not think anyone looking at marriage as a contract, even in the most simple and elementary form, could say that there was a civil right to dissolve a contract.  He added that there is the right to break it and to pay damages and there is the right if both parties agree to modify <Col N="1884" /> it or to withdraw from it.  However, he said, it was over-selling the case for the Government to describe divorce as a civil right.  He said it would probably cause as many breakdowns as it will remedy and he made it very clear that he does not see this matter having anything to do with Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>It is very important that we make these points very clear.  It is not simply a case of giving a yes or no to divorce in Ireland. It is not simply a question of removing the present constitutional ban on divorce. What we are talking about is amending the Constitution to provide every citizen with a constitutional right to divorce. People must understand this when they are making their decision.  The Government's basic approach is to put into the Constitution a firm and strong provision for a constitutional right to divorce.  To my knowledge, no other country has a constitutional right to divorce, although most countries have provision within the law for divorce.  I looked at some constitutions, including the American Constitution which provides a range of rights, but it does not provide a constitutional right to divorce. This is one of the problems which arises under the Government's proposition. They are providing a constitutional right to divorce and we are removing the ban.</P>
    <P>Up to now we were unique in protecting the family with very strong constitutional provisions.  I mentioned these provisions on Second Stage: the State recognises the family as the natural primary and fundamental unit group of society and as a moral institution possessing inalienable and imprescriptible rights antecedent and superior to all positive law or statutory regulation.  The family is superior to any measures that might be taken and has very strong rights.</P>
    <P>Our Constitution banned divorce but we are now removing the ban and putting divorce in its place.  I would like the Minister to say a little more about why he did not propose a simple removal of the ban and attempt to provide for remarriage within the law.  At a very early stage of the Oireachtas joint committee I presented a <Col N="1885" /> paper to them indicating that I thought it would be very difficult, even if you removed the ban, to introduce legislation which could provide for divorce because of the strength of support for the family in the other Articles of the Constitution. I am fully aware of that argument.  The Minister has substantial legal and other resources available to him, and I would like to hear more about his thinking on the impossibility or possibility of doing that.</P>
    <P>The Minister could have updated nullity and other things as Deputy Kelly suggested. Could he have introduced legal arrangements of any sort that would meet the requirements of families who have no legal status where a second union has been formed?  My advice was that this would be extremely difficult if not impossible. The Minister seems to feel this is possible.  If that is so, then other consequences will flow from that.</P>
    <P>The question will go to the people. The Electoral (Amendment) Bill is to be taken in the House shortly and will just propose one question as follows:</P>
    <P>The Tenth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1986, proposes to delete subsection 2º of Article 41.3 of the Constitution, which states that no law shall be enacted providing for the grant of a dissolution of marriage.</P>
    <P>That is the first part &mdash; and to substitute then the words we are discussing here in this Bill here today.  The next subsection of that section provides:</P>
    <P>2.  If you APPROVE of the proposal, mark X opposite the word Yes on the ballot paper.</P>
    <P>3.  If YOU DO NOT APPROVE of the proposal, mark X opposite the word NO on the ballot paper.</P>
    <P>Therefore, it is a simple yes or no to two things combined which are (1) removing the ban (2) the introduction of a positive provision for divorce in the Constitution. People will just be offered the two things for one yes or no to the two combined.</P>
    <P>Members of the House will remember that Deputy Michael O'Leary proposed <Col N="1886" /> the removal of the ban and then the control of divorce legislation through the Constitution.  That was another approach which reflected a view and an attitude of mind amongst people who would want divorce legislation and would recognise that it should be kept in a very restricted way.  He suggested that mechanism as a means of achieving that.  Now the Minister is removing the ban and putting divorce in its place.  The question arises then as to whether he really needs to rewrite the guarantees for the family, especially for the first family, which are contained in other Articles.</P>
    <P>Will there be a conflict there in relation to the first family?  Will all those powers in Article 41.1.1º remain, the inalienable and imprescriptible rights, the State guaranteeing to protect the family in its Constitution and authority?  Then it goes on to state that the family is the family based on marriage.  What will happen where there is contest between the two families and they wish to appeal to the Constitution? Which family will the Constitution recognise?  Will it have to recognise both families equally?  It will be clear and certain that the second family will have the full force and protection of the Constitution because they are clearly the family based on a marriage, and the marriage is the marriage mentioned in the amendment.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the position of the second family will be clear, but what is the position of the first family?  How will that be judged by lawyers in the future when they start to tease out the elements in this amendment, if it is passed by the people? To ensure that the first family will continue to have clear constitutional support, will it not be necessary for the Minister to put that specifically into the Constitution, to rewrite the other Articles that surround it?  I would like to hear from the Minister on that because it will affect very much the position of the first family if this amendment is passed.</P>
    <P>It is very relevant because, as mentioned on Second Stage, families have appealed to the Constitution for protection against the State when the State was being unhelpful to families or tried to <Col N="1887" /> press families into a situation they did not want to go into in education and other things.  What will be the definition of a family if the Minister's amendment is accepted by the people?  How will that be implemented?</P>
    <P>Let me give an example.  A lady has written to the Taoiseach, the President and others because of her present position. She has an agreed separation and her husband is contributing £5,000 per annum for maintenance.  She is trying to support two teenage children and to maintain what she calls the family home. She is having difficulty in doing this because income tax is being charged on the amount which she has.  She says:</P>
    <P>I regret that I am unable to pay tax on my maintenance of £5,000 per annum.  To pay this tax I would be obliged by economic necessity to seek and engage in labour to the neglect of my duties in the home.  My support in the home to my children is my primary and moral obligation, and I hope that this matter can be brought to a satisfactory conclusion.</P>
    <P>That matter was raised in a parliamentary question recently and it is with the Taoiseach who is fully aware of it.  I give it only as an example of how these various provisions in the Constitution for protecting the family are used by the family to protect their position, and the administration of the day must take cognisance of the fact.  That lady stressed in particular Article 41.2.2º which provides that:</P>
    <P>The State shall, therefore, endeavour to ensure that mothers shall not be obliged by economic necessity to engage in labour to the neglect of their duties in the home.</P>
    <P>That is stated expressly in the Constitution and on that basis this lady feels she has a clearcut case.  In practical terms she is in a very difficult position at the moment if the Revenue Commissioners are taking money and she is trying to maintain the family home and carry on.</P>
    <P>All the definitions apply to that situation now.  In the future if the Minister's <Col N="1888" /> amendment is approved by the people, what will be the position?  What will be the family?  What will be the family home?  If her husband left her that sort of money and then married again, what would be her position, her rights?  Could she claim as the family still in what used to be the family home?  Solicitors and lawyers have very definite definitions as to what the family home is.  I am not dreaming up these fears, they are problems which the Minister asked us to address and the harsh realities which must be faced.  I only mentioned that case as an example of what the family home is and what it will be if the amendment is accepted by the people.  I accept that the Minister wants to provide for the first family in any circumstances but the question is not about the Minister's best intentions, it is about what the lawyers will determine if the amendment is passed.</P>
    <P>A number of areas raise serious questions. I mentioned social welfare generally and the reply was that the State will provide under social assistance schemes. If that is the case, the women and children of the first family will lose substantially. Let there be no doubt about that.  If the Minister thinks that that is not the case I should like him to explain clearly why it is not.  Will the Minister provide duplicate pensions or will people have to rely on social welfare payments?  Children would also lose social welfare benefits because they would be dependants of the divorced wife if we assume that they are living with her and that she is trying to keep the home going.  The right to benefit on the father's PRSI will be transferred, under the constitutional amendment, to the wife and children of the second family.  The wife and children of the first family will lose the right to these benefits and instead will get social assistance.  The most up to date rates of social welfare are due in July.  If a wife of 45 years of age with a husband slightly older gets a divorce and the husband marries again and dies after five years, the widow's contributory pension will go to the second wife.  The first wife may have been in receipt of a deserted wife's benefit but this will not be applicable now and she <Col N="1889" /> will have to go on to deserted wife's allowance.  The rates in respect of her children will vary, depending on the size of the family, but there is a distinct difference between the social assistance scheme and the benefit scheme.  As a result of the loss of PRSI benefit the wife would lose £6.95 per week.  If she had six children she would lose £14.  There is a personal loss for the wife and also for the children.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that the divorce will be finalised in the Family Court.  With all the good intentions which he has in relation to it and in which we support him the position changes when divorce is available.  The Minister also said that a lump sum could be paid which would compensate for the loss of future benefits.  However, a wife in these circumstances, having been transferred to means tested social assistance, will not be able to earn any money without losing at least some of her assistance.  Even the allowances under social assistance would be reduced.  Obviously, if she invested the lump sum the annual income would also be taken into consideration.  The terms and conditions in that regard are very strict and are covered in the Social Welfare Act of 1981.  Even if you earn a very small amount it is deducted from your allowance.</P>
    <P>In <i>The Irish Times</i> of 20 May 1986 the Minister for Health said that allowances would not be affected.  He told a Labour Party public meeting in Dún Laoghaire that certain unnecessary fears had been raised in relation to the entitlements of women receiving deserted wife's benefits and allowances.  He said that once a wife's entitlement had been established, the social welfare system continued to support her as long as she was deserted even if she was subsequently divorced abroad. However, if the husband resumed financial support of the family the entitlement would cease.  That kind of information is misleading in these circumstances because once a divorce takes place a new situation arises.  Are both wives entitled to PRSI and widows' benefits?  I do not think that is the case.  Is the second wife entitled to both?  In my view the position <Col N="1890" /> is not as outlined by the Minister and if I am correct that should be made very clear because people are confused about it. The same applies to the different allowances.  We have not had experience in that area and the figures for Britain and other countries show that the vast majority of women who are left at home with children to look after end up on the poverty line or close to it.  They are thrown back on to the means tested social assistance schemes.  If they try to supplement their income their benefit is reduced.  The Minister must take into consideration the views expressed by Members on Second Stage.</P>
    <P>People have raised questions about the financial implications but the Minister has not answered them.  Deputies are right to raise those questions now so that people will be aware of the position before they vote on the amendment.  Will the Minister explain what will happen to Army, Garda and public service pensions?  Presumably, the first wife will lose the widow's and old age pensions and the direct entitlements from them.  The Minister may say this will come in under reasonable and proper arrangement or adequate and proper provision having regard to the circumstances when the divorce is being decided.  All circumstances should be included but in Practice it does not seem to work out that way elsewhere.  We must try to protect the position of the first family in that regard.</P>
    <P>Orphans will lose out under this.  The rate for orphans is £4.90 per week less. In all those areas the amounts will be less and they will be means tested as distinct from the direct benefits under PRSI which a woman would be entitled to and still has even under separation.  The dependent wife's benefit depends on the husband's PRSI.  The non-dependent wife may have her own PRSI and, consequently, may have rights.  That may be the reason why the Minister has left her out of the provision before us.  Part II states:</P>
    <P>...provided that the court is satisfied that adequate and proper provision having regard to the <Col N="1891" /> circumstances will be made for any dependent spouse and...</P>
    <P>It may be that in the Minister's view a spouse who is not dependant would continue to have rights.  In other words, 100,000 working women would continue to have rights under PRSI and so on and be able to obtain benefit on that basis.  If we accept the figures that have been given, 650,000 wives, less 100,000 working wives, it means that there are at least 550,000 dependent wives who will be dependant on the financial protection that will remain with the first family. Under the present arrangements those benefits continue.  If the husband is on a benefit scheme the wife continues to receive those benefits but it appears that will cease on the day the divorce takes place.  It appears that a dependent wife will lose the deserted wife's benefit and the widow's contributory benefit.  The rates in regard to those benefits are very different.</P>
    <P>What will be the position in regard to the old age contributory pension for a woman?  Presumably a wife will lose the right to the old age contributory pension. The Minister may tell us that the noncontributory pension will apply but in those circumstances a wife will be forced to apply for a means tested old age pension. The rates for such pensions are very different.  The loss per week, according to the rates that will apply from July next, will be £7.70 or 14 per cent.  The loss will be greater if the wife has any savings or any other income because that pension is means tested.  The Minister said our fears have been plucked out of the air but they are very real.  People are concerned about these issues.  It appears that the rights under the widow's contributory pension scheme and the old age contributory pension scheme are transferred to the second or subsequent wife meaning that the first wife and family will lose their rights and will fall back on the means tested benefits.  The State will then have to recognise the claim under the Constitution of the second wife and family to the PRSI benefits which will have accumulated.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1892" /> The question of the non-dependent wife also arises.  Will the Minister define for us a &ldquo;non-dependent wife&rdquo;?  Will he give an indication of the income level in regard to that person?  I presume the term refers to working wives which would mean that 100,000 working wives will be omitted intentionally by the Minister from the provision in the amendment. On Second Stage I raised a question about this but the Minister did not respond.  How much must such a person earn to be &ldquo;non-dependent&rdquo;?  What if such a person becomes dependant after the divorce?  What will happen to her if she loses her job or has to work at home? Is there any protection for her in the Government's legislation?  It does not appear that there is any protection for her since all protections apply to a dependent spouse only.  Is it the intention to introduce a new social assistance divorce allowance should such a person be obliged to mind the family?</P>
    <P>Will a working wife have a divorced wife's benefit based on her own PRSI? Will she get credits while she works in the home after her divorce, or will she have to fall back on the means tested benefits?  It appears that the position of such a person is not protected in the Minister's amendment.  Will the Minister tell the House why that person is specifically excluded?  It appears that all of this depends on means testing.  The calculation of means is contained in section 210 of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act.  It spells out very clearly how means are calculated for social welfare conditions. The weekly means of a person for the purpose of ascertaining entitlement are set out in subsection (2).  The various elements are given, but basically it is a very tight provision.  Subsection 2 (a) states:</P>
    <P>In calculating the weekly means of a person, account shall be taken of the following:</P>
    <P>(a) all incoming cash, including the net cash value of any non-cash earnings derived from personal exertions and the actual or estimated amount of any income as head of <Col N="1893" /> household, whether as contributions to the expenses of the household or otherwise...</P>
    <P>Excluded are sums received as children's allowances for handicapped children and so on.  It makes quite clear that in regard to the value of any property belonging to such person which is invested or which, though capable of investment or profitable use is not so invested or profitably used, the yearly value of the first £400 of the property is being taken to be one-twentieth part of the capital value and the yearly value of so much of the capital value of the property as exceeds the sum of £400 is being taken to be one-tenth part of the capital value and the weekly value of the property is being calculated as one-fifty-secondth part of the value so calculated.</P>
    <P>Sums exceeding £400 will be calculated and taken into consideration.  When the Minister says that a lump sum will be paid at the divorce stage which will take into account the loss of these rights, it would want to be a very substantial sum in the first instance.  It would also want to be arranged in such a way that it can be delivered without being devoured by the means test, the Revenue Commissioners and other people subsequently.</P>
    <P>That brings me back to the basic question of the position of the first family in relation to appeals against any abuse in the future in that area.  The supplementary welfare allowances, of course, will probably apply and these are given on page 147, No. 207.  There it is set out quite clearly that:</P>
    <P>The weekly needs of a person shall be subject to any payment pursuant to section 209 to be taken to be, in the case of a person who has no means, the amount calculated in accordance with section 208; in the case of a person who has means, the amount calculated in accordance with section 208 which would be appropriate in his case if he had no means, reduced by 5p per week for every 5p or part of 5p in his weekly means.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1894" /> That is sufficient to indicate that the means test aspect is extremely tight.  Will the Minister radically change all that? He could change the whole situation.  I presume the reason for not changing all of it is that the cost would be pretty astronomical, as the Minister could guess.  If there is to be an overall change, why has the Minister not made some specific provisions in his amendment for the first family, to make sure they are kept out of the poverty trap about which we have spoken so often on other occasions in this House?  Unless the State accepts the constitutional obligation to provide adequate maintenance for the first family, if the Government put divorce into the Constitution, why not put adequate safeguards for the dependants?</P>

      <P>The people can only vote and that is why I mentioned the question that the people will be asked.  They can only vote on the amendment which the Government put before them.  I accept that it is the people who must decide the issue.  It is one question that will be asked there.  I have not dealt with the situation of the mother leaving and the father having to maintain the children.  According to the information we have at our disposal, this would be a smaller percentage of cases but there is still a problem where the male spouse is left to run the home, or a home, or some home.  Now we are back to what will be defined as the family home in those circumstances in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the provisions of the Family Home Act a spouse does not have a right to sell or dispose of the house without the consent of the other spouse.  What will be the situation there?  Obviously it could be the father who stays in the house with the children and where will his welfare come from?  How will he be able to protect the children in the home?  Will that be the home, or if he goes to a different house, which house becomes the family home?  Which is the family who <Col N="1895" /> will be able to rely on the Constitution for the protection they need?  What financial assistance will the State provide to help the father in these circumstances?  Can the State be forced to defend the first family from attack, whether it is the father who has to support the children in a house which may or may not have been the family home, or whether it is the mother?  There will be cases where the father is left to undertake that care, although most of the debate has concentrated on the situation where the mother is left to bring up the children.  I have mentioned only some of the questions arising in this area.  There are others which we could discuss if we had more time.  I should be very interested to hear the Minister's views on these matters.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry, but on Committee Stage debate I believe it is the habit of the House, which is provided for in Standing Orders, that questions can be dealt with as they arise.  That is part of the value of Committee Stage procedure. I should like to comment on some points which Deputy Woods raised.  He has alleged that there is confusion.  If there is confusion, a great deal of it is being caused by the constant repetition of questions which have already been answered and in some cases by the repetition of statements which have been demonstrated not to be true.  To the extent that Deputy Woods feels there is confusion around, he will find perhaps that some of the confusion arises from that.  He has raised again today a number of the questions which he raised last week.  He has raised again today a number of the questions I dealt with last Friday in my reply on Second Stage.  He <Col N="1896" /> has not indicated whether he accepts the answers, or has any comment to make on those points, whether he has any critique to make on them.  He has spoken this afternoon as if nothing had been said last week.  I am entitled to feel that one can ask what is the point of having a debate.</P>
      <P>There are a number of points which Deputy Woods raised which I dealt with last Friday and I intend to deal again with some of these &mdash; indeed, to go over some of the ground I covered last Friday.  If Deputy Woods finds that there is anything in what I say that he believes is unclear, let him ask for clarification.  If he believes that it is not correct, let him make his point and we shall argue the toss about it.  If he does not believe it, let him give his reasons for not believing it, but let him not simply make assertions. I refer him again to Deputy Haughey's valedictory remarks this morning just before the left the Chamber to attend to some other busness, that we should not be foolish enough to assert with any degree of certainty how it will work out except, of course, where we are basing ourselves on the law.</P>
      <P>The first point Deputy Woods made was the contention that the amendment proposed meets all the needs of the second family.  He seemed to have second thoughts about that in the later part of his remarks.  He appears to take the view that it will not meet the needs of the first family.  He asked is there a need to rewrite the constitutional provisions to protect the first family.  There is not. Deputy Woods analysis of last week, as I said last Friday, seemed to be along the following lines, and he indicated this again this afternoon: Articles 41 and 42 give constitutional protection to the family based on marriage.  He instanced the fact that the State has passed legislation to protect the family against the State in some cases.  I would not argue at all with that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He contends that once a marriage is dissolved the partners and their children cease to be a family based on marriage. He then concludes that, in the event of a remarriage, the children of the first marriage not only lose the constitutional <Col N="1897" /> protection that is conferred upon them by Articles 41 and 42 but he went so far as to suggest any statutory rights that might be afforded them could in some way be regarded as unconstitutional. That is not the case.  I want to repeat what I said on those points last Friday afternoon.  There is no doubt that Articles 41 and 42 give protection to the family. As I said on Friday, to the extent that those Articles enjoin the State to act they are not stated in precise terms.  This is perfectly proper and is not in any way a criticism of the Constitution to say this. They do not prescribe the specific things the State should do to protect the family. That is the job of the Legislature working within the framework set out in the Constitution.</P>
    <P>The Constitution does not state those rights in precise terms.  While there is no doubt that measures taken, including those that give a wife a right to a share of her husband's estate, or a right not to have her home sold without her consent, are fully in accordance with the constitutional undertaking to protect the family, they are specific rights which a are granted not by the Constitution but by the statute under the terms of the Constitution. As I said again last Friday afternoon, one could make the point that had the Legislature not chosen to pass that legislation, those are rights that could not immediately be inferred from the Constitution. They are rights which probably could not be claimed or successfully claimed by anybody covered by those relying solely on the terms of the Articles in the Constitution.</P>
    <P>Equally, I made the point, and I make it for the completeness of the argument, that it would be difficult to contend that were the Oireachtas tomorrow to rescind and repeal those Acts completely we were taking away a constitutional right. We have rights, not specifically prescribed by the Constitution, which are implemented by statutes which are framed taking account of the provisions in the Articles of the Constitution.  The amendment we are proposing now would permit the dissolution of a marriage.  The marriage is the relationship between the <Col N="1898" /> spouses.  That is the only sense in which we understand the marriage.  We speak to a family based on marriage but the marriage, the thing that would be dissolved or capable or being dissolved under the terms of this constitutional amendment, is the relationship between the spouses, not the relationship between the spouses and the children and not the rights or duties of the spouses to the children.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am coming to that point and I want to make the point in the context of the contention repeated today by Deputy Woods that in some way a dissolution of the marriage interferes with the constitutional rights of the children of that marriage and his fear, I put it no more than that, that in some way a dissolution of marriage combined with the other provisions in the Constitution would transfer rights to any family of the second union to the detriment of the family of the first marriage.  I am saying that what is changed by a dissolution of a marriage is the relationship between the spouses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I pointed out, the relationship between each spouse and the children remains a relationship between parent and child and, to the extent that children have rights, or that parents have rights or duties resulting from the parent-child relationship, they are unaffected by the dissolution of the marriage.  That dissolution cannot therefore, in any way affect the rights and duties of the spouses in relation to their children.  The children continue to have all the rights in relation <Col N="1899" /> to their parents that derive from Articles 41 and 42.  The children of the marriage which has been dissolved continue to have the rights in relation to their parents which are provided for or based on Articles 41 and 42.  The children in that situation do not lose&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>That is excellent.  The Deputy is a man like myself.  He can wait for the good wine and I have been waiting for a while.  I was making the point that the dissolution of the marriage does not alter the rights the children have against their parents.  Particularly, I want to make the point that the dissolution of a marriage does not in any way affect the succession rights of children as against their parents.  The children of a man or of a woman have particular rights conferred on them by the Succession Act, 1965.  On the death of their parents, the children have rights to their estates.  It does not matter whether that parent is still married or divorced.  That is not a consideration in setting out those children's rights.  The rights stand simply because that person is the parent of those children.</P>

      <P>It is now claimed that those rights will be diluted.  We take the case of a couple now married with four children.  The argument is that if that couple now get a divorce and one of the parents remarries and has other children, you can certainly argue that the rights of the children of the first marriage are diluted because there are more people to share in the estate.  One could equally argue that in some cases the rights of the children of the first marriage are enhanced if the parent, in respect of whom their rights of succession are being exercised, has become divorced, has not remarried and, therefore has no spouse who would share in the estate.  The children in those circumstances would gain because the portion that would normally have gone to a spouse would be available to them.</P>

      <P>I am not speaking about moral duties.  I will come to Article 117. That is a statutory provision in the case where a will is made and where the justice of the provision is contested.

      <P>To take my own case, and I am not a person of any substantial property, I have two daughters.  They have statutory rights of succession to me.  They have statutory rights of succession which, if they were to be taken into account now, would produce a certain entitlement to each of those children.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>With all respect, Deputy, that is a fact.  To say that because there may be other children of either one of the parents represents a dilution simply says that the same thing can happen in those circumstances as would happen if a given couple had more children.  It is not an argument that has any fundamental relevance to the provisions here.  The fundamental point is that the dissolution of the marriage does not in any way alter the nature of the rights children have on succession against the estate of their parents.</P>
      <P>I pointed out last Friday and I point out again that it is wrong to suggest, as Deputy Woods has, that any of those statutory rights of the children of the first family could in any way be regarded as unconstitutional.  Their inspiration comes from the Constitution.  Their form and reality come from statutory provisions. They are not affected by a change in the status of the spouses as between one another.  There is no ground on which you could argue that those rights become in any way unconstitutional simply because there has been a dissolution of the marriage.  Children, as the offspring of married parents and, therefore, members of families based on marriage, retain their constitutional rights under Articles 41 and 42 even when the tie between the parents has been severed by a dissolution of the marriage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, children of parents who seek and secure a divorce are being given an extra constitutional protection because of the proviso we have put in the <Col N="1902" /> Schedule which makes it a condition of the granting of a dissolution of marriage that the court be satisfied that adequate and proper provision, having regard to the circumstances, will be made for any dependent spouse and for any child of or any child who is dependent on either spouse.  Far from diluting, reducing or alienating in any way the rights of children of the first marriage, we are maintaining the rights they already have.  We are imposing a constitutional obligation on the court to ensure that proper and adequate provision is made for those children and, indeed, for any other children in respect of whom an obligation may lie on either one of the parties to the divorce proceedings?</P>
    <P>The dissolution of marriage, as has been pointed out, will deprive spouses of rights deriving from Article 41 in relation to each other.  They cease to be spouses so they obviously cease to have the rights spouses have in relation to one another. It follows therefore that, on a dissolution of marriage, each spouse will lose his or her statutory entitlement because those are rights that attach to spouses <i>qua</i> spouses.  Those rights which are in question here would include, for example, the wife's legal right share, the wife's share to a husband's estate on intestacy and, equally, any rights a husband might have in relation to his wife's estate.  The law as it stands, the legislation for which Deputy Haughey claims credit, the Succession Act, 1965, provides in certain circumstances for a loss of succession rights. This is stated in section 120(2).  One such circumstances is where a decree of divorce <i>a mensa et thoro,</i> a judicial separation, has been granted.  In such a case the spouse against whom the decree has been secured by a deceased person is precluded from taking any share in the estate of the deceased either as a legal right or on intestacy.</P>
    <P>In their report on divorce <i>a mensa et thoro</i> the Law Reform Commission recommended that on the granting of a decree of judicial separation, that is, a new form of decree which the commission recommended should be available on different and generally wider <Col N="1903" /> grounds than is the case at present, each spouse should be precluded from taking a share in the other's estate.  The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown looked at this question and took the view that the courts should be empowered to vary or to discharge a spouses right of succession following the granting of such a decree, having regard to the circumstance of the parties and in the context of determining what orders, if any, should be made for the division or transfer of property between spouses.</P>
    <P>It is significant that the committee, of which Deputy Woods was a member, agreed that the rights of the children in relation to succession should not be affected, though the committee suggested that changes might be made in relation to the rights of the spouses.  I will not travel all over the grounds the joint committee dealt with.  The point I want to make is that both the Law Reform Commission and the committee felt it was appropriate to recommend that in judicial separation there should be a change in relation to the rights of spouses in the matter of their respective property and in relation to succession.  It is a common condition of separation agreements and judicial separations made between spouses that each spouse renounces his or her right to a share in the other's estates because, considering their respective circumstances, they would take the view that that is the end of their marriage and they want to go their separate ways.</P>
    <P>I will not go into the specific examples Deputy Woods gave but I will make the point that it is obvious a problem arises in this area in any case in which an action is being taken by persons, that there would be a change in status in some instances, but in regard to spouses only. The only way to avoid such problems and problems in regard to succession is to prevent marital breakdown taking place, but we have not found a way to bring about that result which we would most wish to bring about but which is beyond our reach.  It is very clear that no matter <Col N="1904" /> what the circumstances, there will be inevitable difficulties for the persons concerned in trying to make provision for two households out of the assets and income which previously had to support only one. It is inherent in the nature not just of divorce but of marriage breakdown and separation that those problems will arise and have to be dealt with.</P>
    <P>It is in recognition of that that we have put a proviso into the Schedule before us.  It was particularly in recognition of the fact that on the dissolution of a marriage there is a change in the rights of spouses that we have provided that this requirement should be part of the constitutional amendment, and it is further recognition of that difficulty that the legislation will provide that the courts can make orders as to the disposition of property.  Our intention is that the mechanism will allow the courts to put something in place of the succession rights that will have been changed or extinguished by the dissolution of marriage.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is anything in what I have said that can be contested by Deputy Woods.  He may be able to say I have not answered every point he made. I will accept that and I will be very happy to deal with those matters if they are brought to my attention, but there is nothing I have said that can be contested by Deputy Woods.  Allowing for human error, and I claim to be human, I may have left out something, but there is not the ing misleading, untrue or incorrect in what I have been saying.  That being so, I hope this afternoon is the last time we will hear the claim that a dissolution of marriage in any way dilutes, changes or takes away or extinguishes the rights under the Constitution of the children of the first marriage and transfers them to those of the second.</P>
    <P>What I have been saying clearly indicates and demonstrates that that is not the case.  I appreciate the atmosphere in which the debate is being conducted, but if I hear that claim being made again I will find it very difficult simply to say that it is wrong: I would have to say that it can only be intentionally misleading.  I <Col N="1905" /> have said enough to show that that is not the legal or the constitutional position. Nothing I have said has been challenged.</P>
    <P>Contentions and claims to the contrary notwithstanding, I want to make it quite plain that the dissolution of a marriage does not extinguish the succession rights of the children of the first marriage.  It cannot, therefore, in any way transfer those rights to the children of the second marriage.  There can be nothing unconstitutional in the provision that all children of the spouses are treated equally in relation to succession.  Those claims should, therefore, disappear from our debate here, from the pages of the press and from comments in the media, because there is no foundation for them.</P>
    <P>Last week I wondered if Deputy Woods would get around to &mdash; I had hoped he would not &mdash; what I regard as the numbers game: he expressed it much more elegantly than a numbers game. He asked is the incidence of marriage breakdown and possible divorce at a high enough level in our society to justify introducing a measure like that before us.  I do not know how many couples will find themselves in marriage breakdowns, if the numbers are big enough to get ourselves involved in the kind of legislation we have here.  The only guess I would hazard about that, and it is a personal view which is shared by a great many people, is that whatever the number is we passed it long since.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it is a matter of numbers or of deciding if there are enough people who are sufficiently unhappy to justify a measure of this kind. That is not a valid basis on which to construct a piece of legislation like this. Deputy Woods claimed that our human perception and response to marriage have been conditioned by its indissolubility in civil law &mdash; I wonder.  Recently I spoke about this question to a friend and he asked me what I felt about the suggestion that the very passage of legislation like this would increase the incidence of <Col N="1906" /> marriage breakdown.  I do not think it will because I believe what is happening is that now we are catching up in the law with a view or a pattern of behaviour that people have long since decided they will follow.</P>
      <P>I do not agree with the proposition that the human perception and response to marriage have been conditioned by its indissolubility in civil law.  If the proposition were that indissolubility in canon law or in religion had an effect I could accept that, but the evidence we have before us is that notwithstanding the indissolubility of marriage in civil law, save in exceptional circumstances, marriages break down.  People leave their marriages. They decide for a host of different reasons that they want nothing more to do with them.  I cannot see any evidence for saying that more people might have decided to break up if it was not the case that marriage was indissoluble in civil law.</P>
      <P>Since I do not agree with that premise, neither can I agree with the next part of Deputy Woods' contention, which is that the passage of divorce legislation will change the way people see marriage.  Nor can I agree after the discussion we have had&mdash;&mdash;</P>

We will not sit and look at one another and say: &ldquo;Gosh, this changes everything between us.&rdquo;  If we have any kind of discussion on the matter, my belief is that we will say we have done something constructive <Col N="1908" /> because many people will have the prospect of resolving an impossible situation in which they find themselves.  If anything, we will feel comforted as members of a community that we have taken that step and I will feel vindicated as a member of a Legislature that has made it possible to arrive at that point.  The last thing I shall feel is that the legislation has made any difference to my marriage. What will make a difference to my marriage are things I shall do or that my wife will do, not any legislation passed by the Dáil that has to do with the dissolution of marriage.  I hope people who believe that &mdash; the vast majority &mdash; will make that plain.  I also hope those who have not a particular view on the matter &mdash; probably also a large proportion of the community &mdash; will not begin to believe, because of this unfounded assertion, that something that is not true is the case.</P>

We can have civil laws to beat the band, to meet all kinds of situations that people may encounter in their lives, but for the vast majority who never meet that situation the law does not matter a rattling damn.  The fact that a number of things are permitted by law is not in itself an incitation to people to use the facilities of the law.  As I said when opening the Second Stage debate, there is nothing compulsive about this amendment and neither will there be anything compulsive about the legislation that will follow.  The fact that we pass the <Col N="1909" /> legislation is not in any way putting a whip on people to use the provisions in the legislation.</P>
      <P>Deputy Woods asked what constitutional provision there would be for the first family, having previously asked if there was a need to rewrite in the Constitution the constitutional protection of the family.  Since dissolution of marriage does not in any way affect the constitutional or statutory rights of the children of the first marriage, there is no need to rewrite or re-enact the constitutional protection of those children.  That follows inevitably, as night follows day, from the determination of the fact that this does not affect the constitutional or statutory rights of the family.</P>

He has said that the constitutional provision stays with the first family and that there is no need to change that because it stays in the Act.  He said earlier that the family is the family based on marriage. He then said that the family based on marriage is being dissolved.</P>

      <P>This is where the Deputy and I seem to be parting company.  I have not said that the family based on marriage is being dissolved.  I will repeat the point again in order to be absolutely clear.  The rights of the children of a marriage in relation to their parents are rights that <Col N="1912" /> they have as children.  They do not depend on the link between the parents. What I am at pains to point out is that the rights of the children in relation to the parents are not affected by the breaking of the bond between the parents.  That is specifically what I am saying and it is clear beyond any doubt.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Woods asked about people who are non-dependent spouses.  He asked for a definition of a non-dependent spouse.  The question of whether one spouse is dependent on the other would have to be decided by the court in the particular circumstances of any application that is made.  We do not require a definition of it.  The court will have to decide and satisfy itself that proper and adequate provision has been made for a dependent spouse.  It will obviously have to look at the circumstances of the spouse at the moment they come before the court to decide what constitutes proper and adequate provision. It is not a complete presentation of the situation for Deputy Woods to say there are 650,000 wives of whom 100,000 are working wives, so that an alleged failure &mdash; and I use the word &ldquo;alleged&rdquo; advisedly &mdash; to deal with the situation of non-dependent spouses immediately affects 100,000 working wives.  It does not.  The court will decide.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it does not affect their rights.  It does not affect the rights of people who are not involved in divorce proceedings at all.  It goes back to the earlier point I made about marriage.  If the argument were only on the basis that there are 650,000 wives of whom 100,000 are working wives and that this was the point at issue in deciding whether or not we should define non-dependent spouses, then an argument conducted on that basis only would be seriously misleading.  Since I know Deputy Woods does not want to mislead anyone, I have to repeat that the court will decide in the particular circumstances of each case that comes before it who is a dependent spouse and what is the proper and adequate provision that would have to be made for that dependent spouse under the proviso in this Schedule.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Woods asked earlier if there was a level of income at which a spouse goes from being non-dependent to dependent or <i>vice-versa.</i> As I have said, it is up to the court in the particular circumstances of each separate case that comes before it to satisfy itself in relation to the propriety and adequacy of the provision made for dependent spouses and children.  It is extremely important in that regard that the text we have before us refers to adequate and proper provision having regard to the circumstances, because each case would be different and the provision that would be made in one case with a given amount of income and assets would be completely different from the provision to be made in another.  We have provided that the court must be satisfied that adequate and proper provision, having regard to the circumstances, will be made for any dependent spouse and any child who is dependent on either spouse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Woods asked why we did not write in there specifically a provision in relation to compensation.  I think he envisages compensation arising in cases such as the one he mentioned last Friday in relation to a farm where the wife had made a substantial contribution over the years to building up the business of the farm, or any other business, and would feel entitled to seek some compensation for that.  Another case would be where a spouse, whether the wife or the husband, decided on marriage and on the birth of children to give up a job or career or a profession in order to stay at home and found after a period of marriage and <Col N="1916" /> looking after children that it was not going to be so easy to get back into that type of job or career or profession.</P>
    <P>We can all imagine cases where that could happen.  But those are specifically and severally the kinds of things that would be comprehended under the requirement on the court to satisfy itself that adequate and proper provision having regard to the circumstances is made.  The provision of course would not be limited just to that.  Provision would go further than that simple notion of compensation, although it is included.  It would go on to cover maintenance, some continuing provision and the distribution of property between the spouses.  What I am saying is that the framing of that proviso in the Schedule is in fact wide enough to allow the court to take account of all of the circumstances of the spouses when they come before it looking for a dissolution of the marriage.</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods asked would subsequent legislation be constrained or obstructed by the Constitution.  Subsequent legislation would obviously have to follow the guidelines set out in the Constitution.  Subsequent legislation could not derogate in any way from the terms of the Constitution.  In particular, subsequent legislation could not provide any derogation from the requirement on the court to be satisfied that proper and adequate provision having regard to the circumstances was made.  Subsequent legislation perhaps could conceivably require more stringent conditions to be applied.  It could make more stringent demands on the court on the conditions to be met before a dissolution of the marriage could be granted.</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods quoted a number of statements made by Deputy Kelly.  There is quite enough to go on with in the comments made by Deputy Woods himself without dealing with Deputy Kelly.  Incidentally, I do not agree with everything Deputy Kelly said and I specifically do not agree with his contention that there is in any sense a chemical transmutation in any way.  I like the phrase but I do not agree with the concept and I do not agree <Col N="1917" /> that that is what would happen in this case.</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods went on to say that no other country has a constitutional right to divorce.  I accept his word for it and presume that he has checked up the other constitutions &mdash; there are not many written constitutions around.  I am subject to correction but I am not aware of any other constitution that has a ban on divorce.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are not.  I had it checked out and there are none.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>We may all be wrong, in which case we will have to recognise a different reality.  But I cannot see that that is a particularly relevant reflection in the context of discussion we are having here.  It is what I would call an Aunt Sally argument where one puts up a cockshy and knocks it down with a coconut, but one has not done anything that is very constructive because the only reason we are having this discussion is that there is currently a ban in our Constitution on legislation to provide for divorce.  We have decided that we will remove that ban and replace it with a different provision which is the one we are talking about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no other country that I am aware of where that set of circumstances existed.  So, therefore, we can quite reasonably conclude, although the conclusion does not mean anything in particular, that there is no other country that has a constitutional right to divorce.  As far as I am aware, in all of the other jurisdictions that Deputy Woods may have in mind with which I have any acquaintance, while there is a legal right to divorce the question of constitutionality does not enter into it because the constitutions of those countries, to the extent that they are written constitutions &mdash; and there are not all that many &mdash; are silent on the question of divorce.  Therefore, while I do not disagree with Deputy Woods' conclusion, I would like to caution both Deputy Woods and the House against making any particular big thing of the fact that no other country has a <Col N="1918" /> constitutional right to divorce.  It is a result of the particular combination of circumstances that we have here.  We are replacing the provision in the Constitution rather than simply deleting the one that is there at the moment for reasons which Deputy Woods knows about perfectly well.  Indeed, I think he said last week during the course of our Second Stage discussion that he himself was the one who first raised this question in the joint committee.</P>
    <P>Why did I not propose a simple removal of the provision?  I have already dealt with that on Second Stage and I will say it briefly again.  It is because I believe that that would create a contradiction within the Constitution.  Personally &mdash; and I give this only as a personal view &mdash; I am not convinced that there would be anything fundamentally wrong with that. But I think one conclusion that one can draw &mdash; and a number of the members of the Oireachtas Joint Committee drew this conclusion &mdash; is that a simple deletion of the present provision would certainly invite, if not provoke, a substantial amount of litigation.  One of the reasons we have chosen this route &mdash; and it is only one &mdash; is that it would be preferable to avoid a situation where we invited or provoked litigation.  Deputy Woods also suggested that instead of taking this route we could have taken the route of updating nullity and, indeed, I heard Deputy Kelly saying the same thing.  Again that is the point that I dealt with last Friday afternoon.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>That was in conjunction with divorce on demand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say, without prejudging any debate that we might have at a later stage about that, that I find some difficulty in the concept of updating nullity except on the basis that I know there are some arguments to say that developments in psychiatric science over a period of years seem to be such that one can say with a greater degree of confidence that such a person was of a particular frame of mind or was likely to have been of a particular frame of mind <Col N="1919" /> some years ago.  Personally I find that concept very difficult to accept, but I am quite prepared to accept that that may be due to a deficiency in my own knowledge of those areas rather than an objective difficulty.  But I find it difficult to get behind the notion of updating nullity. Nullity is nullity whether it is old fashioned or new fangled and it does not seem to me that updating it is a particularly relevant type of concept.</P>
      <P>What is more important is that as the law stands at present the consequences of following the route of expanding the grounds of nullity to include children are very different from the consequences of divorce.  The Government are taking action which will change this in a very fundamental way.  The immediate consequences of a declaration of nullity at the moment is to render the children illegitimate and they lose many of the rights we were talking about earlier and which Deputy Cowen drew to our attention. Last Friday I said, and I sincerely believe, that pursuing the nullity route would be a very dangerous course because it would not just run the risk but would create the certainty of grave new injustices for the children involved.  That was one of the reasons we did not take the view that we could limit ourselves to updating the law on nullity or to expanding the grounds for nullity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Woods asked if we would make legal arrangements to provide legal status for the families of other unions, that is unions other than marriage.  I am not 100 per cent sure if I grasped what Deputy Wood's was asking, but the answer is that we do not need to make any specific legal provision governing the legal status of a second marriage of a person who has been divorced because that marriage becomes a marriage recognised by the law like any other marriage.  If Deputy Woods is asking if we are taking steps that will cover any other aspect of that situation, I have not proposed any specific steps in relation to the children of non-marital unions nor have I proposed any specific steps in relation to those unions themselves.  In my view that <Col N="1920" /> is not a matter which would properly fall within the ambit of what we are discussing today, but that may be simply because I have not grasped entirely what Deputy Woods was suggesting.  For example, we are not proposing to confer a new legal status on the cohabitation of a person just divorced or about to become divorced with another person who is not his or her spouse.</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods referred to another possible means of approaching this problem, one that was proposed in this House some time ago and which would have the effect of controlling divorce legislation through the Constitution.  If I understood him correctly, he was asking why we did not take the route&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I was giving it as an example of another approach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>There is another approach there.  We did not take the approach of writing the legislation into the Constitution because I do not believe that is a proper way to treat either the Constitution or legislation.  If Deputy Woods wishes to have a longer debate on that we could do so, but it is not something I wish to go into at any great length at this point.</P>
      <P>A great deal has been said about social welfare up to now.  I would remind the House of what the Minister for Social Welfare said on Second Stage last week. I do not know if I would be trying the patience of the House too far by repeating what she said, but I will select passages from her speech.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I know I can rely on you to tell me when the quotations are too long.  She said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fears have been expressed that somehow a person who has been divorced and who was not being maintained by the former spouse would be left without the State's financial support.  I want to assure everybody that of <Col N="1921" /> course this will not be so....  The social welfare arrangements would be called into operation where these resources are found to be inadequate.</P>
    <P>The resources referred to are those which would be taken into consideration by the court under the proviso included in this Schedule.  The Minister referred to particular needs in the social welfare code. She said:</P>
    <P>The system already supports families with a wide variety of schemes and services and, in considering the situation arising from divorce, the schemes for the support of one-parent families are clearly the most relevant ones.</P>
    <P>She went on to point out that over the years a number of different measures had been introduced to care for the particular needs of special categories of families. She quoted schemes for widows, deserted wives, unmarried mothers and prisoners wives and pointed out &mdash; I think quite fairly &mdash; that, although some of those schemes emerged in a somewhat haphazard way over a period of years, they did nevertheless indicate that the social welfare code is flexible enough to cater for a wide range of circumstances among families.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>She said:</P>
      <P>The developments in the area of support for single-parent families will of course be carried out with reference to whatever related proposal the Commission [on Social Welfare] may make.</P>
      <P>There is a need to constantly look at our social welfare code to decide if it meets realistically the needs of the people affected by it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a number of cases which should not be left out of account where the benefits available to a deserted wife do not depend on the husband's insurance record.  They are available to the <Col N="1922" /> wife by right on the basis of her own social insurance record.  Where that is the case there would be no change in the entitlements and any subsequent benefits to which she might be entitled would be determined by her own insurance record. A vast number of the 100,000 people Deputy Woods referred to do not come into this category, but of the small percentage who do a proportion of them have their own insurance record and therefore do not fall to be considered in the context to which Deputy Woods referred.</P>
    <P>The House will understand if I do not comment on the specific case Deputy Wood's raised which seems to have more to do with tax law than with any quirk of the law in relation to marriage.  I do not think Deputy Wood's raised it to have it discussed here but&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;merely as an illustration of a particular point he was making.</P>
      <P>Deputy Woods had a great deal to say about the social assistance part of our code and the operation of means tests in that part of the code.  Without in any way arguing with the concern that he pointed out, I remind the House that means tests exist in that code for a particular reason. Whether we agree with the level of the means bar or not, the means test is there to ensure that assistance is directed to those who need it most and that less assistance is directed to people whose need is less.  The status of the recipient, whether that recipient happens to be divorced, deserted or widowed, has nothing to do with the basic logic of the means test.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a very hard kind of decision in this case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;creates the need for taking decisions, and the formulation of the test itself as read out by Deputy Woods gives us the means of doing it. We may agree or disagree about the level of the means test and the way in which means other than social welfare payments are taken into account, but that is not an argument about the logic of the means test itself.</P>
      <P>The proviso requires the court to be satisfied that adequate and proper provision, having regard to the circumstances, will be made for any dependent spouse, and so on.  The circumstances there would obviously include, first of all, any property; secondly, any lump sum payments that might be made; thirdly, any provision that could be made for maintenance; and, fourthly, any other rights or assets that either one of the spouses or particularly the dependent spouse might have.  Therefore it would seem to be clear that in a case where there is no property &mdash; those are the cases Deputy Woods was talking about &mdash; and there is no argument about the disposition of property rights between the spouses, it would be incumbent on the court to have regard to what the entitlement of the spouses, either jointly or separately, would be under the social welfare code, and that would clearly be comprehended in the reference to having regard to the circumstances.</P>

    <P>I am not sure what Deputy Woods meant by the situation where a mother has left and the father has to maintain the children.  One of the things the court would have to look at where there are children of the marriage is what to do about the family home.  We must conclude that there would be circumstances in which, having regard to the circumstances, as it is enjoined to do by the terms of the constitutional provision, the court will decide that the family home should be handed over to the spouse who had and would maintain custody of the children.  That family home which had been the home of the family based on marriage would now become the family home of one of the spouses and the children of that marriage.  I do not see any <Col N="1924" /> possible confusion about that nor can I see how that in any way casts doubt on what the family home of the other ex-spouse would be in the event that that person went elsewhere and founded a new family.  The family home is the place where the family ordinarily resides, and if one ex-spouse went off and left what was the original family home and set up in another residence and had a family there, then it is perfectly clear that that second place would be the family home of the second family.  In any case, if, as would seem likely in those circumstances, the court had made an order determining the ownership of the first family home, there would be no further room for doubt about where the family home of the other spouse and children of the first family was.  Therefore, I cannot see any need for confusion or doubt on that point.  I hope, therefore, that it will not come up again during this debate because I see no reason for it to do so.</P>
    <P>I am tempted to touch on a great many other points, and I am sure other matters will arise during the rest of the debate. The final point I want to make now, which again has been raised here, is that it has been suggested that the requirement to make provision under the social welfare code for cases where there is not enough in the assets and property the court has to look at under the terms of this proviso will result in an extra cost to the State.  It is clear that in some cases there may be cost to the State.  I pointed out last Friday afternoon that equally there are some cases where an existing cost to the State might come to an end.</P>
    <P>We have deserted wives who now are not in a position to re-marry even though they may be already legally separated from their husbands.  There is no extra cost if we continue a provision at the same level for those wives after they have become divorced if at the moment of divorce the court is in a position to allocate to her either property or income from the spouse who has departed.  Then, other things being equal, there is reduction in the cost to the State if a separated or deserted spouse finds herself or himself entering into a second marriage with <Col N="1925" /> somebody else who can provide support or can assist in providing for support. There also there is a reduction in the requirement for the State to help.  Therefore, it is by no means necessarily the case that divorce would create a new demand on the State even where there is not a great deal of property or income. To suggest that the extra cost could amount to anything like some of the figures that have been thrown around here in the last week or so is, if you will permit the hyperbole, Sir, absurd.</P>

      <P>Let us look at the possibility. Take the figure of £200 million.  If you were to say that there was some reason for believing that the cost to the State would be £200 million per annum I do not know how many divorces you would have to have as costing the State say even £20,000 a year in order to amount up to £200 million.  That amount divided by £20,000 is 10,000 divorces a year.</P>

      <P>That is not at all a reason for believing that the costs could reach that kind of level.  I have said, <i>pace</i> Deputy Haughey and Deputy Woods, in the context of the legislation that will follow this that our intention in relation to the family court in particular is to make a number of additional appointments to the Circuit Court bench.  We will appoint to the Circuit Court bench a number of additional judges.  I do not know what the number will be but it will not be very large and would not come to a couple of million pounds worth of judges in the <Col N="1926" /> year, if I may say so without offence to their Lordships.</P>

      <P>That is the most unworthy and contemptible interjection in this debate so far and the Deputy would have done himself a bigger favour by staying quiet.  We are dealing with a serious point, and I said that we will appoint extra judges to the Circuit Court bench to deal with family law cases, not just divorce cases.  To trivialise it by a remark like that is scandalous.  However, we will appoint a number of extra judges to the Circuit Court and I have already given the reasons for doing so at Circuit Court level.  I do not think that this will involve extra expenditure on courts.  These courts will sit separately from the other courts to deal with family law cases in the kind of privacy which we all agree they deserve.  We are certainly not talking about a requirement of several million pounds per year to fund these courts.  If we are talking about allegations that the cost of this will be hundreds of millions of pounds per year, it must be on the basis of what will be paid out to people who, because of lack of income, have to rely on the State.  It is patently absurd &mdash; I say that without the slightest hesitation &mdash; to claim that the cost could be in the region of £50 million to £200 million per year.  That is plucking figures from the air without the slightest foundation for them.</P>
      <P>I have no doubt that other points will arise during the course of this debate to which I will want to reply but I wanted to deal comprehensively with points which Deputy Woods raised today, some of which I answered last Friday afternoon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to deal with only one aspect of this matter but, before doing so, the public should clearly understand that the interpretations and assumptions of the Minister in connection with this Bill have no legal standing.  If the amendment is passed the provisions of the Bill and the courts' interpretation of them are the only things that will matter.  It will not be of any assistance to <Col N="1927" /> people who may bring cases in respect of this matter to quote what the Minister said and to assume that that is the legal position.</P>
      <P>The Minister said on a number of occasions that a very restricted form of divorce will be introduced here.  He made the point that the court must be satisfied that all the conditions in Part II are fulfilled before a divorce can be granted.</P>
      <P>While this is all very fine in theory, we must remember that in practice it can be quite different as is the case in other countries where divorce was introduced.  In most countries the provisions in Part II of our Bill have been introduced and during the divorce debate in Britain in 1969 people who spoke on this matter, who sincerely believed that the conditions laid down here or similar conditions would ensure that divorce would be restricted, found to their cost shortly afterwards that the situation was totally different.  The detailed provisions of that Bill were warmly welcomed in the British Parliament by the National Marriage Guidance Council, but two years later they revised their opinion because they found that it was impossible to operate the various provisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as the four conditions laid down here are concerned, the first is the major and basic one, that the marriage has failed.  If that condition is accepted the others fall into place, although it may take a bit longer because of the fact that they have to be dealt with.  The third condition is that there is no reasonable possibility of reconciliation between the parties to the marriage, which was more or less taken from the Divorce Act of 1969.  The people who spoke on the measure in the British Parliament expected that this would be of very considerable assistance in the sense that every effort would be made to effect a reconciliation between the two parties.  After a short time, however, it was recognised that there was no reality in it.  Nowadays when two people come to court they are asked if there is any reasonable possibility of effecting a reconciliation.  If one says that <Col N="1928" /> there is not the judge simply says that he cannot do anything further.</P>
    <P>In 1973 a special procedure was introduced where, if there was agreement between the two people concerned, whereby one applied for divorce and the other was notified but did not respond, it was assumed that the marriage had broken down and the judge granted a decree.  Neither of the spouses needed to attend the court as they were informed by post that the decree had been granted.</P>
    <P>The fourth point is to ensure that any other condition prescribed by law has been complied with.  The Government in their White Paper stated that they proposed to bring in legislation insisting that there must be a period of five years' separation before a person can apply for divorce.  We are all aware that if the referendum is passed and the legislation is brought into operation any future Government will have the power to make the changes they wish.  The period of separation may be reduced from five years to three years, or one year or abolished altogether.  In Britain under the Divorce Act, 1969, the period was five years but in 1973 that was reduced to three years.  In 1984 not only was the period reduced to one year but if an applicant could find any other reason for getting a divorce he or she could apply to the court before the year had elapsed.</P>
    <P>Part II of the Bill states:</P>
    <P>the court may in accordance with law grant a dissolution of the marriage provided that the court is satisfied that adequate and proper provision having regard to the circumstances will be made for any dependent spouse and for any child of or any child who is dependent on either spouse.</P>
    <P>We have had a long discussion about the provisions of the Succession Act and I should like to emphasise again that the divorced wife will lose all her rights under that Act.  I am sure all Members accept that the vast majority of people here are either PAYE workers, small farmers or unemployed and that they are all finding it difficult to live on their present incomes.  If any of them apply to a court it <Col N="1929" /> is obvious that after a five year separation they will not be capable of making provision; a husband will not be capable of making provision for his wife and family. Therefore, this will fall to be dealt with by the State.</P>
    <P>The Minister accused Deputy Woods of getting involved in the numbers game when the Deputy asked what level the breakdowns in marriage should reach before a Bill was brought in to deal with divorce.  Deputy Woods did not say that but I must make the point that if divorce is introduced here the number of breakdowns will escalate.  I do not think anybody believes that 50 marriages out of every 100 in America would break down, that more than 40 marriages in every 100 in Britain would break down or that there would be an escalation in the North of Ireland from a figure in 1970 of one marriage in every 40 to one marriage in every six 13 years later if those countries did not have divorce legislation.</P>
    <P>In the event of divorce being introduced here, I am certain that a similar pattern will develop and that will cost the State a considerable amount of money. The basic element in all this is that the marriage must have failed.  That is subjective. If a person goes to court and says, &ldquo;my marriage has failed&rdquo;, I cannot see how a court can decide that the marriage has not failed.  That person can then file for divorce even though the other spouse may not want divorce for a variety of reasons such as religious principles or a desire to ensure that he or she continues to have rights under the law.  The problem will increase and the number of divorces will escalate.</P>
    <P>In Britain and other countries where similar conditions were introduced the intention at the outset was that this should be a judicial rather than administrative procedure.  In other words, the legislators did not want divorces granted simply by stamping a decree.  Although the procedure in those countries appears to be judicial at present it is, in effect, administrative.  Where there is agreement one spouse makes an application for divorce and, if the other spouse does not respond, the judge grants the decree <Col N="1930" /> which is delivered by post.  The Minister is claiming that the conditions in the Bill will ensure that divorce will be of a restrictive nature but that has not worked in other countries.  I have no doubt that it will not work here and that we will have divorce on demand.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an old saying and a very true one that children or fools should not meddle with edged tools.  It is my view that the people will be very slow to allow anybody to tamper with a Constitution they cherish so much. If any other matter was being debated here it would pale into insignificance in comparison to the importance of changing the Constitution, the rules of the country.  Changing the Constitution does not happen every day or in every country. Such a move should only take place when there is a grave emergency and necessity. There is no emergency or great necessity now but the fundamental rights of the people, the essence of democracy, are being challenged.  The Constitution under which we live is about to be altered to remove the ban on divorce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I put it sincerely to the Minister that experience has shown that, where the ban on divorce is removed, the numbers of marriage breakdowns escalate.  In the event of either partner going to court and saying the marriage has failed, what machinery will the courts have to investigate that failure?  The only evidence the judge will have is that given by one of the partners to the effect that the marriage has failed.  What will the court have at its disposal to prove otherwise?  Will witnesses be called?  What assistance will the courts get in deciding this issue?  Naturally, on the evidence given by one of the partners to the effect that the marriage had failed the judge will base his judgment. It is my view that this will be the most liberal form of divorce in the world. The Minister is being told that time and again by some of his own political friends. I should like to be classed as one of those. He is being told by theologians, experts, those who have already the experience, <Col N="1931" /> but they are all wrong and he appears to be right.</P>
    <P>Time will tell that this will be the most liberal form of divorce in the world and the most dangerous form because it will be simple to obtain.  Every single marriage of the 665,000 will be at risk where they are not at risk today.  That is why the majority of those married couples will not buy a pig in a bag in relation to this constitutional change.  It would put every home, every family, every married couple at risk.  We must tell the people the truth.  We are telling them what we believe or what we want them to believe. We must put the facts before them. Danger and disaster hang over every marriage once the constitutional ban on divorce is removed.  There may be marriages that will resist the danger.  There is now a barrier keeping marriages together, which has successfully done so with the exception of 6 per cent.  The percentage of marriages which have broken down is very small compared with the 94 per cent which are functioning well and properly.</P>
    <P>On 30 July 1985, the Leader of the House made a statement here to the effect that in view of certain parliamentary reforms he was going to arrange that every Bill introduced would be accompanied by a financial memorandum giving the cost of the Bill and of the legislation. Is it possible that we are changing the Constitution without having made any estimate of the cost?  Have we not gone to the trouble of finding that out?  This is not an ordinary Bill; it is a change of the rules.  Surely it is the one occasion on which the Leader of the House should have seen to it that hand in hand with the Bill and the legislation there were accurately assessed costings, but that has not been done.</P>
    <P>A few moments ago the Minister said he does not like figures being bandied about, taken at random and used.  He referred to £200 million and a variety of other figures, wondering how those who use those figures arrived at them.  I want to put it on record very briefly that you may take the population of the United <Col N="1932" /> Kingdom where it costs £1 billion to deal with their divorce problems, side payments and so forth.  Compare that with our population, and divide one into the other and you will very quickly reach a figure somewhere in the region of £50 million and £70 million per year.  The Minister for Social Welfare went to great pains last Friday to explain that all the social welfare benefits necessary will be available to the victims of divorce.  Where will this additional £50 million or £70 million come from when at present unemployment assistance, unemployment benefits and even old age pensions in my constituency are being reduced?  If the finance is not available to pay the full present rates of social welfare payments where will the extra money needed because of divorce come from?  That has not been explained to the public.</P>
    <P>All who cast their votes in the referendum for the removal of the ban on divorce will be tightening the noose around their necks as taxpayers.  They will be handcuffing, blindfolding and gagging themselves and tying their ankles in knots.  That is what they will be doing if they do not ask questions about the costs involved.  That is the question that members of the Coalition Government are avoiding.  I am not saying the Opposition are any better at giving us the facts, but it is not their responsibility.  It is the responsibility of the Coalition Government. When the rules are being changed, the Government should tell the people the costs and, where these extraordinary sums will be required, where they will be found.</P>
    <P>I do not think the ban on divorce will be removed because, like most Deputies, I have my ear close to the ground, but if the ban were removed it would mean the door would be open for divorce, obtained simply and easily by telling a judge there is a breakdown in the marriage and no hope of reconciliation.  If in five to 20 years' time this House is comprised of members with the same mentality as the Minister for Justice and the Ministers for Health and Social Welfare, where will the people find themselves?  What will become of our values which have been cherished by generation after generation, <Col N="1933" /> and which are about to be smashed up now if the people are sufficiently foolish to allow it?  We cannot speak too strongly about this changing of the Constitution. We should be protecting the Constitution and teaching its kernel points to our young people, instead of taking pieces out of it to suit the permissiveness of the present times.</P>
    <P>The one piece of advice I can give to the Coalition is to tell the truth in relation to what is at stake.  The stability of every marriage in this country is at stake.  That has been said outside this House by people not concerned with or interested in politics.  The stability of marriage and the rocking of the foundations of the family as we know it are what are at stake.  There is also the prohibitive costs which will smash this country overnight. I want to say this.  The 1977 manifesto of the former Taoiseach, Mr. Lynch, will again fade into pale insignificance in comparison to the cost of this.  That is why his manifesto almost broke the country, if it did not break it, but most certainly the costs involved in the removal of the ban on divorce would smash this country financially.</P>
    <P>The final point I want to make is on the question of placing the facts before the people and telling them these truths between now and the end of June.  There are many ways in which this can be done: the reading of the debates in this House and listening attentively to the speeches of the Divorce Action Group and the Anti-Divorce Action Group.  I want to submit to you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle and I wish to ask you as a custodian of the rights and privileges of Members of this House to actively interest yourself in this matter which I am raising.  I wish to ask the Ceann Comhairle and the Leas-Cheann Comhairle of this House to investigate and report as a matter of special urgency the circumstances in which the Divorce Action Group are using free postage in Oireachtas free postage envelopes to send out literature and for the calling of meetings in their campaign for divorce.</P>
    <P>The evidence is being submitted to the Clerk of Dáil Éireann.  I consider it to be <Col N="1934" /> a serious breach of the privileges of this House.  There was no Member's name connected with the postage of the circulars, but I am informed that very large numbers of Oireachtas free postage envelopes are used to further divorce propaganda and it should be ended by immediate action by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  The Garda Síochána should be requested to investigate this matter.  It is a misuse of the privileges of the Members of the Oireachtas. In addition, it is leading to fraud of the postal authorities.  Free postage to promote divorce is a disgrace and this matter should be referred, first, to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges to meet with the least possible delay and then, to the Garda Síochána for suitable action.</P>
    <P>I feel, Sir, that in view of the seriousness of this matter it is wrong that the Divorce Action Group should be using the facilities of Members of this House to call their meetings and to further the campaign of divorce.  I am glad and happy to say that concrete evidence has been submitted to the Clerk of the Dáil.  I ask that the relevant committee meet with the least possible delay to take action to end this matter before the end of this week because it is despicable and disgraceful that the Divorce Action Group should be using the facilities of Dáil Éireann. It cannot be but to the knowledge of Members of Dáil Éireann.  I say shame on Members of the Dáil who would permit the privileges of this House to be handed over to a group of that kind for the purpose of advancing the interests of the divorce campaign.  I hope and trust that it will be fully and sincerely investigated with the least possible delay.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin North-West):</i> I would like to thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle for giving me the opportunity to make a few remarks.  I would have liked to have come in during the debate on Second Stage but, unfortunately, due to the very limited amount of time and the speed with which the Government are putting this legislation through the House I and many other Deputies were <Col N="1935" /> not afforded that opportunity.</P>
      <P>First of all, I want to refer to the fact that the Government have introduced this legislation because they feel there is a problem.  If one has a problem the first thing one does is to try to investigate why the problem is there.  I will give an example.  If any of us here this evening was ill and decided to go to a doctor, we would expect that the first thing the doctor would do is examine us, diagnose the cause of our illness and give us some drugs or medicine to cure that illness. Unfortunately, the Government, placed in the same position as the doctor, are giving us, the patients, poison.  They do not want to know what the problem is. We have to examine the problem to find the cause of marital breakdown and what is putting a strain on marriages.  Unemployment is a serious problem which has been putting a great strain on marriage in recent years.  Alcoholism is another reason why marriage is breaking down. Neither this Government nor any other Government, seem to have done anything to solve the problem of alcoholism. I am informed that we will be dealing with legislation in a few day's time to increase the hours in which alcohol will be available to people.  The Government have already given licences to restaurants to sell alcohol up to 2 a.m.</P>
      <P>These are problems the Government should be dealing with and not pushing this legislation through the Dáil.  As Deputy Flanagan rightly says, if divorce is introduced, what is it going to cost the taxpayer?  That has not been said at all.</P>
      <P>The introduction of divorce will have a devastating effect on our society.  It will increase the problem of marriage breakdown.  It is true that divorced persons will lose constitutional rights, other legal rights will be weakened and the law will shift to support the second family to the disadvantage of the first family.  This has been emphasised by a number of Deputies in this House.</P>
      <P>I want to quote from the Statement on the Government's Intentions with regard to Marriage, Separation and Divorce, where it states in paragraph 2:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1936" /> The purpose of this Statement is to describe in board terms the type of divorce legislation which the Government would submit for the consideration of the Oireachtas if the proposal being put in the Referendum is approved by the People.  That legislation will be designed to ensure that divorce will be available only in limited circumstances...</P>
    <P>Once divorce is introduced in any country it cannot be limited.  This has been proved in other countries.  Deputy Faulkner emphasised only a few minutes ago what has happened in England.  That is very true.  When divorce was introduced in England a five year period had to elapse before a case could be brought before the courts.  In that case the details of how the marriage had broken down would have to be given.  It would then be entirely up to the judge to decide the grounds for divorce.  Pressure has been put on the British Government to reduce that period and Deputy Faulkner has outlined that.  What has happened in recent years is that a number of cases are before the one divorce court.  All the clerk of the court does is call out the names of the spouses and after each case the judge asks is there any objection.  There could be as many as 40 to 50 cases before any court.</P>
    <P>The latest thing on foot in Britain is to have divorce on demand.  Pressure is being put on the British Government to introduce a system where the person who wants divorce can make an application, the same as one would make an application for a pension or anything else, to a Government Department, where the details will be put on the application form and where the person in the Department will make a decision as to whether the divorce will be granted or not.</P>
    <P>The introduction of divorce law in any country makes marriage obsolete.  It changes the concept of marriage.  It is not longer for life.  The legal fact is that divorce law gives to every person who marries the right to marry again under certain conditions.  Such conditions may <Col N="1937" /> be very limited at first but from the history of divorce in other countries the conditions become wider and wider.  The logical outcome is that eventually divorce is granted without substantial conditions. A person entering marriage has the right to get married again so there is no such legal concept as an indissoluble marriage. The legal concept and the position of marriage change.  The law supports what is a temporary contractual relationship. Marriage as a lifetime relationship is legally obsolete.  This, in turn, brings about a social and psychological conditioning. We can see the process at work in countries where divorce laws have been in existence long enough for a pattern to have emerged.</P>
    <P>If divorce is granted as a civil right, how can such a right be denied to one person and given to another?  When divorce laws were introduced in England the first divorce law was for husbands only on grounds of adultery.  In 1923 the Divorce Act included wives on grounds of adultery.  The 1937 Act included desertion, cruelty and insanity.  The 1969 Divorce Act included grounds for divorce after irretrievable breakdown of the marriage. The application for divorce by one partner against the wishes of the other was allowed after a period of separation. In the United States all but one State have no fault divorce legislation.</P>
    <P>The prevailing opinion among lawyers and legislators is that a no fault based divorce law is harmful and vindictive to spouses concerned.  It serves no purpose. Therefore the international trend will be towards a no fault divorce system.  I will give an example of a pattern that followed the introduction of divorce in England. In 1920 there were 2,953 divorces in England; in 1935, 4,784; in 1945, 16,075; in 1961, 19,000; in 1972, 110,700; and in 1981 there were over 200,000 divorces.  When divorce law was introduced in England it did nothing to help marriage breakdown.  In fact, it had the opposite effect.  In 1977 the European divorce rate was one in every five.  For all who accept the teaching of the Catholic <Col N="1938" /> Church divorce with the right to remarry is not permitted.  In fact, it is impossible.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin North-West):</i> If a Catholic partner obtains a divorce, under the law of the Catholic Church he or she is not permitted to remarry.  Divorce is a claim by the State to be able, through civil law in the courts, to dissolve a valid marriage.  This leaves couples free to remarry.  A Catholic marriage is a sacrament. It does not permit spouses who are married in a Catholic Church to remarry. The bond uniting married couples is a sacramental bond which comes from God alone and no person can pull that bond asunder.  No legislative enactment can dissolve a valid marriage and leave the partners free to marry again.  Remarriage of a civil divorced person is not a real marriage in the eyes of God.</P>
      <P>This debate raises the question of public welfare and the common good.  It raises the question of public and private morality.  The Catholic Church's stand on matters concerning law and morality has been stated frequently.  It has been consistent in all debates on divorce legislation. The Catholic Church have never asked that their doctrines should be enshrined in law as they recognise that morality and civil law do not coincide. Nevertheless, when moral issues which affect society are raised, such as divorce, the bishops and clergy have the responsibility to offer moral guidance to Catholics to help them inform their consciences in respect of their moral responsibilities.</P>
      <P>Most religions regard the concept of marriage as sacred and special.  The Catholic religion sees it as a calling, a vocation and a sacrament.  This approach is a guarantee against marriage breakdown.  The State must support that concept of marriage as a lifelong commitment.  I will quote from the former Minister for Health and Social Welfare in 1973:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We in Ireland esteem the family as a source of many social and personal values.  We believe the family to be the <Col N="1939" /> basic unit of society.  It is not enough, however, merely to state the value we place in the family as an institution. We must go beyond that statement and deliberately create policies and programmes which reflect the value in humane terms.</P>
    <P>That statement very much contradicts the present policies of his party.  I wonder if he was here now would he agree with these policies.</P>
    <P>When the Pope was in Ireland he placed great emphasis on the family.  He stated in Limerick that the family had been Ireland's greatest spiritual resource and the greatest spiritual influence on Ireland in the history of the world.  This has been due to a great degree to the homes of Ireland.  He said, may the Irish always support marriage through personal commitment and through social and legal action.</P>

      <P>Listening to Deputy Flanagan I thought we had reached the stage where we would get divorce through the post.  He said 94 per cent of Irish marriages are at risk.  This casts a terrible aspersion on Irish marriages.  I want to refer to the Catholic concept of marriage and other concepts.  My colleague, Deputy Shatter, will have a very deep concept of it from his religious point of view.  St. Paul said that when people are happily married it is not a union of two people but the union became one. That is a lovely idea of a happy marriage. I am sure many people in Ireland experience that kind of marriage.  Any legislation passed by this House will not put that kind of union at risk because it is a permanent union.  There is no doubt in my mind that a number of marriages have <Col N="1940" /> failed.  Whether or not divorce is introduced this will continue.  We have the problem of second unions arising from that.  If we do not address ourselves to that, the law will fall into disrepute.  I am afraid that is happening already.</P>
      <P>Deputy Flanagan said that divorce gives respectability to adultery.  I regret to have to say that it is society, in a limited way, by its behaviour that is giving respectability to adultery.  We must consider that as well.  I would not accuse Members opposite of being mischievous but I fail to understand some of their arguments, particularly about permanancy of marriage and what has happened in England and other jurisdictions.  In those jurisdictions there is no written constitution. An eminent member of the Bench here once told me that a Labour Attorney General in Britain, Sir Hartley Shawcross, once said that if the British Parliament passed a law that all blue eyed babies were to be slaughtered at birth, so be it.  If we passed that kind of law it would be struck down immediately by the Supreme Court.</P>
      <P>We must be mindful of that during this debate.  I do not think Deputies Faulkner and Barrett were conscious of the restrictions our Constitution puts on statute law.  Every law we pass must comply with the Constitution and its restrictions.  This Schedule is putting to the people a very restrictive measure.  I am glad the Minister pointed out the protections for children in marriage.  The Minister clearly told us that the children of first marriages will have the same constitutional right as heretofore.  If a country has not got a written constitution it has to operate by convention.  We are most fortunate to have a very detailed written Constitution with which our statute law must conform.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will refer briefly to what the Minister said about nullity.  I am pleased the Government have decided to review the law of nullity and broaden that law, as recommended by The Law Reform Commission.  I do not subscribe to the idea that annulment is divorce under another name, but we must be honest with each other.  I have never heard of a happily married couple going to the <Col N="1941" /> church or the civil courts to test the validity of their marriage because they were worried about it.  They go to either court only when there is a breakdown in their marriage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. D. Andrews Mr. D. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Listening to the most recent contributions on both sides I wonder if Deputies on both sides appreciated that we are a republican parliamentary assembly and not an assembly of any Church.  Do we realise, no matter what views we hold, that we are not here as moral standard bearers but as legislators on behalf of everybody?  As I said here frequently, and as recently as November when we discussed the report of the joint committee, we legislate for everybody, whether they are Catholic, Protestant and so on.</P>
      <P>I am not apologising for being a Catholic, but I often wonder where Deputies speeches come from, whether some Deputies are being &ldquo;used&rdquo;.  It would horrify me to think that that is happening because Deputies should come in here to lead, not to be led &mdash; they should make up their own minds, having given serious consideration to the serious issues that confront us every day.</P>
      <P>It is unfortunate that there appears to be an element of politics intruding itself into the debate.  I strongly urge that the Fine Gael and Labour Parties opposite would be very careful in the manner in which they campaign.  I have already said that they should not campaign, that this matter should be outside politics.  It is not an issue for political campaigning.  If we present ourselves at doors during this campaign as Members of the Oireachtas, we will be presenting ourselves as politicians and we should not try to get away from that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I am saying is that the Government are making a very serious mistake in campaigning for this issue.  I appreciate that as a Government they have to address themselves to the people, but in campaigning as political parties they are making a mistake.  I suggest that the Taoiseach should address the nation on television and radio on one or two occasions <Col N="1942" /> and that the Government, as distinct from the political parties, should issue literature setting out the pros and cons of the amendment.  That is how the campaign should be conducted.</P>
    <P>If members of Fine Gael or Labour were to call to my home &mdash; they know my views on this because I am a public representative and I do not hide my views and I am not afraid to let people know my views whether they want to know them or not &mdash; they will be treated with great courtesy.  I will remind them that this is a private moral issue, that they should not be at my door and, with the utmost courtesy, I will ask them to leave. Political parties and politicians, as part of the fabric of our society, are entitled to proclaim their views on matters other than this issue.  That would be my reaction to visits from members of any political party.</P>
    <P>A number of reasonable and responsible reporters have suggested to me that in some way the thrust of the original decision of the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party has changed.  That is not so.  The Leader of my party has indicated his views on the subject, as he is entitled to.  Our spokesman on Justice also has expressed his views on the matter, as he is entitled to.  Deputies O'Hanlon, Flynn and Faulkner have expressed their views.  Quite clearly they are against the proposal of the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support the motion that was moved last night by Deputy Wilson.  It has been two years since the collapse of Irish Shipping.  There have also been difficulties in B &amp; I and traumatic events occurred in November <Col N="1944" /> 1984 in respect of Irish Shipping.  That was probably the biggest disaster and the greatest mistake made by the Government and that is saying something for a Government who have made some major mistakes.</P>
      <P>The Government liquidated a semi-State company that was closely linked with the public service.  For decades Irish Shipping had been regarded as an arm of the State and the company made considerable money for the Exchequer except for a few years.  However, in November 1984 the State liquidated Irish Shipping and left the country without a strategic deep sea fleet.  That tragedy still haunts the State and the liquidation process will go on for years.  It is reliably learned that the liquidation will cost close on £100 million when the final results are known.  At one time the Minister told the House that a sum of £144 million over five years could save Irish Shipping.  The Government were given two options by the management whom I have never supported in the five or six debates in this House because clearly they made errors. However, they put two decisions to the Government.  One was to invest £27 million in November 1984 and the other was to take the legal solution and force the company into liquidation.  The Government panicked.  They did not consider all the implications and they did not carry out any feasibility or viability studies. They liquidated the company.  They left the country with no fleet and many skilled and trained workers were made redundant</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the Government have not broken the spirit of the people who were formerly in Irish Shipping and who continually lobby Members of this House.  All they want to do is to restore the pride the country had in the deep sea fleet.  Two years after the liquidation the Minister continues to say it is a matter for the liquidator and that his proposals are in the Green Paper and that is not much use to the country or to the people who were in Irish Shipping.  It is very difficult to see any justification for the Minister's attitude.  Our country is seen in a different light abroad.  Time and again at <Col N="1945" /> international conferences and seminars people refer to the fact that a semi-State company was liquidated.  Irish Shipping were not involved with any racketeers, with business tycoons or with people who were in the business to make a quick buck.  The State sold out one of its own subsidiaries in one fell swoop.  It was an appalling decision and there is an obligation on us in Opposition to try to force the Government to reverse their decision and try to retrieve something out of the disaster they created.</P>
    <P>The Minister does not like to talk about the matter and he tries to keep well away from it.  However, when he has to talk about it he just attacks the Opposition. Deputy Wilson has discussed this matter throughout the country and the Minister's response to that is that Deputy Wilson wants to re-establish a semi-State company at a cost of hundreds of millions of pounds.  Deputy Wilson's answer last night and on other occasions has been that it would cost very little for the State to purchase the <i>Irish Spruce.</i> By doing that we could pick ourselves up and give some hope to the workers but unfortunately it seems that even that will not be done.  The Minister has no real proposals to offer.  He tells the House that the proposals and recommendation of experts are part of yet another White Paper, the inference being that the many White Papers which are gathering dust on the shelves may be taken down at a future date and considered.</P>
    <P>The Minister has tried to claim much credit for the position in B &amp; I but all of us know that improvements in that area are more to do with the work and the loyal service of trade unionists.  They held the company together last year even though they suffered many taunts.  The same applies to the Dublin Port and Docks Board but that is another matter.</P>
    <P>In his amendment the Minister refers to the B &amp; I Company.  As Deputy Wilson pointed out last night, there are dangerous and worrying sections in the relevant Bill, particularly with regard to the remuneration of staff.  The Bill states that in regard to remuneration or allowances <Col N="1946" /> for expenses to be paid to officers or the terms and conditions of such officers, the company shall have regard to Government or nationally agreed guidelines. That seems to be taking the B &amp; I Company out of the hands of the controlling body who have been there for years and into the hands of the Minister.  This stems from the Government White Paper which says that in future all semi-State bodies or related bodies will be controlled directly by the State.</P>
    <P>All such organisations have house agreements, rather like the conciliation and arbitration process.  It is a total disaster to interfere where there are strong house agreements and where remuneration, conditions and the working relationship of management and workers are laid down.  Such interference is unwelcome and unnecessary and will cause problems in the future.  Whether it be Aer Lingus, the ESB or any of the other semi-State bodies, both management and unions are clearly stating that what the Government are proposing is to the detriment of the companies concerned.  I ask that it be reconsidered and that recognition be given to what Deputy Wilson said last night.  As a result of this detrimental legislation more State companies will close. It is being used as a vehicle for further closures.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not interrupt the Deputy.  The Opposition are indulging in political point-scoring on what I regard as a serious matter.  They bring in motion after motion seeking to spend hundreds of millions of pounds of taxpayers' money without being in the least concerned about where the money will come from. The decision to liquidate Irish Shipping was not taken lightly.  I regret the fact that such a decision had to be made particularly for those involved in the company. The decisions taken by the board of the company during the period 1979 to 1981 meant disastrous losses for Irish Shipping and brought down the company. That company saw us through difficult times since the foundation of the State and we would have liked to see the company continue.  In February 1984 the company received £12 million and they would have needed a further £20 million to bring them to the end of 1985 with the possibility of incurring a £150 million loss. No Minister has the right to use taxpayers' money in that way.  There must be some level of accountability.  The charter <Col N="1948" /> agreements made with the Japanese company were disastrous.</P>
      <P>Irish Shipping developed at a time when we were becoming economically independent.  Most countries wanted to be independent in every aspect.  Things have changed now and we have the EC. It is a major trading area and it is in that context that we should formulate shipping policy for the future.  We do not have sufficient money to invest in a shipping company to the extent that would be necessary.</P>
      <P>Last night the Minister set out in a fair way what Government policy is, what EC policy is and exactly what the Government are doing.  In the Green Paper on shipping policy it is stated that during the first half of 1980 the world shipping industry experienced its worst depression for 50 years.  This was caused by a substantial increase in shipping tonnage to cater for a boom in demand which did not materialise.  It states that the industry has not yet recovered from this depression. The last three years have seen worldwide heavy losses by shipowners, bankruptcy of shipping companies, debt rescheduling, deferred delivery of new vessels and an increased laying up of vessels. The supply of world shipping is still under-utilised to a considerable extent notwithstanding some recent improvements in world trade.</P>
      <P>The Opposition have almost demanded that the Government invest more taxpayers' money in a proposition which can only incur losses.  I do not accept what Deputy Wilson or Deputy Ahern said in connection with the liquidation of Irish Shipping, that is, that it has done untold damage to the deep sea sector.  The market is in recession and the forecast is not good.  Conditions may have improved as a result of the reduction in oil prices but how long will that last?  The position could change very quickly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Not only is it a problem for us, but all the EC countries must look at their own areas.  Last night Deputy Wilson gave various statistics from a number of EC countries.  They are revising their plans with regard to the deep sea freight area. The EC share of tonnage has declined <Col N="1949" /> considerably since 1980.  That gave rise to the necessity for a well thought out Community policy.  It has now been finalised and is being discussed by the Commission.  Hopefully we will have due protection as far as the transportation and importation of goods are concerned.</P>
    <P>We are all concerned about the number of jobs which were lost.  There is much talk about the amount of social welfare paid to those who lost their jobs.  The argument is made that, if they were still employed, the State would save that amount of social welfare but I do not accept that theory.  In any job creation programme there must be a certain level of profitability.  Without profitability, without wealth creation, it is not sustainable, and neither is any freight area, whether it be in shipping or in the air.</P>
    <P>They are all undergoing change.  They are all meeting with competition from other areas and there are people in the market area investigating market trends, trying to take a new share of the market, and unless one can keep up to date with that, one will not survive.  We cannot keep pouring taxpayers' money into any area, shipping or otherwise.  The taxpayer is demanding reductions in taxation.  I do not know where the additional funds are going to come from to put money into Irish Shipping.  It would take another £5 per year from every taxpayer to keep Irish Shipping afloat and there would be another £5 for a number of other interests which would demand the same consideration. If we were to pursue that type of policy to its logical conclusion then there should be no unemployment in the country. I do not accept that.</P>
    <P>I would like to compliment the Department of Communications, the Minister and the Minister of State on the manner in which this whole situation is being handled.  There are difficulties created in all sorts of employment.  Factories have closed down not only during the period of this Government but that of other Governments too.  Listening to the people on the other side of the House, one would imagine that no factory ever closed down when they were in office.  I <Col N="1950" /> had the experience of a closure where about 1,000 people in my own city lost their jobs.  People were led to believe there was considerable wealth to be generated from the Fieldcrest complex, but that went.  We did not expect to stand idly by and let things happen.  We had to go out and entice in others.  I support the view that the whole question of Irish Shipping and a deep sea fleet should be examined, but in the context of the whole European scene.</P>
    <P>I am happy with the way the Minister is approaching this whole issue.  I reject the assertion by the Opposition that this Government are to blame for the collapse of Irish Shipping.  The decision of the Government was not lightly taken.  The Opposition know that, and if they were in the same position, they would have had to take the same decision.  But in Opposition they do not have to make those decisions.  The committee set up to look at the transport policy confirmed the need to maintain a strategic fleet of deep sea vessels for the transport of essential supplies in an emergency.  That policy has not changed.  The estimated total cargo of 198,000 tonnes dead weight is now decreasing.  On strategic grounds, there was an overhelming case for the provision of incentives for the maintenance and development of the Irish fleet. That policy has not changed.  But what has changed is that Irish Shipping closed down because of abuse and badly researched decisions that were taken that put the company into receivership.  It was not the fault of the Minister for Communications. It was not the fault of the Government. It was a Fianna Fáil appointed body that must take the greatest share of the blame for that debacle.</P>

      <P>I would like to support this amendment in the name of the Minister. Since I became a Member of this House quite a short time ago Private Members' Time seems to have become nothing more than an opportunity for the Opposition to explore and manipulate various interest groups to the detriment of the Government of the day.  It is one of <Col N="1951" /> the things that makes the general public sceptical about politicians.</P>

      <P>The cynical fashion in which the Opposition have responded to interest groups from time to time has given further credence to the opinion in the minds of the public that politicians merely manipulate various interest groups for their own good when and if it suits them.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>Everybody is of the opinion that it was unfortunate that the Irish Shipping debacle should have ended the way it did.  Everybody identifies with the unfortunate employees of Irish Shipping. Everybody accepts that it was not those employees on the high seas who were responsible for the failure of Irish Shipping. Everybody equally accepts that they have provided a sterling service on behalf of the Irish nation down through the years.  It is also unfortunate that we in this House were not in a position to record all tributes to them in a monetary fashion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Be that as it may, it must also be accepted that there are people in this House, both in Government and in Opposition who, regardless of what they might say at this time, knew for quite a considerable time before the whole question of Irish Shipping came to the fore, that all was not well with Irish Shipping. They are the people who are now criticising the Government while knowing in their own hearts and souls that, when they had the responsibility for the various offices within this State, they did not take decisions which should have been taken <Col N="1952" /> and which would have changed the direction of that company at that time and which, if taken, would have ensured that at least when the fall came it would not have been as great as it was.</P>
    <P>It is hypocritical for any politician to claim that the Government let down the people and the nation by allowing the loss of a prestigious company such as Irish Shipping.  Of course it would be wonderful to have the prestige of a deep sea fleet if we could afford it.  Unfortunately, we were in no position to afford it.  Again, that was not the fault of the people on the high seas.  It was the fault of the people who were given office to take decisions within the company and failed to take decisions which were in the best interests of the company at that time. This is not the first company this has happened to and it will not be the last. But it does teach us one lesson.  That is that in semi-State companies we in this House are ultimately held responsible when anything goes wrong but we seldom get credit if things go right.  In future when things appear to be going wrong, that is when the decisions should be taken.  It is then that the changes should be made, and it is then that people should face facts and admit that perhaps they are not going in the right direction and that changes should be made.  If they are not made, the right action should be taken.</P>
    <P>In this case, unfortunately, when action time came it was too late to salvage anything.  Undoubtedly the responsibility rests with a number of people.  It is very easy for us on this side of the House to blame the Opposition entirely.  It would also be equally easy for the people on that side of the House to blame the Government.  It would be easy for both sides of this House to come together and agree that the management of Irish Shipping were solely at fault.  Yet we, as a monitoring body, did not take the action we could and should have taken so the fault rests with us all.  It also serves as a reminder to us in regard to the effectiveness of the Oireachtas in general, because that could be repeated in other areas, and we hope we have learned our lesson.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1953" /> I was not very impressed by the fact that Opposition speakers were drawing analogies between ICI and other companies, but Government Deputies could draw an analogy with the Talbot deal and others.  That does not mean that what was done to solve one problem should be applied across the board.  It must always be remembered that circumstances differ and so do remedies.  There are no grounds for suggesting that what applied to ICI also applied to Irish Shipping.  The circumstances were totally different and the analogy is not well founded.</P>
    <P>I would like to deal now with the reasons for the problems in Irish Shipping. Everyone knows the world recession which hit every industry, servicing and manufacturing.  For that reason one would presume that a shipping company or any freight company would take account of the changing circumstances, and particularly the lower freight rates. Obviously in this case they did not do that.  They were lured into an agreement with Eastern businessmen who were sharper than they were and Irish Shipping were lured into an arena where they could not possibly win.  The Opposition are suggesting that the Irish taxpayer should also be lured into that arena to bale out those who were trying to shore up the interests of the Eastern businessmen.  In my view the Irish taxpayer owes no such debt to those people and he should never be asked to shore up any deal which has gone wrong.  This House would have been very wrong if it had agreed to go down that particular road.</P>
    <P>Very emotive and emotional stories have been heard in this House about what happened to the various ships which were berthed around the world.  That makes good publicity, good copy, good radio and television, but it does not deal with reality, which was that the Irish taxpayer could be asked to pay something in the region of £200 million or more to ensure that the investments of financial interest groups outside this country were secure. I do not believe that is the job of this Government or of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Last night Deputy Kirk mentioned the <Col N="1954" /> gloom and doom that apparently emanated from this side of the House.  I do not accept that that has been the case. To the best of my knowledge, most of the gloom and doom seems to be coming from the opposite side of the House in an attempt to tell the people that, if circumstances were different, and if the position were reversed and Fianna Fáil were in Government, there would be a dramatic change in the lives of our people and the Irish economy and the world economy would automatically benefit.</P>

      <P>We then hand over control from the Oireachtas not to another institution in the State but to whatever interest group presents itself on the horizon. That is one of the problems this country has not faced up to over the last ten or 15 years in particular.  Politicians seem to be prepared to say or do anything <Col N="1955" /> that would placate any interest group.  I accept that various interest groups have valid arguments &mdash; and Irish Shipping is no exception &mdash; but I question the sincerity of the continuous pursuit of a so-called ideal on the part of the Opposition.  One of the things I dislike most about politics, and of which I have seen most in my short time in this House, is when we demean politics by pursuing that line.  Our credibility and stature as politicians is lowered by pursuing that line.  I accept that we are probably victims of the system, and I am sure if I were on the other side of the House I would be doing the same thing, although I hope I would not.  Regardless of the political consequences I hope I would have enough sense not to go down that road.</P>
      <P>As politicians we deal with young people who are very impressionable. They very often take us at our word and assume that everything we propose to do on their behalf will automatically become our policy and we will pursue it.

For instance, you can inject &mdash; a word commonly used by the Opposition when they talk about injecting funds into somebody's pocket &mdash; funds into a particular company for a short period provided it can guarantee the life of that company for a specific period.  If that cannot be done, then all we are doing is throwing away good money after bad.  We pretend we are providing jobs in lieu of social welfare by offsetting one against the other, but we cannot make that argument repeatedly.  It would be very unfortunate if the public were to accept that argument as true and accurate because it is not.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with amusement to Deputy Durkan talking about handing over control to vested interest groups.  Every voter out there is part of an interest group and as politicians, whether we like it or not, we are inclined to listen to them and we represent those people. The problem nowadays is that we are not handing over to vested interest groups; we are handing over to receivers and liquidators who cream off the huge expenses and large salaries and at the end of the day the creditors and workers get very little.  That is happening when firms go into liquidation and receivership.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the liquidation of Irish Shipping Limited through motions and Estimate debates, Members on this side of the House have made every effort to get the <Col N="1957" /> Government and the Ministers to recognise the importance of having a national deep sea shipping fleet.  The decision to liquidate Irish Shipping was high-handed and without justification.  Irish Shipping were a major company of international dimensions and importance.  For many years they made an important contribution to the economy.  They had a valuable content of employment and through Irish Shipping young Irish people had the opportunity to take up careers in the service of their own merchant navy.  It was very important to have that outlet and to give them that opportunity.</P>
    <P>In every aspect of strategic, economic and even security matters Irish Shipping were a vital part of our national resources. Deputy Wilson pointed out last night that the present climate lends itself to the Government setting about formulating a shipping policy that would lead once again to establishing a deep sea fleet of modest size.  Oil prices have dropped 50 per cent and ships are available on the world market at reasonable prices at present.  Another valuable asset, and probably the greatest reason why we should get back our shipping fleet, is the talented and outstanding Irish Shipping workers of every rank who are still available, ready and waiting for the call to serve again on the world's seas in the name of Ireland.  They had an excellent industrial relationship with the Irish Shipping management over the years and it is criminal to have such workers drawing unemployment benefit when their talents could be used to the economic advantage of this country.</P>
    <P>How much will the liquidation of Irish Shipping cost?  Does the Minister really know?  Does anyone really know?  Sources say that it would take over five years to finalise.  A figure of £170 million has been mentioned and that begs the question, could it be more than that?  Surely it would have been cheaper to hold on to Irish Shipping and restructure their operations in a more reasonable manner or maybe on a smaller scale rather than getting rid of them.  Remember it is taxpayers' money.  Deputies on the far side talked tonight about their concern for <Col N="1958" /> the taxpayer and the waste of taxpayers' money.  To have nothing to show for the expenditure of £170 million at the end of the day is nothing short of a national scandal and the greatest waste of taxpayers' money by any government of this State.</P>
    <P>The Minister and his Government panicked in calling in the liquidator.  The whole scene of Irish Shipping has become clouded in secrecy and coverups.  The people responsible for getting Irish Shipping into the financial mess have got off scot free and the liquidator, as usual, at the end of the day will have lined his pockets with outlandish fees while the workers are consigned to a miserable life on the dole queues.  The Minister must act as quickly as possible to see that a deep sea fleet of manageable size is set up again.  In comparison, Switzerland, a landlocked country, has its own thriving navy.  Surely we as an island nation must get into the same position.  The Government's decision to liquidate Irish Shipping with such haste and without any alternative plan was a mistake and they should set about formulating a policy to correct it immediately.</P>
    <P>The Minister talked last night about a European shipping policy.  Within that framework there must be a place for an Irish deep sea fleet.  We talk about a national policy in a Green Paper.  The problem with Green Papers this Government brought in in their four years in office has been that they have been brought in but they are put on a shelf in some Department never to be heard of again.  Are we to wait another ten, 15 or 20 years to have the ideas, policies and suggestions in this Green Paper implemented? The Government record to date on taking action on Green Papers is not good and if I were a member of that Government I would not be proud of it.</P>
    <P>The two Deputies on the far side of the House talked only about Irish Shipping. They made no mention of B &amp; I, ICL or Sealink.  I have an interest in ICL because they operate from Rosslare Harbour and they are the profit-making section of Irish Shipping.  In reply to a question put down recently by our spokesman, Deputy <Col N="1959" /> Wilson, regarding the purchase of ICL by an Irish interest, the Minister stated that the disposal of Irish Shipping Limited interest in Irish Continental Lines was a matter for the liquidator and he had no direct responsibility.  That is ridiculous. The Minister must have a say directly in the interest of ICL and particularly in the interest of the Irish nation. The liquidator's interest is purely financial; the Minister's interest must be in the common good and therefore, he must have an interest in what happens to ICL and who eventually acquires them.</P>
    <P>The continuation of ICL in their present format is vital to Ireland and above all to Rosslare Harbour and County Wexford in relation to on-shore and offshore employment and tourism in the south east and the country as a whole. Tourism has tremendous job potential and ICL are vital to this end.  They must be kept under Irish control.  At present they are a profit making company, and we should not allow outside multinational consortia to take them over and cream off the profits while the taxpayer pays for all this.  We must ensure that the company remain in Irish hands.</P>
    <P>We should have our own permanent sea transportation system.  Sea traffic has increased its share of the market from 41 per cent in 1973 to 50 per cent in 1984. The future of this island depends on our ability to trade and compete with our EC partners.  I notice that the Minister, Deputy Mitchell, is missing, for what reason I do not know, but I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Nealon, to ensure that ICL are kept in Irish ownership and remain on the Rosslare Harbour route. There is much concern at present about the liquidator's intentions.  Rumours abound about who is buying ICL, who is involved in ICL, who might take over ICL, who is interested in ICL.  The Minister has a duty to kill those rumours.  What is all the secrecy about?  Is there a buyer, locally or foreign based?  Has one of the major banks a vested interest in the ownership?  Tell us the truth.  Let the people know what is going on in regard to ICL.  We as taxpayers have a right to <Col N="1960" /> know and the Minister should tell us here tonight.</P>
    <P>The arrangement between B &amp; I and Sealink is causing concern at present. This non-competitive cartel arranged on the southern corridor is not in the best interests of the customer.  The monopoly has resulted already in excessive fare charges from B &amp; I and Sealink which I and the consumer, the people using the route, feel is not justified.  The customer is not satisfied.  Recently I have had numerous complaints from consumers regarding the substantial fare hike.  The Minister's responsibility is to see that the consumer is protected in such a cartel arrangement.  If this cartel are to continue then they can increase fares whenever they like.  There is no one to control them or to take charge of them.  The Minister should ensure that this type of cartel arrangement is not allowed to continue and he should keep it under observation and control.</P>
    <P>The Minister should clarify the situation in relation to Pembroke Dock because money from the State is being paid into it at present.  Some plans should be made to hand it over to interested groups because it is not right to be paying money into Pembroke Dock and getting no benefit from it.  It is also a waste of taxpayers' money.</P>
    <P>The other area which goes hand in hand with shipping concerns Rosslare Harbour and its development.  It is one of the fastest growing ports in the country but at present we have a stop-go development in the harbour.  For example, recently a customs shed was under construction but the contractor was told he would have to stop working because there was no money available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>The week after he was told to come back and to start work again. I do not know what kind of messing this is or what is going on in the Department of Finance, but in the interests of the development of Rosslare Harbour this should not be allowed to continue.  Its <Col N="1961" /> development is vital to the national interest and the Government should get on with the job as it would be money well spent.  The development and investment in Rosslare will give a sound financial return to the State and it would not be a waste of taxpayers' money.  Last year over a million passengers passed through Rosslare despite the lack of development. There has been massive development in Ringaskiddy.  I am not going to criticise that &mdash; fair play to them for getting such an investment.  However, I wish to remind the Minister that Rosslare Harbour is just as important as Ringaskiddy and that there must be massive development there also.  It is ideally situated geographically for incoming and outgoing traffic and it has had a remarkable industrial relations record over the years as there have been no strikes by the work-force.</P>
      <P>We must also take into account that County Wexford has the highest unemployment rate in the country and we look to tourism to solve some of the problems. Our greatest potential is in Rosslare Harbour and I ask the Minister to ensure that its development continues on an ongoing basis and to abandon the penny pinching policies which have existed over the last few years.  A substantial amount of money should be made available so that the development of Rosslare Harbour can be completed to benefit Wexford and the economy generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>Aontaím leis an rún atá molta ag ár urlabhraí ar an Roinn Cumarsáide:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann calls on the Government to formulate and publish a policy for Irish deep sea shipping and to declare its determination to maintain in Irish hands, adequate ferry serives to the UK and mainland Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I specifically read the motion because some speakers, for reasons best known to themselves, departed from it.  Perhaps it is because it speaks for itself and is very definite in what is required for the country.  The only thing I would add to the motion is that, in addition to providing <Col N="1962" /> and having a published policy for shipping, we should also include provision for the repair, upkeep and building of ships for the fleet mentioned in the motion.  This motion is not in the interests of one particular group but is of interest to the entire nation, and I discount the suggestion made by previous speakers that it is confined to any interested group. It is not, unless you call our population an interested group.  If that is so, I am quite happy to contribute to the motion.</P>
    <P>Irish Shipping have been dealt with my many speakers.  We are a maritime nation and it is required of us to indicate the need to formulate and publish a policy for Irish deep sea shipping and our determination to keep it in Irish hands. Irish Shipping was created in time of need by the late Seán Lemass to trade and to bring supplies to this country in difficult times.  The hauling down of the Irish flag from ships in ports around the world is the last straw &mdash; it is nothing short of a scandal, which will be to the eternal disgrace of the Government.  In hauling down our flag they abandoned staff and boats without proper consideration for either.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge the contributions of two Government Deputies from inland constituencies, but in so doing I have to say that the absence of speakers from coastal regions in unusual.  It is an indication of lack of faith in their own Government? There is something sinister in the fact that they did not contribute to the debate. One Deputy talked about being on course.  Let me remind that Deputy that we are not on any course because of the liquidation of Irish Shipping.  He talked about aims and ideals on this side of the House.  Since our foundation 60 years ago we have never had problems with our aims and ideals, because they are the same now as they were then &mdash; the benefit and economic welfare of our nation. There is no problem in regard to our sincerity and commitment to those aims and ideals.  Contrast them with the promises mentioned by the same speaker. Could he and other Members tell me about the promises which the Government <Col N="1963" /> made to the people?  What about the £9.50p offered to stay at home wives? What about the budget deficit, one of the main planks of their election propaganda in 1982?  What about foreign borrowing? When those questions are answered the people will know where the sincerity and integrity are.</P>
    <P>As a representative from a coastal county I should like to be parochial for a while.  I refer to Cork city and county.  I want to refer to where we were in times gone by and where we are now as a result of this Government, who have been in office for eight and a half years out of a total of 13 years.  Cork city and county had a number of natural characteristics which would have benefited the region when Ireland joined the EC.  We have the second largest concentration of population in the country.  We have deep, sheltered harbour facilities.  The slogan for Cork is <i>Statio bene fide carinis</i>&mdash; a well-protected harbour for ships.  That was when we had ships, but we do not have them now.  That port was also suitable for the establishment of heavy industries with products or raw materials which were most easily moved by sea. Traditionally, the lower harbour of Cork had been used by transatlantic liners, adequate proof of its ability to receive large ships.  In the sixties the first signs of moves by industries to take advantage of these facilities became apparent.  Other features of Cork harbour are its nearness to the Continent, and, indeed, its suitability for trans-Atlantic trade.  Cork was the only major port on the south coast and should have been able to attract the bulk of trade between Ireland and the Continent.</P>
    <P>In 1952 the tonnage of vessels entering Cork harbour from ports in England, the Six Counties and the Republic was 609,565 tonnes.  In 1961 this had risen to 977,883 tonnes.  The tonnage from ports other than those mentioned in 1952 was 286,194 tonnes.  In 1961 this figure had risen to more that one million tonnes. Clearly Cork harbour was developing trade rapidly with countries other than <Col N="1964" /> Great Britain even before the prospect of free trade with Europe.</P>
    <P>Complementing Cork's location as a port, and its suitability for industrial development is the large agricultural hinterland. From the scale of the dairy products industry in Cork, and the pigs and bacon industry in the larger area of Munster, it is possible to envisage how strengthened trade links with the Continent could open new opportunities for agricultural processing industries and exports of agricultural goods from Cork.</P>
    <P>This should be apparent especially from the reports on textile industries, agricultural processing industries, the printing industry, motor vehicle assembly, fertilisers and chemicals, which are of vital importance for the Cork area.  While agriculture had made a major contribution in the past its role was rapidly being superseded by industry. Cork is well placed by virtue of its location and natural environment to exploit the benefits of EC membership, all we require are positive directions.</P>
    <P>The economic development of the Cork region has been in reverse gear in recent years, through the ongoing closures and liquidations of contracting industries. This has occurred because of a lack of suitable policies by the Government, but the loss of a ferry service to Britain is a major factor in the economic decline and thus a contributory factor to the massive unemployment in the Cork area, something that is not in the priorities of the Government.</P>
    <P>The general public must be telling Government Deputies that their priority should not be on the social changes they are pursuing in accordance with the Taoiseach's crusade.  The Government have got it all wrong.  Unemployment and the creation of jobs are the most important elements in our economy.  However, the Government are pursuing other policies that are clearly aimed at diverting attention from our economic position.</P>
    <P>Allowing the only ship building and ship repairing yard to go into liquidation is another hallmark of the failure of Government policies.  But worse is happening. Former workers from Verlome <Col N="1965" /> Cork Dockyard got together to form a consortium to take over that yard.  They contributed some of their redundancy money and sat long tedious hours with the liquidator with the specific purpose in mind of reopening the dockyard, at the beginning employing 50 to 100 workers, but with the obvious intention of using the skills and abilities which are available in Cobh and in the city of Cork and surrounding areas.</P>
    <P>All they require from the Government at this time is the support of two Ministers, Deputy Noonan and Deputy Mitchell. Their support is vital because the workers are not in a position to put up anything like the money the receiver is seeking.  The Government let Verlome go into liquidation before and I am asking them now to give a positive response to the efforts being made in the Cork area so that the dockyard can be reopened.</P>
    <P>Shipping repair work has gone abroad. The &ldquo;Leinster&rdquo; went for a £2.5 million refit to be followed by the &ldquo;Connacht&rdquo; for a similar job.  We have the unacceptable situation of a semi-State body, the ESB, using foreign vessels to supply thousands of tonnes of coal to Moneypoint because we do not have our own ships since Irish Shipping were liquidated.  Bauxite is being moved to Aughanish on foreign vessels.  Do the Government realise what is happening?  We have Englishmen repairing our ships and Liberians and Panamanians transporting our cargo while Irish people are left stranded.</P>
    <P>The decision of the Government to lease the prototype of the <i>Eithne</i>, the P31, the pride of the Irish work force and design teams of the Cork dockyard, has resulted in that type of ship being built in shipyards around the world with the Government expecting to get £1 million in royalties from each ship built.  We condemned the action of the Government in closing the yard because, as we said then, we believe in the achievements of our work force and the possibilities of the P31.  We outlined the need to market this wonderful vessel but we were not listened to by the Government who showed a complete lack of faith in the Irish work force.  The Government must stand <Col N="1966" /> indicted on this issue particularly as they ignored all the encouragement from this side of the House to save the dockyard and utilise the skills of the work force. The position is nothing short of a national scandal equal only to the liquidation of Irish Shipping and to the utter disgrace of the Coalition Government.</P>
    <P>In the south west, tourism is very important to the economic life of the region and a ferry link with Britain is a pre-requisite for that trade.  Our people in Britain and their families, come home for holidays and visit relatives and friends from whom they have been separated for a long time.  Some of those people have been separated since the economic depression of the fifties.  It is important to recall who was in power at that time. Many people left Ireland in those years in search of work and unfortunately, the trend in recent years has been for emigration to increase.  Again we have a Coalition Government in power and emigration is increasing because of the economic madness of the Government.</P>
    <P>A Cork-Kerry tourism survey in 1985 showed the volume of traffic from the UK dropped to third place from a position of being ahead of all others a few years ago. Nobody is prepared to drive over many miles of substandard roads to get to destinations in Cork and Kerry.  It is worth noting that 30 per cent of tourism plant is located in that region and that 7,000 people are directly employed and many thousands indirectly employed in the industry.  The Government have not encouraged the provision of a ferry from Cork to the UK.  In the five years preceding 1984, in excess of 100,000 foot passengers and 25,000 vehicles travelled the Cork route to the UK.  If any industry were told they would lose 100,000 customers, there would be a revolution and the Government, and the Minister, would not be as smug as they are.</P>
    <P>The report of the Eastern Region Development Organisation shows that 50 per cent of our population will live along the east coast in the near future.  That is an indication of how important it is for the Government to pursue a policy of decentralisation.  Instead of taking stock <Col N="1967" /> of that, the Government seem to be concerned only about providing shipping lanes from the east coast.  Three local authorities, Cork County Council, Cork Corporation and Kerry County Council, joined forces to do the Government's job by providing a ferry service.  They sought £300,000 to ensure the inauguration of that service.  It is true that the Minister intended to give that money but he delayed so long that the amount was inadequate as far as planning for tourism was concerned.  The Minister ought to know that it is necessary to plan ahead for tourism.</P>
    <P>The amendment refers to the support given by the government to the B &amp; I. The granting of £38 million to the B &amp; I for the east coast does not make sense when one considers that only £300,000 was promised to Cork.  The developments at Ringaskiddy were mentioned and it is true to say that down the years Governments provided money to set the scene for the EC to make contributions from the Social Fund and the Regional Fund to develop the Cork port.</P>
    <P>Proposals were shelved until recently when we insisted on their being taken off the shelves.  We have the port and the quayside built up.  However, this Government have failed to sanction provision of equipment for that quayside.  I repeat that this is the equivalent of having a pub with no beer.</P>

      <P>I rise to support the Minister's amendment:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann notes that the conclusions and recommendations of the Committee on Strategic Shipping Requirements set up by the Minister for Communications, were published in the Green Paper on Transport Policy and that the Committee's report is at present being considered by the Government; and also takes note of the substantial financial support for the <Col N="1968" /> B &amp; I Company recently approved by the Government.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I understand the idea that the Opposition are trying to promote.  Yesterday Deputy Wilson said he was anxious to promote a small shipping fleet.  The Government are considering this at present and it is only right that they should examine their options now, in the light of previous bad experience.  That experience came about through decisions, the effects of which were well signalled. I recall meeting people from Irish Shipping Limited who indicated that the management and board of that company were making decisions that they could not stand over.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>At that time the employees did not envisage the total collapse of the company, but they were indicating that there were major difficulties.  I appreciate the reasons which Deputy Wilson outlined for having an Irish deep sea fleet and a strategic fleet, but the continued political exploitation of the problems caused by the liquidation of Irish Shipping is going a little too far.  From the information available to me, Deputy Wilson is doing a good job as shadow spokesman on Transport.  He is operating in a very efficient way.  He is asking the Minister for Communications about various problems and is continuously inquiring about ferry services to the United Kingdom and mainland Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A substantial number of questions were put down on 9 April 1986 in this connection and Deputy Wilson and the Minister had very interesting exchanges. The Deputy was satisfied at the time that the Minister was making a reasonable effort to have new proposals put in train for the continuation of the Irish Continental Line and to have ferry services made available.  Deputy Lyons was at pains to criticise the Government and got great mileage out of clichés which were well used in the fifties.  Why go back 30 years to hammer Coalition or inter-party Governments?  This Coalition took over <Col N="1969" /> many economic problems from the previous Government.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to be speaking to this motion which is highly relevant.  Its purpose is recognised by the Deputies opposite.  It is a shame that nothing is being done and our motion is calling for activity.  There is not only apparent but transparent inactivity on the part of the Government in the whole field of shipping.  We see the need once again to put down this motion to highlight the necessity for action to remedy the present situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our motion refers not alone to deep sea shipping but to the ferry services to the United Kingdom and mainland Europe.  It emphasises the necessity to maintain control over these services in <Col N="1970" /> Irish hands.  That control is being given away by the Government as we have seen, first, by the liquidation of Irish Shipping Limited, secondly, by the proposed partnership arrangement with Sealink and, thirdly, by the likelihood of the sale of ICL to interests outside this State.  It is well to reflect on what has happened in relation to Irish Shipping Limited since 1984, when they were put into liquidation.  Ships were stranded throughout the world and their crews were treated disgracefully by those responsible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government were then and are still responsible.  Even at this moment the <i>Irish Spruce</i> is tied up in France, but with a foreign crew.  Why were the Irish crew brought back?  That question has not been satisfactorily answered.  Over the years we have educated our young people to be marine engineers but at the moment those who are still doing the course are being educated not for service to this nation but for emigration.  The experienced seamen who served the country for many years since Seán Lemass founded Irish Shipping Limited have no alternative but to work abroad or else sign on at their local employment exchanges.</P>
      <P>It is factually correct to state that there is an over-capacity of bulk carriers, as the Minister said last night.  However, it is also true that there are ships available at very low prices and, from what I have been given to understand, it would be possible to purchase two 70,000 tonne carriers for as little as £7 million, which is small money for that type of ship.  If the Electricity Supply Board were to give to one such purchased carrier the contract for carriage of half their coal needs and if the other ship were leased even at present low freight rates, the ships would pay for themselves.  Should such a course be followed, it would be a commencement in the building up of a deep sea shipping fleet again.  Such a fleet might evolve and develop into one comparable with the fleet scuttled so recently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1971" /> The Minister of State highlighted the Government's attitude towards the provision of a fleet when he stated that the key recommendation of the committee is the one relating to the provision of incentives for maintenance and development of an Irish fleet.  From the statement and the actions of the Government one can draw but one conclusion and that is that the Government do not intend to develop a strategic fleet which the committee also concluded was a need and whose first conclusion was the need to maintain on the Irish register a strategic fleet of deep-sea vessels for the transport of essential supplies in an emergency.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State also stated that his Department had acted on one of the recommendations the manning levels and trading areas for Irish ships.  He went on to say:</P>
    <P>I must emphasise the safety aspect and assure Deputies that the Minister would not be prepared to take any decisions which might compromise the safety of our ships and of those who sail in them.</P>
    <P>I would say to the Minister of State, what about the ships to make such implementation of that recommendation meaningful?  The question which the Minister of State has not satisfactorily addressed is the cost of closure versus the cost of keeping in operation Irish Shipping Limited.  He estimated that £144.5 million up to 1989 plus £59 million losses at that date would be the total cost if Irish Shipping Limited were to be maintained.</P>
    <P>Day by day we listen to the Government telling us of the upturn in the world economy which in time should increase freight rates again.  The next day we hear them saying that freight rates will continue to fall and £220 million will be the cost of keeping Irish Shipping Limited going.  Still, we are not told what the final cost of the liquidation will be.  Will it be £50 million, £100 million or £150 million? We get no definite figures &mdash; for one simple reason &mdash; the Government do not <Col N="1972" /> know how much it will cost.  They did not know the first day they made the decision what it would cost.  They did not know whether or not it would be beneficial in the long run to the State to scuttle Irish Shipping Limited.  They panicked and made the wrong decision in their panic. As Deputy Wilson stated last night, a deep sea fleet will be developed by Fianna Fáil and it will grow to be respected throughout the world as the last fleet grew to be respected.</P>
    <P>The future of Irish Continental Line, which is a profitable subsidiary of Irish Shipping Limited, hangs in the balance. We regard the maintenance of this line in either State or private ownership as being of special importance.  It is vitally important that we should have direct contact with the Continent, dependent on no one outside the State.  It would be another tragedy should ICL be allowed to escape from control of this nation, private or public.  If that should happen, there is no doubt that in the long term the employees of Irish Continental Line would be unemployed and should a crisis arise there would be no direct link available between the Continent and this country.  There is no guarantee that Irish Continental Line, if sold out of Irish hands, would under any circumstances provide contact between the Continent and Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State referred to the statement made by the Minister, Deputy Mitchell and I quote:</P>
    <P>I should perhaps in this context draw attention to the fact that the Minister, in the course of a recent discussion in this House regarding Irish Continental Line, at present in the hands of the liquidator of Irish Shipping Ltd., indicated that he would take every step possible to ensure the continuation of a direct ferry link between Ireland and the Continent of Europe.</P>
    <P>There was no reference made by the Minister of State as to ensuring that ownership would continue in Irish hands. I wonder why.</P>
    <P>Deputy Wilson mentioned last night that the former board of B &amp; I had plans to streamline the company and to bring <Col N="1973" /> it into a profitable position.  Zeus Consultants were put in and they have made other decisions.  I hope the plans they have formulated will be successful and that B &amp; I will continue and improve. There are elements which are not satisfactory. First of all, it was said that if there was competition between B &amp; I and the new owner of Sealink of Rosslare to Fishguard or Pembroke routes B &amp; I would lose out but it is not unknown that the opposition, Sealink, were worried about the competition of B &amp; I.  Who decided that B &amp; I would lose out and why?</P>
    <P>What will be the effects of the monopoly on the southern corridor?  Is this in the best interests of the customers?  From the experience of monopolies in whatever field the winners are always those who control the monopoly, the losers are the customers.  Is there any reason to believe or to have faith in those who are effectively saying that this monopoly will be good for the customers and the country? The channel tunnel, when completed will no doubt increase traffic through the southern corridor.  If the present agreement stretches into the future we will not control the ships plying from Rosslare.  This is sad.  The agreement is not in the very best interests of the Irish paying customers.</P>
    <P>Deputy Wilson raised the question of the continued payment by Government for Pembroke.  We have had no comment from the Minister of State or subsequent speakers in regard to this point.  Hopefully, the Minister will address this problem to ensure that some form of activity will be found to offset the substantial <Col N="1974" /> payments which the State has to pay.  Cork and the south west region has for a number of years been without a ferry to Britain.  The Government last year promised £500,000 for the provision of a ferry but this came to nought as the promise of that money came too late. Whether this was intentional or not I leave to objective minded persons to decide.  The lack of a ferry has had disastrous effects on the tourism industry in that area and I would call on the Minister seriously to examine the position, with a view to filling the void.</P>
    <P>A disgraceful situation arose recently when refurbishing of the B &amp; I ships was contracted to a dockyard at Liverpool when the work could have been done in the Cork area where there are thousands of skilled workers available.  The effects of the liquidation in Irish Shipping Limited became apparent when work on the <i>Leinster</i> was stopped until extra money was voted by Government because the people across the water did not trust that they would be paid unless the money was up front.  For Deputies who say that the Irish Shipping Limited liquidation did not have effects throughout the world, this is simple proof that it did.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would say that the chief purpose of this motion is to act as a stimulus and a goad to activity because there is no activity with regard to shipping as of now.  The fact is that the Government have done nothing positive, they have been negative in the extreme and have scuttled what has taken 50 years to build up.</P>

      <P>Before Private Members' time I had made a number of points.  I will not take up the time of the House for much longer because I took more than one hour on Second Stage. During my short contribution this evening I asked if we appreciated while discussing this very important matter that we are members of a parliamentary assembly or if we had confused this place with an assembly of some church or other.  I was horrified at the tone and tenor of some of the speeches.  Of course, I am entitled to be horrified and surprised, though the people making the speeches are entitled to make them in the manner they see fit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I pointed out that I thought the Government could make a serious mistake in campaigning on the issue and I suggested that perhaps the Taoiseach <Col N="1978" /> could address the nation on the airwaves and that the Government could circulate each household with literature setting out the pros and cons of the issue.  I mentioned that if a caller came to my door I would treat him or her courteously but that I would move that person on because I considered this was a moral issue and that it was entirely a matter for myself to make up my own mind on the matter without any political input.  I pointed out I considered it a matter for my own family to make up their own minds &mdash; a number of them have and they may not be entirely of the same mind as myself which is as it should be.  My message to canvassers is not to call to my door.  However, if they should call by mistake they will be treated with courtesy but my response to them will be this is not a matter of politics but is one of private morality.</P>
    <P>I dealt also with the position of Fianna Fáil and I pointed out that the vast majority of members were against divorce and were entitled to take that view.  They had the courage to outline their position and they pointed out they were expressing views on their own account and were not speaking on behalf of Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>During the day I met a number of respected journalists.  They approached me because they considered Fianna Fáil had changed their position in relation to the statement issued by the parliamentary party some time ago.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  Fianna Fáil have not changed their position.  I welcomed the statement by the parliamentary party because it was a new departure and it was a trend I hoped would continue on matters of private morality.  In this instance the Whip did not apply and individuals in the parliamentary party were entitled to do their own thing.  I welcomed that development and I continue to welcome it.</P>
    <P>The Leader of my party has expressed his worries and concern about the referendum and effectively he has come out against divorce.  Our spokesman on Justice, my friend and colleague Deputy Woods, has also indicated his reaction to the proposed referendum, as have Deputy O'Hanlon and Deputy Flynn and <Col N="1979" /> one of the most respected Deputies in the House, Deputy Faulkner.  All of these men have indicated their views as they are entitled to do.  That is what this Parliament is about.  I do not believe it is other than a republican Parliament and we, as republican parliamentarians, represent the people of all religions.  We are not, as one speech appeared to suggest, legislating as Catholics for a Catholic people, that is not what we are about.  I listen to the views of my colleagues which are different from my views but that is democracy.</P>
    <P>There has been much legal chat about the position of the first family in a broken marriage as compared with the legal status of the family of the second marriage. I wonder if those who have deliberated long and hard about this matter have concerned themselves with the hardship, tension and psychological trauma which afflict such families.  Perhaps the husband beats his wife or abuses the children and in the circumstances of such a family where one of the partners seek a divorce it is my view that the marriage has irretrievably broken down. My appeal is for charity and compassion. I have expressed my view that the God who is common to all religions here is a compassionate, loving and forgiving God and will not condemn the former partners in a broken marriage to eternal damnation. As a practising Catholic I do not think these people will burn in hell.  As a legislator or individual, I do not think I am entitled to suggest that another religion should not have its own rules, regulations and beliefs.  I am not entitled to suppress, subdue or subsume those religions simply because they do not coincide with my religious beliefs.  I cannot see my role as a legislator in that direction.  If people who have spoken in the debate do not share my view I do not think the less of them, but I should not like them to think less of me because of the views I hold.</P>
    <P>I see the family as fundamental to the fabric of society.  That is the way I want it in our society.  I want the family unit to be strong and close-knit and to be <Col N="1980" /> prepared to defend itself against outside threat.  I believe very strongly in the goodness of the family and its importance to the general well-being of society.  However, where the family unit breaks down, are we to say to the partners that they cannot enter into another relationship because the rules of my Church or their Church so dictate?  We cannot do that as legislators.</P>
    <P>I do not see the referendum as an attack on the family.  The vast majority of families are strong and can defend themselves.  As I have pointed out <i>ad nauseam,</i> divorce will not be compulsory. Let those who want that facility have it in the circumstances of this restrictive amendment but it will not interfere with those who do not want divorce.  I do not stand for the dissolution of marriage but, where a marriage has dissolved as a matter of fact and reality, who am I to say the partners should not be entitled to remarry?  It is cruel, almost inhuman, to consign people in a broken marriage to a continuation of that until death.  That is wrong.  I am not setting myself up as a judge of morality.  That is not my function. I am here as a legislator to legislate for the common public good and of the nation.</P>
    <P>Of course divorce is a contentious issue.  No one denies that.  Income tax is a contentious issue.  Are we to avoid dealing with the issue simply because it is contentious?  I do not see these proposals as being extra liberal.  They are restrictive enough.  I do not see the proposed referendum as a threat or challenge to anyone or anything.</P>
    <P>I support Fianna Fáil on taking a neutral position.  I know that some of the speeches may seem less than neutral from the Fianna Fáil side of the House, but this is their opportunity to say what they have to say and then to stand back and let the people decide.  It is right that people should indicate their views but to suggest that in some way by expressing those views the neutral stance of Fianna Fáil has been eroded is wrong.  If needs be I will keep pointing that out.</P>
    <P>I thank the spokesman on Justice for the manner in which he met what he <Col N="1981" /> considered to be his duty.  Some of the criticism levelled at him was unfair.  One of my weaknesses in public life is that I can see the other person's point of view. There is a view in some political parties that one can only have tunnel vision and cannot agree with one's opponent on the other side of the political divide.  That makes a nonsense of the politics in which I believe.  It may be part of my simplicity but I can see Deputy Woods' points. While I may not be able to support them, I defend his right to speak as he wishes. We might have a look at the contributions of those who criticise him.  People come into the House on a hit and run basis. They make their contribution arising from the contribution they heard immediately before them.  In this instance the attack on Deputy Woods was made by some Deputy who heard his speech, dined out on it and then skipped.  That is not fair debate or fair criticism.  I applaud his right to say what he said although I may not agree with it.</P>
    <P>I assure the public that as far as I am concerned this will be my last word on this issue on the principle that I believe politicians should stand aside from the issue and let the people decide.  I would add a smaller rider to that: if my position is misrepresented I reserve the right to place on record my correct role in this discussion.</P>

      <P>Deputy Andrews made an eloquent contribution to this debate and tried to ensure that we deal in a realistic and responsible way with what is recognised by everyone as a difficult issue.  In the last few days he has been ploughing a very lonely furrow in the benches opposite in insisting that a neutral approach is adopted.  Anyone standing aside from the debate would expect a neutral presentation of the different views to be evenly balanced.  On each occasion when the Deputy entered the debate it has been to bring the Members opposite back to the reality of the problem that exists.  It is noteworthy that his views do not coincide with the views of his colleagues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I found Deputy Barrett's contribution, with all due respects to him, most disturbing especially when it is considered that he is a member of a party who seek to adopt the tenets of Wolfe Tone and seek to project themselves as a party who wish to have a United Ireland in which the position of majorities and minorities of all types are protected.  His contribution <Col N="1983" /> could not be reconciled with a perception of what is necessary to resolve some of our difficulties in the Ireland of today.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>He has a right to express his views just as every other Deputy has and to tease out what is being said.  The impact of Deputy Barrett's contribution was that the laws of the State should reflect the laws of one Church which is something that was not articulated to the same degree by other Members of the House opposite.  It was quite different from the contribution made by Deputy Andrews.</P>
      <P>I wish to deal with some of the issues raised by Deputy Woods.  There is a real difficulty that, in teasing out the constitutional proposal, we will create unnecessary alarm by suggesting legal interpretations which are untenable.  The difficulty is that, if someone asserts something for long enough, someone will believe it is accurate.  Those who know that it is not accurate can only assert a different proposition.  The people then have to judge which person is to be believed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to deal with the issue which has been raised time and again about the first family and the second family and which one has constitutional protection.  The suggestion has been made &mdash; and adequately dealt with by the Minister for Justice &mdash; that children of the first marriage will lose their succession rights if divorce legislation is enacted.  All that can be replied to that is that it is untrue. It is a totally inaccurate legal proposition because, under section 117 of the Succession Act, children born to a couple in marriage will remain the children of that couple whether or not the marriage is dissolved and will continue to retain the right to make a claim under section 117 of the Succession Act to a share in the <Col N="1984" /> estate of the deceased parent whether or not the marriage is dissolved.  The fact that this is an untrue proposition is evidenced by the fact that currently &mdash; and I think I pointed this out on Second Stage &mdash; we have couples who get foreign decrees of divorce and such decrees of divorce are recognised within this jurisdiction by our courts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not labour the point, but it is a point that is being raised inside and outside this House by those who are opposed to change and it is an inaccurate point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second point raised which I think we need to pin down to a considerable degree relates to the constitutional position of the family.  The proposition that the family of the first marriage, which marriage has collapsed, would be placed in a legally inferior position is based on a perception that when the marriage collapses there are in existence constitutional rights which help the couple, the husband and the wife individually, and provide them with some degree of constitutional protection in the context of the broken marriage.  To that it can be replied that I have never seen a situation, in almost 15 years working with people whose marriages have collapsed, where a battered or a deserted wife has sought legal help arising from the collapse of their marriage and in which I have been able to sit that person down and say: &ldquo;Do not worry.  You have all of these <Col N="1985" /> constitutional protections that you can avail of, even if your marriage has collapsed, that will ameliorate the position.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The reality is that there are no constitutional protections in that sense that afford a hap'orth of assistance to either the deserted husband or the battered wife when their marriage has collapsed because the protections they have in substance are statutory protections provided within ordinary legislation.  One cannot, by constitutional rhetoric, repair the broken marriage.  One cannot, by virtue of the Constitution, guarantee protection for the battered wife.  One cannot, by virtue of the Constitution, guarantee to her adequate income support through maintanance and one cannot, through the Constitution itself, provide her with protection in the family home.</P>
    <P>The fact that the Constitution did not extend any of these protections in a substantive from was evidenced by the fact that until the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act, 1976, was enacted dependent spouses or dependent wives had no general course of action available to them to obtain maintanance support from husbands who were refusing to maintain them properly.  Prior to the enactment of the Family Home Protection Act, 1976, a wife living in a home owned by her husband could discover it was sold when the removal van appeared outside her home to take out the furniture. There was no constitutional protection; it was a statutory provision which provided her with protection.</P>
    <P>Prior to the provision of legislation in 1976 and then in an amended form provided in new legislation enacted in 1981, wives subject to the violence of their husbands could not obtain barring orders to put a violent husband outside of the House.  They are not a form of constitutional protection; they arise by ordinary legislation.  So the reality is that the Constitution, despite the prohibition on divorce, has never provided any constitutional protections or adequate mechanisms to assist the casualties of a broken marriage in resolving the consequences of the breakdown of their marriage.  That <Col N="1986" /> has always been left to ordinary statutory provisions enacted through the Oireachtas and, indeed, the two major pieces of legislation in this area which provide protection for wives were enacted by the Coalition Government then in existence in 1976.</P>
    <P>So, when one takes a broken marriage and talks about these mystical constitutional rights that are providing everyone with protection, they do not and cannot provide a mechanism to repair broken marriages.  They do not provide currently any guarantees of financial support or proprietary protection in the family home.  The one thing the current Constitution does is deny to the victim of a broken marriage the right to enter into a new marriage, the opportunity of a successful and happy family life in a second marriage.</P>
    <P>That constitutional provision which is frequently suggested in some way to prevent marital breakdown clearly has no such impact because of the statistics of marital breakdown to which I referred in the Second Stage debate where I referred to the fact that there had been over 15,000 applications in the District Court alone in a six year period by wives seeking barring orders.  So there are no mystical constitutional protections available.</P>
    <P>What happens in this context if this provision is enacted and is inserted in the Constitution?  For the first time in the context of the latter wording of this proposal there will be a constitutional requirement to ensure, in so far as one can in the context of the circumstances of the couple, that adequate and proper provision is made to provide financial supports or protections for the dependent spouse and children.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I am making is that the suggestion that permitting divorce and remarriage will deprive the victims or parties currently to a broken marriage of substantive constitutional rights which are of assistance to them is untrue because currently those sort of rights do not exist within the Constitution, and currently they do not exist to take into account the divorce situation in the context of a spouse living in Ireland where a foreign decree of divorce is granted which is recognised in Ireland. Currently there are no constitutional protections there either.</P>
      <P>I want to deal with this issue, to finally pin down what it is that Deputy Woods is talking about when he talks about all these constitutional rights being lost in the marital breakdown situation if we permit the casualties of a broken marriage, the deserted husband or battered wife, to remarry.  The constitutional rights that the courts have articulated as applicable to the family relate to the family as a unit; they relate to a functioning viable family unit composed of husband and wife or husband and wife and children living together in a viable marriage relationship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Constitutional rights have been referred to, such as those arising out of the Murphy case which related to income tax, ensuring that the couple living as a unit were not discriminated against in law as compared with a couple cohabiting. Under the current Constitution in the absence of divorce our courts have recognised that where a marriage breaks down the couple, <i>vis-á-vis</i> their relationship with each other, can no longer refer to constitutional rights which apply to the unit of the family because at that stage the family unit has broken up.  That concept is meaningless in the concept of the <Col N="1988" /> relationship between the husband and the wife.  That is something which needs to be clarified.  For people who are unfamiliar with the law and with the Constitution, the general proposition could create alarm if they believed they would lose their constitutional rights.  If the decree of divorce is granted, the individuals will retain all the constitutional rights they have individually under the Constitution. Even without a decree of divorce our courts have recognised that the family rights which apply to the family unit are changed drastically not by the granting of a divorce decree but because the marriage has broken down.</P>
    <P>I am going to refer very briefly to three court judgments which substantiate the point I am making.  Deputy Woods is familiar with one of these judgments because he referred to it in the debate on the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Bill. The case <i>the State (Bouzagou) v. Fitzgibbon Street Garda Station</i> can be found in the 1986 Irish Law Reports Monthly, page 98.  The High Court Judge dealt with the issue of family rights.  There was an assertion on the part of the husband &mdash; who was the prosecutor in a case brought against the State &mdash; that he was entitled to certain rights as part of a family unit despite the fact that his marriage had broken down.  According to the judgment this gentleman had been violent and had been barred from the family home by court proceedings brought by the wife. The court dealt with whether Mr. Bouzagou who had left Ireland &mdash; he was not an Irish national &mdash; had any rights under Article 41 of the Constitution.  I emphasise that this is a case where the couple's marriage had broken down.  It is still indissoluble under our Constitution and there is no suggestion of anybody obtaining a divorce.  The wife and children are living in Ireland and she is separated from her husband.  This situation applies to many thousands of people at present. What are the constitutional rights in this situation?  How will they change if we have divorce?  Mr. Justice Barron in the High Court, dealing with the proposition the husband made said:</P>
    <P>The prosecutor's problem, however, <Col N="1989" /> is that he cannot automatically claim the rights guaranteed to the family under Article 41, because, in this case, unfortunately the family is divided.  It is not a question of asserting the rights of a family, or even of the parents, as against the outside world but of reconciling the rights of individual members of the family when the family itself is divided.  The wife and the children now live as a separate unit and, when the prosecutor was last in the country, had the protection of a barring order against him.  In these circumstances it appears to me that, in the absence of agreement between husband and wife, the task of reconciling the rights of the prosecutor with those of other members of his family is one for the courts.</P>
    <P>In other words, the court recognised that the mystical group of rights, which Deputy Woods is suggesting would be lost to the first family if divorce is introduced, are changed radically, not by the introduction or the provision of divorce but by the fact that a marriage breaks down.  This means the family ceases to function as a unit.  We have a spouse with children on the one hand and the other spouse on the other hand, each of whom has rights which must be balanced.  That will remain the position with or without divorce.  That is not a judgment from a judge dealing with an issue for the first time because similar judicial statements have been made in a number of cases by other members of the Judiciary where marriages have broken down but in which there was no question of the divorce.  In the case of <i>Dennehy v. the Minister for Social Welfare,</i> July 1984&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>That is an example of the type of contribution some Deputies opposite have made.  I would not include Deputy Woods or Deputy Flynn in that because we got to know each other very well on the Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown.  That is an eloquent example of the seriousness with which some Members opposite take this issue, and it is a very sad example.</P>
      <P>Propositions which are being asserted as a legal fact are creating alarm outside this House.  These propositions cannot be substantiated, and have already been refuted by our courts and there is an obligation on Members to set the record straight.  The fact that I am doing that shows I am touching a nerve so far as the people who are making these inaccurate legal propositions are concerned.</P>
      <P>To look at the technicality of the law can be a very boring exercise on occasion. It is much simpler to grab the headlines with a tight phrase and a quotable quote but, if one looks at the reality behind these phrases, one will find that not only are they inaccurate but they have no substance and have already been refuted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dealing with the issue of whether a family's constitutional rights remain exactly the same following a marriage breakdown, in <i>Dennehy v. the Minister</i><Col N="1991" /><i>for Social Welfare,</i> page 5 of the judgment, Judge Barron said:</P>
    <P>Articles 41 and 42 relate to the family.  They preclude legislation which is an attack on the family either as a natural primary and fundamental unit group of society or as the primary and natural educator of the child.</P>
    <P>In this case the deserted husband was seeking to establish that he had a constitutional right to a benefit of an identical nature as a deserted wife.  It continued:</P>
    <P>The failure to provide benefit to a deserted husband is not <i>per se</i> an attack on the family, since the family has already been broken up by the desertion of the wife.  It cannot be suggested that to make provision for the husband in such circumstances would in any way cause the parties to come together again.</P>
    <P>That is another example of the courts acknowledging that where a marriage breaks up with or without divorce the fact that the family unit is broken up changes the constitutional position of a couple and that, whether you have divorce or not, both the law and the Constitution must balance the individual rights of both husband and wife <i>vis-á-vis</i> each other. That cannot be affected by the enactment of divorce legislation.  I do not want to labour the point but I refer to just one more judgment where that issue was dealt with by our courts, something that Deputy Woods and others have made great play of.  I refer to the case of <i>Kent County Council v. CS.</i> Judgment was delivered on 9 June 1983 and is reported in <i>Irish Law Reports Monthly.</i> I have not got the reference here.  In that judgment, dealing again with a family that had broken up, the then President of the High Court, now Chief Justice Thomas Finlay, said:</P>
    <P>Taken in its broadest and most usual sense the family of which the Infant is a member has broken up and it is not possible any longer for the courts of this country or indeed for the courts of England to provide a unified right to <Col N="1992" /> the family to educate and bring up this child as a close or united family unit.</P>
    <P>The case concerned custody of a child.</P>
    <P>I introduce this at this stage to make the point that when a marriage breaks up our courts recognise currently that under the Constitution that affects the family unit to the extent that instead of having a unit whose rights to protection are provided for, the law and the Constitution must provide a balance in the rights between the individual component parts of that family unit, be it husband or wife, and that the real protections currently available to the dependent spouse are those that arise under Statute.  The presence or absence of divorce will not affect that.  The enactment of this divorce provision in the context of the constitutional proviso which requires that adequate and proper protection in the financial and property areas be provided will mean a greater degree of constitutional protection than exists at the moment.</P>
    <P>A myth has been created.  The Frankensteinian monster that was released from the box last week to stalk the land is stalking the land on the basis of a legal theory that cannot be substantiated and can do nothing other than create worry or alarm and is &mdash; I will not say mischievously created &mdash; misconceived.  I do not know whether it was accidental or a deliberate attempt to create worry in an area where it is not necessary.</P>
    <P>I want in dealing with this issue to refer to something I find difficult to understand. One of the general propositions made by Deputies opposite in dealing with the issue of divorce has been what I have just referred to, the possible loss of constitutional rights of the first family.  I have explained that there will be no loss that does not occur currently without divorce but that the dependent spouse and the children might have their constitutional position copperfastened to a degree that it is not currently copperfastened. I assume that Deputy Woods is anxious to ensure that the dependent spouse and the children retain their rights and get adequate support but that cannot <Col N="1993" /> be reconciled with a portion of the contribution made by Deputy Woods last week. He said in this House that one way that many of the problems of marital breakdown &mdash; he listed various ways &mdash; could be dealt with was by the enactment of nullity legislation.  Whereas there is no doubt that the individual constitutional rights that husbands and wives would normally have would be retained by them in the context of divorce legislation and that the children of a marriage where divorce is granted will remain children of the family based on marriage and retain all of their constitutional rights, it is certain that if nullity was used as a mechanism instead of divorce, the constitutional rights under the family Articles of not only the husband and the wife but of the children born to them would be extinguished because those children would no longer be regarded as children of a family based on marriage.  The theory and practice of nullity law is that a decree of annulment is the decision of a court that no marriage ever came into existence. I find it extraordinarily difficult to reconcile the concern expressed that the members of the first family retain constitutional rights with the proposition that instead of providing for divorce we should provide nullity legislation when nullity legislation would patently extinguish the constitutional rights of the husband, the wife and the children under Articles 41 and 42 of the Constitution. The two propositions are irreconcilable and cannot withstand analysis or examination.</P>
    <P>The approach that has been adopted by some Members opposite and adopted yesterday evening in a speech not delivered in this House but released to the press by Deputy Haughey was based on Deputy Woods' perception that the family is important, is a great buttress in society, the fundamental unit group within our society.  Of course it is. Nobody in this House takes a different view.  The suggestion is that those who are in favour of this reform in some ways see it as a means of undermining the family or wish to undermine the family. The reality is that we all wish to see the <Col N="1994" /> family functioning and we all regard the family &mdash; to use Deputy Haughey's words &mdash; as a great buttress.  But, in what way is the family a buttress when the husband and wife are living apart and the wife has had to get a court order for protection against her husband or when the husband has been deserted by the wife who has gone to live with someone else?  How is that family a buttress to society?  How does society benefit by telling that couple, whose marriage has collapsed, that we are going to pretend that they are still married to each other by saying that in law they are regarded as married when in reality we know they are not?  The press release indicated that a price was to be paid for the introduction of divorce. A great price is being paid currently by this community for our not having faced up to this issue.  How many thousands of husbands and wives currently find their constitutional position intolerable?  The law's denial to them of a second chance is seen by them as a harsh and cruel way to deal with someone whose marriage has collapsed.  In what way is the family being enhanced or marriage buttressed by the fact that people are getting church annulments and going through second marriages in churches and these second ceremonies are not recognised as valid or as creating valid marriages?</P>
    <P>In what way is family life enhanced or buttressed by the fact that couples whose marriages have collapsed are trying to arrange divorces of convenience in England, Mexico, Haiti or the Dominican Republic and going through second invalid marriage ceremonies before returning to Ireland?  In what way are marriages enhanced by the fact that a wife who has been deserted by her husband may, six or seven years later, from a permanent, viable relationship with someone else and give a degree of social acceptability to that relationship by changing her name by deed poll to assume the name of the man with whom she is living so that people around her believe that she is married?</P>
    <P>In what way is family life enhanced by all these things which the Joint Committee <Col N="1995" /> on Marriage Breakdown acknowledged are part and parcel of Irish society? The price is now too high to do anything other than to permit couples whose marriages have collapsed the opportunity of a second happy marriage.  We are paying a very high price, one which many people in the medical profession see where patients, under the strain of broken marriages, are under regular medication, some of them receiving psychiatric treatment and others resorting to drink.  The problem of alcoholism was referred to earlier but it is not always the cause of a broken marriage.  It is often a form of escape to get away from a broken marriage.</P>
    <P>I hope some of the inaccurate propositions which are giving rise to concern outside the House and which Members opposite have been pursuing on a regular basis throughout the course of the debate, can be left aside.</P>

      <P>I should like to go into detail on some points which I raised on Second Stage as I am still puzzled regarding some of them, especially as to how divorce legislation will operate in the event of the referendum being passed.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister would clarify the special provisions which will be made for those couples whose marriages have failed for more than five years on the passing of the constitutional amendment, if that is the case.  The amendment sets out the conditions on which a divorce can be obtained and the Minister said on Second Stage that all conditions must be fulfilled before a divorce decree is obtained.  Paragraph 15 of the statement of the Government's intentions with regard to marriage, separation and divorce says:</P>
      <P>The legislation will contain special provision to cater for cases where, at the passing of the legislation, spouses have been separated for long periods but may not have obtained decrees of judicial separation or had separation agreements made a rule of court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1996" /> The Minister said in his speech on Second Stage:</P>
    <P>People who have already been separated for five years at the time the legislation to provide for divorce comes into force will be able to apply for a divorce once they have proved that fact and also that proper provision has been made for dependants.</P>
    <P>Because of the fact that there is a special paragraph in the statement, could the Minister clarify the position in regard to any divorce legislation which may be brought before this House and if special provisions will form part of that Bill in respect of those who have already been separated for five years?  If that is the case, then on the basis of his Second Stage speech, if they can prove at the divorce proceedings that they have been separated for five years and that there is adequate provision for the spouse and children, then they will obtain a divorce decree.  That seems to suggest that the special provision which is to be made for these people will allow them to obtain a divorce.</P>
    <P>Seemingly, the fact that they have been separated for five years will be conclusive evidence that their marriage has failed. Therefore, separation becomes the determining factor in respect of that category. At any rate, that is my interpretation of the position as outlined by the Minister because he specifically pointed out that this is a special provision in relation to these people.  By making special provision for a category of people, the court will have no option but to decide in respect of new cases coming before it which are outside that category at the time of the enactment of the legislation, that the fact of separation for five years will be the determining factor in deciding that a marriage has failed.  The objective test generally will be whether the couple have been separated for five years and which will determine whether a marriage has failed.  If that is not the case, perhaps the Minister will explain paragraph 15 and his remarks which I quoted earlier because it is misleading and it is very difficult for Members on all sides of the <Col N="1997" /> House to make arguments which are considered valid by the Minister if he is not prepared to explain how this special provision for that category of people will come about.</P>
    <P>The second point revolves around the spouse's rights in this matter if the referendum is passed.  The Minister said, with regard to spouses, that it will of course be a consequence of divorce that the person who has ceased to be married to another, by reason of the dissolution of the marriage, would not be regarded as a widow or widower of the other for the purposes of succession when the other dies and would lose rights as a result.  He went on to say the new powers being provided in the family court will enable the court to make some compensation for loss of expectation on the death of the other spouse if that is appropriate.</P>
    <P>I accept that once a divorce comes into being there must be a clean break.  We should say openly and honestly that, as a consequence of divorce, the rights of the children by the first marriage are diluted. That must be accepted in the event of there being a second union and children born to it.  As I pointed out on Second Stage in regard to intestacy, one third of the estate which is available to those children will be available equally to the children of the second and subsequent unions.</P>
    <P>In regard to the spouses the Minister said on Second Stage that as a consequence of divorce he or she would lose rights.  The new powers to be given to the family courts to award lump sum payments at the time of the divorce proceedings will be some compensation for loss of expectation but the circumstances will vary considerably in each case.  They will vary from the person with a £100,000 house in Foxrock to the person living in county council rented accommodation in some other part of the country.  Let us take the case of a person who has been happily married for 20 years, with children of that marriage but who then divorces and forms a second union.  It is accepted that the widow's pension rights will go to the second wife, the dependent wife at the time.  I am sure all Members <Col N="1998" /> will accept that there is an injustice in that case.</P>
    <P>I bow to Deputy Shatter's statement in relation to the change that courts accept takes place in the event of a marital breakdown under present constitutional arrangements but the system that operates in Germany in relation to divorce proceedings is a way around that.  In that country evidence has to be given at the time of the divorce of an appointment of the pension rights of the person seeking the divorce being granted to the first spouse.  That should be the case in regard to people with private pension rights. Justice demands that our legislation should incorporate such a provision.  In regard to PAYE workers who do not have private pension rights, the contributory pension goes to the second spouse and the first spouse will be means tested for social assistance.  We will have to deal with that point in any legislation to be introduced by the Government in the event of the referendum being passed. The justice of the case demands that.  If the people are being asked to accept the justice of the case of those whose marriages have broken down then the Legislature will have to accept the justice of the cases that will arise following that.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Kelly said, the passage of this referendum will cause as many problems as it will remedy.  The first spouse as a result of divorce may lose her succession rights.  At the divorce proceedings alimony payments may be granted to her and, in the event of a change in circumstances for the better of the other partner, presumably she will be able to return to the court, as in other jurisdictions, and have that alimony increased.  However, it is important that the pension rights issue is dealt with.  The people should be made aware of that before they vote on the amendment.</P>
    <P>When dealing with the cost of divorce today the Minister was a little dismisive. It is not popular for legislators or individuals to raise that issue and one is often told that this is a civil right.  It is suggested that we should take into consideration the difficulties experienced by many people and there is validity in that, but the Minister <Col N="1999" /> does not seem to be aware that the normal run of the mill case will not involve a person who is economically independent and can provide adequately for his first spouse and children and for a second spouse and children.  The vast majority of people here cannot provide for the wife and children they have, let alone for a future wife or children.  In the event of the person who is being granted a divorce not being in a position to provide for his wife and children, the State must step in.  If that does not happen we will have divorce for the rich.  If divorce is to be for all socio-economic classes the State will have to step in.  It will not be a question of providing an extra welfare allowance for the spouse taking care of the children.</P>

      <P>We will have to provide a council house for the person who has to leave the family home.  That is not being done in some cases at present.  Where there is a separation at present one party to the marriage returns to his or her family.  In the event of a second liaison being in existence at the time of the divorce application proper accommodation will have to be provided.  I am not making that a central point as to why divorce should or should not be granted or why people should vote &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo;, but it must be taken into consideration.</P>
      <P>When divorce proceedings are instituted and the new family court decides on who should get the family home, what happens if the family home is held in joint tenancy?  Will the court have the power to direct one of the joint owners to transfer the interest in that house to the party who will be remaining there?  Can that be done under the Constitution which guarantees property rights?  If a person does not wish to transfer the joint ownership what will happen to the family home?  The Minister should clarify that point because in most cases the family home is in the name of the husband and the wife.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2000" /> In relation to the question of nullity, I was quite amused at the contributions in relation to the final paragraph of the Government's statement proposing that the law of nullity will be reviewed, taking account of the recommendations contained in the Law Reform Commission's report on marriage and the recommendations made by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown.  They talk about expanding the grounds on which civil nullity can be obtained.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health on Second Stage spoke about the importance of dividing Church and State and went on to criticise the Church's version of nullity as theological hypocrisy.  The Minister for Justice, Deputy Dukes, said that he found it difficult to see the logic behind extending civil nullity and he found it difficult to grasp its function.  Deputy Shatter spoke of what would happen if civil nullity were expanded and said that constitutional rights would be available neither to spouses nor to children of that marriage.  Could we please have a clear statement from the Government as to whether this is a sop of some description in paragraph 21 or whether they will reform the law on civil nullity?</P>
    <P>We are being asked, on the one hand, to bring the Constitution up to date, taking cognisance of the fact that there are marriage breakdowns and that we should therefore provide the right to remarry.  We are asked to bring some sort of legal consistency into the law in relation to divorce.  On the one hand we are told that church nullities are more liberal than civil nullities available in the courts of this land at present.  On the other hand, we are being told by certain prominent members of the Government that there is not much point in following this trend but that they will do it anyway; that that would bring some legal consistency into the lives of people who have obtained church nullities which are not recognised in law.  These people may wish to avail of civil nullity so that they can be remarried in the eyes of the State.  We need some clarification on that point.  The Government seem a little dismissive of <Col N="2001" /> the proposed reforms in that area while making sure that we see the point about bringing legal consistency into the law in relation to divorce, as they see it.  Perhaps the Minister might reply to those points.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill which has been before the House last week and this week is of tremendous importance and the Schedule we are discussing tonight contains the main elements of the Bill.  As we know, the family is the natural, primary and fundamental unit of our society.  Its authority is contained in Article 41.1 of our Constitution, which I fully support and endorse.  This Article is important because of the obligation on the State to protect the family.  We in this House must continue to strengthen the family unit and the concept of the family. If we fail to do so, Irish society will suffer as a result.  I am justifiably proud of our society and our family unit.  I am totally supportive of and committed to the protection of the family unit.  I am anxious that the institution of marriage on which the family unit is built should be maintained and preserved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of marriage in the Catholic Church, of which I am proud to be a member, the couple marrying enter into a contract for life.  Marriage is a lifelong union and is indissoluble.  Let it be clearly understood that no State, Government or civil power on the earth have the power to dissolve or break that Church marriage according to the teaching of my Church. I accept unequivocally and without reservation the teachings of my Church in this instance.  I am anxious that marriage in Ireland would be maintained and strengthened.  Other people may have views different from mine on this matter and may have views different from my Church's.  Have I the right to impose my views or my Church's views on what I consider to be a minority in this country? Have I the right to deprive that minority of a civil freedom?  That would be wrong, unless it is clear it is for the common good.  In Church marriages &mdash; and I mean &ldquo;Church&rdquo; in the broader sense &mdash; in most of the western world there are two separate <Col N="2002" /> and distinct marriages.  Where a marriage takes place in a Church in Ireland there are two separate and distinct agreements entered into.  One is the ceremony which takes place at the altar and which bestows the sacrament of marriage on the couple, confirming that they are husband and wife according to the law of their church.  The second agreement is a civil contract, a State marriage where the man and woman sign a marriage contract and are recognised as husband and wife according to the law of this land as enacted by this House.  In Ireland the civil contract is usually signed in the sacristy or in some room off the Church.</P>
    <P>This amendment to the Constitution will not affect the sacrament of matrimony of the Church marriage.  I now quote an extract from the submission of the Irish Catholic Bishops to the New Ireland Forum on 9 February 1984, given by Bishop Cahal Daly:</P>
    <P>The Catholic Church of Ireland totally rejects the concept of a confessional state.  We have not sought and we do not seek a Catholic State for a Catholic people.  We believe that the alliance of Church and State is harmful for the Church and harmful for the State.  We rejoiced when the ambiguous formula regarding the special position of the Catholic Church was struck out of the Constitution by the electorate of the Republic.  The Catholic Church in Ireland has no power and seeks no power except the power of the gospel it preaches and the consciences and the convictions of those who freely accept that teaching.</P>
    <P>We are facing a serious situation concerning marriage breakdowns and the sadness and tragedy caused to the couples who are having their problems.  A real challenge must be faced by all here in this house, by the Churches, by all the civil and legal authorities.  If this amendment goes through, everybody must face the challenge of marriage breakdown and realise the trauma, pain and suffering caused to the couples involved and must make a special effort to unite to try to make marriages more worthwhile and <Col N="2003" /> make more marriages work, to try to make marriage something meaningful for the couples concerned.  That is what everybody should strive for and work towards.</P>
    <P>Statistics have been quoted freely about the United States and Great Britain. People have said we are going to follow the slippery slope of America.  Statistics are thrown out about marriage breakdown in America and Britain.  I am different from persons in Britain.  I am Irish, they are British.  I am different from persons in the United States of America. They are American, I am Irish.  I believe that the Irish people are different from Americans and are different from British people.  I do not necessarily think that we are going to follow the path that the British and Americans have followed.  I do not necessarily feel that we are going to take all of the bad points that they have had and that marriages will start breaking down immediately if something of this nature is passed by the House.  I do not think so.</P>
    <P>Figures have been quoted for the North of Ireland in regard to the number of divorces which have taken place there. The people in the North are Irish, they are part of our people.  There have been a number of applications for divorce, most of which were originally made in the North of Ireland at the time divorce legislation was first passed there.  There is a real and genuine challenge facing all of us and if we work together we can ensure that the family unit as we know it can continue to be strong, vibrant and alive as we would all wish it to be.</P>
    <P>I fully understand and appreciate the views of people who like myself are anxious to retain the family unit.  In the statement on the Government's intentions with regard to Marriage, Separation and Divorce reference is made to a decree of <i>a mensa et thoro,</i> which is a judicial separation.  I have before me the number of applications for such decrees. The interesting thing is that the number of such applications has declined decidedly since the period 1972-85.  I will quote some of the figures to contrast <Col N="2004" /> them with the figures for nullity: in 1972, there were 30 petitions for such a decree; in 1973, 26 petitions; in 1974, 51 petitions; in 1975, 43 petitions; in 1976, 37 petitions; in 1977, 29 petitions; in 1978, 39 petitions; in 1979, 34 petitions; in 1980, 27 petitions; in 1981, 25 petitions; in 1982, 20 petitions; in 1983, eight petitions; in 1984, five petitions; and in 1985, 15 petitions.</P>
    <P>What has clearly come across is that the number of applications to our courts for a decree of nullity has risen sharply. The following are the number of applications for decrees of nullity to the High Court &mdash; this is a sad situation because of what a decree of nullity does &mdash; and I will deal with them in five year periods: between 1966 and 1970, there were eight petitions all of which were refused; between 1971 and 1975, there were 25 petitions of which nine were granted; between 1975 and 1980, there were 52 petitions of which 23 were granted; between 1980 and 1985, there were 124 petitions of which 66 were granted.</P>
    <P>The courts have given different reasons why they are granting decrees of nullity; some were for the lack of consent; more were for coercion, whether it was mental, physical or psychological; another reason was impotence at the time of marriage; and the failure to maintain a loving or caring relationship and was in that condition at the time of marriage.  It is true to state that the Church over the years granted annulments which permitted people to remarry and to enter into further relationships.  Similarly, where a decree of nullity was granted the parties concerned were entitled to remarry and enter into further marriage obligations. In both instances, the Church and the State made a point that there was no marriage in the first place.  The problem this creates for children born in these marriages is that it raises questions and doubts of a most profound nature as to their legitimacy.  These are not isolated incidents but are very real problems for the children born of these unions who do not know what their status is under the laws of the church or State: whether they <Col N="2005" /> are legitimate or illegitimate or whether they have property rights to their father's or mother's estates.</P>
    <P>The sad point is that the legal position in regard to a decree of nullity is that when it is granted by our High Court the children born of that union are regarded as illegitimate by our courts.  They are children of the mother but are not children of the father even though they were born of that union which was regarded as a marriage during the period they were cohabitating and living together.  What a situation for a young man, a young woman or any person of 15 years of age suddenly to realise that although their parents were married for 12 to 15 years they no longer carry their father's name but, in fact, carry their mother's name. This is something the Bill is making an effort to tackle.</P>
    <P>I shall not go in for statistics because the Bill is not about statistics in any way, it is about the sadness of broken marriages and about men, women and children. I must bring to the attention of the House that between 1980 and 1985 the number of applications to the District Courts for barring orders was 15,003. Does anyone fully realise what a barring order is and the tragedy for the wife in having to apply to a district justice to have her husband barred from her home?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you.  It is important to bear it in mind because of the tragedy for the wife, the husband and children of that marriage.  Those who are involved in the legal aid system and those who are dealing with these applications day in and day out will tell you how sad the situation is.  I am 20 years practising at law and I am sad to say that the work of our courts in relation to family law matters is increasing.  The experience of practising lawyers is that the number of cases where wives are battered, where children are assaulted and injured and where fights take place are too horrific to contemplate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2006" /> I would be dishonest if I did not recognise and face up to the fact that these problems exist.  Even more so, if I did not state here and now that there is a united effort needed to tackle and solve these problems with the Churches and all other bodies anxious to help and strengthen the family unit.  I am referring to a small minority of cases but it is a minority which is growing.  For this reason, we must be diligent in seeking out and endeavouring to eradicate, if at all possible, some of the causes of these problems in homes throughout Ireland.</P>
    <P>In Ireland, there are some marriages which have failed and marriages where there has been a complete breakdown. In Ireland, luckily enough, the vast majority of marriages are happy unions resulting in happy homes.  However, a sizeable number of persons have entered into new relationships and have children as a result.  Some of these persons feel because of the fact that they are unable to remarry that their basic rights are not being catered for.  Does the right for these people to remarry do positive harm to the common good?  Personally I have the greatest possible reservations about divorce.  It is important to ensure that easy access to divorce must be opposed. The common good would not be damaged if the Irish Constitution having been passed by the majority of our people were to allow a restricted form of divorce of the type envisaged in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Approximately 70,000 people suffer from marriage breakdown.  Where these couples have been separated for a period of five years and where it is proven to the satisfaction of the Family Court such people should be given the option, if their consciences allow, to remarry.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to one of the points made by Deputy Haughey last night.  In <i>The Irish Times</i> today it is stated: &ldquo;Haughey sees family as the `great buttress'...&rdquo; It also states:</P>
    <P>Mr Haughey warns that there will be a price to be paid for the introduction of divorce but accepts that the people must decide on whether or not they wish to pay that price.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2007" /> I accept that a price has to be paid and I think that is acknowledged by everybody Similarly a price has to be paid for unmarried mothers, for their children and also for deserted wives.  In the final analysis one must ask whether or not there is an obligation to look after people whose marriages have irretrievably broken down and failed.  I recognise that there are serious financial implications.  Nevertheless, the question is whether it is right or wrong to ensure that these families are looked after.</P>
    <P>There is a very real challenge facing us at present.  We have an obligation to face up to this challenge.  If we do not, then in ten years time there will be absolute and total chaos.  The approach made by the Government, a restrictive, limited type of divorce and a five year period built into the Bill, which can only be changed by a further referendum, is a safeguard.  That is why I support this measure.  It is one of the most important points in this Bill.</P>
    <P>I say to the Minister that it is important that in this instance as much effort as is possible should be made to provide proper, qualified professional counselling and advice.  This is absolutely essential. The legislation should provide that every effort shall be made to ascertain what the problems are in regard to a particular marriage, to see if that marriage can be saved or if the union can be re-established. If proper professional guidance, mediation and counselling had been provided up to now the number of applications which I have quoted might not have been as extensive.  In whatever legislation is introduced a very genuine determined effort must be made to ensure that counselling and advice are given.  A judge cannot go back 30 years into the lives of a husband and wife in a short period of hearing and therefore cannot make the decision.  For that reason I hope that the court welfare officers and professional guidance counsellors would have the opportunity for research and for providing up-to-date information for the judge hearing a particular case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>To take Deputy Enright's last point, he is right in that the judge will have to decide many things under the legislation as it is before us.  There will be considerable difficulty in that respect.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer briefly to the contribution made by Deputy Shatter, particularly in relation to the first family.  From what he said it is absolutely clear that the constitutional rights will be conferred on the second family.  In his view they will not apply to the first family.  He said that this is a natural enough situation.  I referred to the circumstances of broken families earlier today when I asked the Minister to consider, in the context of the drafting of this amendment, the position of the family which is left behind and the difficulties which arise in relation to the family home.  It seems quite clear that their rights within the Constitution, in the limited circumstances mentioned by Deputy Shatter and also in any other circumstances which arise, will be transferred to the second family.  The Minister did not get a chance to come back to that but Deputy Shatter dealt with it to him.</P>
      <P>I trust that the Minister accepts that the final provision in the divorce proposal sets out to make the granting of a divorce conditional on the making of proper provision. It states in the last section, &ldquo;the court is satisfied that adequate and proper provision is made having regard to the circumstances.&rdquo;  This applies to the dependent spouse and children.  I take it that the Minister is aware that there is similar provision in divorce legislation in most countries and also that the number of examples of cases in which a divorce has been refused because proper provision was not made is very rare indeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have to congratulate <i>The Irish Times</i> for a very useful article by Joe Carroll on Monday, 19 May.  On researching some of the points arising in last week's debate he found there were three cases since 1969 in which a hardship clause was applied and in which divorces were refused because of this hardship clause.  There was none in Northern Ireland at any time.  He found that Lord Simon, former President of the Divorce <Col N="2009" /> Division of the English High Court, said that the Northern Ireland divorce order, like the English 1969 Act, is utterly unjust to married women in relation to the hardship provision.</P>
    <P>The words &ldquo;making of adequate provision&rdquo; do not seem to have the force that the Minister has suggested.  That being so, is it not the case that this provision realistically cannot be relied on or restored to ensure that dependent spouses and children will be properly provided for?  Would the Minister accept that this provision is purported to operate as a condition of the granting of a divorce, but once the divorce has been granted will the provision not become redundant? Would the Minister accept that this provision in so far as it will have any real effect will have only a once for all effect, at the date of the divorce, and cannot operate later or be relied on later to make any provision for a dependent spouse or child?  If a change in circumstances occurred afterwards it could not be invoked as a means of putting matters right.</P>
    <P>Would the Minister accept that in so far as this provision will have any effect even at the date of divorce, the effect will be limited to dependent spouses and only then, that it would exclude a working wife or a wife capable of working at the time of the divorce?  Does the Minister accept that when a marriage is dissolved the foundation of that marriage will have gone and, therefore, Article 41 will no longer apply to that family?  That is a very important question.  I asked the Minister earlier because marriage based on the family means that the family is based on marriage, if the marriage is dissolved what is the position of the family subsequently? If the Minister does not accept that that is the case, how would Articles 41 and 42 continue to apply to a divorced family when the foundation of that family through marriage has been dissolved?</P>
    <P>We can take an example of what may happen in relation to the family home.  If a married man is earning £15,000 a year and has three children and lives in an average suburban semi-detached house worth £35,000 on which there is a mortgage <Col N="2010" /> of £18,000, and he gets divorced and remarries and has two children by the second wife, what will happen to the family home of the first family.  How will it be defined at that stage?  The Family Home Protection Act provides that the family home cannot be sold without the written consent of either spouse.  Clearly, on the income of this man he could not afford to buy a second house for his new family.</P>
    <P>What will happen in those circumstances? Are the first family to be allowed to continue to live in the family home notwithstanding that it may be jointly owned or owned wholly by the first husband? Can the Minister say if he intends to leave the Family Home Protection Act as it is, and if so, does it not follow that in the event of a divorce the protection of the Act would no longer extend to the divorced wife, she having ceased to be his spouse?  In such a case the sale of the family home could be forced on the divorced wife.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister intend to amend this Act to include the divorced spouse, and if so, would he agree that notwithstanding his good intentions such an amendment to the Act would be likely to have the effect of keeping the first or divorced family in a house and the second family out of one?  In those circumstances would the Minister accept that the State through its legislation would be failing in its pledge to guard with special care second marriages, which would be undoubtedly protected by Article 41?  Therefore, would the Minister not accept that such a provision in the legislation would be likely to be struck down on the grounds that it was unconstitutional?  The wife has no beneficial interest in the house.  She might get no interest, or only a 30 per cent interest, when a decision would be made about the home.  All she would have is a right of tenure in the home. Where then, would the second wife's family home be?  She could claim her right to a family home.  It probably means there would be need for a whole new community property law in which the wife would get half of everything.  Therefore, <Col N="2011" /> the Minister may need to re-define &ldquo;family home&rdquo;.  Once a husband leaves, the home would not be regarded as the family home.</P>
    <P>Then we come to the question of maintenance after divorce.  If a man earns £12,000 and is married with three children and gets divorced, remarried and has two or three children by the second marriage, what will happen in relation to the maintenance of both families?  Under the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act, 1976, the spouse has a right to a maintenance order when there is failure to maintain.  Does the Minister intend to amend that Act to include in its scope a divorced spouse, and does he intend to cater for a divorced spouse on the same basis as the lawful spouse?  Has the Minister considered what will happen if there were a competition between the two families for the very limited income? Clearly, after tax and other outgoings, there would not be enough left to support both families.</P>
    <P>In so far as the Minister may intend eventually to provide even-handed maintenance rights in legislation to deal with both families, would he consider it inevitable that the second family, relying on their undoubted protection under Article 41, would challenge the legislation on the obvious basis that its had failed to fulfil the State's pledge to the second family, now founded on marriage, to guard it with special care and protect it from attack?</P>
    <P>These are two of the areas that could be affected.  In relation to dependent spouses, it has been made very clear in the course of the debate that there is no constitutional protection for a non-dependent spouse, including, possibly, a teacher, secretary or any other working spouse, even though she may be earning far less than the other spouse.  It has been made clear, too, that there would be no inheritance rights at all for a wife or husband. The Minister said allowance will be made for loss of inheritance rights, but no guarantee has been given in this constitutional amendment in relation to inheritance.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2012" /> How can the courts assess a sum for compensation when the value of an inheritance would be assessed at the date of death of the spouse?  In the Government's statement of intentions document there is no reference to any provision for compensation for loss of inheritance rights and the Minister's suggestion earlier today seems to be nothing more than a form of words to cover up the fact that the divorced wife will lose her inheritance rights even when by her efforts she has directly or indirectly contributed to or made possible the development of a farm or business or the acquisition of material assets by the husband.  The element of compensation is important in that respect, but there is no provision in this amendment for it though there is need for a provision for such matters.  The Minister has failed totally to deal with the rights of a spouse who, in the example given, has assisted her husband in running and building up his farm or business as security for their future well-being.</P>
    <P>This is not compensation for inheritance rights.  It requires a constitutional protection for the right to share in the future income from the farm or business that without the help of the wife would not have achieved the same degree of success.  On the basis of the proposed amendment the husband will retain his constitutional property rights in the farm, or business, or other assets which he accrues and of which he cannot be deprived but the wife, to be divorced and abandoned by him when he so decides, has no recognition and no constitutional right for the the contribution she has made during ten, 20 or 30 years.  Such contribution could stem indirectly from the fact that the wife had given up her career to pursue the job of looking after and supporting the family in the home, thus releasing the husband to work at his business, farm or his career.  It could also stem directly from working long hours on the farm.  Failure to make a constitutional provision to protect the spouse in these circumstances is regrettable.  Legal advice I have had is that the matter cannot be catered for properly in legislation, least of all by something that, <Col N="2013" /> according to the Minister, would give some kind of nebulous compensation for loss of what she might have received on the death of her former husband at a future date.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister state how and in what terms it is possible to calculate in money terms the loss of inheritance rights of a spouse at any given date?  Will he state the criteria and the factors to be used in making such a calculation?  Will he say the basis on which the assets of the spouse will be calculated and the means to do that?  Will he say how he proposes the courts should calculate the value to a spouse of his or her loss of inheritance rights as at the date of divorce and as of the date of death of the other spouse?  If the Minister cannot calculate or have a means of calculating these matters, how can be expect the courts subsequently to do so?</P>
    <P>The Minister has said that provision in separation deeds is commonly made to provide for abandonment of inheritance rights.  It is also common for them not to do so.  In the cases that will follow the proposed amendment, all spouses in all cases would lose their rights.  In any case, special considerations are negotiated usually by the wife, using her inheritance rights as a self-protecting bargaining power.  As a result of this amendment she will have no such power.  She will have no constitutional right in that respect.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that in divorce <i>a mensa et thoro</i> the spouse loses inheritance rights.  Yes, that is so because the spouse is the guilty party in a decree granted on the basis of fault but in this instance the innocent spouse can lose rights.  In relation to the matter of succession, the wife loses her rights on the day she is divorced. There is no constitutional requirement or protection for her to be awarded part of a farm or inheritance.  There is no corresponding protection for the first wife on the dissolution of marriage, following the amendment put before us by the Minister.</P>
    <P>Under the present law where there is no will, a widow gets two-thirds while the balance goes to the children and if there are no children the widow gets 100 per <Col N="2014" /> cent.  If there is a will the widow gets one-third when there are children involved and she gets one-half where there are no children.  In all cases she can opt for the family home in whole or in part discharge of her rights.  How does one compensate a person for future inheritance?  Perhaps the wife gave up her career to contribute to the farm and to its development, although the farm is in the name of her husband.  Should wives now get farms, businesses and other assets placed in joint names?  Is that the wise procedure to take at this stage since the Minister has accepted fully that the wife will lose her inheritance rights?</P>
    <P>With regard to orders relating to property, will the Minister indicate clearly the scope and type of orders he envisages the court may make in relation to property where a marriage is dissolved?  In the statement of intent he refers to the intention to make such orders.  Will he set out clearly the guiding principles, or is it the case that there will be no guiding principles? We have asked the Minister many questions in the past few days but he did not seem to think there would be any guiding principles and that really it would be a matter for the courts and the Judiciary to decide these matters.  If that is the case, we have here another issue on which the Minister has not given any guiding principles.  Is it the case that a Circuit Court judge would have an unfettered jurisdiction to carve up and dispose of the property in any way he sees fit?  Will there be some constitutional control in relation to property?  The Minister must answer all of these questions.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister not agree that such situations could have serious implications for the farming community?  For instance, a farm that has been in a family for generations could, at the totally unrestrained discretion of a Circuit Court judge, be taken from that family and given in whole or in part to a person who might have married into the family solely to claim the property upon the dissolution of the marriage.  Has the Minister considered the effect on Article 43 of the Constitution which deals with the right to private property?  Has he taken advice <Col N="2015" /> on the matter and, if so, can he tell us the nature of that advice?</P>
    <P>I have mentioned only some of the issues that arise as a result of the amendment and that need clarification and discussion.  Many more issues could be raised but because of the time limitation it will not be possible to discuss them fully here and that is regrettable.  The change proposed in the Constitution will have wide-ranging effects on these matters. They should be fully considered in this House so that the necessary measures can be taken.</P>
    <P>The only constitutional provision in the proposed amendment in relation to children is for proper provision having regard to the circumstances.  There is no mention of the health, the emotional or physical state of the children or their welfare generally.  Unlike legislation that deals with children, their adoption, care, custody and their interests are not safeguarded as the first and paramount consideration. They are given virtually no consideration in this amendment.  The court will only be concerned with proper provision for them in the circumstances. The mental or physical health of the children or their welfare is not a precondition to a dissolution of a marriage.  It is put down as a precondition.  The text clearly contemplates that the right to divorce is the primary consideration and, once the preliminary conditions have been satisfied, it must be granted by the court, doing the best it can for dependent spouse and children.</P>
    <P>However, if the circumstances are such that serious injury will inevitably be caused to the emotional or physical health of the child, the divorce will be granted since there is no precondition to protect the child's health or welfare. Since no provision can be made for the child in the circumstances, nothing further can be done.  If the Minister seriously intended that adequate and proper provision for the spouse and children should be made a precondition for the granting of divorce then further conditions should have been inserted stating that the court would also have to be satisfied that <Col N="2016" /> adequate and proper provision had been made for any spouse or child and that no material injury to the health and welfare of the children would result as a consequence of the divorce.  It seems as if children are being given little protection under the amendment.</P>
    <P>It is clear that the children of the second marriage will enjoy all the constitutional guarantees given to the family based on marriage.  It would be possible for some future law to discriminate in favour of the children of the second marriage to the disadvantage of those of the first marriage since they would enjoy the special protection afforded to the family under the Constitution.</P>
    <P>These are some of the questions that come to mind.  Obviously there are other matters which could have been discussed in detail and perhaps the Minister might have been able to make changes in the amendment which has been put forward. I trust he listened to what was said here yesterday and today about the terms of the amendment, for example, the use of the word &ldquo;failed&rdquo; and the reasonable possibility of reconciliation and also the &ldquo;adequate and proper provision having regard to the circumstances&rdquo;.  Most of these are terms which in other jurisdictions have proved not to be the strong restrictive kind of terms the Minister suggests they are.  Several Deputies referred to these matters and assumed there would be a Report Stage Debate and that the Minister would take their views into consideration.  In effect, Committee Stage and Report Stage were taken together.  That is regrettable on such a major and serious constitutional amendment.</P>
    <P>The Minister has made it clear that social welfare benefits will change.  The person who is divorced will lose benefits and will be dependent on social assistance. There are a number of implications in this.  It could mean substantial loss of income per week.  It raises major questions about the provision of pension rights in relation to pensions, PRSI and so on.  It does not seem as if the Minister has given these matters much consideration. He does not seem to be anxious to <Col N="2017" /> respond to these questions or give his views in a forthright way on the likely financial consequences for the family.  A deserted wife who receives benefit now and all that goes with it, will no longer be regarded as deserted if her husband divorces her.  She will only receive an allowance which will be means tested.</P>
    <P>I regret that Members did not have time to contribute.  I know that many were anxious to do so.  I did not have time to tease out these matters in detail with the Minister.  We did not have the normal process which takes place during Committee Stage whereby matters raised are considered by the Minister and replied to on Report Stage.  It seems as if the Minister did not have any intention of changing the amendment before us.  His mind was made up and it was just a question of bringing this before the House and having it passed.  Many people made reasoned arguments about safeguards which could have been provided but the Minister seems to have a predetermined view in relation to these matters and passed off the reasonable concerns which people have as if they did not exist.</P>
    <P>This is an important amendment which deserves the fullest possible consideration. The way in which it has been treated is not satisfactory and I regret that.  We have made our position clear in relation to this amendment.  We have discussed it as fully as we could and we will now leave the matter to the people to decide.  Presumably the Minister will speak on platforms.  I do not know if he is one of the directors of the campaign which is being launched.  Our position is different in that we are not participating in any political campaign.  We have discussed the amendment fully and maturely. It is one of the most fundamental and important constitutional issues to come before the House.  When one considers how fundamental and important the issue is, it is a little sad that the whole process has been somewhat truncated and the time which could have been available for it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>My question was to ask the Minister for Justice to make a statement on the disappearance of priceless paintings <Col N="2019" /> from the Alfred Beit Foundation at Russborough House.</P>
      <P>Our country was never at such a low ebb.  National morale has plumbed the depths of despair.  The words of the Napper Tandy song were never more true: &ldquo;Tis the most distressful country that I have ever seen.&rdquo;  That was written when Ireland was part of the British Empire and there might have been an excuse for our situation then.  But I see no excuse today because we have been a sovereign independent State for so long. The Government have done nothing to help the situation.  In fact, the Taoiseach advised the young people as to the measures they should take before emigrating. He has obviously thrown in the sponge. The weather is bad but we will not blame him for that.  However, it is no help to the farming community, together with super-levies and cutbacks in quotas which affect all our people.  Parnell once said that no man has the right to set a boundary to the onward march of the nation. But in the case of the agricultural industry we have capitulated already in Europe. We have accepted boundaries and we have accepted guidelines and we have mutely witnessed the emasculation of the Common Agricultural Policy.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>I am coming to it now. Despite all that adversity we tried to keep our heads up and retain our sense of dignity and our respect and our standing among the other nations.  It has not been easy.  Then, to cap it all, we learn of the robbery from Russborough House of 17 paintings of the Alfred Beit collection, some of the finest paintings in the world and probably the greatest private collection in the world.  The fact that several of them have been recovered near a stolen vehicle by some fishermen near Manor Kilbride is poor consolation.  Apparently the ones that were found were the least valuable and the robbers kept the ones <Col N="2020" /> they wanted, among them the Vermeer, the Goya, the Gainsborough and a Reubens or two.  They are priceless treasures and they cannot be properly valued at all.  The fact that the discovered pictures were left out in the open beside the stolen vehicle is an indication of the lack of care afforded the paintings.  One must be concerned that some of the recovered art treasures were already torn and damaged so that we must all be concerned for the safe return of the remainder.  Our country was very fortunate to be the recipient of this collection.</P>
      <P>Twelve years ago the nation was shocked by the first robbery in Russborough House.  It was then classed as the greatest art robbery ever.  Thankfully the paintings were recovered and the pseudo-patriots were brought to justice. But the response by Sir Alfred Beit was a very generous and heartwarming one. He handed over the house and all his priceless paintings and the estate to an art foundation working on behalf of this nation.  It was a wonderful gesture and the paintings were on view to the nation not alone in Russborough House but on loan to the National Gallery.  After today we must ask ourselves were we worthy of these treasures.  They were stolen before and recovered after a long period. Luckily, on that occasion, they were not damaged, apart from some rubbing off of varnish.  I sincerely hope we will be as lucky this time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must compliment the Garda for their prompt answer to the alarm.  A squad car was in the area and they were assured by the administrator then that no harm had been done.  Apparently the sophisticated alarm system did go off the first time but must have been by-passed subsequently when the real raid took place.  It appears that the thieves were able to drive across two fields, break a window and a shutter and back in the car or cars to the french window which provided a ready-made platform for them, load up with the paintings and leave at their leisure.  That is simply not good enough.  Did we deserve this gift at all?  There is an old saying: &ldquo;Fool me <Col N="2021" /> once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Indeed the Irish nation is shamed.  We are trying to promote investment in our country and we in Kildare are particularly involved in the bloodstock industry where millions of pounds are involved. Many people from outside the country have invested huge sums of money here and many more are anxious to do likewise. But they need to be reassured. Russborough was burgled in 1974 and Shergar was stolen later, and then Russborough again in 1986.  This is no help to encouraging investment here. Last March there was a huge art robbery in Ardsallagh House near Fethard and there was another nasty incident in our own county where valuable thoroughbreds got loose or were allowed loose in their boxes in the nearby stud and had to be put down because of injuries.  One wonders if the Coalition Cabinet itself is safe at Barretstown Castle because this is only a stone's throw from Russborough.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>It appears that the Cabinet <Col N="2022" /> think more of themselves as far as security is concerned than they do of the paintings. We are making headlines in the world press but for the wrong reasons. We have murders, sectarian violence in the Six Counties, kidnappings, muggings. The Minister's own wife was an unfortunate victim on the very day he became Minister for Justice.  We have ransom demands, and robberies are a daily happening down here.  We need to restore the image of Ireland in the perception of the world.  There is great goodwill in the outside world for this country.</P>
      <P>When Shergar was stolen I raised this matter in the House and there were sniggers from some of the Members.  I think at this stage even the ranks of Tuscany can appreciate what losses like this mean to Ireland.  Shergar's owner, the Aga Khan, reacted manfully to his frightful experience.  He sent his next classic winner to stand at stud in Ballymanny. He installed his own highly sophisticated security system at the stud giving around the clock security and around the clock employment and he continued to invest millions in upgrading Sheshoon and Ballymanny.  I must compliment him on adopting that attitude.  He has shown his true colours in the midst of difficulty and I am glad he is having lots of winners too. That is the type of pragmatic patriotism we need and he is not an Irishman.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sir Alfred Beit reacted in the very same way after his first robbery.  He handed over the collection for Ireland's benefit and even tonight he is the first person in the field to offer a reward for the return of the paintings.  He has not offered a ransom but a reward for the safe return of our property which he presented to us as a gift.  I heard some smart alec say here that it was wrong for any man to have valuables worth millions hanging on the wall.  They are the idealists who are anxious to divide up the world's wealth. I did not see too many of them rush in to compliment him when he made the generous gesture to the nation which he did.  Now, we do not appear to have the capacity to look after this ourselves. When I see Ministers with Garda drivers, extra protection and round-the-clock <Col N="2023" /> patrols I wonder if we have our priorities right.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been pointed out by Deputy Power that in this case there is, and I use his own phrase, a sophisticated alarm system in place, an alarm system which is connected to the local Garda station and a security system in place around the House.  I think, quite honestly, that Deputy Power is not doing anything to assist the situation or to prevent a recurrence by making what I regard as totally inconsequential remarks about the level of security the Garda authorities think it appropriate to provide for members of the Government, Members of this House or anybody else.  That has nothing to do <Col N="2024" /> with this case and I am very disappointed that my constituency colleague should feel that he has to drag these red herrings across the case.</P>

      <P>The pig industry is going through a difficult period at present.  Producers have experienced declining margins while processors have had to contend with a depressed market situation, both at home and abroad.  The recent introduction of an EC scheme of aids for private storage has gone some way towards arresting a further decline in the market.</P>
      <P>At factory level, there is an urgent need for rationalisation and modernisation of slaughtering and processing plants.  Significant grant aid &mdash; both IDA and FEOGA &mdash; is available to suitable applicants for these purposes.  The aim is to increase competitiveness on all markets. However, the decision to invest rests with individual firms who will be primarily influenced by prospective returns on investment.</P>
      <P>At the marketing end, the services of CTT are available to help with marketing arrangements.  The main initiative in this area must, however, come from the individual factories which must be prepared to devote more resources to the proper marketing of pigmeat.</P>

    <P>The amount recouped from the European Community for disease eradication expenditure in the period was £12.2 million.</P>
    <P>Any evaluation of this expenditure must have regard to the essential role of the schemes in preserving market outlets for livestock and livestock products and to the effects of productivity in agriculture of the removal over the period of hundreds of thousands of diseased animals together with prevention of disease spread.  On this basis I am satisfied that the expenditure has been necessary and worthwhile.</P>

I have received many similar requests for concessions in relation to a variety of other services the cumulative cost of acceding to which would be significant. There are not sufficient grounds for specifically extending the concession to ice rinks outside of its extension to these other services.  I will, however, be reviewing the position in the normal course in the context of next year's budget.</P>

      <P>Entitlement to unemployment assistance is dependent on means and levels of payments are normally fixed at budget time.  In any particular case the rate of assistance payable is the appropriate maximum rate less the weekly means assessed, including in the case of single persons living at home the value of board and lodgings.  Statistics are not kept in such a way as would enable the average rate of assistance paid to single persons living at home to be determined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite the very difficult financial situation, the Government has more than fulfilled its commitment to maintain the value of social welfare payments and has in fact provided real increases in the levels of those payments.  In regard to unemployment assistance in particular, the Government made provision this year and in each of the last three years for higher levels of payment to people who have been unemployed for 15 months or <Col N="1862" /> more.  In the period mid-May 1983 to mid-May 1987 the increase in the consumer price index is expected to be of the order of 23 per cent.  In that period the long term unemployed will have got increases of about 40 per cent, other long term recipients, such as pensioners, will have got increases amounting to 33 per cent and short term beneficiaries will have received increases amounting to 30 per cent.</P>

      <P>Entitlement to unemployment assistance is dependent on a claimant being the holder of a qualification certificate and to obtain a qualification certificate a person must satisfy certain conditions including an assessment of means.  The person concerned claimed unemployment assistance from 12 August, 1985 and her case was referred to a social welfare officer for investigation of her means.  She was not available for interview initially but, subsequently in December 1985 she made herself available for interview.  Following the investigation she was assessed with nil means.</P>
      <P>Due to a clerical error she had not been paid unemployment assistance due to her for the period 12 August 1985 to 29 August 1985 during which she signed the unemployed register.  The weekly entitlement in her case is £31.75 and arrears due for the relevant period will be paid to her this week.  She ceased to sign the unemployed register after 29 August 1985.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed disability benefit from 3 July 1981 and payment was disallowed initially from 19 December 1983 following an examination by a medical referee on 24 November 1983 who expressed the opinion that he was capable of work.  He was subsequently examined by medical referees on 1 March 1984, 13 December 1984 and 19 September 1985 who all considered him to be capable of work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Appeals officers have considered his case on three separate occasions and have decided that he is not incapable of work <Col N="1864" /> within the meaning of the Social Welfare Acts from 19 December 1983 to 17 May 1984, from 18 May 1984 to 17 June 1985 and again from 18 June 1985 to 18 October 1985.  The decision of an appeals officer is final and can only be altered in the light of new facts or fresh evidence.</P>
    <P>The person concerned has continued to submit medical evidence and benefit has again been disallowed from 19 October 1985.  He has been informed of this latest disallowance and if he wishes to appeal he should inform the Department in writing, and he will be referred for another medical examination.  His entitlement to benefit will then be reviewed on receipt of the result of this examination.</P>
    <P>Supplementary Welfare Allowance was suspended from 29 April 1986, because of the failure of the person concerned to disclose details of his means.  If he is prepared to give the community welfare officer the information requested he should contact him, and the decision to suspend payment of supplementary welfare allowance will be reviewed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mrs. Hussey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The person concerned claimed disability benefit from 11 April 1986.  She is not qualified for benefit as regulations provide that where a claimant has no contributions paid or credited for any two consecutive contribution years preceeding her claim, she cannot qualify for payment of disability benefit, or the award of credited contributions in respect of periods of incapacity for work, until she has a further 26 weeks of insurable employment for which the appropriate contributions have been paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1865" /> According to the records of the Department, the person concerned had no contributions paid or credited in the years 1982-83 and 1983-84 and has not had 26 weeks of insurable employment since that time.  If her means are insufficient to meet her needs she may be entitled to supplementary welfare allowance or disabled person's maintenance allowance and in this regard she should contact her local community welfare officer.</P>

One of the conditions for receipt of the grant is that the deceased, or spouse of the deceased, must have had at least 26 paid contributions since entry into insurance or since 1 October 1970 (whichever is the later).  Entitlement to the grant in this case is based on the insurance record of his late father who died in 1949 before the death grant scheme was introduced.</P>

Arrangements are being made to have his case determined by an appeals officer at the earliest available opportunity.</P>

      <P>When these inquiries were completed the case was submitted to the chief appeals officer for determination at the earliest available opportunity.  When the date and venue of the oral hearing of his case have been arranged the person concerned will be informed as quickly as possible.

      <P>Invalidity pension is payable to insured persons who satisfy the contribution conditions and who are permanently incapable of work.  One of the contribution conditions is that the claimant must have not less than 48 contributions paid <Col N="1867" /> or credited in the last complete contribution year before the date of the claim.</P>
      <P>The contribution year at present governing entitlement to invalidity pension is the period from April 1985 to April 1986.  According to the records of the Department there are only class K contributions registered in respect of the person concerned for this period.  These contributions are paid at a modified rate and do not give cover for social welfare benefits. The person concerned is not therefore qualified for the receipt of invalidity pension.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Regulations provide that an invalidity pension cannot be paid in addition to a contributory widow's pension.  If the person concerned were transferred to an invalidity pension it would be paid to <Col N="1868" /> her at the rate of £45.30 and both her contributory widow's pension and disability benefit would cease to be paid to her.  She would therefore have a cash reduction of £20.70 per week in her income from the Department if she were transferred to the pension.  Invalidity pensioners are entitled to a free travel pass.  Some such pensioners are also entitled to a free electricity allowance, free (black and white) television licence and free telephone rental allowance.  The position has been explained to the person concerned and she has been requested to say whether, in the circumstances, she wishes to be transferred to invalidity pension.</P>

Many of the high losses incurred in individual mountain flocks <Col N="1872" /> were due to poor management and overstocking arising from failure to cull older ewes (the main casualties) last Autumn.</P>
      <P>Between mid-December 1985 and early May 1986 advances of ewe premium amounting to £7.2 million were paid to 23,600 flockowners in the disadvantaged areas including the mountain area where the problems were worst.  I have made arrangements to bring forward the payment of the balance of ewe premium in the disadvantaged areas, and the full premium outside these areas to next month and to July as inspections are completed.

      <Col N="1875" /> I am satisfied that we have taken full advantage of the scheme and this is evidenced by the fact that applications for aid have always exceeded the funds available.  While some firms are slow in claiming the grants awarded to them all of the grants are eventually taken up or are re-allocated to other Irish firms.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Dukes) Alan Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Dukes)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Garda authorities inform me that they are not aware of any problem of the dimension suggested by the Deputy and have not received complaints to this effect.  A serious problem existed up to the middle of 1983 but I am informed that this has not been so since the old derelict buildings were demolished and the property better enclosed at that time.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, there are many open spaces, some of which adjoin the property, to which access may be gained by persons disposed to create nuisance of the sort outlined in the question. Nevertheless, I am assured that the property is not the focal point of any such problem.</P>
      <P>The former St. Vincent's School at Hart's Corner, Philbsborough, Dublin and about 7 acres was purchased in August 1980 and, as stated in a reply to a parliamentary question on 16 October 1980, was intended to be the location for a Staff Training Centre for the Prison Service and for 60 official staff houses to replace old staff housing in the North Circular Road, which is gone beyond economic repair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Clearance of the site and proper enclosure, preliminary to construction, was to have commenced in 1981 but the financial stringency which began to apply around that time made it impossible to incur the <Col N="1878" /> expenditure which the work would have involved and also caused the project to be postponed.</P>
    <P>I am of course aware of the fact that money was spent not only on the railings but on other protective works to prevent misuse of the property by delinquents. Various representations, including representations by the Deputy, had been made to my Department with a view to having such measures taken.</P>
    <P>The whole question of providing official accommodation for Prison Service personnel was reconsidered in 1981-82 and, in view of the altered economic climate, the expense of providing official housing that would be maintainable at low cost and &mdash; on the other hand &mdash; the greatly improved earnings of prison officers, it was decided, as part of a wider policy not to provide further official houses for staff, that replacement housing for the North Circular Road houses would not be undertaken.</P>
    <P>Recently it was decided that Beladd House, Portlaoise, which was originally intended as an official staff residence for unmarried personnel and a staff canteen, would be adapted as a staff Training Centre.</P>
    <P>If resources become available to proceed with the second prison planned for Portlaoise, it may be necessary to make Beladd House available for unmarried officers and general staff catering.  In those circumstances, present indications are that it would be desirable to have the Hart's Corner property available to relocate the staff training facility in Dublin.  Furthermore, the site is the only substantial undeveloped site located so conveniently to the custodial complex at Mountjoy and to Arbour Hill and may be required for other ancillary facilities related to them, apart altogether from staff training.  Incidentally, the property is not envisaged as a site for custodial accommodation.</P>
    <P>It is not possible in present circumstances, when restrictions on financial outlay for capital purposes still apply, to say when further development of the property is likely to commence.</P>
