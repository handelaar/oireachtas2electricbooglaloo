    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. a1:</P>
    <P>In page 2, before section 1, to insert the following new section:</P>
    <P>1.  &mdash; The following section is hereby substituted for section 22 of the Act of 1965&mdash;</P>
    <P>22  &mdash;(1)  Where extradition is requested for the purpose of proceeding against any person, to whom this section applies, for an offence, the requesting country shall produce signed statements of witnesses, which, if the person were being prosecuted for a similar or corresponding offence under the laws of the State in respect of an act committed in the State, would be required to be tendered at a preliminary examination before a Justice of the District Court, in order that an order returning the person for trial on indictment might be made.</P>
    <P>(2)  An order for commital under section 29 of this Act shall not be made unless the Justice is satisfied on the basis of the said statements and other documents that the person claimed <Col N="3176" /> would be returned for trial in the State if the offence had taken place in the State.</P>
    <P>(3)  This section applies to persons who are Irish citizens and to any other persons to whom the relevant extradition provisions provide that it shall apply'.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Last night the Minister gave us a clear statement of the position he is taking in relation to the certification of warrants to be used for the extradition of Irish citizens.  He said that the agreement is that a warrant for the return of a fugitive would be sought only where the Crown prosecution service in England and Wales or the Director of Public Prosecutions in Northern Ireland is satisfied that there is a clear probability of prosecution, founded on a sufficiency of admissible evidence.  It seems that the arrangement the Minister is coming to, which probably is not of any great value because it is not a statutory arrangement, only an administrative arrangement, will have no statutory authority.  Nevertheless, it is an arrangement that sets aside the authority of the Irish courts. That authority, in our view, should not be subsumed under the DPP in Northern Ireland or the Crown prosecution service in England and Wales.  Both are prosecuting authorities, whose vested interest is in prosecuting.  Surely in these circumstances the Government will be failing in their duty to vindicate the rights of Irish citizens through such an arrangement, because the courts here would be used only as a rubber stamp for the certification, or whatever one wishes to call it.  The Minister called it that in a press releases but he is calling it something else now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems very clear that the Government are ignoring their duty and setting aside their obligation to vindicate the rights of Irish citizens.  I do not believe there is a political consensus in Ireland for that approach.  I do not believe that even people in the Minister's party would <Col N="3177" /> support and endorse that approach if they were made fully aware of it.  If this Bill had been given the time which a Bill of its importance requires, the Minister would have been advised by his own backbenchers and by learned and experienced members of his party that this is a foolish step and most inadvisable.</P>
    <P>One would have thought the Minister would be a little wiser in the light of recent events.  It has been pointed out clearly that these and similar functions are judicial and that it is not acceptable to have an administrative arrangement to cover them unless it is in line with the Constitution.  In the Supreme Court on Friday last five Supreme Court judges sat &mdash; Judges Finlay, Walsh, Griffin, Hederman and McCarthy &mdash; and judgment was given by the Chief Justice in the case of the State, at the prosecution of Garda John Clarke as prosecutor <i>versus</i> District Justice Maura Roche and Peter Senezio, responding.  The Chief Justice said:</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that on the terms of section 10 of the 1851 Act it is an inescapable conclusion that the issue of a summons upon the making of a complaint was a judicial as distinct from an administrative act.</P>
    <P>In other words, the issuing of a summons, whether for car parking or drunken driving, was a judicial function, and whatever may have been the position in the past the Minister now would need to make the appropriate changes to ensure that the judicial nature of this function is fully recognised.  That must ring a warning bell with the Minister in relation to the actions he is taking on the extradition of Irish citizens.  There is another very interesting case, Maher <i>versus</i> the Attorney General, 1973, reported in <i>Irish Reports</i>, 140:</P>
    <P>The administration of justice which, in criminal matters, is confined exclusively by our Constitution to the courts and judges set up under the Constitution necessarily reserves to those courts and judges the determination of all the essential ingredients of any offence charged against an accused <Col N="3178" /> person.  In so far as the statutory provision purports to remove such determination from the judges or the courts appointed and established under the Constitution, it is an invalid infringement of the judicial power.</P>
    <P>That was the judgment given in Maher <i>versus</i> the Attorney General in 1973 and is very relevant to the steps the Minister is taking now.</P>
    <P>In the case of the State &mdash; Lynch <i>versus</i> District Justice Ballagh &mdash; the Supreme Court held, among other things, in May 1986 that &ldquo;the Garda Síochána, is not in any sense part of the judicial system nor does it participate in the exercise of the judicial powers of the District Court in its administration of justice.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister is proposing that there be some form of certification by the British authorities coming before the Garda Commissioner here and that, presumably, the Commissioner and the Attorney General &mdash; as the Minister mentioned in his remarks yesterday &mdash; would examine this case to ascertain whether there was a reasonable one to be answered.  But, in putting forward this kind of scheme, in effect the Minister is proposing that prosecuting authorities here, however great may be their individual integrity, would be the people who would decide whether there was a <i>prima facie</i> kind of case or one which is the sort of case that these amendments seek to have written into the Bill.  In so doing the Minister is in danger of running against the clear signal from the Supreme Court as recently as May 1986 in the case of the State &mdash; Lynch <i>versus</i> District Justice Ballagh.  That judgment makes it very clear that &ldquo;the Garda Síochána is not in any sense part of the judicial system nor does it participate in the exercise of the judicial powers of the District Court in its administration of justice&rdquo;.  The Minister is at least suggesting that some form of quasi-judicial function would be given to the Garda in this respect.  In so far as that decision is in any way judicial surely it must be left to the courts.  It would appear to be a matter properly within the confine of the courts.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="3179" /> Until March 1984 the power to send persons forward for trial was given to the Director of Public Prosecutions under section 62 of the Courts of Justice Act, 1936.  That provision was amended by section 3 of the Prosecution of Offences Act, 1974, which power was exercisable where the district justice did not send a person forward for trial.  Therefore, in a case where the district justice decided not to send a person forward for trial the Director of Public Prosecutions had an overriding power.  In March 1984, in a judgment given by the then Chief Justice O'Higgins, the Supreme Court held that that power was unconstitutional because it gave to the Director of Public Prosecutions a power that was an invasion of the judicial demesne and an attempt to exercise the judicial power of the Government otherwise than by the organ of the State established for this purpose by the law.  If such power in the hands of the Director of Public Prosecutions was seen to be unconstitutional, surely the giving of similar powers in relation to an extradition must also be unconstitutional.  This is a matter to which the Minister would need to devote attention.</P>
    <P>Again and again the courts have said that the exercise of judicial power is for the courts.  In that respect, if there is to be a decision as to whether there is what is in effect a <i>prima facie</i> case against a person whose extradition is sought, it seems quite clear that that decision should be taken by the courts rather than by administrative or executive officers either here or in the requesting country.</P>
    <P>Having listened to the Minister I am not convinced of his argument.  The case made in favour of a <i>prima facie</i> case being presented before the courts is a strong one.  I believe our amendment meets these requirements.  I believe also that it is the least we should offer our citizens in the circumstances in which they may find themselves if there is a request made for an extradition.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) of our amendment says:</P>
    <P>No order for the extradition of an <Col N="3180" /> Irish citizen shall be made unless the District Court is satisfied, on the evidence before it, that there is a sufficient case which would warrant the sending forward for trial of that person...</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley points to the fact that, in his amendment, he talks about statements being laid before the court and that such would be adequate.  He suggested that the inclusion of the words &ldquo;on the evidence before it&rdquo; would necessitate the production of witnesses.  That is not the case; it merely leaves the District Court on the evidence, which would normally be the book of evidence and the written statements which are required to base a decision.  Of course one could conceivably have a situation in which the District Court might not find the evidence before it reliable, or might question it. We have suggested, further down in our amendment, at subsection (3) (c):</P>
    <P>A document served pursuant to paragraph (b) of this subsection shall be received in evidence without further proof if it purports to be signed or certified by a judge, magistrate or other judicial officer of the requesting country or place and to be authenticated by the oath of some witness.</P>
    <P>One could contend that there could be certain circumstances in which the justice in the District Court might want to see something more.  That would be a matter for the District Court.  It would be a matter for the court to be satisfied on the evidence before it that there was a basis for the extradition of an Irish citizen.  The Minister has pointed out that in most cases this would in effect be much the same as what would happen under his proposal.  If so, why is he so reluctant to accept these amendments?  We believe this is a reasonable proposal and nothing the Minister has said has changed our view.  Since we are now reviewing the law in relation to extradition, this is the time to review it fully and properly and to build into our extradition laws the measures which we believe are appropriate.  The provision about which I am speaking is <Col N="3181" /> one we believe to be essential and we will be pressing our amendment.  It has been very well debated in the House in the time available, but the Minister's approach would appear to be settled above his head and consequently he is not prepared to accept any amendments. Therefore we will have to divide on the matter.</P>
    <P>We have another amendment which deals with the question of fair trial and fair proceedings in the jurisdiction to which an Irish person would be taken on extradition.  There will be an opportunity to discuss that aspect under that amendment. As far as the <i>prima facie</i> requirement is concerned, we stand by our amendment.  We believe it is appropriate and right and we will be voting in favour of it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate on reform of the law on extradition has underlined the shortcomings of this Government perhaps more clearly than many other issues in recent times.  Every party in this House have, as far as I know, stated unequivocally that they support the ratification of the European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism.  The Government have rocked themselves and their conscience into a fretful sleep by clutching in a warm embrace what turns out to be a complete falsehood &mdash; that the provision of a <i>prima facie</i> case safeguard would make extradition unworkable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is manifestly clear that the Minister is ill at ease both with the concepts and the technicalities of this issue.  One had only to observe him here at length yesterday to realise the truth of what I say and the extent of his uneasiness.  One has only to look at the empty benches behind him today, as yesterday, to realise the lack of support for his views.  The advice the Minister has received is clearly to the effect that any safeguard is a potential loophole and that to maintain any small constitutional protection for our citizens is to make this country a bolthole, allegedly, for international terrorism.  That advice is wrong.  The intellectual bankruptcy of the Minister's position has been <Col N="3182" /> exposed by this debate.  His preoccupation with loopholes and boltholes has blinded him to the real issues.</P>
    <P>We are entitled to ask this question: if a <i>prima facie</i> requirement effectually eviscerates the extradition process, why is it that this Government and this House agreed to such an arrangement in the case of the recent Irish-US extradition treaty, certainly in the case of Irish requests to extradite from America, while conceding that no such requirement would bind the United States in seeking the extradition of Irish citizens?  If that requirement makes extradition unworkable, why did the Government seek and get the approval of this House?  If it is unworkable within Europe or among the signatories to these two Conventions, how suddenly does it become workable where the United States is concerned?  Why is it that both the United States and Britain, the people who are supposed to be so opposed to safeguards of this kind, have such a safeguard in their respective arrangements in regard to extradition? Why is it that this Government in their dealings with the United States agreed on a unilateral basis to a procedure which they now claim makes extradition unworkable, not just in a European context but, according to the Minister, in any context?  That question has been asked repeatedly during this debate but it has never been answered.  Unhappily, it looks now as if it will not be answered.  The fact that it is not answered does not obviate the need for an answer and it underlines the untenable position the Minister and the Government are now seeking to take up.  It is a position they do not wish to adopt but it is forced upon them by external pressures greater than themselves.</P>
    <P>There is a summary on the front page of this morning's edition of <i>The Irish Times</i> written by their political correspondent, Mr. Cooney.  He says that essentially this boils down to the fact that if the Government make any change at all in this arrangement as dictated to them by the British, then the British will regard it as a breach of faith in respect of the Anglo-Irish Agreement; that this is part <Col N="3183" /> and parcel of the Anglo-Irish Agreement, while extradition is only subsidiary to it and of lesser importance.  It is tragic that the Government should choose to use a matter of this kind for a different purpose.</P>
    <P>The answer to the question I posed about how extradition is workable with the United States but not with Britain and how extradition is workable as between Britain and the United States but not between Britain and Ireland is that the requirement for <i>prima facie</i> evidence does not make extradition unworkable here or anywhere else.  It merely makes it slightly less easy than the slot machine legal process to which this Government have apparently become addicted.  It is slightly less easy, slightly less automatic and puts some colour of judicial consideration into the matter rather than leaving it as an arrangement between policeman or civil servants for automatic extradition whether there is sufficient evidence or not.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his reply to the Second Stage debate put forward the proposition that if amendments of the type that I and others were suggesting were made, extradition would no longer be a reality and we would be seeking to give a safe haven in the Republic to those who carried out the Darkley murders.  That is an idiotic suggestion for the Minister for Justice or anybody else to make.  Tragically, it is the Minister's belief that if a warrant is sent here from Britain or Northern Ireland charging people with those murders, whether or not there is any evidence they should be automatically extradited.  If a warrant arrived here for me tomorrow morning charging me with the murder of six people in a church in Darkley in County Armagh, the Minister for Justice says that I have no entitlement to have any evidence or statement produced against me, that all that can be looked into is whether the technicalities are correct, or whether the warrant is properly signed, whether it was properly sworn and whether the approprite words have been written on the form and whether those procedures have <Col N="3184" /> been certified by the DPP in the North and the Attorney General in England. The Minister for Justice regards that as justice, even if there is no evidence.  The Minister says we are not entitled to evidence. Even if I had nothing to do with the Darkley murders I can be extradited and so can any other citizen who had nothing to do with them.</P>
    <P>What kind of thinking is it that reduces this whole process to one of purely automatic movement of people around on the basis of a warrant without evidence or a <i>prima facie</i> case?  There are many good reasons why we should have a <i>prima facie</i> case but there are no good reasons why we should not have one.  Good reasons have not been given because they cannot be given.  The Minister's absent friends who support him on this issue are not prepared to come in and say so because they know they have lost the argument, as the Minister has lost the argument, in so far as they understand the argument at all.  The Minister and his supporters have not, will not and cannot advance a single argument as to why it should be possible to send an Irish citizen in custody to await trial on indictment in a foreign jail for 18 or 24 months without any safeguards or a <i>prima facie</i> case, when that same citizen could not be sent for trial here for the theft even of a packet of cigarettes without the establishment of a <i>prima facie</i> case against him.  This shameful anomaly cannot be explained by the Minister nor by his press handlers or his Cabinet colleagues.  It drives one to a sad conclusion that this Bill is intended for a very different purpose from the apparent reason of acceding to a European Convention on terrorism.  In off-the-record briefings to journalists, the Government are prepared to concede that this Bill is regarded as a <i>quid pro quo</i> part of the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  It was said that the Bill would be passed here in consideration of a reform in the Diplock courts and the rejection of such reforms by the British Government will require a rethink by the press handlers about this argument for passing the Bill.  It is no secret that the commencement section <Col N="3185" /> was designed to pressure the British into making concessions.</P>

      <P>The amendments before the House really go to the kernel of this whole thing.  I accept that speeches on it have been wider than might be normal on Committee Stage but if this set of amendments, mine and the others, which are roughly similar, are turned down, the Bill in effect will be passed in a way that is grossly unsatisfactory and which is widely recognised as being grossly unsatisfactory.  I do not blame the Minister for not making a real effort to defend his position, because it is impossible to defend it, but the consequences of this if passed will be extremely serious.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last night the Minister sought to deal in some fashion with the amendment in my name, and if one consults the record as to what he said, apart from a general observation more or less to the effect that it is unworkable he gave no reason for turning it down.  The Minister advanced the old argument about the British never using a <i>prima facie</i> requirement.  That position and those statements of the Minister are demonstrably false.  They are clearly incorrect and if the Minister has no valid inherent reason for turning down this amendment, he should not do it.  The Minister made a rather curious suggestion, that because the amendment entails statements of evidence against the defendant being handed to him and to the court and being considered by the court, the defendant would be put at a disadvantage because witnesses from <Col N="3186" /> abroad would not be available for crossexamination. I pointed out to the Minister that under a case decided here last year, even in an Irish case where someone has been returned for trial here, he does not have the right to cross-examine the witnesses.</P>
    <P>To say that the defendant is at a disadvantage because he is given details of the offence against him, and that therefore this amendment must be refused is laughable, because he has had the enormous advantage that he will have the evidence against him disclosed to him and to a district justice and he will have the advantage that a district justice will have to adjudicate as to whether or not there is a <i>prima facie</i> case, before he decides to extradite him.  How one can argue that therefore the defendant is at a disadvantage is beyond me.  The Minister for Justice has this facility to give out something, whether it is right or wrong, as if that were the only thing that could be said about the matter and that therefore it must be accepted.  The entire weight of the evidence and the entire weight of the argument is against him.</P>
    <P>The Minister should throw off the shackles of the external pressures to which he is now subjected and realise that long after the Anglo-Irish Agreement has hopefully changed into another form, and is no longer relevant, this Bill if it is enacted in this form will remain our law. This is grossly unsatisfactory and that is pretty well the unanimous decision of anyone who has examined it.  For that reason, I appeal to the Minister to accept this amendment.  If there are any technical deficiencies in it, let the Minister say so and we will rectify them, but the Minister should and will have to accept the spirit of this amendment.  If he fails to accept the spirit of this amendment he will demonstrate that the real decision-making power is neither in this House nor in the Government but somewhere else.  This matter where the fundamental rights and liberties of Irish citizens are at stake is being used in order to achieve something greater.  I say to the Minister that that is too high a price to pay to <Col N="3187" /> achieve it.  You cannot trade the fundamental liberties of your own citizens to achieve something else.  If you do, you will pay a heavy price for it as will many of our own citizens.  I do not think it is something which is going to be tolerated in the longer term.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Malley is engaging in a fairly normal and on the whole a fairly acceptable parliamentary tactic in that he has tried both last night and today a form of parliamentary guerilla warfare which is not going to work.  I have been through it with the Deputy on a number of Finance Bills in the past.  It did not impress me particularly then and it does not impress me particularly now and I will not be put off my stroke by these kinds of waspish and arrogant comments from Deputy O'Malley.  I am not going to follow up his comments about octopi and clouds of ink because they are totally irrelevant to the argument.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Malley should simply accept the fact that there are occasions in a debate like this when the Minister in reply is not going to agree with him or look at the arguments.  There are also occasions in a debate like this when the Minister is going to spend some time talking about points made by somebody else and if that does not happen to suit Deputy O'Malley it is just too bad.  Therefore, I am not going to get into that area or rise to that kind of bait.  If Deputy O'Malley thought I was uneasy yesterday during the course of the debate he seems to have been a great deal more uneasy because he was in and out of the Chamber like a yo-yo. It is not relevant to the discussion we are having.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley again this morning suggested that I was wrong in contending that in a preliminary hearing a person before the court has the right to examine witnesses.  In the case to which he refered, the State (Sherry) <i>versus</i> District Justice Hubert Wine which was reported in <i>The Irish Law Reports Monthly</i>, volume 5, No. 4, there is a lot of <Col N="3188" /> interesting comment from Judge McCarthy in giving his judgment.  He said for example, and I will limit myself to this:</P>
    <P>The plain meaning of s. 7 (2) is that either the prosecutor or the accused or both of them is entitled &ldquo;to require the attendance before the justice of any person, whether included in the supplied list of witnesses or not, and to examine him by way of sworn deposition&rdquo;. This admits of no meaning other than the right of either party to have a listed witness attend, such witness is to be examined by way of sworn deposition and may be cross-examined or re-examined on his evidence.</P>
    <P>There is a great deal more but that establishes that the person is entitled to require the attendance before the justice of any person whether included in the supplied list of witnesses or not.  To the extent that Deputy O'Malley took a different view of that and playing on the basis of a different view that a difficulty I suggested would exist with the procedure he is requiring, he is just wrong.</P>
    <P>I have also made the point that our extradition procedures with the UK do not deprive the requested person of a committal hearing.  That is relevant to the question which Deputy Taylor raised. The procedure as we have it requires, first of all, that in Northern Ireland or in Britain a warrant be issued by a judicial authority, a magistrate.  Information must be laid before the magistrate and sworn.  We have provided as I indicated to the House that that warrant should be scrutinised and the application be scrutinised for a sufficiency of evidence by the Crown prosecution service in the UK and that it should be confirmed by the attorney general in the UK.  It should be sent over here for execution.  The person who is requested under our law has the right to contest the execution of the warrant and to go before the court here, in which case the court here makes a decision on the basis of the law on whether or not extradition will take place.</P>
    <P>If extradition takes place that person <Col N="3189" /> goes to the requesting jurisdiction and in the case of the UK that person in the requesting jurisdiction goes before a court for a commital hearing before the trial can take place.  Nobody can suggest that that process in any way takes away the rights of that requested person to have his case examined judically in a court and to allow him the freedom he should have to make his own case in his own defence.</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods' suggestion that there was in some way something unconstitutional about all of that is totally unfounded.  The procedures we operate in relation to the backing of warrants have been examined on many occasions by our courts and they have been held to be constitutional.  As I have said, they are procedures which provide for a necessary degree of inspection and supervision all the way through the system.  There is no question of any administrative arrangement carrying out a judicial function and if Deputy Woods would simply look back through the procedure he would come to the conclusion that that is the case.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley claims that the system set out in Part III of the 1965 Act is not appropriate to two sovereign independent countries.  I can see no reason whatever why two sovereign independent countries should not agree to a system like this or should not decide to maintain a system like this.  It is a reciprocal arrangement which puts the same obligations on both sides and produces the same result for both sides as I indicated in my statement last evening. Deputy O'Malley has put forward a different system which would create obstacles and which would not be in conformity with our obligations under international conventions.  Deputy O'Malley keeps asserting that his system would be. The plain fact of the matter is that it would not and I do not think there is any room for doubt on that.</P>
    <P>If we are to change the system and review it fundamentally as Deputy O'Malley and now Deputy Woods seem to want to do, I am quite happy to participate in that, but they will have to find some other method of approach as the <Col N="3190" /> one they are proposing is not in conformity with our international obligations. It is a departure for no good reason from the system we already have.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Malley may make his argument in relation to one bit of his proposal or in relation to another bit of his proposal.  I am looking at his proposal taken all together which is the only sensible way to look at his amendment. I do not think that I should go into any more detail into the difficulties that would arise in the kind of system that Deputy O'Malley has tried to produce.  I mentioned them yesterday in relation to what would happen in a court here if it were looking at that <i>prima facie</i> requirement. The Deputy knows that there are difficulties there, that that would create an extra obstacle, that the system that we have now in operation already includes the proper judicial process and that the extra assurances we have added into it add on extra guarantees for anybody <Col N="3192" /> whose extradition is requested from this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I will come to the Americans in a moment, but first I want to make a couple of points.  Deputy Cowen took the view last night that the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act, 1976, should be used as a basis for trying a person here for an offence committed in Northern Ireland or Britain.  I should point out as a matter of detail that the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act would allow us to try people here for offences committed in Northern Ireland and only for explosives offences committed in Britain.  Therefore, if Deputy Cowen was under the impression that that would cover all of the possible cases he is mistaken.</P>
      <P>Deputy Mac Giolla asked what the situation would be in relation to section 22 when this Bill is passed.  Section 22 would not apply to our extradition arrangements with other convention countries.  It might apply to non-convention countries with which we negotiated a new extradition treaty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I mentioned the heady mixture of sherry and wine.  I do not intend to go any further into that.  I have also touched on Deputy Woods' comments of this morning.  He seemed to feel that the arrangements that we have are unconstitutional in that they give judicial functions to administrative persons.  That is not the case.  The system we have in operation, as I have mentioned several times during this debate, is a backing of warrants procedure.  There is no unconstitutionality in the system as it operates now or the system as it would continue to operate after the passage of this Bill. It is idle for Deputy O'Malley to come in here, as he did this morning, and suggest that in some way under the system as it has operated up to now and as it will <Col N="3193" /> continue to operate he could find himself being requested for extradition for the theft of a packet of cigarettes without evidence.  That is preposterous and far away from the system that is there, and Deputy O'Malley knows that that is the case.</P>

He knows that that is patently not the case.  His argument is a far better one than to be served by that type of nonsensical comparison which is totally irrelevant.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Woods known perfectly well that there is a proper judicial involvement in these procedures all the way through.  If for once he just sat down and reflected on the system that is there, he would know that many of the things he has said are without foundation.</P>
      <P>Reference was made to the treaty with the US.  Why have they a <i>prima facie</i> requirement in their treaty with us while we do not have a reciprocal <i>prima facie</i> requirement with them?  What is required in the US treaty is that an affidavit must be produced to the US authorities to the effect that there is evidence.  That is something the US authorities believe they should ask for from other countries. We on our side operate it on the basis of the normal extradition type arrangement that we have with all other countries.</P>
      <P>It is relevant that I conclude by quoting a passage from the judgment in Shannon <i>versus</i> the Attorney General in the 1985 <i>Irish Law Monthly Reports</i> No. 449.  The present Chief Justice said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="3194" /> I am satisfied that there is no want of constitutional protection of the rights of the plaintiff arising from the acceptance under the procedures contained in Part III of the Act of 1965 of the warrant, as evidence that the judicial authority in Northern Ireland has found <i>prima facie</i> grounds for the issuing of a warrant.</P>
    <P>That is the situation as it exists at the moment under that arrangement.  That will continue, as I have said.  The only change we are making in relation to that arrangement is that we have strengthened the assurances and the inspection of the sufficiency of evidence before the warrant arrives in our jurisdiction.  That being the case, and because the system that is proposed in this amendment does not fit in with our international obligations, I am rejecting that amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister in concluding said that the system being proposed in the amendment does not fit in with our international obligations.  Either the Minister has been wrongly advised or he does not understand the advice he has been given.  For the record let me refer to the international obligation and particularly Article 6 here which states that a contracting party shall have the right to refuse extradition to its nationals. Nothing could be clearer than that. Therefore, for the Minister of the day in introducing this legislation to suggest that <i>prima facie</i> evidence before extraditing your nationals is not in conformity with your international obligations is patently a misstatement&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Read the rest of the convention.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and should not be allowed to go unchallenged in this House.  I can read the rest as well.  It says what each contracting party may do within that.  Clearly that Article was <Col N="3195" /> designed in conformity with our international obligations and those of the signatory members to allow any of the member states to refuse to extradite their citizens anyway.  It is sad that the Minister has such a bad grasp of the international obligations that he would attempt to argue against that fact.  These amendments clearly do not go that far.  They do not seek to exclude the extradition of nationals.  What they seek to do is, in that we are not excluding nationals from extradition &mdash; which we are entitled to do in conformity with our international obligations &mdash; to introduce a balancing consideration where our courts, our procedures would determine whether there is a <i>prima facie</i> basis for extradition of our nationals.  That is not only reasonable but absolutely essential in the circumstances in which we find ourselves here.  If we decide not to do as Germany, France, Belgium, The Netherlands, Italy, Portugal, Switzerland and Sweden did in conformity with international obligations and exclude nationals from extradition, then at least we have an obligation to protect those nationals in conformity with our law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said that a court here on the basis of the law then makes a decision. He seems to suggest that the court here, if these amendments are not adopted, will be acting on the basis of the law, with full protection of our citizens.  In case the Minister does not understand, what we want to ensure is that the law on which the court acts will include a provision for <i>prima facie</i> evidence in respect of our citizens.  If there is no such provision in the law on which the courts must act then the court has no right whatsoever to consider the question of <i>prima facie</i> evidence.  He must know that.  What effectively the Minister is doing is excluding our courts in this instance, in the application of their functions and in the exercise of the law, as he says, from considering the question of <i>prima facie</i> evidence in respect of our citizens.  That is outrageous in the light of the circumstances which exist elsewhere.  The Minister is proposing that the law be <Col N="3196" /> framed on such a basis that the courts in the exercise of the law will be excluded from considering <i>prima facie</i> evidence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister may answer many things in a moment.  The circumstances that have arisen since 1965 have been well argued here for some considerable time.  The Minister is not going to have me go back down that avenue.  The next point I want to make is in terms of the pressure that has been brought on all of us here and that has made us in a sense a target.  Last evening I found myself in the company of a number of ambassadors from the European Community, including the ambassador for the German Federal Republic, and from Europe generally.  Each of them understands perfectly that Ireland would be acting fully in conformity with international obligations if we did as many of them have done and refused to extradite our own citizens.  They certainly accept that if we enter a reservation or a condition in terms of <i>prima facie</i> evidence which these terms seem to suggest&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I just said it in passing. I regret that the implication being put out from the opposite side of the House by Deputies and even by the Minister is that if we do not do this we are setting ourselves apart from the international community, that we are not acting in conformity with our international obligations.  I reject that.  The representatives of the member states know that to be untrue.  Therefore, why should it be stated by our Minister here as if, doing what we are obliged to in protection of our citizens and our principles, we then set ourselves outside the standards of international law?  That is <Col N="3197" /> not a reasonable argument to bring before this House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I remind the Minister that if we decide in conformity with the principle <i>aut dedere aut judicare,</i> that instead of judging here, which we are allowed to do, we extradite, there is another principle of international law that applies.  That is that there should be the same balance of consideration between the countries to which we extradite and ourselves.  If their procedures require certain protections for their citizens then our procedures should require similar protections, at least, for our citizens, otherwise we are not entering into a mutually fair and balanced agreement. It is reasonable that these countries have entered reservations, but this Minister is telling us it is unreasonable for us to do so.  That is an outrageous assertion which will be proved in time to be so.  It will be proved not only to be contrary to our obligations in the interests of our citizens but to set us outside the whole practice of international law.  What the Minister is saying is that if the Germans do not extradite their citizens to us, there is no reason why we should not extradite our citizens to them.  Similarly with other countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Surely we have sufficient knowledge of what sovereignty really means in terms of our obligations to other countries.  That is part of sovereignty, but equally balanced should be our obligation to our own citizens. By discharging that properly here we would not in any way limit the obligation we have to other countries to attack this menace to international law. Only our Government and the Government Deputies suggest that in doing so <Col N="3198" /> we would be limiting our commitment to attacking international terrorism.</P>
    <P>The Minister has stated that if he were to adopt these amendments, which the whole force of argument used here in this House demands that he should, he would be going against the Anglo-Irish Agreement, of which this is a conditioned precedent, an essential condition.  If that is the case then the Anglo-Irish Agreement on this alone, apart from other issues, was a bad agreement hastily entered into without being properly thought through as to its implications.  I do not remember seeing this stated as a condition of the Anglo-Irish Agreement.</P>
    <P>I recall the Taoiseach in a rather typical statement afterwards &mdash; not very considered, it must be said &mdash; indicating that as part of the general consensus and understanding of the Anglo-Irish Agreement we would now implement this convention without reservations.  That is sad. The Taoiseach did not know what it was he was committing us to.  He did not really understand the implications. Because of that hasty conclusion we are now being asked to do something here that no other country will do in respect of their citizens.  We are being asked to set ourselves outside the whole framework of protecting our citizens and in our amendments we are not even going as far as they.  These amendments ask simply that there would be <i>prima facie</i> evidence.</P>
    <P>The Minister talks about procedures. He seems to suggest that procedures adopted elsewhere should be sufficient to satisfy us in the discharge of our sovereign obligation.  I could not care less what procedures were adopted elsewhere, even if they were fully judicial procedures unless and until they satisfy our procedures and particularly our judicial procedures. The fact that the DPP in Britain and the prosecuting authorities would suggest that there seems to be a reasonable basis on which we could expect a prosecution is not anything like adequate.  Does the Minister realise that he is telling our independent courts under our jurisdiction that even we have not the right to interfere in this matter?  He is telling them that their judicial function, <Col N="3199" /> in terms of inquiring into <i>prima facie</i> evidence, must be set aside because an executive or administrative authority elsewhere comes to a certain conclusion and that we must back the warrants.  It is and offence to our independent Judiciary&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I have not been impressed by the Minister's response to the arguments and his remarks <i>ad hominem</i> in respect of Deputy O'Malley and Deputy Woods, in trying to imply certain things about them personally.  That is not the way a Minister should reply to issues.</P>

      <P>The record will show that the Minister did not address the issues, either because he was incapable of understanding them or because he chose to ignore them.  The fact that our courts should be influenced by administrative decisions elsewhere is outrageous and we resent and reject it.  There is a consensus outside the House that there should be protection in the Bill but the Minister has not advanced even one decent argument to justify his position.  Perhaps he was influenced by the Anglo-Irish Agreement, Article 8 of which states that the conference shall also be concerned with policy aspects of extradition and extraterritorial jurisdictions between North and South.  The Minister seems to be saying, &ldquo;To hell with the fundamental rights of the judicial functions&rdquo;.</P>

      <Col N="3200" /> I received a letter from the Federation of Irish Societies dated 9 December and I know that the Taoiseach and representatives of each party also received a copy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, only four lines deal with another matter.  It states:</P>
      <P>At its national meeting held in London on Saturday, 6th December last, the Federation of Irish Societies resolved that I should bring to your notice the Federation's opposition to the ratification at this time of the Extradition (European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism) Bill, 1986. The Federation of Irish Societies is actively involved in the massive campaign in Britain to achieve justice for those imprisoned for the Birmingham and Guildford bombings and for the Maguire family.  While all three cases remain unresolved we believe that the proposed Bill should not be given effect by Dáil Éireann.  The Federation further believes that the interests of Irish citizens are not adequately protected in the Bill because of the absence on the part of the requesting country to present a <i>prima facie</i> case in an Irish court in respect of extradition proceedings.  The Federation is the largest and most representative organisation within the Irish community in Britain comprising 17 societies whose combined membership is in excess of 60,000.  I can vouch for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a respected organistion which has general reservations about the Birmingham Six, the Guildford Four and the Maguire family and its members are against this proposal unless and until there is a provision in relation to <i>prima facie</i> evidence.  Have we any sense of pride?  We are prepared to say to the British authorities that we will extradite our citizens to them without <i>prima facie</i> evidence although they will not extradite their citizens to us without such evidence. Apparently, they have indicated that <Col N="3201" /> they will review the whole position in regard to <i>prima facie</i> evidence.  We all know what that means.  While they are reviewing the case we will immediately extradite our citizens without <i>prima facie</i> evidence in respect of their jurisdiction. What kind of balance of justice is that? What kind of sovereignty is it?  What kind of understanding does it show from a Government who clearly do not seem to be able to address the fundamental issues of the role of a sovereign State, either through Parliament or by the exercise of the judicial function?</P>
    <P>The Minister said that the court, on the basis of law, makes a decision. However, he is tying the hands of our courts and limiting their function in regard to the law, which is very hard to accept.  If these amendments are adopted, we would be in excellent company and I hope that the Minister will publicly assert to Britain and to our partners in Europe, who do not need to be convinced, that we are acting in conformity with the convention in the fullest possible way.  No one can suggest that what we are doing is showing any sense of lack of commitment in dealing with the problems of international terrorism in the context of the European convention.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. L.T. Cosgrave Mr. L.T. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L.T. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>It is unfortunate that important legislation is introduced at the end of a session when it is passed <Col N="3202" /> with indecent haste.  Perhaps we are all to blame as we delay other legislation. The Minister indicated last night that he felt the British would shortly be changing their procedures in respect of the provision of evidence regarding the establishment of a <i>prima facie</i> case.  Has he any indication as to when such a change is contemplated?</P>
      <P>I should also like to query the provision that the designated officer will state that there is a clear probability of prosecution.  Is there any guarantee that such a certificate will not just be rubber stamping because the designating officer wants to get his man?  I hope consideration will be on the basis of the evidence offered.  It would be unfortunate if the Bill was regarded as a possible trade-off or bargaining issue in relation to matters being discussed in some other forum.  I hope it will be judged in its own context.  While we hope for progress in relation to other matters they should not be intertwined with this issue.  We would not like to see our citizens extradited to any jurisdiction which has a history of defects in regard to its law and where questions remain unanswered.  I should like the Minister to deal with the matter in relation to the changing of procedures in the UK.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In page 2, lines 34 to 36, to delete <Col N="3213" /> subsection (4) and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(4) This Act shall apply only in relation to an offence committed or alleged to have been committed after the commencement of this Act.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Section 1 (4) of the Bill provides that:</P>
    <P>This Act applies, except where otherwise provided, in relation to an offence whether committed or alleged to have been committed before or after the passing of this Act.</P>
    <P>We are proposing that this Act shall apply only in relation to an offence committed or alleged to have been committed after commencement of the Act.</P>
    <P>Deputies will note that we are changing two words here.  One is the word &ldquo;before&rdquo; and the other is &ldquo;passing&rdquo;.  We are saying in this amendment that after the date on which the Act commences the Act should apply only in relation to an offence committed or alleged to have been committed after the commencement date.</P>
    <P>The Bill turns offences which were previously regarded as political offences into offences which will not be accepted as political.  It limits the political exception which is in the 1965 Act.  If we look at the commencement procedures we will see that the Bill also clearly requires that an improved system for the administration of justice be introduced especially in the northern Six Counties before it is implemented.  The commencement section states that very clearly and in addition the Minister has now, as we know, put the commencement date back to December.  Section 12 (2) of the Bill provides that:</P>
    <P>If, after the passing of this Act but before the 1st day of June, 1987, a resolution is passed by each House of the Oireachtas declaring that this Act should come into operation...</P>
    <P>The Minister has now put that date back to 1 December.  The commencement provisions in the Bill themselves indicate that the Government want to see change in the administration of justice in the North <Col N="3214" /> before they are prepared to agree to the commencement of the Act.  The coming into operation of the Act has, therefore, been linked by the Government to improvement in the standard of the administration of justice in Northern Ireland. It is implicit in such a linkage that even the Government are dissatisfied with those standards.  A primary objective of the Anglo-Irish Agreement is the securing of improvements in the system of justice in the Six Counties.</P>
    <P>All the political parties in Dáil Éireann accept that gross injustices have been perpetrated by the Diplock courts.  It is accepted generally that the use of uncorroborated evidence has undermined confidence in the standard of justice prevailing in the Northern Ireland.  It is also generally accepted that convictions have in the past been obtained in confessions extracted under duress.  Nevertheless, the Government's position is that if improvements are made in the future administration of justice in Northern Ireland they are willing to extradite persons convicted under a system which they acknowledge was and still is unsatisfactory. Therefore, unless this measure is non-retroactive this State could end up in the ludicrous situation of having to extradite people to Northern Ireland who were originally convicted on the basis of interrogations which we have protested about publicly or of supergrass trials which again we have protested about. Were those still in English prisons for the Birmingham bombings to escape in the morning and be found here we would have to return them to prison in England regardless of the fact that not a single person in this House believes them to be guilty.  Many Deputies, including members of the Government, have campaigned for their release.</P>
    <P>As the section stands it is retrospective. I know the Minister will say that it will not make an offence in the past into an offence now.  It will not change the base of offence.  It changes the fact that one can be extradited for particular offences. That is why I advisably do not use the word &ldquo;retrospective&rdquo;.  I use the word &ldquo;retroactive&rdquo;.  This measure should not <Col N="3215" /> be retroactive.  There is a way of dealing with any person taking refuge here against whom there is evidence.  Such a person can be dealt with under the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act, 1976.  I remind the Minister of the many young people who were caught up in the violence of the seventies, who may have been only alleged accomplices to acts traditionally regarded as political and who have escaped from the violence of the North often to settle and marry in the Republic or in England, turning their backs on the past and becoming useful citizens.  They could now find themselves at the mercy of an RUC warrant based on no evidence, issued often for the purposes of interrogation only but receiving the automatic backing of the Irish authorities. Is this what the House wants? How far back do we allow this to go? Will it affect a 15-year old who hid an Armalite after Bloody Sunday, who could be sought as an accomplice?  A young woman wanted by the British authorities and named in the British press as the most wanted woman in Britain was sought for extradition purposes but the Irish authorities at the time insisted that if there was evidence she would be put on trial here under the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act, 1976.  No evidence was forthcoming because there was none and later other parties confirmed her innocence.  She would now be liable to extradition on an RUC warrant, without supporting evidence.  What sense of security can she have, if we allow this section to go unamended?  A number of people came to me in the last ten days saying they were innocently involved in the troubles but that they had succeeded in getting away and had settled in this jurisdiction but because they had brothers and sisters involved they felt they would be pursued for interrogation so that they would give information about others.  They have left all that behind, but now what is to happen?  This measure is to be retrospective and retroactive.  The Minister should amend the Bill so that it will operate only from the time when it <Col N="3216" /> is passed.  Other methods can be used to deal with other circumstances.</P>
    <P>Surely the Labour Party must be concerned about this measure even if the Minister and his colleagues are not.  Does anyone on the Government side support civil liberties?  Surely they cannot support a provision which applies 1986 law to conditions which prevailed in 1971, 15 years ago.  The Minister will say that the cornerstone of the Anglo-Irish Agreement is reconciliation and that is the basis on which all parties support it.  If that is the spirit of the agreement how do the Government justify giving an open door to the British authorities to go back into the past and demand the surrender of people who have escaped that past, and against whom there are merely allegations? This section should not be retroactive and I would ask the Minister to consider this seriously on Report Stage. I am sure this is not the Minister's intention, but the Minister will be faced with many circumstances over which he will find it difficult to stand if this Bill is passed as it stands.  The Minister should accept our amendment which merely proposes that the Act will apply in relation to offences committed or alleged to have been committed after the passing of this Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite willing to support Deputy Woods's amendment, but the difference between the two amendments is that we would allow the words &ldquo;passing of the Act&rdquo; to remain.  It is only right that if a Bill is passed, no matter what the opposition against it was, it should have effect from then even though it is deferred for 12 months.  I agree with the argument put forward by Deputy Woods.  After defeating the very core of the opposition to this Bill, after throwing out the need for any evidence to be produced, one should be very strong in deleting this &ldquo;before or&rdquo; so that it will not relate to the past, particularly as the Minister has admitted that section 22 of the 1965 Act will no longer apply when this Bill is passed and that extradition will be easier.  The Minister should look at this <Col N="3217" /> section because it is essential to remove retrospection from the Bill.  There is already very substantial unease about the Minister's refusal to move on the need for evidence to be produced, but this in addition will cause quite an outcry.  I ask the Minister to look at this now and to delete the provision making this law retrospective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Neither of these two amendments is acceptable and it would be unwise for the House to adopt either of them.  They would have the effect, now that the Government propose to put back the commencement date of the Act until 1 December next, of allowing terrorists to commit crimes and come back into this jurisdiction and claim they were political offences or that they were offences connected with political offences.  That defence would still be open to them and there would be a danger of an invitation to such people to try to avail of the long period before the Act comes into effect. That would be wrong.  There is nothing inherently wrong in retrospectively doing away with the defence of alleged political motivation for terrorist type offences of the kind set out in articles 1 and 2 of the Convention and in sections 3 and 4 of this Bill.  This is not a question of making an offence something which was not already an offence.  This is simply taking away the colour of political defence from a request for extradition.  I was glad to see that the law was, at least in part, changed by the Supreme Court some years ago in the McGlinchey case as it reflects the reality we have to face today.  I do not see why that rather peculiar method that terrorists had of getting out of responsibility for their crimes should be retained any longer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whatever about it being done retrospectively if this amendment were accepted it would have the effect &mdash; I am sure the drafter did not intend this &mdash; of leaving the political defence open to somebody who commits a terrorist type offence between now and 1 December 1987.  Quite frankly, I do not think that is right.  Accordingly, the Progressive Democrats will vote against acceptance <Col N="3218" /> of this amendment.  Like Deputy Mac Giolla.  I think it is a great pity that the core of what is needed in this Bill, a safeguard, has now been voted down, admittedly by the slenderest possible margin, the casting vote of the Ceann Comhairle, in two successive votes.  That is a tragedy but it should not affect our judgment of individual sections and individual amendments.</P>
    <P>The Government were grossly wrong in their refusal to accept the earlier amendments which have been defeated only by the casting vote of the Ceann Comhairle but that fact should not colour our judgment on subsequent individual amendments and sections.  Accordingly, we take the view I have now expressed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I can readily see the points made by Deputy O'Malley, that if these amendments were accepted it is possible they would give a <i>carte blanche</i> to terrorists to act accordingly in the next year or so.  On the other hand, we must look at how far back we are going to go as regards retrospection.  Should we insert some date, say, 1 January 1970 or 1 January 1980?  The authorities in the United Kingdom may have someone on their books whom they have wanted to extradite since the fifties or the sixties. This may be for something that we would not regard as a crime here.  There may be Members in this House who were involved in activities 30 years ago and perhaps whom the British authorities may still wish to have extradited to their jurisdiction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept the validity of the points raised by Deputy O'Malley that we cannot provide in this legislation a <i>carte blanche</i> for terrorists to commit horrendous crimes in the next 12 months and to say the offences were committed before the commencement date of the Act and, therefore, they cannot be extradited.  On the other hand, we cannot go as far back as the UK authorities think fit.  There may still be people alive who were involved in the troubles of 1918 to 1920.  While it is very unlikely that the UK authorities would want to extradite any such persons it is not beyond the bounds of possibility <Col N="3219" /> that it would happen.  A certain date, say 1975, should be inserted into the Bill in the matter of offences that can no longer be regarded as political.  We cannot leave the Bill open in this regard to the extent that any country can go as far back as they want.</P>
    <P>We must remember that the political climate in this country has changed. Deputy O'Malley is glad to see that the concept of a political offence is being thrown out the window, that a crime which was inspired by political motives will no longer be regarded as political. Deputy O'Malley is well aware that he was a member of successive Governments who point blank refused to change the extradition law and who, back in the seventies, refused to change the political offence concept.  Members on the other side of the House were members of a Government in the seventies who also refused to do away with that concept.  We are talking now in 1986 and with the benefit of hindsight we are able to say that we should have done away with that concept a long time ago but that in the conditions which prevailed in those earlier years we were not able to do so.</P>
    <P>I accept that the political climate and that people's thinking have changed but we also have to accept that the political thinking of Members in this House has changed not alone during the past 30 years but during the past ten years.  We cannot have a section in the Bill which allows another jurisdiction to present us with warrants for crimes committed in 1956 or in 1976 and requesting the extradition of the persons concerned.  We rejected the earlier amendments by a slender margin thereby leaving us without any <i>caveats</i> as to when a warrant is presented.  We have done away with the idea of a <i>prima facie</i> case and we are saying that on presentation of a warrant, regardless of whether there is evidence against a person, we will extradite.  I do not think we can do that.  There are people around this House, not all of them Members, who were activists in illegal organisations but who have changed their political thinking during the past ten to <Col N="3220" /> 15 years.  We must insert some date in the Bill in regard to retrospection but that must not be any old date.</P>
    <P>If the Minister is not going to accept the amendments in the name of Deputy Woods or the amendments in the names of Deputies Mac Giolla and De Rossa some amendment should be inserted specifying some date, perhaps 1975.  It cannot be left as open as it is now.</P>

      <P>There is a point of confusion.  Deputy O'Malley has mentioned that if we were to adopt this amendment&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy believes there is a point of confusion I would be happy to hear it when I have finished what I want to say.  I can assure the Deputy that I do not intend to take ten minutes. Neither do I intend to be sitting here at 1.30 p.m. without having made a reply.</P>
      <P>The position is that sections 3 and 4 of the Bill would apply only in relation to a request made for the surrender of a person or a warrant issued after the commencement of the Act but because of the provisions of section 1 that request or warrant may relate to an offence which was committed or alleged to have been committed before that date.  There is one exception to that provided for in section 5 which establishes extra-territorial jurisdiction over offences committed outside the State.  That section applies only to offences committed after the commencement of the Act.  That is reasonable because it is creating new offences in terms of our jurisdiction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Provisions of the kind contained in the Bill are quite normal when new extradition arrangements are being made.  The Extradition Act, 1965, for example, <Col N="3221" /> applied to offences whether committed before or after its passing.  Our extradition treaty with the United States, recently approved by the House, contains a similar provision.  I might point out that none of the points now being made in support of these amendments was adverted to at all during the debate on that treaty.  The recent Anglo-American treaty also contains a similar provision. Those provisions, as well as being normal, are perfectly reasonable.</P>
    <P>If a state decides to put in place a particular agreement on extradition, it is thereby saying that in its view the interests of justice require that persons be extradited in accordance with the terms of that agreement.  In that situation, the question of whether an offence was committed before the agreement was made or, as in this case, before the legislation was passed is irrelevant. There is no injustice involved here.  There would be an injustice involved if a new offence were being created and the Bill contained a provision to give it retrospective effect.  That is not what is involved here.  In this Bill where a new offence or the potential for a new offence is being created, that will arise under section 5 but only on the passing of the Act.  There is no question under the Bill of making something criminal which was not an offence at the time it was done. Before a person can be liable for extradition, the act for which he is sought will have to be one that constituted an offence against the law of the requesting state and of the requested state at the time of its commission.</P>
    <P>The plea that an offence is a political offence is available only for the purpose of extradition.  It is not a defence to a charge of the offence it self to say that it was a political offence.  Accordingly, it is irrelevant from the point of view of criminal liability whether an offence was or was not within the scope of the political offence exception.  The scope of that exception is a consideration that arises only in relation to the decision whether or not to extradite a person for a particular offence.  Accordingly, it is quite proper and in accordance with principle that the <Col N="3222" /> time of the commission of the offence concerned should be immaterial.</P>
    <P>I would point out to the Deputy McCreevy that there is not a statute of limitation in relation to serious criminal offences, nor do I think Deputy McCreevy would make the argument that we should automatically decide not to undertake proceedings in the case of a murder committed 15 years ago if new evidence should become available.  That is not the argument Deputy McCreevy would make and he should apply the same logic to this discussion.</P>
    <P>Neither is it true to allege, as Deputy Woods did, that people who have turned their backs on their past would now find themselves at the mercy of RUC warrants, based on no evidence, seeking them for questioning only.  The system does not allow for warrants based on no evidence seeking people for questioning only.  To say the least, it is disingenuous of Deputy Woods to throw in that allegation at this point in the discussion.  It seems to be an attempt to find the merest corner of what looks as if if might be a green flag and to take it out and wave it. It is not an allegation founded in any way on the practice we have since 1965.  For those reasons I would agree on this occasion with Deputy O'Malley and reject the two amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened to the Minister and to Deputy O'Malley.  It seems very reasonable and proper in a legalistic way to make the argument that there would be a vacuum within which a licence would be granted to do anything and everything and scut back here.  This Bill will be forced through as it stands by the casting vote of the Ceann Comhairle. We are not dealing here with France, Germany, Belgium or Holland.  In effect, we are dealing with part of our own country in which there is a very flawed Judiciary, a flawed police force and flawed activities within those two realms about which we have complained in the past and got a verdict in the European Court.  These are the special circumstances and background against <Col N="3223" /> which we are talking, not just the legalistic situation which might arise in what we would regard as relations between normal countries or jurisdictions.  We are talking about an occupied part of our country which is held in subjection, which has a flawed Judiciary, a flawed police force, and a verdict of the European Court against the inhuman treatment, involving unnecessary strip-searching and so forth, that has been meted out in Gough Barracks and other such places. It is to these people that we are giving the right virtually to create an internment situation if they so wish, going back as far as they can in the files of people who are still alive.  That is what we are doing.</P>
      <P>If the Minister has any leanings towards trying to allay the real fears and the real injustice of the retroactive aspect of this Bill, he does not have to take the wording of either of the two amendments before us.  He could propose his own formula somewhere in between, agreeing to the spirit behind the two amendments. Those people who are here, in respect of some of whom extradition proceedings have failed, must not be put at second risk.  That could be done if the Minister had the wish to do it by implementing such a formula from the passage of this Bill through this House today.</P>

I am totally against this measure being applied to the Six Counties administration or to England, Wales, Scotland and the Isle of Man because their system has discriminated against Irish citizens in its application in recent years.  I take it that the delayed coming into force of this Bill is a clear admission and acceptance by the Minister and the Government that this is so.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will also be aware that the broadcasting of Dáil proceedings on radio has only recently been introduced.

      <P>The treatment benefits scheme administered by my Department provides dental health care to insured persons only.  I am very conscious of the position of spouses of insured workers, particularly those with family responsibilities who work in the home and who are not at present covered by the scheme.</P>

Would the Minister consider the possibility of allowing either spouse to opt for inclusion in the scheme so that when a couple get married, one or other &mdash; in the event of only one insurance contribution being made &mdash; could be covered?

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if she is satisfied at the controls within her Department over the printing, delivery, storage, issue, return, encashment and accounting for children's allowance books; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>Order books for the payment of child benefit are printed under very secure conditions by the stamping branch of the Revenue Commissioners. The printed books are delivered to the Department of Social Welfare in secure containers and are stored in strong-rooms until issue.  All books printed are recorded and fully accounted for.</P>
      <P>The procedures relating to the printing, delivery, storage, issue, return, encashment and accounting for these books are constantly under review and improvements have been made over the years both in the light of perceived deficiencies and in response to suggestions by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  The procedures have, therefore, been made as secure as possible having regard to the resources available up to now.</P>
      <P>For the future, however, a greater degree of security can be obtained by the use of up-to-date technology.  Some time ago, therefore, I instructed my Department to arrange for the introduction of the most modern secure systems available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The computerisation of the claim details in respect of child benefit and pensions which has been completed in recent <Col N="3231" /> times affords the opportunity for introducing the additional security and controls which I have been seeking.  The Department have now virtually completed their examination of the problem and I expect that a contract will shortly be placed for the production of higher security orders.  I expect the first of the new type orders will be issued to claimants around mid-1987.</P>
    <P>The new orders will have a feature &mdash; optical character recognition &mdash; suitable for automatic reading by computer after encashment and will thereby allow for full reconciliation of all orders cashed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisFoley" hpid="Mr. Foley Mr. Foley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foley</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's reply.  However, between July and December 1984, 391 children's allowance books were returned to the Department because an allowance book had been issued to a post office and a bank.  A further 500 books were returned in cases where entitlement had terminated prior to the issue of the books.  Will the Minister explain how this could happen in view of the computerised checking within the Department?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a very detailed question and if the Deputy had tabled it I could have given a comprehensive answer.  We are aware that there are loopholes in the system and that difficulties arose because of forged books. That is why there has been a constant review of the system and the fact that we hope to place a contract very shortly for a completely new system of very high security orders will render many of these problems a thing of the past.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that in some cases her Department issued payments to recipients who ceased to be eligible?  Sometimes a parent cashes these cheques, not knowing that eligibility has ceased, but attempts are then made by the Department to recoup the money. Does the Minister consider that this is a fair practice in view of the fact that the errors emanated from her Department?</P>

      <P>The Deputy has asked a completely separate question from that which Deputy Foley put down and I could not go into details at present.  There are difficulties in those circumstances and it is not the only area where problems arise. However, it is difficult to see how one could justify not attempting to reclaim money which was overpaid and which, by the very nature of its overpayment, was not needed.  Unfortunately, a detailed answer is not available at present.</P>

      <P>The project undertaken by the consultants is designed to afford an examination of all the major payment systems of the Department with a view to establishing where they are most at risk and to advising on the best cost-effective measures to keep these risks to a minimum.  The work in connection with this project is extensive in nature due to the vast scope and complexity of the various social welfare schemes and the variety of systems both manual and computerised used in their administration. The project covers all aspects of the schemes being surveyed, including the administration of those schemes with a view to eliminating waste or abuse of any sort from the system.  Work on the project commenced at the end of last August.  This work is being done in several phases and it is still ongoing.  The cost of the work undertaken to date by Craig Gardner is £50,830 (exclusive of VAT).  The cost of the subsequent phases of the assignment has not been agreed as the detailed work content has not yet been finalised.</P>
      <P>As regards publication of the reports, all I can say at this stage is that in view of the confidential nature of the subject matter obviously I would be reluctant to consider publishing the actual reports as this could well prejudice the ongoing work of the Department in administering their schemes.  However, when the final reports of the project have been received and evaluated, it is my intention to make a detailed statement on the findings and on the follow-up action which I propose to take.</P>

      <P>An opinion poll has nothing to do with establishing the extent of fraud or abuse.  It is very important that the public should be convinced of the proper carrying out of duties by any <Col N="3235" /> State Department, particularly when large amounts of public money are being spent.  There have been many media reports and discussions in this House on fraud, abuse, the level of such fraud or abuse, and even whether it exists in the social welfare system.  It seemed to be a very valuable part of the terms of reference of any study of the system to establish through well accepted modes what exactly the public think about fraud or abuse in the system.  I believe this is relevant but is not intended to establish the level of fraud or abuse.</P>

There was, and there continues to be, a great deal of public comment on this subject.  I believe this was a very wise step to take but it is only part of our ongoing work.  Last summer we issued a general range of measures designed to deal with fraud and this is part of it.  I make no apology for employing independent consultants to look into this area.  Their terms of reference are specifically designed to examine the payments system, with the specific purpose of finding out if there was danger of fraud and abuse, and not the other matters which the Deputy mentioned.</P>

      <P>A final question: would the Minister not agree that it would make sense, if she is investigating social welfare abuse, that the abuse by employers of PRSI payments is a valid area for investigation in view of the fact that many employees who find themselves unemployed or sick on many occasions cannot get benefit because their employer has not sent in the appropriate contributions?  Will she not also say that the purpose of her Department should be to ensure that everyone who is entitled to a benefit gets it?  There is also concern about under-payments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy raised a completely different question.  My Department operate an extremely efficient and widespread information service across the country.  They fully inform people of their entitlements and constantly make available all the rates and entitlements of people.  On the question of the collection of PRSI, the Deputy may recall that one of the measures we announced last autumn in the package of anti-fraud measures was a joint inspection group made up of my Department and the Revenue Commissioners, who <Col N="3237" /> are the collecting agency for PRSI, to examine specific areas where it was suspected there were difficulties with PRSI, PAYE and so on.  I consider that was the best thing to do.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMcCarthy" hpid="Dr. McCarthy Dr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister not concede, in view of the amount of untold publicity which fraud in the social welfare area received in the past, in some instances with quite hysterical headlines that it would not be in the public interest, that the Craig Gardner report be published? It might be seen as an indictment of all those on social welfare payments that the details of the report are not open to the public.  There is something sinister in a report that is kept secret, behind closed doors.  It would serve the public much better if the details were made available to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said in the original answer, many of the areas covered by the report are very confidential matters in the Department.  Publishing it would negate the whole purpose of combating fraud and abuse.  That would be showing people how to defraud or abuse the system.  It is important, and I have said this before, when the final report is made available to me that the public should have a very detailed statement on it.  They should also be informed of the follow-up action the Department propose to take following the making public of that statement.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare her views on the practice of suspending social welfare payments to claimants when they come under investigation as to their circumstances before such investigations are concluded; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>Apart from the automatic suspension of payment to persons receiving disability benefit who fail without good cause to attend when summoned for examination by a medical referee of the Department, it is not the general policy of the Department to suspend payments to a claimant while his circumstances are still under investigation. Investigations are carried out by social welfare officers who do not themselves have the power to suspend payments. A report of an investigation is submitted to a deciding officer who has the statutory power to suspend, reduce or disallow payment.  The deciding officer will base his decision on the facts as put forward in the social welfare officer's report.</P>
      <P>The suspension of disability benefit to persons who fail to attend for medical examination is for up to nine weeks and is provided for in statutory regulations. If the Deputy has a particular case in mind and will give me the details I will have the case examined and I will communicate with him as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>The question arises not from any one specific case but from a number of instances over a period where people have their allowances, particularly deserted wife's allowance and unmarried mother's allowance, stopped <Col N="3239" /> pending investigation.  The people concerned are not informed there is any investigation into their case until they are told the payment has been stopped.  Does the Minister not think it would be more appropriate for such people to be involved in the investigation process before benefit or assistance is stopped?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I will have that matter looked into.  The original question implied that there is full scale suspension of payment before investigations are completed.  That is not the case.  As I said, the deciding officers have power to suspend payments on receipt of evidence from social welfare officers.  The deciding officer has to base his decision on facts. There is an appeals system in operation. It is hard to see that the present system could be fairer.  If there are particular instances the Deputy has in mind I would be very interested to have a look at them.</P>

      <P>In the normal course a married woman who applies for unemployment benefit, who has sufficient contributions and who has no family responsibilities is refused unemployment benefit on the basis that she is not available for work.  In those circumstances she is not getting the benefit even though the investigation into her circumstances has not begun.  It is just an opinion of a person.  There are different aspects to this problem.  We are simply asking that the Minister have regard to the question of maintaining payments to people while inquiries are proceeding.  If at the end of investigations or inquiries a decision to stop payment is made, then payment must be stopped.</P>

      <P>The Minister referred to those receiving disability benefit.  Will she accept that the vast majority of those in receipt of disability benefit who fail to turn up before the medical referee do so because the condition of their health has deteriorated?  In many instances they are <Col N="3240" /> hospitalised.

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 and 19 together.</P>
      <P>Approximately £270,000 is being spent this year in meeting the Government's share of the costs of projects included in the EC Poverty Programme.  I will make available separately a breakdown of the expenditure involved in this case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It took somewhat longer than expected to set up the Combat Poverty Agency with the result that it has only been in operation since September last.  The agency immediately set about identifying projects working in the area of poverty and community development which merit <Col N="3241" /> support and encouragement and proposals about these were submitted to me. I was glad to be able to respond positively and speedily and I recently announced that I have approved grants totalling £515,000 to 55 organisations engaged in work relating to poverty on foot of the proposals.  I will also make available separately a list of the organisations and the amounts of the grants involved.</P>
    <P>There are clearly many more projects and initiatives around the country which the agency will be progressively identifying but in the short period available in the present financial year it has not been possible to go any further.  I am satisfied, however, that a good and worthwhile start has been made.  For the future I look forward to working out with the agency a programme of ongoing support for projects of this kind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that £1 million had been allocated in the budget this year to the Combat Poverty Agency once it was established but according to my arithmetic, the Minister has dispensed £785,000.  What does the Minister propose to do with the balance of £215,000?  Will the Minister indicate why she has given money to 55 organisations or groups that applied and the number of projects submitted to her by the agency?  Will the Minister tell the House why the Coolock Law Centre did not get any money although they applied for £5,000?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot answer a question about a specific group and it would have been helpful had the Deputy referred to an individual group in his question.  There was a lengthy and useful debate on the legislation establishing that agency and the Deputy, like most Members, was active in that debate.  The fact that Members were anxious to tease out all details of the legislation meant that the agency did not hold their first meeting until September.  Since then the agency received applications for an enormous number of schemes and they worked very hard to carry out investigations. On 17 November the agency <Col N="3242" /> recommended a number of projects to us.  As a considerable amount of money was involved my Department had to go through them in detail and then obtain the sanction of the Department of Finance before paying the grants.  I understand that almost all the projects submitted by the agency were sanctioned by the Department.  I was very pleased they were able to deal with the applications so quickly and that we were able to respond fully to the agency's request. The fact that there was some money left over does not have anything to do with whether the Government want to spend it.  We responded quickly to the applications. The money had to be spent this year and I was anxious that those worthwhile projects would be funded as soon as possible.  More than £500,000 was paid out to those projects last year and that represents a great achievement by the agency and my Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy must be aware that the projects submitted by the agency were responded to and that £515,000 has been paid out in respect of them.  I am sure the Deputy is not suggesting that we should expend more public money without evaluating the projects? What is he suggesting we should do with the £215,000?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have the full total with me.  It may be that a few projects were not funded but I should like to assure the Deputy that the amount involved would be a small fraction of the £215,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMcCarthy" hpid="Dr. McCarthy Dr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister suggested to Deputy De Rossa that had she been asked for specific information on the number of applications for funds it would <Col N="3243" /> have been given.  In my question, No. 19. I asked the Minister to give a breakdown of the number of applicants for funds under the scheme and the number of applicants sanctioned for moneys under the scheme.  The Minister has told us that 55 groups had projects sanctioned but the Minister has not told us how many groups applied for assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I overlooked that and I will get the information for the Deputy from my notes.  I will be making the full list available later.  The agency submitted proposals to the Department for grants totalling £515,000 to 55 organisations throughout the country.  Those proposals were submitted towards the end of November and I am sure Deputies will agree that, bearing in mind that each project has to be sanctioned by my Department and the Department of Finance, they were dealt with expeditiously.  It is understandable that the applications were received late in the day because the agency did not commence work until September.  The first batch arrived between 17 and 24 November and the grants were issued on 12 December.  Those grants were for once-off projects.  The requirement was that the grants should be spent before the end of the year.  I understand that the agency, in addition to the 55 applications that were approved, received further applications from 20 other organisations. However, they arrived too late to be evaluated before the end of the year.  I am happy that the agency were able to have so many projects approved in a short space of time and I look forward to the work of the agency expanding in future years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the applicants receive the amount recommended by the agency or was it reduced or increased in any way after the agency's recommendation was considered?  Why was it necessary for the agency, which was established by the Oireachtas and in which we presumably have confidence, <Col N="3244" /> to go to the Department at all to seek permission to spend the money?  We understood from the budget that £1 million was being allocated for this purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not make any apology for the fact that the Department responsible for collecting taxation and spending it should examine all projects on which public moneys are to be spent. The problem referred to by the Deputy probably arises from the fact that we were very anxious, in the first year of their operation, without a specific budget having been agreed in advance and the agency having been set up so late in the year, to get money out before the end of the year to as many projects as the agency were able to recommend to us.  We were still not proceeding as we will be in the future, which will be on a definite budget planned by the agency, all agreed in advance.  I expect that there will not be so much checking in the future.  This year we were spending a lot of money in a short time, anxious to help people as quickly as possible, and we had to ensure that the money would be spent in the way it was intended.  Because there was such a short time, the Department decided to assist the agency and the agency did not have any objection whatever to this co-operation and help.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMcCarthy" hpid="Dr. McCarthy Dr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the consensus that one million people are living in poverty or on the verge thereof, is it not easy to reckon that the £1 million allocated to the agency meant only £1 per head of those living in poverty?  Therefore, why did this poverty agency fail to provide the low sum that was allocated, and is it not appalling that the Department have not arranged to allocate even the small amount provided in the budget? It is important that even the £1 million allocated to the poor was not distributed, that £215,000 was left.</P>

      <P>The Minister has not attempted to answer.  There are one million living in poverty and only £800,000 was spent.  We on this side facilitated the Government to get the agency Bill through as rapidly as possible.  We have been told that 22 late applications went in and should it not have been quite possible for the agency to have exercised their right and allocated the balance to some of those applicants who would have been eligible?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I reject any criticism whatsoever of the agency.  I regret very much that the work they have done so speedily and so well in co-operation with the Department since September should have been criticised like this in the House.  The Bill setting up the agency was not finalised until the period during the summer recess.  We then set about appointing the agency, they met in September and did extremely good work on examining applications quickly and working with us.  They did a magnificent job getting out £750,000 for the EC programmes and the combat poverty programmes and a further £750,000 to voluntary organisations.  This has meant that this year there has been more help given to people working in the on-the-ground voluntary organisations in combating poverty than in any other year in the history of the State.</P>

      <P>I have not got the answer to that.  When the Department were satisfied that the full amounts for once-off projects could be expended in the time available they did not interfere in any <Col N="3246" /> way with the allocations.  The Department would have reduced expenditure not targeted for this year but cases of that were very few.</P>

The board's initial task is to advise on all aspects of occupational pension schemes, including funding and financial security, disclosure of information, transferability of pension rights and general monitoring of scheme performance. The board will also advise me on the question of providing earningsrelated pensions for all employees and in particular, the potential of occupational pension schemes in this regard.</P>

      <P>Why is there such a delay in the board's report?  Most of the ground work was done in a Green Paper in 1976 which pointed out shortcomings in the existing scheme.  There was absence of a social insurance pension scheme for the self-employed and social insurance pensions for employees were relatively low.  That Green Paper was followed by another in 1978 which showed that the social insurance scheme should be broadened to give as comprehensive a cover as possible.  The Minister has told us that the board were formed earlier in the year and that they <Col N="3247" /> would report some time in the distant future.</P>

    <P>No person at present in receipt of free electricity allowance, free television licence or free telephone rental will be deprived of those allowances as a result of the new dependency arrangements which came into force in the week commencing 17 November, 1986 and it is quite wrong <Col N="3248" /> to suggest that any decision was made to do so.</P>
    <P>Entitlement to free electricity allowance and free television licence is subject to the condition that the pensioner be living alone or only with certain categories of person.  Under these arrangements hitherto, a married man who was living with his wife automatically qualified for an allowance, whereas a married woman pensioner living with her non-pensioner husband was only entitled to the allowance if the husband was invalided. In future entitlement to these allowances will be subject to the revised dependency conditions which now apply in the social welfare system generally. This means that men and women will have an equal right to claim these allowances in future.</P>
    <P>Entitlement to the free telephone rental allowance is not affected by the revised definition of dependency.  The qualifying conditions for this allowance require that the pensioner must either be living entirely alone or with a child under age 15 or an incapacitated person.</P>

      <P>Do I take it from the Minister that where, say, a man has an old age pension and is entitled to free electricity allowance, if his wife is working, is in receipt of an income or of a disability benefit, he will still qualify for the free electricity allowance?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">

      <P>In future entitlement to these allowances will be subject to the revised dependency conditions which now apply in the social welfare system generally. This means that men and women will have an equal right to claim these allowances in future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="3249" /> Therefore, if a person had a free electricity and television licence allowance before 17 November we will not change that position in respect of them.  New applicants will be treated under the new regulations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>In other words, new applicants will have a different set of criteria applied to them.  In circumstances where, previous to 17 November they would have received free electricity, now &mdash; irrespective of the hardship and, say, the low income of their spouse &mdash; they will not be in a position to claim free electricity.  I would ask the Minister to review that position, ensuring that people will continue to receive this benefit in the same way as they did before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>All of those applicants who received these benefits before 17 November will not have them changed.  I made that clear.  The Deputy seemed to imply in his question that I had made some decision he was asking me to change.  No decision was made to change the existing conditions for people entitled to those benefits.  There will be &mdash; along with every other new applicant &mdash; a change to the new system.  If they are not living with a dependant, or have other earnings or income, that changes the situation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is contradicting herself.  On the one hand she says there is no change in the criteria. Then she says there is a change for those who apply after 17 November.  While I take the Minister's word that there will not be any change applicable to persons who were in receipt of free electricity up to 17 November I am now asking her if she will reverse her decision and apply a change to those who make application after 17 November to ensure that there will not be further hardship created for people already on the bread line?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that the new arrangements will create hardship for people because we are talking about new applicants who did not have these <Col N="3250" /> entitlements.  I might repeat that people who had these entitlements prior to 17 November will not be affected.  The Deputy must accept that it would be both impractical and illogical to continue to operate these schemes quite separately from the rest of the equality legislation, rendering one set of women less equal than another.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister must be aware that the position that will prevail henceforth will discriminate against people who would be entitled to the allowance.  They will argue the case that, before 17 November, people in similar circumstances qualified for the allowance Therefore this will lead to further discontent and indeed anomalies in the social welfare system, anomalies that we are endeavouring to eliminate.  Can the Minister give us any undertaking that henceforth the same system will apply whether one applies after 17 November or one qualified before that date?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PearseWyse" hpid="Mr. Wyse Mr. Wyse">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if people have the same right of appeal under the new national fuel scheme which was announced recently as they have had prior to the Supreme Court decision last November.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Supreme Court decision referred to declared the regulations governing the national fuel scheme to be invalid and, as a result, the scheme as it stood, including the statutory provisions for decisions and appeals, ceased to exist.</P>
      <P>In order that the persons who would previously have received fuel allowances could continue to do so, arrangements have been made with the health boards for the operation of the scheme on a non-statutory basis pending a review of the situation.  The present position, therefore, is that although the statutory basis is no longer there, the rights of applicants have effectively been safeguarded. Where persons are dissatisfied with decisions on their claims the boards will review the decisions in the light of any new facts or evidence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PearseWyse" hpid="Mr. Wyse Mr. Wyse">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that in the event of a mistake being made in the assessment of one's income, and an applicant refused free fuel, applicants will have a court of appeal, so that they can lodge an appeal against the decision of the official concerned? Is that correct?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy used the expression: &ldquo;have a court of appeal&rdquo;.  I <Col N="3252" /> would remind him that the right of appeal claimants had previously was under the legislation relating to the supplementary welfare allowance scheme and as the Deputy knows, the national fuel scheme formed part of that legislation.  The Supreme Court decided that the regulations specifically providing for the national fuel scheme were not valid; that also invalidated the legislative provision for the scheme.  We had to consider what alternative regulations we could make. Of course the previous legislation included a formal right of appeal.  We thought of making alternative regulations but it was thought likely at that point that the same legal problems could recur which might threaten people's existing entitlements.  It was considered that, in the short term at least, a non-statutory scheme offered the best solution.  In a non-statutory scheme, as the Deputy will be aware, it is not possible to include a formal legal right of appeal.  But I am satisfied from our contacts with the health boards that claimants will have the same opportunity as before to bring all the facts of cases before the health boards and that full consideration will continue to be given to them.  In all cases there will be arrangements for reviewing cases which are refused.  In most cases the mechanism will be the same as before, that is the supplementary welfare allowance appeals structure, even though the formal right of appeal no longer exists. Any person who is dissatisfied with a decision taken in their case should get in touch with the relevant health board and seek a review.</P>

      <P>I want to be very sure that all officials of health boards are aware of this, that a person can appeal where he or she feels there is any injustice invalued in their assessment.  This is of vital importance because as far as I know, community welfare officers throughout the country are completely confused about this aspect.  I am glad the Minister is telling the House this afternoon that everything stands as heretofore.  It is of vital importance that every official within each health board is made fully aware of <Col N="3253" /> the Minister's statement here this afternoon.</P>

      <P>Is it the Minister's intention to rectify the anomaly obtaining between Dublin city and county, whereby people moving from Dublin city to Dublin county qualify under the provisions of the free fuel scheme whereas a vast number of people living in County Dublin do not qualify?

He will be aware also that the rationalisation of those schemes would be a very considerable undertaking possibly with implications of enormous expenditure, or if not enormous additional expenditure then the loss of entitlement of a great many categories of people.  My Department have this under review and it should be rectified.  However, it is a very difficult question because of the financial implications involved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMcCarthy" hpid="Dr. McCarthy Dr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if she is satisfied with the assessment of applicants for unemployment assistance by her Department examination officers in general and, in particular, in relation to the assessment of small farmers for unemployment assistance; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>In order to qualify for unemployment assistance an applicant must satisfy a means test.  The investigation of means is carried out by a social welfare officer and on the basis of his report the means of the applicant are assessed by a statutorily appointed deciding officer.</P>
      <P>The means of all applicants are assessed in accordance with the provisions of section 146 of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1981, and the Unemployment Assistance (Calculation of Means Regulations) Order, 1934.  The main items taken into account in assessing means are:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(a)  the yearly value of capital, that is money invested or property which is <Col N="3255" /> not personally used but which is, or is capable of being invested or put to profitable use;</P>
    <P>(b)  cash income;</P>
    <P>(c)  the yearly value of the advantage accruing from property which is personally used but excluding the applicant's home and farm buildings:</P>
    <P>(d)  the yearly value of any benefit or privilege enjoyed, such as board and lodgings.</P>
    <P>As regards the assessment of means of farmers, the position is that income from farming for unemployment assistance purposes is assessed under the legislation as the yearly value of the advantage accruing from the farm.  The calculation is done on an income and expenditure basis and represents the income from farming less the expenses actually and necessarily incurred in earning that income.  The basis of the calculation is the net income over the 12 months preceding the investigation of means.  Where at the time of the assessment the normal pattern of farming has been distorted by unusual factors, for example herd depletion, due allowance is made by the social welfare officer when investigating the means.  The aim of the assessment is that it should reflect the net income from the farm in a normal year.</P>
    <P>The means test is designed to ensure that all applicants for unemployment assistance are treated in an equitable manner having regard to the resources available to them.  I am satisfied that the present system of means assessment as applied to all applicants, including small farmers, ensures that unemployment assistance is made available only to those who are in genuine need and is directly related to the financial circumstances in each individual case.</P>
    <P>I should also point out that where an applicant is dissatisfied with the amount of means assessed against him it is open to him to appeal and have his case determined by an appeals officer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMcCarthy" hpid="Dr. McCarthy Dr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the serious effects of the very rigid <Col N="3256" /> application of the means testing procedure, particularly in relation to the provision of benefit in kind for young applicants, boys and girls, young men and women who are residing at home with their parents and because of the economic climate cannot get jobs, and that the benefit in kind rule in regard to board and lodgings means that these young people are being given pennies to exist on which seriously affects their dignity and their right to become even part of the social establishment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and the Deputy was asking for a considerable relaxation in the means test used which would disregard as much as possible the whole question of benefit and privilege &mdash; that is the term used, as the Deputy rightly says &mdash; to cover accommodation and food for a person.  It might well be desirable that one would give far bigger amounts of money to that category of person, but the problem is that the amount of money involved in removing the benefit and privilege section of the means test is considerable. The figure we discussed on the last occasion was about £30 million. Other Deputies in the House have expressed greater concern about other things, for example, elderly people living alone on long term unemployment assistance with no other means, and some Deputies expressed the view that that category would be of greater priority.  We could all agree on all sides of the House that all these competing demands for greater payments are very desirable and the question which we all in responsible political parties have to ask ourselves is where the money will come from.</P>

      <P>In relation to the provision of unemployment assistance payments to small farmers, was any leeway given to the Minister's investigating <Col N="3257" /> officers this year in assessing these small farmers in view of the fact that they have gone through two atrocious summers with very bad weather?  Many of these farmers are absolutely destitute and there seems to be quite a degree of difference of views among the investigating officers as to what are means and what are not?  In some cases the means which have been arrived at as assessed by the Minister's officers are at total variance with the gross income less the costings.</P>

There is a great degree of dissatisfaction and even the IFA, who in the past have not really concerned themselves too much about the provision of unemployment assistance for small farmers, now are extremely concerned that the assessments of income being made are not factual, and some of the Minister's officers seem to be assessing the ownership of land or stock as being a form or part of means.</P>

      <P>Then if I do not give long answers the Deputy will complain that I am not answering the questions properly. One cannot win here.  The Deputy mentioned the IFA.  I am very happy that recently I had a very good meeting with the IFA on this whole question of unemployment assistance for small farmers. We had a considerable discussion and as a result we have a working group of representatives from the IFA and my Department discussing this kind of issue and problems that arise therefrom from time to time on an ongoing basis.  I assure the House and the Deputy that we are in touch with that farming organisation on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the question of the particularly difficult weather conditions that applied, all applicants for unemployment assistance are made aware that where there has been a set of factors which has changed their means and which would interfere with the assessment originally made, they may apply for a review of their case and they may get a revised means assessment which would reflect the difficulties they would have faced as a result of a factor such as particularly bad weather.  I assure the Deputy that the system is flexible to that extent.  I would emphasise that social welfare officers give the applicants a very detailed copy of the income and expenditure on which they base the assessment and if the applicant feels that this is unfair it is open <Col N="3259" /> to him to appeal and have the case determined by a statutorily appointed appeals officer.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if she is aware of the chaos surrounding social welfare payments following the implementation of the equality legislation, as made clear from a media report (details supplied); whether the delays in payments are unacceptable; and if she will outline her plans, if any, to remedy the situation.</P>

      <P>The equality of treatment provisions and the alleviating measures were complex, particularly in cases where two payments were being made to a family both of which required adjustment. The particular case referred to in the article was further complicated by the fact that one of the payments was what is known as a split payment, that is to say, shared between the husband and wife.  All payments due were issued last week to the person concerned.</P>
      <P>In general, the position is that the equal treatment dependency arrangements came into effect in the week beginning 17 November last and there was no delay in making the necessary adjustments in the vast majority of the affected cases. Furthermore, the further alleviating measures which were announced on 26 November were put into effect last week and claimants were also paid the arrears covering the period since the equal treatment measures took effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is inevitable that in an operation of this size and complexity a small number of cases will give rise to problems resulting in delays.  The administrative requirements involved sending out some 200,000 questionnaires to persons receiving payments and reviewing the entitlements of all those affected.  However, everything is being done to deal as quickly as possible with any cases where there may still be difficulty.  I would emphasise that the article in question did not talk about <Col N="3260" /> chaos surrounding social welfare payments, but referred simply to one case.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that because of the crazy way in which she and the Government attempted to implement the equality directive and then had to do a succession of political gymnastics and U-turns to extricate themselves from political problems, many families who should not have been affected by the directive suffered a huge cut in their social welfare payments so that many cannot buy necessities such as food and clothing?  Is the Minister also aware that there seem to be some 5,000 people who have lost their free electricity this year?</P>

The article on which the Deputy based his question, in which he uses the phrase &ldquo;chaos surrounding social welfare payments&rdquo; referred to one single case which has been fully dealt with.  I would remind the Deputy that last May, 46,000 married women who had been discriminated against under the social welfare system were at last given justice, something that his party failed to do when they were in <Col N="3261" /> Government.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>As a result of the Minister's refusal to accept either of the amendments before the House adjourned, we are now in a position in which the Bill will apply except where otherwise provided in relation to an offence whether committed or alleged to have committed, before or after the passing of this measure.  I want to make a distinction between the case made by Deputy O'Malley and what is the issue. Deputy O'Malley understandably made <Col N="3319" /> the case that if we were to say that offences committed before the commencement of the Act, which the Minister says will be 12 months from now, would not be covered by the Act that would be unacceptable.  I agree with that. For that reason Deputy Woods indicated that from the point of view of this party we wished his amendment to be read that we were talking not in terms of offences alleged to be committed before the commencement of the Act, which is 12 months from now, but about offences alleged to be committed before the passing of the Act which will be tomorrow.</P>
      <P>In passing this section the Government are asking us to accept that this Act applies to offences alleged to be committed before the passing of this Act.  We should not do that.  An offence is alleged to be committed when the allegation is made, when the charge is brought.  This Act applies now to offences alleged to be committed before the passing of this Act.  There has been so many offences alleged to be committed before the passing of this Act that we have to be very careful that we do not, in this law, give a cover for the type of alleged offences that will not hold water in our courts or in other courts.  This again is an example of an ill-thought out and hasty conclusion on the part of the Government who must be aware that when they insert words such as that they cannot lay it all at the door of the parliamentary draftsman.  He does as he is told and there is nothing here as complex as the kind of gobbledegook the Minister and I used have to engage in on Finance Acts.  This is clear and simple.  What the Government are doing here is not acceptable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What type of offences are we talking about &mdash; offences, which due to police questioning procedures either in Northern Ireland or in Britain, are alleged to have been committed, Do we not know enough about the police practices in both Britain and Northern Ireland to make us very apprehensive in respect of arranging convenient extradition for alleged offences such as those?  If we endorse that kind of extradition we endorse also the <Col N="3320" /> practices which give rise to these alleged offences.  That is something we cannot and should not be asked to accept.  The Diplock courts and the police practices in relation to them &mdash; paid informers who are subsequently going to be granted immunity and the information of paid informers on which the police act all give rise to alleged offences.  The kind of questioning which was engaged in Birmingham and in Guildford gives rise to alleged offences.  We are now going to extradite people, without <i>prima facie</i> evidence, in respect of these alleged offences, even before the passing of this Act.</P>
    <P>I do not see how anyone in this House who has a concern for the principles of jurisprudence and justice&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>This Act applies to an offence alleged to have been committed before the passing of this Act.  That is the law we are now being asked to pass and that is the point I am addressing myself to.  I do not think that is acceptable in view of the nature of the alleged offence to which this Act will not apply either in respect of practices in Britain or in Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>We owe it to ourselves as a sovereign Parliament that has a function under the separation of powers enshrined in our Constitution to protect not only the Judiciary but to vindicate the rights of our citizens.  I do not think we should be asked to pass a section such as that.  The Minister at this stage should acknowledge that that section as it stands is in fact capable of being used and can be used to ask for extradition proceedings based on questioning practices, police practices and marshalling of evidence through, to say the least of it, unacceptable procedures such as paid informers which would not stand up in this jurisdiction, which never have and, please God, never will.  If it does not stand up here we are quite prepared to say, &ldquo;yes, but we will extradite only to places where they do stand up.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to engage in what might conveniently be called &ldquo;Brit bashing&rdquo; but I do want to assert that our legal practices, and our police and court procedures are of the highest possible standards.  If they are not as high elsewhere it is up to us to expose those shortcomings and particularly to say we will not have any truck with them in terms of endorsing them by extraditing people on the basis of alleged offences.  I do not want to get into the realm of dreamland by going back 15 to 20 years but there is no doubt that there are many people who will be <Col N="3322" /> put on the hazard at this point.  The reality is that there has not been any lack of willingness in this jurisdiction under any Government to have people charged in accordance with the law for outrageous crimes.</P>
    <P>That is not the problem.  The problem has always been the lack of evidence.  I quoted on Second Stage the Chief Constable of the RUC, Sir John Hermon, who, in my presence in Saint Anne's Cathedral in Belfast acknowledged that the problem was lack of evidence.  If the problem is one of lack of evidence, as we have seen unfortunately during the years particularly in Northern Ireland, there are ways and means of getting &ldquo;evidence&rdquo; for alleged offences.  This Bill seeks to endorse that here.  I find that unacceptable as must any Member who has an awareness of what our obligations are. That is why I ask the Minister in the circumstances to have second thoughts on this.  There is no point in saying that we do not intend to do it that way.  The actions of the past ten years demonstrate how things are done and done wrongly.</P>
    <P>In fairness to the Guildford Four, the Birmingham Six and Annie Maguire it is time we in this sovereign Parliament gave a clear signal that we are not going to tolerate that kind of thing, that we are not going to ask our courts to extradite on that basis.  We could extradite people who would be subjected to the same treatment as those people who were accused wrongly of the Birmingham and Guildford bombings.  That is what we are being asked to do today.  I find that reprehensible and any Member of Parliament should share the same view.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>When discussing Deputy Woods's amendment before lunch to change subsection (4) I made most of the points I wished to make regarding this section but I would like the Minister to clarify a few points particularly in regard to subsection (4).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsection (4) deals with the retroactive aspect of the Act.  What will the position be regarding extradition requests on named people which have failed in <Col N="3323" /> the courts here?  There have been a number of cases where extradition warrants were defended successfully in the courts here and people were not extradited as a result of claiming that their alleged offence was of a political nature. What will be the position of those who have found themselves in court on foot of extradition warrants but who, because they applied a successful defence, claiming the offence was political, were not extradited?  At least we will know what will no longer be construed as a political offence.  What will be the position of people who have successfully defended extradition warrants if the British or Six Counties authorities should seek to extradite them now?  Will those people be put on trial again?  From my reading of the Bill I believe this is possible.  One could argue as to whether defending an extradition application is really a trial.  Most people would agree that it would not be correct jurisprudence to bring a person before the court again if a previous extradition application had failed.  Since the Minister has steadfastly refused to put any safeguards into the Bill, particularly the safeguard requiring <i>prima facie</i> evidence, anyone can be extradited whether there is a case to answer or not.</P>
    <P>We have discussed this Bill totally in the context of extradition applications between here and the UK.  It would be a pity if we did not consider at some stage during the debate that these extradition arrangements will apply in respect of all the signatories and any other states which the Minister for Foreign Affairs may designate from time to time.  The Minister told us yesterday about this extra arrangement to be made between the Irish and British authorities whereby an extradition application will not be proceeded with unless the Director of Public Prosecutions in Northern Ireland or the British Attorney General is satisfied that there is sufficient evidence against a person.  At least that is something extra. I accept that 99 cases out of 100 involve Ireland and the UK, but we are putting <Col N="3324" /> on the Statute Book an Act which will apply to all the other convention countries as well where there will be no such extra arrangement.  What will be the position some years hence if we do not like the way some of those countries operate their system and if we have grave doubt about extraditing people to their jurisdictions? This Bill appears more flawed the more it is discussed.  It is bad legislation.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to clarify part of section 1 (1) which states:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;serious offence&rdquo; means an offence which, if the act constituting the offence took place in the State, would be an offence for which a person aged 21 years or over, of full capacity and not previously convicted may be punished by imprisonment for a term of 5 years or by a more severe penalty.</P>
    <P>Why specify 21 years?  I cannot understand it.  Perhaps the Minister would clarify that point.</P>

      <P>As the Bill enters its second full day of debate it is inevitable that there will be repetition.  I do not want to contribute to that repetition or to delay unduly the passage of the Bill, but I should like to re-echo the view expressed earlier by Deputy Liam Cosgrave when he regretted that this important legislation was being put through the House with such haste.  It is regrettable that the Government should have taken the decision to have this Bill dealt with in the concluding hours of this session.  It deserves the more serious consideration of the House.  When I spoke on Second Stage I said that the Bill in its initial stages was more appropriate to an all-party committee of the House where all these matters could have been teased out and some consensus reached.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is firmly entrenched in his view and is determined to pursue that view to the end, even though he knows that not only are Members on this side of the House in disagreement but also <Col N="3325" /> members of his own party.  The Minister would be serving the best interests of the nation if he recognised the degree of unanimity expressed by totally different political parties with completely different ideologies in relation to a matter as sensitive as extradition.  At the end of the day this is not a political issue.  We have no desire to make it such.  The Minister will not suffer any loss of face even at this late stage if he decides to recognise that the amendments are worthy and should be accepted in the national interest.  The Minister should now give serious consideration to accepting at least the remainder of the amendments.</P>
    <P>I was totally discouraged when I found that the House had outvoted our very legitimate amendment in relation to the production of <i>prima facie</i> evidence for extradition.  I felt that the whole foundation had been taken away in relation to the case we are making.  The Minister has an opportunity, even at this late stage, to redeem himself and this House with regard to the credibility of what is being voted through by the effectiveness of the Whip system as it operates.  It is obvious to him and to every Member of this House that people are walking behind the Minister into the division lobbies who do not agree with what they are being asked to vote for.  I hold the view, particularly in relation to a matter as sensitive as this, that the Minister should not impose that liability on his own backbenchers or on anybody else.</P>

      <P>I spoke fairly extensively on Second Stage.  I expressed unease at that stage about the aspects on which we have now tabled amendments.  On section 1 that we are debating now, the Minister has said nothing which would in any way convince me that the case which he is putting forward is in any way credible or justified.  His reluctance to accept the <i>prima facie</i> amendment tabled by Members from all parts of this House is an indication that he is totally entrenched in his views.  It is very relevant to this section that the Minister earlier made the <Col N="3326" /> point that the island of Ireland is unique in this matter because of the existence of Northern Ireland.</P>

      <P>How can we credibly, in this part of the island, give our imprimatur to a request for extradition to an administration where both the courts and the police system have been as suspect as they have been down through the years?

He could do with some lectures himself, as he has demonstrated in this House.  Subsection (4) underlines the extent of the application of the Act and the procedures which would be acceptable to bring the Act into effect.  I submit that on that basis everything that Deputy Hyland has said in relation to an alleged offence, police practice and courts practices is entirely relevant.

    </Speaker>
    <P>In the section which we are now discussing, the Minister is asking this House to give its imprimatur to a situation where people can be brought to justice under the terms of this Bill even to appear in relation to matters prior to the passing of the Bill in this House.  For any Minister for Justice to seek the approval of this <Col N="3328" /> House to a proposal as serious and draconian as that is not on.  It indicates how naive the Minister is with regard to the entire Bill.  He is closing his eyes to the reality of the situation in Northern Ireland and is expecting us to pass this section, which would allow extradition even for acts which were alleged to have been committed long before this Bill becomes a reality in 12 months' time.  He must be out of his mind if he thinks this House would give approval to that kind of regressive legislation.  If he has not accepted our amendment on the need to produce <i>prima facie</i> evidence on extradition, would he accept from us that this requirement is totally retrograde and one which it is hoped cannot be accepted? I appeal to the Minister to accept the amendment tabled by our spokesman, Deputy Woods.</P>

He is objecting to the provision in subsection (4) where the Act applies &ldquo;to an offence whether committed or alleged to have been committed before or after the passing of this Act&rdquo;. He is picking up this word &ldquo;alleged&rdquo;. Extradition can be granted in the case of persons who had been convicted of an offence or who are being accused of an offence.  Up to the time when the offence is tried and up to the time when the matter of criminal liability is determined, there is an alleged offence.  There is an allegation; that is the only way to describe it.  All of the rest of what Deputy O'Kennedy built on to this word &ldquo;allegation&rdquo; is a pure construction of his imagination.</P>

      <P>The allegation is there until it is either proven or disproven.  In terms of extradition, we are not talking about the determination of criminal liability, we are talking simply about the determination of the issue of extraditability. Except in the case where it is a convicted person whose extradition is being requested, we are talking about an alleged offence.  That is the context in which we see this section.  He suggested that people are being put on the hazard but that is not so in relation to criminal liability.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry that Deputy O'Kennedy feels his point is not getting across but it is at least arguable that if that is the case it is because there is not much in it in the first place.  Deputy O'Kennedy simply took the appearance of the word &ldquo;allege&rdquo; in this section to make a speech about something totally different.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McCreevy raised the question of a case where an application for extradition had already been refused prior to the passing of this Bill in relation to an offence which might no longer be deemed <Col N="3331" /> to be one to which the political defence would apply.  In other words, if a new application is made for extradition after the passage of the Bill, would the person be extraditable?  That is a matter for decision by the courts because the question is whether, on the basis of the procedures set out in the Act and the convention, that person is extraditable. Of course it would be a material consideration in the determination of that question whether the offence was one which was now excluded from the scope of the political defence.  I cannot say what a court would decide in a case like that, we would only know that by having a case like that submitted to it.  If an application is made for extradition, it would have to be reviewed under the procedures set out.  I must insist that what is in question there is simply the matter of extraditability and not criminal liability.  In no sense could it be argued that there is a question of double jeopardy because, as is clear from the debate, the matter being tested in our jurisdiction is not the criminal liability question but that of extraditability. Indeed, as I pointed out before when we were talking about the amendments, a provision of this kind is the standard one on any occasion when changes are made in the extradition arrangements.  It was a feature of the 1965 Act and was included in the recent treaty concluded between ourselves and the United States.  As I pointed out earlier this morning, the matter now being raised on this section was not adverted to during the course of that debate.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCreevy alleged that the Minister steadfastly refused to put any safeguards in the Bill.  That is not the case, I spoke of the safeguards already built into our procedures under the 1965 Act which neither Deputy McCreevy nor his colleagues saw fit to challenge or to attempt to modify.  I wonder why.  In addition, we have put in place a separate arrangement with the UK authorities.</P>
    <P>In relation to the definition of a serious offence, particularly the reference to the age of 21, that is put in because there are <Col N="3332" /> a number of restrictions on the imprisonment of young people.  In defining a serious offence, we wanted to make sure that there was nothing in the definition which could give rise to any reasonable fear that we had included as a serious offence something that would not be treated as a serious offence either in our courts or, subsequently, in the penal system.  In making the reference to the age of 21 and full capacity, our intention is to make sure that the offences covered here are really serious offences.</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods asked at what age one can be extradited.  There is no age limit in regard to extradition.  For example, in a recent case a young person of 17 years was extradited here from the UK for an offence he had committed here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">

      <P>This has been part of our system since the 1965 Extradition Act and, as far as I am aware, it has not been the subject of any proposal for amendment by the Opposition in government or out of it.  It was not a matter which caused them any hesitation at the time when they or their predecessors were sponsoring the Bill which led to the 1965 Act.  I do not intend to follow Deputy Hyland in his trip down memory lane as far as the previous part of the debate is concerned because I want to stick to the section and not make another Second Stage speech.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister clarified some of the points which I raised but, in case anyone is in any doubt, it will be possible, depending on the nature of the case, for people who have already been before the courts here on foot of an extradition warrant, where the courts decided <Col N="3333" /> that they would not be extradited, to be brought before the courts again on foot of another extradition warrant.  I do not know if, in strictly legal terms, that is placing a person on trial twice for the same offence.  I do not think it would be proper to bring such people before the courts again as it constitutes double jeopardy. Perhaps the Minister will consider introducing an amendment on Report Stage indicating that people who have been before the courts previously on foot of an extradition warrant which was refused on the grounds that the person claimed it was a political offence, should not be brought before the courts again.  In the interests of justice it would be equitable to introduce such an amendment.</P>
      <P>The Minister said today and on previous occasions that Fianna Fáil did not challenge the 1965 Act.  However, that Act specifically excluded extradition for a political offence.  This Bill redefines a political offence.  Up to now we have steadfastly refused to extradite a person who claimed that the alleged offence was a political offence, or connected with a political offence.  The 1965 Act is completely different.  In 1965 we were not prepared to extradite a person who alleged that he was being extradited for a political offence.  The same applied in the seventies when rather than change the Act regarding extradition the then Coalition Government brought in the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act, 1976. The then Taoiseach, Mr. Liam Cosgrave, steadfastly refused to go down this road although the Sunningdale Agreement had been signed and the British authorities were anxious to have an extradition agreement similar to that which we are now putting on our Statute Book.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a red herring to introduce phrases like &ldquo;the 1956 Act says before or after the passing of this Act&rdquo; because that Act did not say a person could be extradited for a political offence.  This is a major change.  As I said, the Minister is introducing a red herring to distract attention from the shortcomings of this Bill, but it does not distract me because I realise it is a ploy to get people's minds off the real <Col N="3334" /> proposals in this legislation.  This legislation takes away a person's right to claim that an offence is of a political nature. This is a fundamental change in the law. Talking about the 1965 Act in this way is like saying a game of hockey and a game of Gaelic football are the same.  They bear no relationship except that they are both games.</P>
    <P>I want it to be clear that under this Bill people can be brought to court again, although extradition warrants have been refused in the past.  Unless an amendment is introduced on Report Stage, it will be possible to bring these people before the courts again.  I do not think that in the interests of justice that is right or fair.</P>

      <P>This brings us to the heart of what this Bill is about.  I would remind Deputy McCreevy, in particular, that he is one of a number of Deputies who said he agreed with the general thrust of this Bill and with the change we are making in the definition of a political offence. This morning he said &mdash; and I think I am quoting him correctly &mdash; that in his view maybe we should have done this before.</P>

      <P>On a point of order, I do not mind being quoted if I have said something, but Deputy O'Malley said that and I said Deputy O'Malley had also changed his view about this matter but I did not agree with him.  The Minister is confusing me with Deputy O'Malley and the record will show I never said it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>That is something I will take up with Deputy McCreevy.  For <Col N="3335" /> whatever comfort it might be, I would never confuse him with Deputy O'Malley.  Deputy McCreevy and the Fianna Fáil Party have said they support the principle of this Bill.  The essential function of this Bill is to clarify the scope of a political offence, but what Deputy McCreevy said a moment ago goes against that.  I should like the Fianna Fáil Party, and in particular Deputy McCreevy, for whom I have a special regard and affection, to make up their minds on where they stand on that issue. If Deputy McCreevy is saying we should not change the scope of the political offence, let him say so, and then he is opposing the Bill, but I want that to be clear because we need to know.</P>
      <P>I said there is no question of double jeopardy here nor can there be since what would be at issue is not the question of criminal liability but the question of extraditability.  Under the 1965 Act as it now stands, and as it would continue after this &mdash; and I am not comparing games of hockey to Gaelic football &mdash; if we were to send a warrant to Britain requesting a person's extradition and that warrant turned out to be defective and was refused, there is absolutely nothing to stop us from requesting again the extradition of that same person by warrant.  It might be refused again or it might be granted, but there is nothing in the system that would prevent us from doing that.  Our system is designed not to have vexatious warrants but that can happen under the system as we know it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To make another example, take the case of a person who was wanted for the murder of a head of State in 1960.  Before the passage of the 1965 Act that person would not have been extraditable here. After the passage of the 1965 Act, he would have been extraditable and it would have been perfectly in order for a request to be made to us to extradite that person.  The same situation would apply under the provisions of this section.  It is completely wrong of Deputy McCreevy to pretend that this Bill removes the possibility of a refusal of extradition on <Col N="3336" /> the grounds that an offence is political. It does no such thing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I doubt that it would be even remotely described as practically impossible.  What it does is say in section 3 that there are certain offences, serious offences, which will not be regarded as political offence, and section 4 provides that there are certain offences which may not be regarded as political offences.  This Bill does not in any way demolish or exclude a political offence, and to object to it on that ground is objecting to it &mdash; on a ground which does not exist.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister was asked about the age at which a person could be extradited.  He referred to the serious offences in the interpretation section.  In section 3 (3) &mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnJRyan" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle John J. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but I am dealing with the definition and it is essential that I refer to this section.  Section 3 (3) (iii) states: &ldquo;a serious offence involving an attack against a life, physical integrity or liberty of an internationally protected person&rdquo;.  A serious offence is mentioned <Col N="3337" /> and obviously it has to be defined.  Paragraph (i) and (ii) of that subsection refer to an offence; paragraph (iii) refers to a serious offence; paragraph (iv) refers to an offence; paragraph (v) refers to an offence involving the use of explosives or automatic firearms; and paragraph (vi) refers to any offence of attempting to commit any of the foregoing offences.</P>
      <P>The Minister pointed out that the age of 21 years applies to the serious offences mentioned.  For the other offences the age is the age of criminal responsibility, from seven onwards.  I know the Minister has no intention of having people extradited at the age of eight, nine, ten, 14 or 15.  He mentioned extraditing a person of 17 years of age.  It is purely by way of clarification that the question was asked. Am I right in that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>In section 3 (3) (a), paragraphs (i), (ii), (iv), (v) and (vi) are all offences which would be regarded as serious offences.  Paragraph (iii) applies to a serious offence involving an attack against the life, physical integrity or liberty of an internationally protected person.  If an offence of that kind is treated in our law as being an offence which would carry a punishment by imprisonment for a term of five years or less, it would not be regarded as a serious offence for the purposes of section 3.  If on the other hand it is an offence which, if committed by a person aged 21 years or over, of full capacity and not previously convicted, it would carry a penalty on conviction of a term of five years imprisonment or more.  That would be regarded as a serious offence for the purposes of section 3 (3).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is confused with what I said on Second Stage of this debate.  I said I have serious reservations about this Bill.  In regard to the definition of a political offence I said we are engaging in a very subjective argument in this legislation, and that we are going to decide what is a political offence. If the Minister reads what I said on Second Stage he will see that is what I stated.  Apart from Deputy Blaney, I was <Col N="3338" /> the only other person to say I had serious reservations about the Bill.  I adopted a very different tactic to that adopted by our spokesperson, Deputy Woods.</P>
      <P>In this section we are eliminating what will no longer be regarded as a political offence.  Perhaps the Minister can give me some examples of what will be a political offence.  The only ones I can think of are if somebody shouts: &ldquo;up Dev&rdquo; or &ldquo;up the Republic&rdquo; or by singing &ldquo;Roddy McCauley.&rdquo;  If a person sings that song in a pub in Northern Ireland, causes a riot and damages property, it probably will not be regarded as a political offence. There are sections in the Bill which eliminate things like that.  Perhaps the Minister could give an example of what in the future, in the context of the Six Counties, will be regarded as a political offence.  It is not in the Bill so it will not have any legal standing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I might elicit from the Minister some information relative to this section.  Will the British treat their citizens in regard to extradition on a warrant sought or produced by us in the same manner as we propose to treat our citizens where we are requested by them? Like Deputy McCreevy, I also ask what are the serious offences that the Minister will envisage as possibly existing outside of those he has set aside in section 3?  He has picked out offences which are not political.  Some examples of political offences would be very enlightening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 1 is the effective section of the Bill.  I hope I am not misquoting the Minister when I say that he stated in some part of the debate that we are seeking to remove obstacles from the extradition of people from this jurisdiction to wheresoever. I think I am not wrong in paraphrasing many of the Minister's statements that this is on foot of our undertakings under the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  It is just a part of that agreement which was signed in Hillsborough. Surely these are no bases on which to come into this or any other Parliament to propose legislation with such serious implications as this has.  Section 1 (4) states: &ldquo;before or after the passing of <Col N="3339" /> this Act&rdquo;.  The Minister falls back on this much-abused defence by referring everybody back, in particular anybody who happened to be in Government at that time, to the Extradition Act, 1965.  He refers to what was or what was not done in that Act and the reasons for it.</P>
    <P>One Member a couple of nights ago wisely pointed out that this is 1986 and a lot has happened since 1965.  We have to take that into consideration and it is not good enough to ask other Members why they did not do something in 1965 or change something since.  The fact is that this was not done until we got the abortion that was, the McGlinchey extradition, and the political offence that was a traditional and historical matter here was a quite sufficient safeguard as far as extradition to the Six Counties was concerned.</P>
    <P>The Minister is delaying the implementation of the provisions of the Bill for almost 12 months because he is not satisfied with the administration of justice in that jurisdiction.  If he is not so satisfied can he not appreciate that while he, and his Government, are removing obstacles to extradition which is part of their agreement under the Anglo-Irish Agreement, the rest of us who were no part of that agreement and are totally opposed to it are most concerned about this issue.  The Minister is putting across the view that this is of no account and that things have not changed since the 1965 Act was passed.  If the 1965 Act is all the Minister purports it to be why bother changing it at all?  I am not saying that changes should not be made but the Minister is trying to indicate that we are all engaged in a pre-Christmas exercise by the Government. It is far from that because it does not tally with what the Minister has said.</P>
    <P>I put great weight on this removing of obstacles in order to facilitate extradition so as to please the Prime Minister of Britain under the Anglo-Irish Agreement. The British Prime Minister got from that agreement the first and only admission that she, the British occupier, has a right to be there and may remain there until the contrived majority says <Col N="3340" /> she must go, which will be Tib's eve.  We must look at this in that context.  I ask the Minister to accept that we are not here to annoy him or take up the short amount of time allocated to debating this measure.  There is an urgency to get the measure through before Christmas because the Government fear they may not be in a position to get any measures through after Christmas, but it is my belief that they will be able to have legislation passed and that depends on how they deal in the meantime.  That is no part of this debate and I will not elaborate on it.  Indeed, it would be adverse to the chances of success of the dealing that is going on if I were to.  For that reason also I do not intend to say anything further on that issue.</P>
    <P>It is extraordinary to think that the phrase &ldquo;before or after the passing of this Act&rdquo; could have that effect.  It may be that there are Members who can be taken under this provision.  Does the Minister realise that?  Has he looked around?  Does he feel that if some Members, if there are more than one, could be taken under this new provision it would enhance his Government's prospects of remaining in office because it would be taking an Opposition vote or votes away?</P>

      <P>The Minister should not be so sure about that.  I did not make that statement lightly.  I reckon that there is one Member who can be removed if a warrant is issued.  Will there be any immunity for a Member in those circumstances? I am not advocating that there should be because what is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander and if it was felt a representative of the people should be granted immunity because of the dangers to him then the same should apply to his constituents.</P>

      <P>I am reacting, as is natural, to interjections that awake some memories, if that is necessary.  The Minister, and my colleague, Deputy O'Malley, have been putting me off track with the result that I have been a little out of order and for that I apologise to the Chair but this is a scandalous piece of legislation.  I have no doubt about that. Is it a fact that many former Members who may be 85 or 90 years of age now could be included under that phrase &ldquo;before or after the passing of the Act&rdquo;? Back in the twenties some of them were sentenced to death <i>in absentia</i>.  Can they be extradited?  If that is so it is crazy.  It is wrong that we should go back to the twenties.  The Government want to be all things to our occupiers, and to the British, and they want us to go back to a time when none of us, regardless of which side of the divide we took, wanted to be part of their regime.  It is conceivable but almost unbelieveable that this can happen.  The Minister may say that that cannot happen but it can happen and the Minister is providing for it in the Bill by including the word &ldquo;before&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not believe that the Minister, or any other member of the Cabinet, intends to do that irrespective of their motives on foot of their Anglo-Irish sellout. I admit that the cases I have outlined are extremes but in between there are hundreds of people who are watching what is happening in the House and wondering if they will have to flee, not because they committed any crime but because of what they were.  Many of those people have not been able to go back across that Border since.  They are living <Col N="3342" /> in fear because subsection (4) is retroactive. I appeal to the Minister to take care of that before the night is out.  He should protect those who have never committed any crime other than being nationalists in their own land but were on the wrong side of the line.  They were hounded and harassed and are wanted people if they go back even though a crime was not committed.  There are hundreds of those people living among us and I know them.  I am sure the Minister, who lives far from the Border, will find them in his constituency.  I appeal to the Minister to have a care in that regard. The provision is a dangerous one and is causing great fear to many innocent people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy McCreevy has asked me to give an example of what might be regarded as a political offence after the passing of the Bill.  I am going to refuse that invitation because it is not a matter for me to decide.  I am concerned to bring forward legislation that says that certain offences &mdash; they are set out in the Bill &mdash; will not be regarded as political offences.  It will always be open to a person whose extradition is sought to claim the protection of the political exception and in each case it will be up to the courts, on the basis of the law, to decide whether or not that claim should be upheld.  I am concerned to provide that certain specific kinds of offences, set out in section 3, shall not be regarded as political offences and that certain other kinds of offences, dealt with in section 4, may not in certain circumstances be regarded as political offences.  That is as far as I intend going.  I am not trying with the Bill, nor do I think it is possible, to set out a comprehensive definition of what is a political offence.  What I am concerned to do is to bring forward legislation that provides that certain offences will not be regarded as political offences. It will always be open to a person whose extradition has been sought to claim the protection of the political exceptions, and in each case it will be up to the courts on the basis of the law to decide whether such claims should be upheld.  I am trying <Col N="3343" /> to provide that certain specific types of offences set out in section 3 shall not be regarded as political offences and that certain other types of offences dealt with in section 4 may not in certain circumstances be regarded as political offences.</P>
      <P>That is as far as I intend to go.  I am not trying in the Bill, and I do not think it is possible to do it, to set out a comprehensive definition of what is a political offence.  What I am concerned to do is to indicate a number of particularly serious crimes and to remove the cloak of political exception from what are simply acts of violence and terrorism that should never have had the dignity of being given that political cloak.</P>
      <P>On Deputy Blaney's statements and question, I cannot say who might be sought by any other jurisdiction for extradition from here but I can say that anybody who is sought will have the protections built into the system that we operate and have operated since 1965.  I do not agree with Deputy Blaney's opinion about one such case.  I would point out to him that it is not the Bill that changes the situation in regard to political offences.  For a long time it was believed here that the political defence would always apply, would always work, would always be regarded as valid here because it was thought our Constitution created that kind of situation.  A succession of court cases and decisions indicated otherwise. If Deputy Blaney is worried about changes in the background or the climate as a result of definitions given in this Bill of things that may not be regarded as political, the Deputy had equal cause to be worried each time our courts, when presented with the argument that a particular offence was political, decided they would not accept that claim and that they would proceed to give effect to requests for extradition.  This Bill is intended to give a much clearer guideline benchmark to the courts than they have had up to now as to what may not be regarded as a political offence.  That is as far as it goes.</P>

      <P>I asked the Minister a number of questions which he did not answer, and I will add a further one.  One of the many examples of serious offences excluded from the defence of political offence and what goes with it is referred to in section 3 (3) (v) involving the use of an explosive or an automatic firearm if such use endangers persons.  In section 3 (4) (c), an offence involving an automatic firearm is defined as a firearm which is so designed or adapted that if pressure is applied to the trigger missiles continue to be discharged.  Are we taking firearms in the sense of section 3 (3) (v) and, if so, what is the significance of including &ldquo;automatic firearm&rdquo;?  If a guy uses a single shot and he kills somebody the victim is just as dead as if an automatic has been fired.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is relevant on section 1, because without this section we would not have a Bill.  Everything that follows is underpinning what is proposed in this section.  I am curious to know what we are dealing with in the subsections and paragraphs I have referred to in section 3. There seems to be a connection between them but it is not exact and I cannot see the Minister being inexact in a matter about which he is so concerned.</P>
      <P>I asked other questions.  Has the Minister told us how the British treat their citizens, what provisions they have made if we seek extradition of their citizens and how does it compare with what we are proposing in regard to our citizens when they are asked for by Britain or the Six Countries?  Deputy McCreevy was not unfair; he did not ask the Minister to trot out everything that conceivably could have been brought in in relation to political offences.  Very reasonably, he asked the Minister, taking all the exclusions later in the Bill, if he would give examples of the many matters not included or precluded from the category of political offences.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I will make a passing reference to the matters dealt with in section 3.  In each case of a firearm being mentioned we are speaking of an automatic firearm because that was the approach adopted by the Council of Europe when they agreed on the terms of the European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism. This Bill is designed to allow us to ratify that.  It seemed to me that the proper course of action was to stay as closely as possible to the terminology used in the Convention.  The Deputy asks again for a definition of what might be regarded as a political offence after the passage of the Bill.  I do not think it would be proper for me to give such a definition.</P>
      <P>The Bill is not concerned with that: it is concerned with merely defining those offences that will not be regarded as political offences.  You could say after that that any other offence &mdash; God knows there are a multitude &mdash; could be claimed to be a political offence.  Whether the courts here would accept that is a totally different question.</P>
      <P>There are numerous offences which the Deputy knows perfectly well would never be regarded as political offences, nor would anybody be daft enough to claim a political defence in relation to them.  I am not setting out to define what is a political offence because, as I have said, any attempts that have been made, including suggestions in some of the amendments, that go in the direction of trying to define political offences fall down.  We cannot possibly define in every possible case what should be regarded as a political offence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not being naive in expecting Members of the House to believe he cannot define what is excluded?  We have not asked him to do that.  We have asked him to give us a couple of typical examples.  In the absence of even one example I suggest there is nothing that can be left out.  It is a poor defence the Minister has been making for the reservations he has put into the Bill: he is trying to mitigate his cheek in bringing this before us.  The Minister is trying to make the plea that he <Col N="3346" /> has excluded a political defence in cases where heretofore it was possible to do it. I cannot visualise a serious offence that would not be caught by the inclusions in section 3.  Furthermore, I would say to the Minister that to rely on what the Council of Europe Convention or some such organisation did, God knows how many years ago, is not good enough because there have been a lot of changes since&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1977 this would not have been accepted here by us and it has not been accepted by successive Governments until this one, for the very good reasons the Minister well knows and I know also, but which I will not trot out here because there will be another opportunity to do so.  It is not a good enough argument and justification for the Minister to come along and say, &ldquo;The convention said it in 1977 so who am I to go against it?&rdquo;  I would remind him that we are a sovereign Parliament, in session, enacting legislation concerning our citizens. It is not essential for us to follow, willy-nilly, in the enactment of our legislation what the convention said in 1977.</P>
      <P>Is the Minister not concerned in regard to whatever we pass here, in whatever manner we propose treating our citizens here in regard to requests for extradition to whatever country we may have done a deal with &mdash; and I do not say that with any disrespect &mdash; that he and his Government should expect to have reciprocal arrangements to the last detail as to how their citizens would be treated as against the way we propose treating ours?  Being nearer the Brits than anybody else, having had so much experience of their tender mercies over the years, naturally we would want to know how they treat them in comparison with how this Minister and Government propose treating them under this legislation.  I have asked that question on several occasions and I should like an answer to it.</P>

      <P>This gets us to very interesting points.  I do not for a moment take the view that Deputy Blaney is naive, or that this House is naive.  But Deputy Blaney has finally suggested now that, as far as he can see, we have included so much in the definitions of these offences that are not to be regarded as political, there is very little left.  That is not true anyway.  That says one very clear, significant thing to me.  I am going to leave out the offences listed in section 3 (3) (a) (i) and (ii), they are separate offences dealt with by other international conventions.

      <P>Subsection (4) is a subsection on which I have not received much satisfaction from the Minister either, and the ludicrous situations that can arise thereunder.  It is not possible for the Minister to do as he was asked at an earlier stage on some of the amendments to this section, that is, to exercise some sense and delete the word &ldquo;before&rdquo; from that subsection.  The Minister can circumscribe it any other way he likes but for Heaven's sake delete the word &ldquo;before&rdquo;.  The Minister can define it in any other way he wishes.  But the subsection should not read so that the ludicrous can be put to the Minister and cannot be defended, that people involved in the 1920s struggle are subject to extradition by the very same authorities, that is the Brits, as they were then.  That is the position.  If only for the sake of the tidiness attributed to the Minister, not only in his role in this House and Ministry but in his career beforehand, surely he would not want to leave this slovenly provision behind him which could be used in the way I have said?  It could be used in the way I have said.  It is not necessary to have it there, I take it, nor is it the Minister's intention that people who ran foul of our occupiers back in the twenties could be extradited on a warrant today which no doubt would be still extant and the files would still be there in a dungeon in some sort of a civil administration in Britain.  The Minister would not want that with the long political career we hope he has ahead of him and I would prefer that it be over here rather than over there.</P>

Are we concerned about extradition and about this section <Col N="3352" /> 1 and its implications for its own sake, or are we concerned in this charade we are going through at the moment merely to fulfil maybe foolish promises made at Hillsborough in the agreement that was signed there, or are we, as the Minister said, merely removing obstacles to extradition? If that is the real purpose behind it, why do we want to remove the obstacles? I ask for the umpteenth time how do the British authorities under their laws treat their citizens whose extradition we request as against how we propose in this Bill to treat our citizens whose extradition is requested by them?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I answered that last question in rather a loud voice a few minutes ago but Deputy Blaney may have been shouting at me and he did not hear the answer.  The UK authorities would treat our citizens in broadly the same way that we would treat their citizens on extradition because we have a reciprocal backing of warrants procedure.  The procedure is the same in the two directions.</P>

I made that abundantly clear when we were talking about the two amendments that had been previously proposed to this section and I do not intend to rehearse it all over again.  I did not accept those amendments.  I prefer to have the section as it stands for the reasons I set out at that time.  That is the sum total of the answers to the questions the Deputy has put, but I am looking forward with great anticipation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <P Just="Center">NEW SECTION.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 3, before section 2, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;2.&mdash;Section 50 of the Act of 1965 is amended by the insertion, after subsection (4), of the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&lsquo;(5)  A direction under this section may be given by the Court or the Minister, if the Court or the Minister&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  is not satisfied that the person concerned will receive a fair trial within a reasonable period.</P>
      <P>(b)  is not satisfied, that the general standards which prevail in the administration of justice in the place to which the person is to be removed are satisfactory and acceptable, or</P>
      <P>(c)  has reasonable grounds for believing that the person concerned may be subjected to methods of interrogation which, if operated within the State would be unlawful or which are in breach of Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights.&rsquo;.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is a very important amendment which we are proposing as a safeguard in the introduction of this new legislation.  I did not want to prolong discussion on section 1, but I would point out to the Minister that we agreed in principle to support the taking of Second Stage on the understanding that safeguards would be provided for Irish citizens.  This is one of the safeguards which we feel must be provided in this Bill.  I am quite certain I am striking a chord which rings true with the Minister because his own amendment whereby he is putting back the date of commencement from 1 June to 1 December indicates he is concerned about the matters in this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are seeking to ensure that a person who is extradited to any place will receive a fair trial in a reasonable period of time, that the general standards which prevail in the administration of justice in that place will be acceptable and, thirdly, that <Col N="3357" /> the methods of interrogation used on persons in custody will also be acceptable. These are three very basic safeguards which I am sure the Minister would support. I will be very interested to hear what he has to say about the importance of such safeguards.  When we look at Northern Ireland we are faced with the infamous Diplock courts which have certainly been discredited in the eyes of the world.  I know the Minister will say he is hoping to have change in that area but today's papers carry reports about a statement by Mr. King on this matter. <i>The Irish Times</i> states:</P>
    <P>The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Mr. Tom King, yesterday repeated the British Government's opposition to the introduction of a three-judge Diplock court system in Northern Ireland, but indicated that such a change could be considered at some stage in the future.</P>
    <P>Proposing the second reading of the Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Bill, Mr. King told the House of Commons that the Diplock court system had successfully maintained the highest standards of justice in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>There seems to be a gap between the understanding of justice as it is applied here to citizens in this country and Mr. King's understanding of the highest standards of justice.  <i>The Irish Times</i> report continues:</P>
    <P>The Under-Secretary of State, Mr. Nicholas Scott, also said that the Government was &ldquo;not presently persuaded&rdquo; of the necessity for such change,</P>
    <P>Not surprisingly, the Deputy Leader of the SDLP, Mr. Séamus Mallon, in relation to the Emergency Provisions Act and its operation in the North of Ireland, said:</P>
    <P>The Act itself is so inherently harsh, so far removed from the highest standards that any changes, however good of themselves, will inevitably be deficient.  It is like trying to write a <Col N="3358" /> travel brochure about Siberia &mdash; one might admire the glossy brochure and photographs but Siberia itself is unchanged and unchangeable.</P>
    <P>These are not my words but those of the Deputy Leader of the SDLP yesterday. We are all very familiar with the problems which have arisen in relation to the administration of justice in Northern Ireland and, as far as Irish citizens are concerned, in Great Britain.  We want to provide safeguards for our citizens, especially with the limitation of the political offence which this Bill involves.</P>
    <P>When we look at the situation in the North of Ireland we should look for independent, objective views.  On Second Stage and yesterday Members of the House pointed to the difficulties they saw.  I should like to refer to the book <i>Use and Abuse of Emergency Legislation in Northern Ireland</i> by Dermot P. Walsh, published by the Cobden Trust in 1983. Dermot Walsh is a barrister-at-law and a lecturer in law at University College Cork.  The Cobden Trust is, of course, the National Council for Civil Liberties in the United Kingdom.  He undertook an objective, scholarly study of the situation in the North and he presents his material in that way.  Many of his conclusions are relevant to this debate and to some of the statements the Minister made today and yesterday.  He states:</P>
    <P>The Special Powers regulations, therefore, gave the RUC the means to short circuit traditional British policing and judicial practice by relying on very broad powers of arrest to maintain control.</P>
    <P>When Westminster repealed the Special Powers legislation it did not strip the RUC of its wide powers of arrest.  These were simply re-worded and re-enacted in new legislation. Today the relevant powers are contained in section 11 of the Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Act, 1978 (EPA) and section 12 (1) (b) of the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1976 (PTA)...</P>
    <P>A terrorist is defined in section 28 (1) as &lsquo;a person who is or has been <Col N="3359" /> concerned in the commission or attempted commission of any act of terrorism or in directing, organising or training persons for the purposes of terrorism&rsquo;.</P>
    <P>He goes on to analyse experience of the operations of this Act.  One of the conclusions as far as the courts are concerned is as follows:</P>
    <P>It would seem to be police and DPP practice to prefer the most serious charges available in respect of a particular incident.  For example, where an accused is on the periphery of a murder to the extent of passing on information about security force movements he will be charged with murder along with the more appropriate lesser charges; equally, where the circumstances of a case would favour a charge of manslaughter a charge of murder is always preferred.</P>
    <P>I would recommend this booklet to the Minister, because it goes on to deal with many of the concerns of people in this House, with the lack of access to a solicitor, with abuse in the interrogation room, with the unusual features of interrogation which had been made very public over the years &mdash; so public that it was necessary for this country to take the United Kingdom to the European Court of Human Rights.  That court gave its judgment on 18 January 1978.  I do not need to dwell unduly on that; I am sure the Minister is familiar with the case. For a whole series of reasons and having exhaustively examined the case brought by Ireland against the United Kingdom, by 16 votes to one it was decided that the use of the five techniques constituted the practice of inhuman and degrading treatment, which practice was in breach of Article 3.  Unanimously, they claimed that other practices were in violation of Article 3.  There was a great deal of detail in that report but that is a matter of public record.  It is not a question raised by Opposition Members or based on biases or prejudices, or just a matter of emotional concern, as the Minister seemed to indicate yesterday.  These are <Col N="3360" /> hard facts which have been substantiated. They are matters of considerable concern to us in relation to our citizens.</P>
    <P>In that same study, various legal cases were pointed to, one in which it was found that if arrested under section 12 of the Prevention of Terrorism Act, a person has no right to know the offence of which he is suspected.  It is stated that it would be sufficient if he was told that he was suspected of being a terrorist. Another finding was that an arrest under section 12 (1) (b) is simply the first step in the investigation of a person's involvement in terrorism.  The conclusion was that the purpose of interrogation in the Northern emergency apparatus would appear to be twofold &mdash; first, to procure a confession to a criminal offence and, secondly, intelligence gathering.</P>
    <P>Now we are back to Mr. Prior and his statement that the force need only have reasonable suspicion about the person in question to apply for extradition.  He further said that this does not mean that the police force necessarily have enough evidence to bring a charge against the suspect, but just a reasonable suspicion.</P>
    <P>The records are full of cases where citizens have been subjected to harsh and inhuman treatment and to treatment which verges on that if it does not quite come to that level.  A serious danger was pointed out in the McGlinchey case, although there are many other aspects in that case.  McGlinchey, as we know, could have been brought to trial here in the first instance before being sent across the Border.  That did not happen, he went across the Border and the evidence &mdash; if you like to call it evidence &mdash; principally arose from affidavits which he had given in the courts in Dublin when his case was being presented there.  We all know the length of time during which he was kept up there and in the long run there was no evidence in relation to that particular charge.  There is a real fear that people on this side of the House have and this was described by Deputy Taylor yesterday as &ldquo;fishing operations&rdquo;.  The authorities are fishing to get people to tell them about other people where these people do not have any involvement <Col N="3361" /> themselves.  We have already provided, under the first section, that they can fish back into the past on the same basis.  We advise the Minister to make it at least apply from today when this Act passes in the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister ignored our warnings in that regard.  In another case, R. <i>versus</i> Milne of 1978 in Northern Ireland, it was stated that torture, inhuman or degrading treatment in the interrogation room will still not render a confession inadmissible under section 8 unless that treatment was actually used for the purpose of obtaining a confession.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>This survey was carried out in the period 1981 to 1982, which is relatively recent.  In another case of R. <i>versus</i> Brophy, with Judge Kelly presiding, various allegations were made about this kind of thing.  The kind of treatment which was meted out was that the person was slapped on the face, caught and pulled by the hair, jabbed in the stomach, struck on the back of the head, hit on the chest, pushed against the wall, had his head and neck squeezed in such a manner that he fell to the floor losing consciousness.  His head and arms were bent and twisted into his armpits, his feet were stamped upon and various other things were done.  I shall not go into these because it is not really decent to mention them.  These things are recorded.  The Minister has access to them, just as I would have access to some of these records.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These are the fears, fears that there will be a whole process.  The Minister has skilfully, as we went through the various steps of Committee Stage and indeed on Second Stage, skirted around these matters, cleverly brought in red herrings and avoided the issue about which people are worried.  He said that all would be well and even that he is about bigger things. He defined those bigger things here.  He <Col N="3362" /> is about delivering on part of the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  We have already discussed that.  We can see how he can deliver on that agreement and yet look after, protect and safeguard Irish citizens. We see no problem there.  When the Minister says he is about bigger things, there cannot be bigger things than the life, liberty, safety and vindication of the rights of the individual citizen.  There are no bigger things.</P>

      <P>The end does not justify the means, as far as the citizen is concerned. If we are extending the criteria under which they can be extradited, especially in regard to the circumstances that exist between Ireland and the United Kingdom, we must be particularly careful to ensure that we include adequate safeguards when we are, as the Minister rightly puts it, limiting the political exceptions. These limitations have been applied in Europe with various safeguards. In principle, we go along with the Minister in doing that but adequate safeguards must be built in for our citizens. I am sure the Minister is aware of the problems involved and I probably strike a chord to which he will respond.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Other Members mentioned the cases of the Birmingham Six, Annie Maguire and the Guildford Four which took place in Great Britain.  In the case of the Birmingham Six, a former police officer is prepared to come forward as a witness and corroborate what had been alleged earlier by the Six who are in their 13th year in prison.  An excellent programme on Granada television outlined details of the case, especially in regard to explosives. Some fertilisers are explosives and, as in the case of the Birmingham Six, nitrocellulose can remain on your hands from playing cards.  It is interesting to note that the Minister introduced that term as the convention uses the term under Article 1(E) which refers to an offence involving the use of a bomb, rocket, automatic firearm or a parcel bomb.  The Minister uses the term <Col N="3363" />&ldquo;explosive&rdquo; which is a much wider definition and there could be difficulties in that regard.  I advise the Minister to read the submission of 9 September 1985 from Professor Christopher H. Pyle before the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations in regard to the treaty relating to the extradition proceedings regarding political crimes.  The Americans were very concerned about the extension to this wider definition of explosives and the use of that term.  It is relevant to the Birmingham Six because the materials that can be associated with explosives can be very innocent otherwise.  I appreciate that the Minister recognises that difficulty and will be anxious to protect against it.</P>
    <P>The Birmingham Six were subjected to 48 hours of interrogation, inhuman treatment and deprivation of sleep.  A shotgun was pointed at one of the people through the flap of the door which reduced him to a state of desperate fear. A hungry alsatian who had not been fed was barking viciously outside and shown to one of the men.  They were seriously assaulted and photographs support the allegations of the injuries.  Other injuries were inflicted in the police station and the Judges' Rules were ignored.  This happened in Britain and I could detail other cases which happened in Northern Ireland.  There is a duty on the Minister to provide adequate safeguards along the lines we are suggesting in this measure.</P>
    <P>To give the Minister an idea of how people are thinking, I will quote from a letter I received from a professional person who says:</P>
    <P>I should like to bring the following to your notice in this week's crucial debate on extradition ... In your amendments you are proposing you may find my experience in London of interest.  While studying as a student in the vet. college I worked during the summers on motorways in England between the years 1971-78.  I spent the summers in England so I was there during the worst bombing outrages which in my opinion were lunatic activities but it was an experience to <Col N="3364" /> have lived during those times and see first hand how working class Irish people are treated.</P>
    <P>At that time I lived in Kensington and used to go for a drink in a pub on Kensington Church St. One Thursday night the two other Irish lads and myself were in as usual for a drink around 9.30 p.m.  The following night a bomb disposal expert was killed outside the K shoe shop opposite the pub and we were duly questioned as we were in the area before the explosion.  We were not politically aware at that time but as things have gone I shudder to think what could have happened in the light of Annie Maguire, Birmingham Six etc.  My query to you now is this; it is my understanding of this present crazy rushed bit of legislation that if it is passed as presented an Irish national could be extradited on even a trumped up charge.  Many Irish people who were in England in those times had very nasty experiences and I think it is ridiculous that if for instance the tabloid press of Fleet Street got one of its all too frequent hysterical anti-Irish bouts, that after a week of headlines naming some innocent person he could then be bundled off from here to face British justice.  I would like you to ask Deputy Dukes what will be the legal position of an Irish person innocent of any acts of violence who could be named for extradition in say the hysterical tabloid press or on being named under privilege in the House of Commons.</P>
    <P>I will not go any further with the letter but that professional person lived there at the time and abhors violence.  There is a grave danger of miscarriages of justice and we must be particularly careful that we will not contribute to further miscarriages of justice.  We must be careful to build into our arrangements adequate safeguards which will assure such people that we will always be vigilant about attempts to use people as scapegoats and that we will also be vigilant about the process of the administration of law in the places where people are sent.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="3365" /> It was for that and for many other reasons that we have proposed this very important amendment which reads:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;2.&mdash;Section 50 of the Act of 1965 is amended by the insertion, after subsection (4), of the following subsection:</P>
    <P>&lsquo;(5)  A direction under this section may be given by the Court or the Minister, if the Court or the Minister&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  is not satisfied that the person concerned will receive a fair trial within a reasonable period,</P>
    <P>(b)  is not satisfied, that the general standards which prevail in the administration of justice in the place to which the person is to be removed are satisfactory and acceptable, or</P>
    <P>(c)  has reasonable grounds for believing that the person concerned may be subjected to methods of interrogation which, if operated within the State would be unlawful or which are in breach of Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights.&rsquo;.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This is a very simple request and I am sure it is one which, in essence, the Minister would agree with.  I beseech him to avail of this opportunity and to accept this amendment or, if he wishes to vary it between now and Report Stage, to introduce his own amendment.  We do not mind whose amendment is accepted.  We are anxious that adequate safeguards will be provided and that they will be clearly stated in this legislation so that all who follow us will be able to refer to them and that they will not be lost with the passage of time.  There are two very important considerations here, first, the establishment of a <i>prima facie</i> case before we allow an Irish citizen to be extradited and, second, that there be a fair, reasonable and proper standard in the administration of justice and the treatment of persons extradited from Ireland.  This is relevant not only in the context of Northern Ireland and Great Britain but in other countries as well.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="3366" /> Because of the time limit, I will not go into these cases, although I could tell a story about one individual who recently had very disturbing experiences.  Fortunately they ceased immediately some interest in the case was shown in Ireland. In that case there was a difference between what was written down and what was practised.  We will have to be careful about the practice as well as what is written because there are many fine things written in the laws of some of these countries but the practice may be quite different. Therefore, we have to be careful about the practice and how it operates.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to heed our request at this stage and to include this very important safeguard in the Bill.</P>

      <P>This amendment proposes to introduce three new grounds for refusal of extradition to Northern Ireland or Britain.  Deputy Woods referred to other countries, too.  He proposes to insert this amendment into section 50 of the 1965 Act.  His proposal is that the application of this provision would be confined to our extradition arrangements with the United Kingdom.  A provision of this kind, as far as I know, is without precedent in any extradition treaty or in any other extradition arrangement.  It is a fundamental prerequisite for having extradition arrangements with a particular country that there be a basic degree of acceptance that the system of administration of justice in that country is satisfactory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Implicit in the proposed amendment are fundamental doubts about the fairness of trial, the general standards of the administration of justice and the treatment of persons in custody in the requesting countries.  Those doubts go to the basis of the system of law enforcement and administration of justice in the requesting country.  If Deputy Woods has those doubts in this case, he should be proposing that we stop extraditing to that country altogether.  There are no two ways about it.  If his doubts are as he says, he should make it quite clear in this House and in our relations with that other country that that is his view.  He is talking <Col N="3367" /> here about extradition and therefore by definition extraditable cases.  He is not talking about political cases or non-extraditable cases.  He is talking about extraditable cases and cases which run the whole gamut, from the kind of offences we are talking about in the context of this Bill down to what we might call the ordinary, everyday run of the mill criminal activities.</P>
    <P>It is not my impression that that is actually what he has in mind, and I am not at all sure that this amendment has really been framed taking full account of the total context of what Deputy Woods is saying but if it is not, then it should not have been put forward.</P>
    <P>I have made it clear that if the Government were to consider at the time when this legislation comes into effect that there were grounds for doubts of such a fundamental nature about the administration of justice in Northern Ireland or Britain, then the Government would not advocate bringing into existence this legislation.  As we made very clear in the joint communiqué issued after the Hillsborough meeting, we do not attach great importance to seeking measures in Northern Ireland to give substantial expression to the aim of underlining the importance of public confidence in the administration of justice, and the British Government took, and take, the same view.</P>
    <P>I should like to read paragraph 7 of the joint communiqué of 15 November 1985 because it shows not only the concern of this Government but the shared concern of two Governments.  It states:</P>
    <P>The two Governments envisage that the meetings and agenda of the Conference will not normally be announced.</P>
    <P>The earlier part of this document is procedural on the occasion.</P>
    <P>But they wish it to be known that, at its first meeting, the Conference will consider its future programme of work in all the fields &mdash; political, security, legal, economic, social and cultural &mdash;<Col N="3368" /> assigned to it under the Agreement.  It will concentrate at its initial meetings on:</P>
    <P>&mdash;relations between the security forces and the minority community in Northern Ireland;</P>
    <P>&mdash;ways of enhancing security co-operation between the two Governments; and</P>
    <P>&mdash;seeking measures which would give substantial expression to the aim of underlining the importance of public confidence in the administration of justice.</P>
    <P>In the interests of the people of Northern Ireland the two sides are committed to work for early progress in these matters.  Against this background, the Taoiseach said that it was the intention of his Government to accede as soon as possible to the European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism.</P>
    <P>That is the process on which we embarked on 15 November 1985 and on which we have been working and indeed making progress ever since.</P>
    <P>In my opening statement on Second Stage of this Bill I outlined a number of areas in which progress has been made in relation to the administration of justice in Northern Ireland.  I also indicated that it is the Government's view that further progress needs to be made &mdash; that is the British Government's view also &mdash; and that dialogue will continue on measures to improve confidence in the administration of justice in Northern Ireland. In these circumstances, the Government thought it right that the Dáil and the Seanad should have an opportunity to review the question of the Bill's commencement in the light of developments in this area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>It is for that reason that section 12 of the Bill was drafted, to enable the two Houses to make a final <Col N="3369" /> decision on bringing the Act into operation having looked again at progress in the build-up of public confidence in the administration of justice.</P>
      <P>Deputy Woods, in proposing his amendment, referred to a number of cases in the British system of justice.  I would like to recall the attention of the House to what was said during the course of Second Stage by my colleague, Deputy George Birmingham, Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs.  The Government, and I am quite sure Members of this House, will continue with their efforts to persuade the British Home Secretary by all appropriate means to take positive action to enable those involved in these cases to have the opportunity of clearing their names.  It would be neither helpful nor appropriate to include in the Bill a provision of the kind proposed in this amendment as a means of trying to force the British Government to take action on these cases.  That would very likely have the opposite effect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The same would apply in our own case if the boot was on the other foot.  That is a dimension of the Bill that seems to have been totally lost sight of or is being ignored by Deputy Woods and his colleagues.  The amendment is not designed for that purpose, as Deputy Woods seems to think.  It is designed to safeguard persons facing possible extradition in future cases.  I suggest that that kind of provision would certainly be perceived to have that purpose and would most likely be counter-productive in the way I have just mentioned.  That is not to say, quite the contrary in fact, that we will not continue our efforts to persuade the British Government to take positive action on the cases in question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should also point out that in conformity with Article 5 of the Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism which is <Col N="3370" /> included in the explanatory memorandum published with the Bill, there is a safeguard in the Bill against extradition if a person's position is prejudiced on certain grounds.  Article 5 of the convention permits the refusal of extradition where there are substantial grounds for believing that the request for extradition has been made for the purpose of prosecuting or punishing a person on account of his race, religion, nationality or political opinion or that his position might be prejudiced for any of these reasons. There is a similar provision in the European Convention on Extradition and in Part II of the Extradition Act, 1965.  This Bill will apply a similar safeguard to requests from Northern Ireland and Britain.</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods raised a number of points in presenting his amendment to which I must repeat that extradition under the system in operation here is not granted simply for the purposes of questioning; it should not be granted for that purpose and it will not be granted for that purpose.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the case.  Even in the case raised by Deputy Woods, the McGlinchey case, as I said had we had a requirement for a <i>prima facie</i> case to be put forward that person would have been extradited.  It is no reply to that and it is not of any particular significance in the context of that statement to say that people have been acquitted after extradition even where there has been a <i>prima facie</i> case.  We all know perfectly well that there are cases in our own jurisdiction where people who are returned for trial, having gone through a committal hearing and having gone before a district justice who has concluded that there is a case to answer, have been acquitted because the trial judge or the jury did not take the view that guilt had been established beyond a reasonable doubt.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly.  It is not at all surprising, given that that can happen in our own system and in the system in other countries, that there should also be cases where extradition is granted where the court which finally hears the case decides there is not sufficient evidence or there is not a strong enough case for the court to come to the conclusion that guilt has been proven beyond a reasonable doubt.</P>
      <P>Deputy Woods raised the question, although it is not specifically relevant in relation to his amendment, of the use of the term &ldquo;explosives&rdquo; in the Bill.  He made a fair point.  Unfortunately, there is a substance or substances called home-made explosives that can be manufactured from materials that are reasonably easily available here.  The Garda seized a large quantity of this substance very recently.  The reason we use the term &ldquo;explosives&rdquo; in the Bill rather than using the combination of terms used in the convention is very simple.  It was because we wanted to use a term in the Bill that means something in our legislation.  We deliberately used the term &ldquo;explosives&rdquo; because our law provides for certain things in relation to explosives being offences.  I wanted to make it clear beyond any doubt that those offences are the ones we had in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Woods read out a letter from his correspondent, a very understandable letter.  The correspondent asked &mdash; Deputy Woods used the occasion to ask also &mdash; if Irish nationals could be extradited on a trumped-up charge and the answer is &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  The procedure I outlined yesterday, and on Second Stage, is designed specifically to avoid that. Indeed, Deputy Woods made the point in the later part of his presentation that he is concerned with the practice and not with what is written.  I will take a little bit of liberty and latitude with that to say that that is exactly my concern.  I am concerned with what happens in the production, the processing and the sending of a warrant as to the quality of what <Col N="3372" /> underlies it.  It is for that reason that we have come up with this procedure.</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods mentioned something he said was a danger in the UK and almost everywhere in that we could have the less responsible people in the media deciding in relation to a particular difficulty or activity they knew who the guilty person was and deciding to name such a person.  If that happens here and an allegation of that kind is made in the press there will be grounds for action. Not only that, if an allegation of that kind is made about a person who is before a court that person will certainly have grounds for submitting to the court that it was now not possible for him to get a fair trial.  The same kind of course of action will be open to a person in similar circumstances in Britain.</P>
    <P>A provision of the type suggested in the amendment is to my knowledge without precedent in any extradition arrangement. The concerns that lie behind it are ones which the Government share.  Not only that, the Government are taking action to give real expression to those concerns, as I indicated briefly in relation to the action we are taking both in the context of the Anglo-Irish Agreement and in relation to the specific cases mentioned by the Deputy, by direct contact with the British Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment tabled by Deputy Woods for the same reasons he has given.  There has been a development called &ldquo;situation ethics&rdquo; and to my mind what the Minister is talking about is &ldquo;situation justice&rdquo;, a type of justice which is expected to improve. The fact that the Minister has agreed to postpone the coming into effect of this legislation is an indication that we are dealing with &ldquo;situation justice&rdquo;.  The Minister quoted the Minister of State, Deputy Birmingham, and used the word &ldquo;improve&rdquo; as Deputy Birmingham used it.  For that reason we should support what Deputy Woods is advocating.  In dealing with this we &mdash; I include the Minister in this &mdash; have inadequate knowledge of the &ldquo;justice situation&rdquo; as it obtains in the Six Counties.  In today's <Col N="3373" /> newspaper a cousin of mine who is practising law in Belfast has a letter outlining some of the weaknesses in British justice as exemplified in the cases Deputy Woods used as examples.  For that reason I support Deputy Woods in what he is advocating in the House.  I have also taken into consideration the research he has done and the knowledge people on the ground have with regard to this.  If by December 1987 no improvement has taken place then we are handing people over to what is, even by the implication of the Minister's own action in postponing this for 12 months, a flawed system of justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I heard the Minister say in response to Deputy Woods's comments on his amendment that progress has been made.  The Minister was referring to the administration of justice in the Six Counties.  I should like to ask the Minister what progress has been made. The Minister told us that he hopes for more progress but if it is more of the same progress that has not been made we are back to square one because nothing has changes despite the wishful thinking of the Minister and his collegues. Nothing has changed despite all the hopes that they pinned on their agreement. Deputy Woods's amendment is a very sensible one in that it has a realistic outlook. I am sure it is to the Six Counties he is referring in that amendment.  The amendment suggests that if we are not satisfied that the person concerned will receive a fair trial within a reasonable period we should not extradite him.  That &ldquo;reasonable period&rdquo; might apply to other countries where people are jailed for six and nine years before trial.  Nobody could be satisfied that the person concerned will receive a fair trial.  If we are dissatisfied the onus is on the Minister, and the Government, not to hand over to the authorities of such a jurisdiction any citizen, or other person, if they are not assured of a fair trial.  There cannot be such an assurance given in regard to the Six Counties.  A fair trial for many of our people up there is not on and the Minister is aware of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="3374" /> Deputy Woods's amendment also suggests that if we are not satisfied that the administration of justice in the place to which a person is to be removed is acceptable the order should not be made.  Yet again we could not possibly be satisfied with the administration of justice up there.  It is not acceptable.  We must consider the interrogation methods.  We have to be satisfied that we can tolerate them and not be afraid if they see the light of day.  I say that notwithstanding any assertion that certain methods on occasions were used in our jurisdiction, substantiated or not.  That will happen in any jurisdiction but the persistent interrogation methods used in the North and for which Britain was condemned in the European court continue.  Gough Barracks is still there and the operators are even more perfect in their methods of interrogation than they were when we were condemning them.</P>
    <P>There is not an opportunity for a fair trial for any people we send back.  There is not a satisfactory or acceptable administration of justice in the area of the Six Counties and we are not satisfied with the methods of interrogation.  The Minister will remember the cigarette burns. We all saw graphic pictures of them; they were real.  The Minister will remember the sound treatment, the beatings and so on.  Are we satisfied to reject realistic amendments like that before us against a background that is known to the House, and, in particular, to the Department of Justice?  Surely we cannot be serious in pushing through this Bill in order to send citizens, or non-citizens, to that little statelet above the Border where there is neither fair play, a fair hearing or justice and where the methods of interrogation could be added to the horrors in Nazi Germany that we have seen so well depicted.  Do not have any doubt about it.  That is what we are proposing to send our people to through this legislation.</P>
    <P>The Minister is aware of all this.  He is not happy about sending our people into jurisdictions without being sure that they have a charge to answer.  His amendment to extend the time within which the legislation may not come into operation and <Col N="3375" /> until a motion has been passed by both Houses is a clear indication that the Minister is aware of what I have been saying, that he is not happy about this, that this is all window dressing about the progress that has been made, because progress has not been made and our hopes for the future based on that non-progress are negative.</P>
    <P>In those circumstances the Minister would be fulfilling his duty as a member of the Government in this Parliament by backing up his fears.  The Minister and the Government have got what they wanted, what Mrs. Thatcher wanted &mdash; they have got this section.  The Minister should give us the safeguards sought in the amendment of Deputy Woods and by other later amendments.  The least we should expect from an Irish Minister in an Irish Parliament dealing with Irish citizens is protection against the monstrosity that passes for law in the Six Counties.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in sympathy with the feelings behind the amendment but I doubt if it is workable.  It would require some form of inquiry by courts here as to what the circumstances would be, under three major headings, in other jurisdictions. I do not know how the courts here could do that.  These are matters for political judgement.  If this kind of amendment were to be made it should be simply on the basis that the Minister should have power to direct the release of somebody rather than &ldquo;the court or the Minister&rdquo;. I do not know how matters in relation to foreign jurisdiction could be successfully argued in an Irish court, and though I am concerned about the problems that exist in certain jurisdictions, the best way to overcome such difficulties would be at least to limit the extradition of people from here to those against whom there are <i>prima facie</i> cases &mdash; at least not to subject people against whom there are not <i>prima facie</i> cases or against whom <Col N="3376" /> such cases have not been shown, to the possibilities of encountering these difficulties in another jurisdiction.</P>
      <P>The Minister's reply to Deputy Woods seemed to be concentrated mainly on taking issue with some of the things Deputy Woods said rather than on the practicalities of what is in the section.  It seemed to me that while the sentiments might be laudable and understandable in the light of the sordid court cases there have been in Northern Ireland and in England in the past decade, I do not know how a court here could comply with the onus put on it by the requirements of the amendment.</P>
      <P>Deputy Woods should think about the amendment in order to make it more practical rather than having it in the terms in which it is, because it states that the court has to be satisfied that the person concerned will receive a fair trial within a reasonable period.  I do not know how you could satisfy a court here, short of an undertaking from the judge who would be sitting in England or elsewhere guaranteeing that he would hear the case by such and such a date.  I do not think that is practical.</P>
      <P>The amendment also requires that the court must give a direction if it is not satisfied that the general standards which prevail in the place to which the person is to be extradited are satisfactory and acceptable.  It would be impossible for a court in one jurisdiction to form an opinion about the general standards in another jurisdiction.  If some foreign courts were looking at our standards of justice about six months ago and if they were to read the newspapers or the letters to the editor and the various comments made about certain court cases in which certain people got directions from the judge to prevent cases going to the jury &mdash; it happened in more than one celebrated case &mdash; they might come to the conclusion that there were serious defects in Irish justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even assuming that there have been abuses in individual cases in England &mdash; I do not think too many people would disagree with that &mdash; does the fact that there have been injustices done in a small <Col N="3377" /> number of identified cases in England and in Northern Ireland, though some of the worst injustices there were rectified on appeal &mdash; mean that we can never have extradition to a country like that where there have been three or four identified cases of injustice out of tens of thousands of cases in a period of years, and is it reasonable to impose that requirement on a court here on matters like this?  There are other ways in which to try to overcome these difficulties, to avoid potential injustice.</P>
    <P>Unhappily, Committee Stage of this very important, complicated Bill will come to an end in 11 minutes and this is one of the most important and useful amendments.  However, there are plenty of others further down the list, which clearly will not be reached, which contain more practical methods to achieve what Deputy Woods has tried to achieve in this amendment.  This amendment is too widely drawn and it places an impossible requirement on an Irish court, a requirement that it could not undertake, any more than a court in some other country which tried to pass judgment on the general standards of behaviour here, and so on.  The European Court has already found that Britain was in breach of Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights.  That has already been found to be a fact by an international court.</P>
    <P>If this amendment were accepted it would, or could, preclude any extradition to Northern Ireland, which I think would be unreasonable.  Indeed, it could be <Col N="3378" /> argued that it could preclude extradition to Britain because it was the British authorities who were found guilty, not the more localised authorities in Northern Ireland.  It was the Government of the United Kingdom that was the defendant and it was found guilty because of the acts of its servants or agents.</P>
    <P>I would invite Deputy Woods to consider the implications of the amendment, when he may well come to the realisation that it is much too broad and sweeping, in that it would place an impossible burden on a court here and, in the way it is drafted, might well preclude any kind of extradition to any part of Britain or Northern Ireland.</P>

      <P>I am very anxious to have the matter put to the House at this stage. In any event, we do not have time to go into the matter at any length.  I do not agree with Deputy O'Malley.  I think he is wrong in what he says.  The practice in the courts here in a number of cases recently &mdash; and as stated in those cases &mdash; has shown that what he is saying is not true.  I was open to discussion on this if the Minister was willing to consider some variation, either now or on Report Stage. Having said that, I must say that what Deputy O'Malley says in that respect is not borne out in the practice which has been applied to date.  There is no more time for looking at the matter today and I would rather the question was put.</P>

      <P>One of the significant achievements of this Government has been to carve out a new approach to the development of commerical State enterprise which has been both constructive and consistent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government are not anti-public enterprise, ideologically or otherwise; nor could they be.  The Labour Party regard the development of a commercial State sector as the key to the long term creation of wealth and jobs in our economy. Through our participation in this Government we have contributed to a recognition of the significance of the State company as a social enterprise with responsibility to the community and, in particular to their own immediate workforce. State enterprise has, over several decades, made a vital contribution to the development of our economy.  The Labour Party have ensured that this economic contribution has been augmented <Col N="3386" /> by giving to State companies a pioneering role in the development of new management techniques.</P>
    <P>I welcome the pamphlet recently published by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, &ldquo;Public Enterprise &mdash; Everybody's Business&rdquo;.  The record of the Labour Party in Government confirms the unity of purpose within the labour movement in sustaining and promoting public enterprise that is efficient, dynamic and growing.</P>
    <P>In the past four years the Government have identified a key role for public sector companies in the creation of wealth and jobs in our economy.  What has distinguished our approach from that of previous administrations is that we have not at any stage been content to settle for a &ldquo;Government as caretaker&rdquo; policy.</P>
    <P>Recently, the notion of public enterprise as a viable economic instrument has come under unrelenting attack.  The value of its contribution to growth, jobs and wealth creation has been increasingly disparaged in an opportunistic way by the Progressive Democrats.  While it is difficult as always to identify a coherent ideological stance on the part of Fianna Fáil, their new found interest in developing public enterprise is as surprising as it is welcome &mdash; that is, of course, if the commitment is genuine.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil have traditionally adopted the classical caretaker approach to State enterprise.  They have tolerated its presence as a necessary evil.  Public enterprises were developed by Fianna Fáil in an <i>ad hoc</i> fashion where it was acknowledged that private enterprise could not or would not do the job or provide the essential services which were needed in a developing economy.  Their new found conversion, which I welcome, to the notion of treating public enterprise as an efficient and effective instrument of economic development is to be commended. I thank them for putting down this motion for debate.</P>
    <P>I would earnestly hope that they will, in the future, further endorse the coherent approach which this Government have adopted to public enterprise and will not revert to their old policy of &ldquo;out of sight, <Col N="3387" /> our of mind&rdquo;, except when it comes to making appointments to the boards of these companies.</P>
    <P>

    </P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The primary emphasis of this Government has been to develop a modern industrial sector with emphasis on commercial viability and profits.  We have been obliged to take account of the fact that many State enterprises have experienced serious difficulties in recent years.  These have arisen partly, as in the rest of the economy, from the effects of recession and adverse cost movements, and partly from lack of investment and a strategy for growth and development in this sector over a significant number of years.</P>
      <P>We have also taken account of the fact that State companies have responsibilities and objectives which oblige them to pursue lines of action which they would not follow if profit-making was their sole objective.  These social objectives were not, hitherto, clearly spelt out in the context of national planning.  This gave rise to confusion as to how social objectives might be balanced with the necessity for State enterprises to take due account of the commercial reality of the economic enviornment in which they must operate.</P>
      <P>The boards, management and workers in State enterprises are directly accountable in economic decision-making affecting their future.  There is no place for an expectation on their part that Government must automatically in the end support clearly non-viable operations or countenance a lack of flexibility in adapting to modern market conditions.  In the Government's view, commercial public enterprise has a key role to play in the future.  This has meant addressing the weaknesses that became apparent in many of our State enterprises and taking appropriate action to remedy deficiencies so identified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Labour Party's commitment to the development of a vibrant State sector is underlined by our achievement in having the National Development Corporation <Col N="3388" /> established.  The corporation will make a very significant contribution towards unleashing the job creation potential which exists in so many areas of enterprise, especially natural resources, which have remained substantially untapped. The corporation have the scope and the potential to become involved in natural resource-based industry, in stimulating the development of food processing in forest products and in high technology projects.  Since the Opposition now wish to reaffirm in a most timely manner their support for an efficient and effective instrument of economic development, they must surely now be prepared to endorse the concept and the necessity for the National Development Corporation and presumably as a consequence give a clear commitment that it will be maintained if there is a change of Government and honour the request made by the president of Congress, Mr. John Carroll, to the Fianna Fáil Party in this regard.</P>
    <P>At all stages in the past four years, the Government have taken action to secure the viability of our respective State companies, something which was not easy to do but which was a necessity if those companies were to survive and prosper. We have grasped the nettle: in this context, I would direct the attention of the House to my own experience with the Great Southern Hotels, known as the OIE group.  I would remind the House that the option facing this hotel chain at the end of 1983 was liquidation, massive redundancies and a major blow to our tourist industry.  Instead, this Government took the hotels into public ownership as a semi-State enterprise under my aegis.  The board of OIE, the management and the workforce have brought off a remarkable achievement in a short space of time and the group is now established as a profit-making State company.</P>
    <P>I should like to compliment the management of OIE and to indicate to them in public, as I have in private, that the co-operation which they obtained from the workforce and the flexibility with which new management techniques were enabled to be implemented, following proper dialogue and consensus with the <Col N="3389" /> workforce, has ensured that five hotels have continued to trade profitably and improve their performance considerably. Deputies who are familiar with the company will recognise that this has been achieved by a combination of trust in the Department of Labour, a policy of non-interference by the Department in the day to day operations of the company, even at the early stages when there were fears and worries about the way the workforce would have to adapt to new circumstances, and a board who have been unselfish in the time they have given to the operation of the company and to ensuring that the chief executive got all the support and advice which the broadly experienced board were able to bring to bear.  I take responsibility for the appointment of that board, with the agreement of the Government.  There is a model in that success story which other State companies should examine.</P>
    <P>It would be wrong to say that because a company is a State company it must be a good thing, or to say that because a company is in private ownership it must be a good thing.  That is the kind of ideological straitjacket that none of us can afford and which provides a cover for inefficiency on the part of management or an ability by some sections of the workforce to exploit their position to demand that deficits in the operation of that company should automatically be funded out of the State purse.  We have had debates on this.  There is a necessity to say that we will have a positive and constructive way of approaching State companies, that we will not just use them to fill gaps which the private sector will not fill.</P>
    <P>We have to move on to a more positive approach to the whole idea of semi-State companies, which is what we have been trying to do with the National Development Corporation.  I regret that it took so long to get the NDC, or NATCORP as it is now called, off the ground.  I do not think there is any secret that there was a difference of opinion in the interpretation that the Labour Party had as to how best that should develop and the interpretation that some sections of the Fine Gael Party had in relation to the <Col N="3390" /> National Development Corporation. Part of the reason &mdash; and I address my remarks now to those in the semi-State companies generally &mdash; for some of the opposition to the idea of the National Development Corporation was the perception by some who had no particular ideological axe to grind that semi-State companies had become so inefficient, or were perceived to be so inefficient, that this would not be a profitable venture, would not be viable and would not get the sort of performance required and certainly not the job creation without continuous massive subsidies.  I do not accept the view, but I can understand in one way how that perception would be abroad. This House to a certain extent must take responsibility in part for not ensuring that we took a healthy interest in the way in which our State companies were developing.</P>
    <P>All of us are politicians and we all have to deal with State companies in one shape or form.  In making the normal sort of representations that we do on behalf of our constituents, on behalf of the particular constituency which we might represent in order to maintain a presence, or to ensure certain levels of employment, if we do that at the expense of not insisting that these State companies become efficient, more efficient, profit centres in their own right, the short term success that we might have of maintaining the companies would be compounded by long term failure.  There simply would not be the resources ultimately to underpin those companies should they get into long term structural difficulties.  We have seen that with regard to Irish Shipping where, through a combination of factors, the position in terms of figures was presented to the Government and the taxpayers that was, in our view, regretfully totally unacceptable and hence that decision was made.  Difficult as it was to make, it has had, I think, a very positive effect overall on the recognition by people in the semi-State sector that there is a need for efficiency and performance, for profit and wealth creation.  The Labour Party have never had any difficulty about the creation of profit.  Our difficulty has been <Col N="3391" /> that the people who tend to create it do not get a sufficient share of it, or that the sharing out of the profit is not equitably based.  No economic enterprise can develop if profit and wealth are not created at the end of it.  Some commentators would like to attempt to portray us as being anti-profit.  We are not anti-profit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>We are against the stealing of profit by a section of the workforce, be it management or whatever, that have not earned their fair share of it.  It is economic nonsense in a country that is growing in terms of demands, in terms of population, in terms of requirements for additional services if all our enterprises, public and private, do not create wealth.</P>
      <P>In a number of State companies &mdash; and we have had debates on these in this House &mdash; there has been a slow and steady improvement in areas where there have been external factors &mdash; be it the price of energy, the cost of competition from other external companies, the glut in terms of certain industrial commodities, while the EC does its best to all intents and purposes, virtually being dumped into the market, or dumped in the form of subsidies which are very cleverly hidden by their own governments. There has been a recognition by many people in the State sector that efficiency and performance are the absolute <i>sine qua non</i> in order to ensure that these companies will maintain their current workforce at best, and will, it is hoped, develop it into the future in certain subsidiary categories.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would quote, in evidence of that view, a speech made recently by the general secretary Mr. Billy Attlee of the Federated Workers Union of Ireland, my own union who has made public speeches &mdash; and the FWUI have many workers and many members in the State sector &mdash; that the best way that the members of the FWUI in those commercial semi-State companies can protect their jobs and their economic future is to out-perform <Col N="3392" /> the private sector, to be more efficient, more effective and more profitable in a company sense, and to do that in terms of changing market conditions and in terms of new sources of competition &mdash; requires an adaptability to adjust to new circumstances.</P>
    <P>There has been a false argument, not just in this country but elsewhere, that labour market flexibility &mdash; to use the jargonistic phrase that has emerged in talks in other countries &mdash; somehow or other implies either a reduction in wages, which it does not, or a reduction in basic social protection which workers in the labour movement have acquired over a certain number of years through their combined efforts.  That is not what it meant and it has been wrongly attacked as such.  I am glad to be able to tell the House that in the programme for jobs and employment which was adopted at the Social Affairs Council of the Social Affairs Ministers and Labour Ministers last week in Brussels, which I attended, the document which was adopted unanimously by all the member states representing governments of different political complexions clearly makes the distinction between the need for a workforce to adapt to change on the one hand and the rights of workers to retain the protections which are vital to their economic and social wellbeing.  There is no conflict between the two.</P>
    <P>However, there has been a presentation by some people &mdash; and one can understand it, it is a free society and free collective bargaining is part and parcel of the process &mdash; to suggest that any change will have to be resisted and that if there is to be change it has to be paid for, so to speak.  The rate of change and the effect on semi-State companies from the outside is such that I do not think we can enjoy those kinds of days any longer.  It is no longer a question of simply paying for change internally.  It is a necessity that we adapt to change, or we simply will not survive.</P>
    <P>The last point I want to make is this.  I am a person who believes in effective and strong management, but I believe in effective and strong management after <Col N="3393" /> there has been comprehensive and substantial dialogue with the people involved.  In 1986 it is absolutely Victorian and contradictory to educate people to the level that we do, to have highly trained technicians, highly trained accountants, highly trained professionals in one shape, size or form, or highly experienced people in a general sense and to treat them like children in the context of how they should do their job. It is for that reason that the concept of worker participation, industrial democracy within the workforce, is something that I very strongly support.</P>
    <P>There is a need to consult, to involve, to ensure that if there is to be change people should have the right to know what that change will be, the right to voice their views on how that change can affect them and the right to be able to suggest alternative ways of accommodating change in an adult and sensible manner and within a framework that respects their rights as human beings, as workers and as citizens, which is what is necessary in a semi-State company.  It is for that reason that the Worker Participation Bill which I have now introduced into the Seanad, whose delay I regret, has provided for the extension of the experimental programme which was introduced in 1977 to a new category of State companies and, most important the introduction of flexibility itself in how appropriate sub-board structures should operate within semi-State companies. Worker participation simply is not about electing two, three or four people to a board of a company that may have 10,000 or 20,000 employees.  Worker participation is deciding how best the job can be done by the people who are actually involved in it at all levels and then getting on with doing the job once they have been consulted.</P>
    <P>I would hope when this House, after the New Year, is in a position to discuss that Bill, that the Deputies who are so clearly concerned with the viability and profitability, with the strength of commercial semi-State ventures, will give me the kind of support&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>This Government directly and through their spokesmen have, since coming into office, carried on a campaign of denigration against the whole public and semi-State sector.  The feeling of resentment within the sector boiled over in the first and, hopefully, the only full day strike by the Civil Service. All semi-State bodies have been the victims of this campaign and Aer Lingus have suffered more than most from threats to sell off shares in the company on the day that they celebrated their 50th anniversary to attacks by the Minister on fares packages and to what could reasonably be described as sales promotion work by him for rival airlines engaged in creaming off business and profits from the major routes of Aer Lingus.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Aer Lingus in 1986 are celebrating their 50th year of serving the people. They have a staff of 6,000, 5,000 in Ireland, the balance overseas plus the subsidiaries of the Dunfey hotel staff running to nearly 6,000.  At present they have a fleet of 25 aircraft and in the year up to March 1986 carried 2.25 million passengers. This company have been one of the success stories of the semi-State sector and of business generally.  It is a company in which the people have a sense of justifiable pride.  One would have assumed that the Minister responsible for the airline would share the national joy on the 50th anniversary of this company, but no, he took the opportunity on that day, much to the dismay of the workforce, to raise the fears in their minds as to their future by proposing the sale of shares in Aer Lingus, supposedly to raise funds for fleet replacements.  He attempted to justify this major change from public ownership by using distorted <Col N="3395" /> figures of financial requirements of £1,000 million for fleet replacement, a figure which is totally incorrect and which he has failed to substantiate.</P>
    <P>It is important to remember that in the 50 years' history of the company the total equity investment by all Governments has been £73.6 million &mdash; less than the cost of even one jumbo jet.  This can be set against the airline's assets which are conservatively valued at £300 million.</P>
    <P>I want to put on the record the factual situation regarding the funding needs of Aer Lingus.  Far from the £1,000 million which the Minister continually speaks about, he has now admitted in a letter that the actual figure involved for the European and cross-channel fleet is £200 million.  More than half of that figure will be raised by Aer Lingus from profits and by borrowing.  The figure being sought by Aer Lingus from the Government is less than £100 million and £45 million of that relates specifically to past debts which arise from losses incurred on the trans-Atlantic service.  This latter loss was incurred by the company because of the view of successive Governments that it was commercially essential for this country that a scheduled trans-Atlantic service would be available on a year round basis.  The balance of the £55 million being sought from the Government relates to Government equity investment. In order to ensure that the company maintains an adequate debt equity ratio it is essential that the Government, as shareholders, provide equity.  The capital requirements for the European and cross-channel fleet will arise as aircraft are replaced and, as this will be done on a phased basis, the Government equity investment can be made over a period of years.  The company's plan is to replace the older aircraft in the European fleet on a phased basis over the years by both new and secondhand aircraft.  The Aer Lingus investment proposals currently before the Government relate to the European fleet only.</P>
    <P>Despite the Minister's acknowledgement that the figure for European fleet replacement is £200 million, he <Col N="3396" /> again raises the figure of £1,000 million and explains it as follows:</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus capital requirements over the next ten years, including the financing of fleet replacement on its European, cross-channel and North Atlantic operations, as well as its ancillary activities come to a sum in the region of £1,000 million.  That figure includes:</P>
    <P>&mdash;£200 million for replacement of aircraft on the European and cross-channel routes, and</P>
    <P>&mdash;£475 million for the company's extensive range of ancillary activities.</P>
    <P>The balance of the £1,000 million is an estimate of the cost of fleet replacement on the North Atlantic routes.</P>
    <P>The figure of £1,000 million quoted by the Minister in his letter was first raised by him in an article published in <i>The Irish Times</i> on the occasion of the airline's 50th anniversary in May of this year.  It has since been quoted by him and by the press on numerous occasions.  Despite repeated attempts to put the record straight, members of the public must by now be convinced that Aer Lingus are looking for £1,000 million from the Government.  No such figure exists in relation to the airline's fleet requirements. No such figure is being sought by Aer Lingus from the Government in respect of any or all of the company's activities.</P>
    <P>The Minister's reference to a figure of £475 million for ancillary activities does not relate to the proposals before the Government for equity investment for the European fleet.  This figure would appear to include every possible capital requirement of the Aer Lingus group of companies projected over the next ten years &mdash; for example, an annual figure is estimated for day to day capital expenditure and then multiplied by ten.  Any such capital expenditure would be raised by the group of companies and not from the Government.  In fact the bulk of the capital requirements of the subsidiary <Col N="3397" /> companies would be raised by those companies themselves.  There is no question of Aer Lingus seeking Government investment to cover these capital requirements. No Government investment is required for this type of day to day capital expenditure and no such investment is being sought from the Government.</P>
    <P>The Minister goes on to state that the balance of the £1,000 million is an estimate of the cost of fleet replacement on the North Atlantic routes.  The trans-Atlantic fleet is not involved.  The Government's Green Paper on Transport acknowledged that the three B747 aircraft currently being used on the North Atlantic operations have a reasonably long life ahead of them and that their replacement is unlikely until well into the nineties.  The figure of £1,000 million simply does not exist in relation to the proposals currently before the Government.</P>
    <P>The Minister continues to use this mythical figure of £1,000 million and every time it is used, it is damaging to the airline and damaging to the morale of the staff of the airline.  Aer Lingus are not looking for a subsidy or for £1,000 million as Minister Mitchell tries to portray but for an investment of less than £100 million by the Government as shareholder in a profitable company.  A total net profit of £41 million was made by the company in the past three years.  Surely such a company and their workforce are worthy of support and should not be the subject of continuous sniping?</P>
    <P>We in Fianna Fáil believe in a state owned national airline and we believe that if Aer Lingus can be a profitable company for anyone it should be for the State and not in a Thatcher-like sell off for the benefit of other shareholders.</P>
    <P>We are very concerned, as are the workforce of Aer Lingus, as to the deliberations of the interdepartmental committee who are studying the fleet issues. The terms of reference of this committee are not known but we understand that they are very wide ranging and, consequently, their recommendations, options or proposals may also be very wide ranging. I say to this Minister and the Government, &ldquo;you have lost your mandate to <Col N="3398" /> govern, do not attempt in the dying days of this administration to try to force your views of privatisation on Aer Lingus.&rdquo; Fianna Fáil will not stand for it.  When we return to power we will reverse any damaging decision taken by this Government.</P>
    <P>The really sad thing is that the Minister and this Government do not seem to understand the spin-off effects of the national airline.  For example they are advertising not merely themselves but the nation.  They spend more on advertising than Bord Fáilte spend in the United States.  The social and economic benefits of 6,000 people being employed cannot be overstated.  The benefit to the country of the ancillary activities providing as they do, jobs from nursing in the Middle East to airline related jobs in Africa, cannot be overstated.  What is needed is a Minister who believes in the public sector and the fact that the Irish taxpayer should benefit from the history and financial success of a national airline.</P>
    <P>The Minister and the Government simply do not understand and support the need for a State owned national airline. Let me inform the House as to why Ireland needs its own State owned airline.</P>
    <P>Ireland is a small island economy located on the far west of the European Community and air transportation is an integral part of the economic infrastructure. It is economically and socially essential that Ireland continues to own its national airline.  Only the State's own airline can be relied upon to give total long term commitment to the provision of regular year round scheduled services between Ireland and the UK, Europe and the US.  There are far-reaching benefits from regular year round connections for passengers and freight to the main cities of Ireland's trading partners in Europe and the US.  The Government's Green Paper on Transport acknowledges that Aer Lingus provide the strategic links that are required on a year round basis for the development of Ireland's trading with the rest of the world.  If any portion of the State owned airline is sold now it will be only a matter of time before more and more is sold off.  Ireland and the Irish <Col N="3399" /> people will lose control if this happens to this vital element of our economic development.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Communications, by his lack of commitment to the airline, has sapped the morale of the company to such an extent that next to the period when the first Coalition sold the trans-Atlantic fleet and delayed the development of the company by nearly 15 years, this period is the next damaging.  The sooner the Minister and the Government go, the sooner this company can reach their full development potential.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The recent declared intention by the Government and by some of the Coalition Ministers that they were going to sell off the profit making semi-State bodies came as a great shock to the country at large.  In effect it is nothing more nor less than a statement which is tantamount to declaring Ireland a bankrupt nation and saying they want to get involved in the formal selling off of our national assets.  We know there is a Government greed for money at this time.  We know they have an insatiable appetite for money to shore up the empty coffers of the Exchequer.  They are not satisfied to wreck the economy, they want to sell off any of the profit making ventures and projects that we in Fianna Fáil set up with loving care over the past 60 years.  They set the all time record so far as unemployment and exporting people and money are concerned.  They hold the all time record for borrowing and for the national debt.  Now they want to add to their list of records the fact that they are the greatest liquidators and receivers of Ireland Incorporated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are not satisfied that they should be given that chance.  This evening we see a further example of the ideological differences that exist in the Coalition at this time &mdash; from the right wing arch-monetarists of Fine Gael to the pseudo-socialists on the left.  They are bleating at each other hoping they will be able to create some confusion in the minds of the public as to which side they are on, for or against <Col N="3400" /> the industries and the semi-State bodies which have served this country well in the creation of jobs for the past 60 years.</P>
    <P>The need for the semi-State commercial sector has been there for some time.  It was met and developed by successive Fianna Fáil Governments and that need has not changed.  We take the pragmatic view so far as maintaining the strength of the commercial semi-State bodies are concerned and we are not interested in the ideological differences that exist between the two wings of this disgraced Government.  We say that if it is working let it continue and keep creating the development and the job potential that exists, but if it is not working, we must ask what is wrong with the semi-State organisations.  If there is something wrong, it should be put right rather than handing it over for a pittance to individuals who will make fortunes on the backs of the taxpayers whose money was involved from the start.</P>
    <P>The development and potential of our natural resources has been given a lot of lip service over the past number of years. We say there is a great need at this time for that development.  Surely there is no area more worthy of State involvement than our natural resources.  What have we seen by way of experience of this Coalition Government?  They mandatorily made people on our bogs and peat lands redundant.  They tried to contemplate the selling off of the State forests, despite the fact that it was taxpayers' money which was put at risk initially to develop these forests.  They would now hand them over to some private concern to make profits from the money which was expended on our behalf so many years ago.</P>
    <P>What have they done to the fishing industry?  They sold it off by badly neglecting our strategy for negotiating at EC level and they never created a situation where we would get sufficient people on shore in the processing industry as against those on the high seas.  That is why Fianna Fáil have laid down as part of their fundamental policy for return to Government that we will deal with these <Col N="3401" /> matters and create new initiatives in all areas of State endeavour.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt but we must look at what they have done in the area in which I am very concerned, that is, the tourism industry.  All the strengths of that industry are God given &mdash; our people, our climate, our scenery and our infrastructure. All the weaknesses are man made.  We have to change some of those weaknesses to get back the full potential of that industry to the Irish people.  This Government have consistently denied to the marketing and promoting agencies of Bord Fáilte the means and the resources necessary to enable them to carry out their functions properly.</P>
    <P>The total spent on industry in this country is £2,000 per job; the total spent on agriculture is £2,150 per job but the total spent on tourism is just £850 per job created.  Out of the £1,000 million spent on those three areas of activity, the tourism share is a mere 3 per cent. That is the commitment the Coalition had to the tourism industry during their term of office.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The tourism industry is labour intensive and has great potential for job creation.  The Government bleat that at us every time they come in here but still they refuse to give the necessary finance to Bord Fáilte to enable them to generate jobs.  Tourism is an integral part of the services sector and given the monetary encouragement necessary it can fulfil its job creation potential.  It must be remembered that the total spent on tourism impacts on every other sector of the economy &mdash; from the local suppliers and small businesses to the big companies. These people have all felt the pinch this year with tourist numbers down.  Let there be no doubt about it.  It was not Chernobyl or the lack of interest from the Americans travelling to Europe that crucified tourist numbers this year, but the lack of commitment and the lack <Col N="3402" /> of promotional and marketing money being provided by this Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>A mere £30 million is being voted to Bord Fáilte this year to cater for a £1 billion industry which provides 80,000 jobs and creates £386 million in taxes for the Exchequer this year.  Since this Government took office Ireland's share of the international tourism industry has been falling off.  They failed to maintain the competitiveness of the industry.  They failed to maintain the profitability margin of the industry.  They also failed to maintain the standards necessary to attract more people to avail themselves of our tourism product.  We lay the blame firmly where it should be &mdash; at the door of the Coalition Government.</P>
      <P>There is no point talking about what they might or might not do to support the semi-State sector and our natural resources.  Here is a means readily available which can generate much needed employment but still they are reluctant debutantes when it comes to the Cinderella of the industries, namely, the tourism industry.  What was necessary was a marketing response because every pound spent on marketing in tourism generates £15 worth of spending.  Out of that £15, it is estimated that £7.50 comes back directly to the Exchequer by way of taxes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The appeal of Bord Fáilte has to be broadened and we want to see more money being given to the marketing and promotional side of Bord Fáilte to enable them to sell Ireland to the high income non-ethnic sectors in the United States and in the United Kingdom.  This has been the major failure of this Government in their dealings with the tourism product.  We want cost effectiveness of the promotional expenditure of Bord Fáilte, but we are not satisfied that Bord Fáilte are being allowed to develop their full potential in attracting tourists because they have been denied the financial muscle which is absolutely necessary to generate that growth for the Irish people.  That is why this Coalition Government stand condemned as the great <Col N="3403" /> liquidators of Ireland International and Ireland Incorporated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;development&rdquo; and to substitute:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;and recommends that a radical programme of review and co-ordination takes place, with a strong emphasis on:</P>
      <P>(i)  clarifying the remit, role and function of semi-State agencies, where appropriate;</P>
      <P>(ii)  restating clear economic and social goals and targets where necessary;</P>
      <P>(iii)  introducing an adequate and comprehensive system of rewards of standards of excellence and achievement;</P>
      <P>(iv)  eliminating waste and duplication where they exist;</P>
      <P>(v)  introducing modern management systems and controls where necessary; and</P>
      <P>(vi)  encouraging greater public participation and joint venture programmes, as appropriate, in the development of State assets and resources.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I believe our amendment provides a much sharper focus than The Workers' Party's extremely bland amendment or the Government's equally bland counter amendment.  It gives us an opportunity to assert firmly and clearly the potential of an efficient and an effective semi-State sector as a major instrument of economic development and employment potential. It is also right that we should point to the need for urgent rethinking of the direction and management of this sector if its maximum potential is to be realised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Bland generalisations about the centrality of the semi-State sector in our way of life are no substitute for determined and clear-sighted action to bring about the changes that are necessary.  Many of <Col N="3404" /> those changes arise from the absolute lack of any co-ordination of all the elements and agencies within the sector which continues to grow, in pursuit of clearly stated economic and social goals. That co-ordination is essential not just in terms of working towards those clear targets, but also in terms of the most efficient use of a budget which runs into many hundreds of millions of pounds.</P>
    <P>The definition of semi-State activity is a grey one.  There is no clear definition of its parameters because there are many agencies and bodies in receipt of annual public funding which could legitimately be argued to fall within the ambit of semi-State activity and which at present are in no way co-ordinated or accountable.  It is fair however, to say that there are well in excess of 100,000 people within the semi-State sector, including the local authorities and health boards: that there is one person for every full time farmer employed in that sector or one semi-State employee for every two people involved in manufacturing, presiding over a very wide and diverse range of economic activity.  The scale of the opportunity and the problem is vast.</P>
    <P>All of our efforts should be to underscore that vital role, the extraordinary potential and the essential nature of much semi-State activity.  Our efforts should be to encourage the highest standards of excellence in the direction of achieving clear targets.  If those directions or those targets are not clear, we submit they are not sufficiently clear, the responsibility lies with successive Governments who have pretended that there is no problem &mdash; the Government amendment suggests that tonight &mdash; or that reports such as that of the National Planning Board, which produced a very constructive and highly regarded document on this area, can be ignored.  Therefore, our approach must be positive towards the people in the semi-State sector, encouraging of their efforts, rewarding when those efforts pay dividends, and full credit given at every opportunity for work well done.</P>
    <P>This can only be done by introducing an adequate and comprehensive system of rewards and incentives for standards <Col N="3405" /> of excellence and achievement.  The regimented codes and traditional Civil Service attitudes to promotion depress initiative and in no way necessarily reward high standards.  Maximum flexibility for semi-State bodies, giving them the right to incorporate the most modern reward systems within their operations, is essential if we are to make progress in this respect, and such incentives must include cash payments where appropriate.</P>
    <P>Perhaps, more fundamentally, the environment within which the semi-State agencies operate has to be reviewed, so that the remit, role and function of each such body is clarified and their economic and social goals clearly restated.  This could mean that some agencies and bodies might very well be amalgamated, still others might have to be created, and there may well be a case, arising from such a review, for some such bodies to go out of existence.  This sector, as a fundamental element in our economic life, has to evolve and change to meet modern needs.  It cannot be immune from the kind of demands which face other areas of economic life in this country at present.  In general terms this has not occurred apart from the creation of one or two new agencies, the merits of which in some cases are dubious to put it mildly.</P>
    <P>There is also an obvious need to eliminate waste and duplication where they exist, and they do exist but not everywhere. It is obvious that there are cases where there is overlapping and lack of clarity in terms of jurisdiction.  These have given rise to unnecessary duplication and this has to be dealt with.  It can only be dealt with, of course, where modern management systems and controls are introduced and the semi-State bodies do not have sufficient autonomy in this respect.  Far too often, their actions and activities have to be overseen by a Government Department's bureaucracy who insist on a plethora of written reportage and clearances from Ministers before allowing the semi-State agencies and bodies to take the slightest initiative. This, in itself, is an absolute waste of money and tends to massively depress the <Col N="3406" /> sense of initiative within the semi-State sector.</P>
    <P>One way of introducing a new dynamic into this sector would be to encourage greater public participation and joint venture programmes involving the semi-State sector and members of the public in the sensitive and gradual development of State assets and resources, where this might be appropriate.  Such an initiative could take place on the basis that one was talking about retaining majority rights within State hands, but take place it should.  It is fundamentally wrong and economically shortsighted to encourage people to save money by means of pension funds in order to provide for their own futures through their personal savings, while not allowing for such people to realistically invest those hard won earnings in the widest possible share market.  By absolute exclusion of the semi-State sector from such investment opportunities, which can quite reasonably involve very small savers, individual pensioners, and others with a little to invest, we are discouraging people from saving for their own futures, encouraging yet further reliance on the State and not allowing people to become involved.</P>
    <P>There is a great deal that is extremely good about the semi-State sector.  This kind of vacuous debate which does not focus on the sharp reality of the need for change, progress and evolution does not do the semi-State sector or the public a service.  We formally seek to have our amendment put before the House.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>After &ldquo;contrary.&rdquo; in the last line to add the following:</P>
      <P>Dáil Éireann further deplores the failure of successive Governments to recognise the potential of the State sector for job creation, industrial development and economic growth, and calls for the expansion of the State sector into productive profit making areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to thank the Fianna Fáil Chief Whip for allocating five minutes to me <Col N="3407" /> and for giving me the opportunity to move the amendment in my name and Deputy Mac Giolla's name.  We deplore the failure of successive Governments to recognise the potential of the State sector for job creation, industrial development and economic growth and call for the expansion of the State sector into productive profit-making areas.  It is significant that in October last the Irish Congress of Trade Unions launched a document entitled &ldquo;Public Enterprise &mdash; Everybody's Business&rdquo;.  In launching that document the president of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions said:</P>
    <P>Public sector workers and their unions will also work for change and to make public enterprises &ldquo;centres of excellence&rdquo;.  Workers are not afraid of change when that change is for the better.  We believe in public enterprise that is efficient, dynamic and growing &mdash; public enterprise that creates new jobs and makes existing jobs secure &mdash; public enterprise that will benefit its workers, its consumers and its owners, the people.</P>
    <P>That is a very clear statement of where the unions of this country stand in relation to the public sector.  It is strongly in favour of its development and not its reduction and its scuttling as happened recently under the Government in relation to Irish Shipping.  That had atrocious effects on the living standards of thousands of men and women who are dependent on jobs in Irish Shipping.</P>
    <P>There have been a number of examples in recent times of the tendency of the Government to decide that the way to get out of the financial problems is to sell off parts of the State sector.  The most recent one I can recall is the proposal that the State forests should be sold off. There are always attempts to sell off bits and pieces of one company or another. There are proposals afoot at the moment to marry NET with Imperial Chemical Industries Limited.  One wonders if that will have the same effect on NET as the marriage between Heinz International and Erin Foods Limited which destroyed <Col N="3408" /> the Erin Foods company.  The Minister for Labour who declared tonight that his Government are totally in favour of the public sector and of the development of the public sector was trying to con this House and the people outside the House. We only have to recall the manner in which the Government treated the ESB, a company who get no State funding whatsoever, who never got any State funding or equity capital and who have to borrow in order to operate.  At the same time, they are used by the Government to collect taxes.  The Government impose levies on them, they decide what will be their fuel costs and a couple of years ago doubled the costs of natural gas to the ESB.  While the Government decided to allow the ESB to sell coal which they import, a Labour Deputy in the House today decried the fact that the ESB will be allowed compete openly with private enterprise in the sale of coal.</P>
    <P>The whole question of private enterprise is dogged by a fairly general commitment in this House to private enterprise.  It has been said by a number of speakers on both sides of the House that they have no ideological hang-ups but when it comes to a choice between private and public enterprise it is my experience that private enterprise always wins out.  It should be remembered that the IDA, Fóir Teoranta, the various employment subsidies, subsidies to farmers, to the ICI, the ACC and so on all operate in the interests of private enterprise and that it takes in the region of £1.5 billion per year to support private enterprise.  It is private enterprise that has failed in this State, not public enterprise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The first question I should like to answer is one raised by two Government Ministers as to where Fianna Fáil stand in regard to State and semi-State enterprises.  I should like to remind the House, if it is necessary to do so, that the concept of semi-State enterprise was the brainchild of the late Seán Lemass and we continue to walk in his footsteps in promoting and developing semi-State and State enterprises.  That is <Col N="3409" /> not to say, as the Minister for Finance tried to suggest last night, that any time we are in Government we just throw money at various companies to try to solve their problems.  That has not been our record in Government and the Minister, Deputy Bruton, more than anybody else, should know that.  Indeed, some of the suggestions he made last night amazed me.</P>
      <P>I listened to the Minister time and again espouse right-wing capitalism.  I am a capitalist myself but I would not reckon I am anything like as right-wing as the Minister and last night he made a speech on converted socialism the like of which I have not heard made by any Member on this side of the House.  For ten minutes last night he lauded and lauded the National Development Corporation. That was unusual for a Minister who has spent the past four years in Government trying to stultify it, prune it down and make sure it would never see the light of day but last night he praised it to the sky. There is no depth to which any Minister is prepared to stoop to hang on to power. I am glad to be able to tell the Government that the dying days are numbered. In fact, as an observer of the scene around the House, I can say that <i>rigor mortis</i> has set in and the funeral will take place about the third week in January.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last night the Minister for Finance lauded the National Development Corporation as the great engine of growth but I wonder if the House will believe the Minister has not appointed a chief executive to the corporation?  Will he explain that to the people?  In the course of his speech the Minister told us about the Government throwing money at various semi-State bodies and said he was proud of the great performance of those bodies.  I should like to remind him that in 1982, after his ill-fated budget had led to the collapse of the Coalition Government, I took over as Minister for Industry and Energy.  I found in the Estimates prepared by the Minister, Deputy Bruton, £35 million of equity capital for NET.  NET never got one shilling of that £35 million in 1982 but the board and chief executive of NET were called in by <Col N="3410" /> me to be told that there was no more money available and that a better management job would have to be done.  I asked them to set out their corporate strategy for the next few years and get their house in order.  That was a decision by the supposedly spendthrift Fianna Fáil Government.  I must commend NET, the board of directors and the chief executive who has since gone to sort out the problems of CIE, on the magificent turnaround in the fortunes of that concern. Had I followed the example of Deputy Bruton and thrown £35 million at that concern I have no doubt that they would be losing money yet.  At that time they were losing £35 million annually but they have made a profit in two successive years since.  However, because of the exchange rate policies they had a loss last year. The Minister tried to claim credit for the success of NET.</P>
    <P>The Minister told us that Aer Lingus had a profit of £19 million.  I should like to compliment the company on achieving that profit but it is a sad indictment of the Government who have been running the country for four years that a large contribution of that £19 million has come from the thousands of emigrants who have had to take flights to America. Heretofore the aircraft were empty going to the US and full on the return journey but that has changed.  I was proud of the members I appointed to the board of Aer Lingus.  At the time I appointed them the company were losing £17 million and if the philosophy of the last Coalition had been adhered to the hotel chains would have been sold off along with the other successful subsidiaries of the company. The attitude of the last Coalition was to sell off subsidiaries and get rid of the problems.  The new board, under a chairman who had experience as a general manager of the company, turned around the fortunes of the company.  I am glad to say that the company are strong in profit and I hope that in the next 50 years they will have continued success.</P>
    <P>We cannot forget that it was a Coalition Government who sold off the Constellations and that it was the late Deputy James Dillon who said that the rabbits <Col N="3411" /> would be running around Rineanna using it as a playground.  It was the view of the Government that Knock Airport would not succeed but I am glad to be able to salute the take-off by Ryanair from Knock Airport yesterday on its first scheduled flight.  We do not have any ideological hang-ups about semi-State and private enterprise.  We do not amble down a particular road but we have a simple and commonsense view of how to use our money and the companies we should support.  Bord na Móna, languishing after two years of bad weather, are hanging on and will be out of money by April or May.  What are the Government doing to help them?  The Government have offered them a soft loan but that is no good to Bord na Móna.  They need a conversion of the existing loans to allow them get rid of the expensive loans the Government forced upon them from the European Investment Bank at rates of between 17 per cent and 18 per cent.  That is an indication of Coalition management of the semi-State sector.</P>
    <P>If the Government were serious about Bord na Móna they would convert the Government loans into equity and permit the company to get on with the business of running the company.  We do not subscribe to the selling off of our forests to Johnny-come-lately speculators who will make a fortune out of them after progressive Fianna Fáil Governments down the years established that national asset. I should like to make it clear that between now and our return to Government we will be discussing with the various interests the future of our forests.  In our view Bord na Móna are the best semi-State body to take over forestry.  The development of our bogs and our forests should be carried out by the one company. That is the type of development corporation we will make out of Bord na Móna when we are returned to power in the not too distant future.</P>
    <P>The Minister has told us that Aer Rianta turned around a profit of £5 million.  I recall appointing the board of Aer Rianta to take over a business that <Col N="3412" /> was experiencing severe losses.  The company have turned in profits of up to £12 million but that is no credit to the Government.  Yet, they have the audacity to say that they are going to look at the system of appointing new boards of directors to the semi-State system having gone round each body since they took office and stuffed their own political hacks into them.  In the last four years they filled every vacancy in sight with their own political hacks.  How can they say that now they are going to set up a panel of competent people to choose the members of those boards?  It amazes me the price every Minister is prepared to pay to hang on to power.</P>
    <P>Is it any wonder that the citizens of Dublin in a recent opinion poll displayed a rate of dissatisfaction of 9:1 with the Government.  If they do not go quickly it will be 10:1 because they do not have anything left to give.  The Government are living on borrowed time and using borrowed money.  I am contributing in the last Private Members' debate of this Dáil and I expect a general election in February.  I am confident that Fianna Fáil will sweep the Government out of office and that the parties opposite will not be heard of until the end of the century. They promised everything but did not deliver anything.  Their cure was worse than the disease.  They said they would bring down borrowing but they sent it through the roof.  They said they would halt the trend of unemployment but they did not do that.  However, they looked after their own.</P>

      <P>My amendment reads:</P>
      <P>In page 2, between lines 12 and 13, to insert the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;1. &mdash;Notwithstanding any provision of this Act or of the Act of 1965 no person shall be ordered to be extradited for the purpose of proceeding against him for an offence pursuant to the provisions of Part II of the Act of 1965, nor shall any person be committed pursuant to a warrant endorsed pursuant to the provisions of Part III of the Act of 1965, unless statements of proposed evidence of witnesses, authenticated in a manner prescribed by regulations to be made by the Minister pursuant to the provisions of the Act <Col N="3417" /> of 1965, shall have been produced to the District Court and unless the District Court, on production of such statements, is satisfied that such statements of proposed evidence would suffice to return that person for trial, if the person were being prosecuted for a similar or corresponding offence, in respect of an act committed within the State.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This is not the same as the amendments which were defeated earlier today on Committee Stage but it has in part at least the same general purpose of seeking to achieve the introduction of a <i>prima facie</i> requirement in so far as the extradition of people from this country is concerned. Largely the same arguments that were made already in respect of this matter can be adduced again, and they have to be adduced because no real response has been made to them.  In substance what the Minister said in reply did not deal with the merits or demerits of the amendments as such but he looked at them from a broader point of view and said that if amendments of this kind were accepted &mdash; I am sorry, Sir, is amendment No. 1 disallowed?</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 2, between lines 12 and 13, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;1.&mdash;The following section is hereby substituted for section 4 of the Act of 1965:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&lsquo;4. &mdash;Every order made by the Government under this Act after the commencement of this section shall be laid before Dáil Éireann and shall not have effect until Dáil Éireann has approved the terms of such <Col N="3418" /> Order by resolution in that behalf.&rsquo;.&rdquo;,</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 2 is a different matter altogether.  I am sorry, I thought at first that you called amendment No. 1.  Unfortunately, amendment No. 1 is disallowed apparently and that is by far the more important one if I could have moved it, but I will have to go on to amendment No. 2.  That is regrettable in a way because I would prefer to have moved amendment No. 1.  Amendment No. 2 is a much simpler matter, a matter which I hope the Minister is prepared to accept.  It is important that the Minister would show some willingness to have some flexibility in regard to these matters and our efforts to try to introduce safeguards into them. The effect of amendment No. 2 is simply to change section 4 of the 1965 Act which deals with the making of orders by the Government.  In practice it means the ratification of extradition agreements. This amendment in my name and in the name of Deputy Harney will have the effect of requiring that each such extradition agreement with whatever country it is made, would have to be laid before the House and would not have effect until the Dáil had approved the terms of such an extradition agreement.  It is called an order in the amendment because that is what it is called the 1965 Act, which this seeks to amend.</P>
    <P>Extradition is a matter which causes and has caused considerable concern, particularly in recent years, to many of our citizens, not just to those who are directly affected, but to ordinary citizens who are concerned for the preservation of civil liberties.  It causes concern to Members of this House, as is evidenced by the length and intensity of debates on this Bill over the last number of days, the closeness of the votes, and the continual tied votes that have been taking place in the House today.  It is quite evident that it is necessary and appropriate that all extradition agreements that this State enters into with foreign states should be laid before this House and should need the approval of the House.  That is the <Col N="3419" /> practice in the US where every such agreement is regarded as a foreign treaty and requires the approval of the US Senate, which is the House within the US Congress which has particular powers in relation to foreign relations.  If the Amercans feel that it is necessary that every such treaty or agreement should be subject to the approval of their Senate, which is the more important of the two Houses for the purpose of foreign relations at least, it is quite appropriate that similar agreements made by our Government should have the approval of this House. The Constitution provides, in Article 29, that all such agreements with foreign countries be laid before the Dáil, but it only requires, constitutionally, that agreements which involve a charge on the people or expenditure of money by the State require the express approval of the Dáil.</P>
    <P>We had the instance three weeks ago in this House that the 1983 extradition agreement which this country entered into with the US, had to come here as a result of the Supreme Court having held that it was invalid because it had not been passed by this House.  The reason was that it involved the expenditure of public money and therefore under the Constitution required the approval of the House to make it valid as a binding foreign agreement.  That is probably likely to happen with all future extradition agreements that the State enters into, but is is not necessarily going to happen. There may be instances where it does not.  For example, if the Government of the day for some reason chose to leave out that clause that entailed expenditure it would not be constitutionally necessary for it to come to this House.  Therefore it should be made legally necessary whether or not there is a clause in the extradition agreement.</P>
    <P>As a result of this debate on this Bill, and as a result of the many contested, disputed and botched extraditions that have taken place from this country in the last several years, extradition agreements from now on will be matters of considerable public interest and should be <Col N="3420" /> subject to the scrutiny and approval of this House before becoming binding on the State.  It is a reasonable requirement. It does not infringe any of our international obligations or run counter to any of our practices.  It is perfectly feasible for the Minister to accept this and he cannot even attempt to make any of the arguments he made on the substantive amendments on Committee Stage regarding the <i>prima facie</i> requirement. The Minister cannot conceiveably allege that this will be damaging to the Anglo-Irish Agreement or that to go ahead with this would in some way put the Anglo-Irish Agreement in some jeopardy or doubt.  These were the ridiculous statements the Minister made with regard to the amendments we moved on Committee Stage.  None of these sorts of arguments can conceiveably be made.  It will not cause any inconveniences to anybody. It will probably happen in the majority of cases anyway, but obviously if the Government have the opportunity of not having to bring such an extradition agreement before the House they will not.</P>
    <P>The agreement signed in July 1983 was not brought before this House until the Supreme Court declared it invalid because that had not been done.  The 1983 agreement would not have been brought here but for the fact that the Supreme Court decided as it did.  It is interesting that the Australian agreement does not seem to have come before this House and the circumstances in which that agreement was made were so dubious that it would indeed have been appropriate that it should have been brought before this House, because the authorities here, presumably under the direction of the Minister for Justice of the day and his Department, directed that a man be arrested under section 30 of the Offences Against the State Act, 1939 and be detained for 48 hours while an agreement was cobbled together between Australia and Ireland for the purpose of arresting him under that extradition agreement on the expiration of the 48 hours.  That blatant misuse of the powers in the Offences Against the State Act, 1939 was never <Col N="3421" /> contemplated.  Because of the dubious circumstances of the birth of that agreement it is appropriate that it should be subject to the scrutiny of this House.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will accept this amendment.  It is straightforward, it stands on its own, it does not affect anything else or run counter to our international obligations and, above all, they will not be displeased in London if the Minister accepts it, because it is a matter that is immaterial to London and therefore the Minister is free to accept it.  The Minister might now make an effort to accommodate in some way the reasonable views expressed on all sides of the House except in the case of some of the Government backbenchers who cannot express them publicly, but they are certainly expressing them freely in private.</P>
    <P>It is appropriate that the Minister should accept this amendment after three or four tied votes today on major substantive amendments to this Bill and because a clear majority of Members of this House do not want this Bill without the safeguards we have sought to import into it.  I gave warning before in respect of the Fifth Stage of this Bill which will be taken tonight before 11 p.m., that if the reasonable views being put forward by the Progressive Democrats and Fianna Fáil, and in private by a large number of Government backbenchers, were not accommodated in some reasonable way, then we would have to consider our position in regard to the Fifth Stage.  We have already voted for this Bill on Second Stage because we approve the principle of it.  We gave the Minister the opportunity to remedy what not just we but many people and commentators thought were serious defects in the Bill.  The Minister has turned his face against every effort to insert reasonable safeguards which nobody reasonably could object to.</P>
    <P>We have to take that into account in making up our minds between now and 11 p.m. as to what to do on Fifth Stage. If this Bill is to receive a Fifth and Final Reading on the casting vote of the Ceann Comhairle yet again today it is a Bill which is perhaps without parallel in the <Col N="3422" /> history of this Oireachtas for the doubtful democratic nature of its passage.  It could never have been envisaged that a normal Government in normal circumstances would attempt to push through a Bill by having to rely on the Ceann Comhairle five or six times in the one day during the course of its passage.</P>
    <P>The Minister has an opportunity, even though this is only a relatively minor matter by comparision with these other matters, to remedy the ridiculously inflexible attitude he has taken.  He has some opportunity to encourage the Progressive Democrat Deputies as well as other Deputies who at present are forced into the position, against our own instincts in many respects, of voting against this Bill.  It is a matter of some concern to me that I find myself being put in that position but I am being put in it by the foolish inflexibility of the Minister.  This is a relatively minor matter and there is no reason it cannot be accepted.  It is par for the course in other countries where it is perfectly normal and it should be normal here.  It will happen in most cases but not in all.  I simply want to have the legal requirement that it will happen in all.</P>
    <P>It will be the desire of all Members of this House in the future to scrutinise each extradition agreement.  It is well they might do so because these agreements, particularly those which are likely to be made with Britain and Northern Ireland over the next number of years, will require careful scrutiny.  It should be the legal right of this House to do that and it should be put in such a way that until such time as this House approves of it it does not become law domestically and does not become binding on this State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support this amendment probably for different reasons from those put forward by Deputy O'Malley.  I would not agree with all his arguments but it has been very disappointing that the Minister has not acceded in any way to the very reasonable demands made on him.  It did seem last weekend that the Minister &mdash; perhaps we should not blame him personally &mdash;<Col N="3423" /> was about to make some alteration on Committee Stage which would have gone some way towards meeting the fears expressed on Second Stage.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach came out very strongly at the weekend to bone up the Minister and make sure he would not make any changes.  He made the outrageous allegation that Deputies knowingly and deliberately put down amendments with regard to <i>prima facie</i> evidence in order to prevent the European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism from being ratified.  The Taoiseach was being deliberately and knowingly insulting to Deputies by making that allegation but his intervention was to ensure that the Minister would not make any concessions to Deputies on Committee Stage.  He has succeeded because the Minister has stonewalled on every issue.</P>
      <P>The main purpose of the Bill and of the Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism is to remove certain criminal and terrorist acts from the cover of being political crimes.  The Workers' Party are in general support of that provision and have constantly asserted our total opposition to terrorism and to the effect which terrorist acts have as attacks on democracy. Basically, they are anti-republican as well as being anti-human.  However, because of the major changes in our extradition procedures we must be more careful than ever in protecting the rights of citizens because our purpose is to protect the innocent and not the guilty from being extradited without reasonable evidence being given.  The Minister has not in any way acceded to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is in accord with amendments we have put down to similar sections in Bills which come at regular intervals before this House, that is, that an order is laid before the House and passed unless an annulling order is put before the House within 21 days.  This procedure is most unsatisfactory because as far as most backbench Deputies are concerned the order would be before the House for some days before they would know about it.  The procedure does not assist us as we discovered on one occasion <Col N="3424" /> when we were unable to get an annulling order through the House.  It is far better procedure to have the positive element that the order is laid before the Dáil and shall not have effect until the Dáil approves its terms.</P>
    <P>The amendment is most reasonable. Its effect would be to restore the power to the Dáil which it should have on every Bill where such orders are referred to with the order not coming into effect until the Dáil has approved it rather than having it go through unless somebody succeeds in obtaining an order disapproving of it.  It is on that basis that I support the amendment.  Again, this is not a major change in the Bill.  The Minister cannot say it is preventing us from ratifying the convention as he said when we proposed the <i>prima facie</i> case.  It should be a normal procedure and it is the best procedure for Deputies.</P>

      <P>I thought you might be, Sir. Section 4 of the 1965 Act provides that every order made by the Government under that Act shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after it is made and that if a resolution annulling the order is passed by either House within the next 21 days on which that House has sat after the order is laid before it, the order shall be annulled accordingly but without prejudice to anything previously done thereunder.  The amendment would provide that every order made by the Government under this Act after the commencement of the section would be laid before Dáil Éireann and would not <Col N="3425" /> have effect until Dáil Éireann had approved the terms of such order by resolution in that behalf.</P>
      <P>I take the view that the procedure set out in the amendment is infinitely preferable in parliamentary terms to the other procedure.  Deputy O'Malley knows as well as I do that the procedure that is followed in section 4 of the 1965 Act at present is one that has a good deal to do with the convenience of business in the Dáil, in that by and large in the normal course of events orders can be laid before the House and made without there being a requirement to have a debate in the House unless an annulling motion is put forward.  While that procedure has its value in areas such as the one we are talking about, the affirmative procedure has its own particular and, in my view, superior value for reasons much like those set out by Deputy O'Malley. For that reason I am very much inclined to accept the amendment.  However, there is one question that it raises and it might be worth while looking at for a minute or two.  The present procedure providing for the annulling order provides that the order shall be annulled if a resolution annulling it is passed by either House within the next 21 days on which it sits.  The proposal in the amendment before us requiring an affirmative order to be made specifies that the order shall not have effect until Dáil Éireann has approved the terms of such order.  On the one hand the negative road provides in relation to either House passing an annulling motion.  The amendment before us specifies Dáil Éireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not sure if it would be appropriate to use the same wording in the affirmative order as in the negative one, unless Deputy O'Malley is particularly attached to the idea that it should be Dáil Éireann which should pass it.  Perhaps he really has in mind the situation where either House would make it.  I believe it is better that the matter be brought before the Oireachtas and positively decided one way or the other.  While I accept the spirit and intent of the amendment, there is a question mark in my mind.  Perhaps <Col N="3426" /> Deputy O'Malley would comment before we finally conclude on this.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3: In page 3, before line 1, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;2.&mdash;Section 50 of the Act of 1965 is amended by the insertion, after subsection (4), of the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&lsquo;(5) A direction under this section may be given by the Minister, if he&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) is not satisfied that the person concerned will receive a fair trial within a reasonable period,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b) is not satisfied, that the general standards which prevail in the administration of justice in the <Col N="3430" /> place to which the person is to be removed are satisfactory and acceptable, or</P>
    <P>(c) has reasonable grounds for believing that the person concerned may be subjected to methods of interrogation which, if operated within the State would be unlawful or which are in breach of Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights.&rsquo;.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment deals with the question of a fair trial and the general standards of administrative justice which prevail in the places to which an individual is to be sent.  The amendment which has been accepted by the Minister now says that a draft order proposed to be made by the Government under this Act shall come before both Houses of the Oireachtas and this is something which we said was very desirable in relation to the American order.  We support that amendment. However, it does not affect the obligations which are entered into by the Government under the Bill which we are discussing now.</P>
    <P>If the Government are committed, without safeguards, to the measures which are included in this Bill, then the Government will have to honour their obligations.  The Government of the day will be required to honour those obligations by way of the appropriate order. One will still be faced with the situation where one has either to agree or not under the terms which are already agreed in this Bill which we are considering now. While this is an amendment which we would welcome generally and it gives an opportunity to propose to the Minister of the day the kinds of reservations or declarations which might be made in relation to any order which he is planning to proceed with, nevertheless if these reservations and declarations are not included, either at the signing or at the ratification of any such agreement, then they cannot be included subsequently unless one is to denunciate, or find some other similar means.</P>
    <P>We have had a good deal of discussion here today and yesterday on this very <Col N="3431" /> important Bill.  I should like to point out that we live in a constitutional democracy. The Government are bound to vindicate the rights of citizens.  They are bound to protect and vindicate and look after those rights.  In this convention on terrorism the Government have refused to include any of the safeguards which we have suggested.  The main question which we must ask oursleves is how this Bill protects and vindicates the rights of Irish citizens.</P>
    <P>We supported Second Stage because we are in favour of playing our part with our international partners in tackling the problem of international terrorism, but we are not in favour of giving <i>carte blanche</i> to the Minister, or to the crown prosecutor in Britain, or to the DPP in Northern Ireland, or to any foreign prosecuting authority.  No self-respecting sovereign country would do less than insist that there be safeguards included in these measures, nor have they done any less.  All our partners have insisted on one kind of safeguard or another.  We have gone through those fairly exhaustively. We talked about the United States, the United Kingdom, Israel, Denmark and Norway, who all require <i>prima facie</i> cases to be established before they will agree to an extradition.  We also have Germany, France, Belgium, Austria and The Netherlands who will not extradite their own nationals at all.  Then we have various other safeguards which we dealt with fairly exhaustively during the course of this debate.  The Government here have proceeded with far too much haste, which indicates a certain amount of irresponsibility on their part. For instance, on Committee Stage we did not get past the first section.  We have now had to go back to Committee Stage as an emergency measure to try to fit in a very reasonable amendment.  We did not even discuss section 2 and, clearly, none of the other sections was discussed.</P>
    <P>A measure of this kind requires a great deal of consideration and study and a good Committee Stage.  There is a danger that laws made in haste will almost inevitably be endured bitterly for many years <Col N="3432" /> to come.  This Bill will certainly generate conflict and a certain amount of misery. The courts will be bound by the measures in the Bill.  We, very reasonably, proposed on Committee Stage that either the court or the Minister could give a direction under section 50 of the 1965 Act if the court or the Minister were not satisfied that the person concerned would receive a fair trial within a reasonable period and if they were not satisfied in several other respects.  This was not accepted and indeed Deputy O'Malley felt that to have the courts involved would create too many difficulties.  We are now proposing an amendment which will allow the Minister to make such a direction if he is not satisfied that the person concerned will receive a fair trial within a reasonable period, if he is not satisfied that the general standards which prevail in the administration of justice in the place to which the person is to be removed are satisfactory and acceptable or if he has reasonable grounds for believing that the person concerned may be subjected to methods of interrogation which, if operated within the State, would be unlawful or in breach of Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights.  We regard this as a particularly important protection.</P>
    <P>We have a major objection to the Bill in that it proposes to extradite in circumstances where people would not even be sent for trial in this country.  It proposes to remove from the Irish courts any effective decision-making in a whole expanded series of offences which previously would have been regarded as political. This is a downgrading of the function of our courts, to which we object.  If somebody is to oversee extraditions, then rather than the British crown prosecutor, the DPP in Northern Ireland or any foreign prosecuting authority, the courts should protect and vindicate the rights of Irish citizens in this regard.</P>
    <P>In deference to the views expressed here earlier, we are putting forward in this amendment a proposal restricting the provision to the Minister if he feels that a direction under this section should be <Col N="3433" /> given.  It is not as comprehensive as we would have desired but it still gives control to the Minister.  Indeed, I pointed out in looking at the British Bill which is still being discussed, that they reserve to the Secretary of State the final decision and the power to give direction.  We are all very aware of the problems involved and I spelt them out at some length earlier on, our concern about the methods of interrogation in the Six Counties, the infamous Diplock courts which have been discredited and which are still upheld by the British authorities, even as recently as yesterday.  They have expressed their satisfaction with the Diplock courts and they do not envisage changing the system in the foreseeable future.</P>
    <P>The Minister also indicated that he is concerned about these areas and he, therefore, set the date for the implementation of the Bill back to 1 June and then, for some reason, put it back to 1 December, presumably in the hope that there will be some progress in relation to the methods of trial, questioning, interrogation, the holding of people in custody in Northern Ireland and the basis on which they are held.  Learned, objective academics studied the problem as recently as 1980-81 and they found that one of the principal purposes of arresting people and taking them into custody is for interrogation and to get information about third parties.  That is still a problem, the Minister seems to think it has gone and I would be very happy if he could substantiate that view.  The Diplock courts are still in existence even though they have been discredited. Almost as if to thumb his nose at the Minister, Mr. King said yesterday that they will continue in the foreseeable future.  Why did he say it yesterday?  I know there was a debate in the House of Commons but he did not show much sensitivity in relation to a Minister who was struggling to meet commitments which the Taoiseach had given within the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  Obviously, he was not concerned about getting headlines in our newspapers and the British press which were embarrassing for our Minister.  It will be quite some time <Col N="3434" /> before the system of justice in Northern Ireland reaches an acceptable standard. The measure we proposed could be used as a means of ensuring that if the Minister is not satisfied a person will receive a fair trial within a reasonable period, if he is not satisfied with the general standards of the administration of justice and if he has reasonable grounds for believing that the person may be subjected to methods of interrogation which are not acceptable from our point of view, he can issue the appropriate direction.  This is exactly what the Minister has in mind.  This is what concerns him and we are giving him an opportunity because we trust our own Minister in that respect&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very concerned about the effects this Bill will have on the Irish people if it is enacted.  Even at this late stage an amendment such as this will give some protection to our people should it be accepted.  It is unfortunate that when we speak of extradition our attention is almost totally absorbed by the situation between Ireland and Britain.  Yet the only major argument in favour of the Bill is the implementation of the measures claimed to be consistent with recent European moves to combat terrorism.  The scale of terrorism throughout Europe and the suspected links between terrorist organisations in different European countries is a major problem for all.  It also involves the liberty and freedom of movement of all EC nationals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must look very carefully at the safeguards which should have been built into this Bill, as suggested by many Members of this House, but even at this late stage some safeguards can be built into this Bill if this amendment is accepted.  Other European countries &mdash; Germany, France, The Netherlands and so on &mdash; do not extradite their citizens as we propose to do if this Bill is enacted. This is a serious problem in Germany <Col N="3436" /> where they have to deal with refugees from East Germany but their legislation provides very reasonable safeguards.</P>
    <P>This Bill will affect many people in this country, not alone in the Border counties but in Dublin as well.  Many people have had to get out of the Six Counties and have tried to make a new life for themselves in the Republic.  Over the last 16 or 17 years, unfortunately, the situation in the Six Counties has not improved.  We could find ourselves once more dealing with many people from that part of Ireland seeking refuge here.</P>
    <P>The Anglo-Irish Agreement has been referred to throughout this debate.  It is claimed to have brought about a new approach between the Irish and British Governments in dealing with the political <i>impasse</i> in the Six Counties, but there is no point in fooling ourselves that the position in the North has improved as a result of that agreement.  It has not improved for the ordinary people just because the Irish and British Ministers meet periodically in their friendly &ldquo;get togethers&rdquo;.  Anybody can see that the British Administration in the North is nothing better than a Berlin bunker.  The Ministers heading that Administration in Stormont failed time and time again to deliver any significant support for the agreement from the pro-British element of the population in the North.</P>
    <P>We must try to ensure that some safeguards are built into this Bill for the people who could be extradited to that part of Ireland.  I would be very worried about the treatment of our people who would be extradited there.  We cannot for a minute ignore the different political analyses arrived at over the years, both in Dublin and London, about the deteriorating situation in the Six Counties. We fully appreciate and understand that some misguided young people can get involved with terrorist godfathers because of the terrible experiences they suffer in the North.  No one can condone any illegal actions in which they might participate but we can understand that they can be duped into thinking that the IRA or other terrorist organisations offer them a way of getting back at the regime <Col N="3437" /> which is not, and has not been, prepared to give them a chance.</P>
    <P>It is necessary to look at the attitude of the British generally.  There have been calls time and time again for extradition of our people to Britain.  It is hard to understand the motivation behind this. The British have had little success with their anti-terrorism measures in the North.  Their supporters tend to blame the Irish Republic for a situation which is of their own making.  The British are clinging to the North without making any real effort to resolve the political situation there and the consequence is continuing violence which is affecting all sides of the community there.  The different understanding of the problem by the British is best illustrated by the attitude that if we do not pass this Bill we are in sympathy with the terrorists.  That seems to be the attitude the British want to accept.  From my own experience of cases involving Irish people convicted in British courts, the British assumption is that if you are Irish you are guilty.  We are all aware that in Northern Ireland or in Britain when an Irishman is arrested and he says he is Irish, he is guilty immediately. If an American or any other national is arrested he is not guilty.</P>
    <P>On numerous occasions I visited our citizens in prisons in the UK.  The story is always the same; they are guilty.  In cases where an individual has an Irish background there are a number of years added to the sentence.  If a person is second or third generation Irish and is reared in Britain it makes a vast difference when he is sentenced.  How can we allow our citizens to be extradited, in particular to Britain, to be treated in that fashion? When one is convicted and imprisoned in London or in any other part of Britain that is convenient for their families to visit, immediately they are sent to the Isle of Wight.  I had intended visiting some of my constituents this week who are imprisoned in London but I heard today that they are not there any longer.  It was too easy for their families and for public representatives to visit them so they were <Col N="3438" /> sent to the Isle of Wight without any protest from Dublin.</P>
    <P>The mere fact that extradition is a legal matter should not lead us to ignore that initiating a case is a matter for the police. Even if a suspect is extradited with the condition that it is not for the purpose of interrogation the case against them may rest on evidence gathered by the police in circumstances which Irish courts may not approve.  Numerous cases have been referred to during the course of this debate.  In British courts and in our own courts doubts have been cast on what was introduced as expert evidence, including forensic evidence, as well as on identification procedures and on the statements of witnesses implicating people in crime.</P>
    <P>Our residents are entitled to the full protection of Irish law just as it is the duty of the law enforcement agencies to ensure that Irish laws are upheld, including those relating to offences committed in their own countries.  Down the years we spent many billions of pounds patrolling the Border.  These problems were created by the British blunders in the North.  Are we now saying that our laws during those years were inadequate?  The security forces on this side of the Border have done a good job in trying to ensure that the laws are observed.  One of the biggest problems is as a direct result of the way the British behaved in the Six Counties for too many years.  Whether the position in the North improves or gets worse the implications of this Extradition Bill could be very serious for this country. The security forces have almost universal support in combating terrorist crime.</P>
    <P>We should not further compromise the legal rights of Irish citizens as is contemplated in this Bill.  It is, at the least, unnecessary and, at the worst, may prove to be very embarrassing if any injustice is done to innocent people as a result of by-passing present procedures.  Our courts have the necessary powers to decide questions which may involve the deprivation of liberty to individuals for long periods of time before they go on trial.  That has happened already.  People were handed over to the North and were subsequently acquitted on the original <Col N="3439" /> charge.  That happened in the McGlinchey case.  Serious charges were also pending against him in this State and he had to wait until he was returned to this jurisdiction for trial.</P>
    <P>The Minister has an opportunity at this late stage to accept the amendment as proposed on Report Stage by Deputy Woods.  The Minister has been inflexible in his attitude throughout this Bill.  Apart from the principle of the Bill, one could not accept that our citizens can be literally dumped over the Border simply for interrogation.  That is something we cannot accept.  I ask the Minister to take this discretion upon himself, and upon future Ministers, to ensure that he is satisfied that the person concerned will get a fair trial within a reasonable period.  I ask the Minister to give this every consideration and to include it in this section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought the Minister was going to say something that would have obviated my saying anything.  The idea of the Minister for Justice having this chore to do might appeal to him.  He has been behaving in a draft manner at the direction of his Government led by a daft Taoiseach who produced to this House daft but dangerous legislation.  It has been improved somewhat by the reasonableness of the Minister in accepting, after all the talk in the last few days, the amendment as reworded by Deputy O'Malley.  In Deputy Woods's amendment, and with his agreement, instead of saying if the Minister &ldquo;is not satisfied&rdquo; I would be more in favour of saying &ldquo;unless he is of the opinion&rdquo;.  That might make it less difficult for the Minister to accept the various elements of this amendment which are absolutely essential to try to mitigate the great dangers that are inherent in the whole measure.  This would go a lot of the way towards giving some assurance &mdash; whether by the present Minister acting in a non-daft manner as he is quite capable of doing most of the time or whoever &mdash; to many of our people who might have fears at the moment that those fears could be allayed.  If the Minister is of the opinion <Col N="3440" /> or is not satisfied that a fair trial will not be forthcoming within a reasonable period; if he is of the opinion or is not satisfied that the general standards are acceptable or if he is of the opinion or has reasonable grounds for believing that the person concerned may be subjected to unacceptable methods of interrogation, he could give a direction on the matter.  What is of most concern to us is the interrogation and the atmosphere &mdash; as was rightly stated by my colleague, Deputy Gallagher, and by all of us &mdash; in the Six Counties where there is a lack of any proper, acceptable or satisfactory dispensing of justice, particularly when the non-Loyalist element of the population may fall foul of the law and if they are extradited on foot of a mere request from the legal authorities there.  The intervention of the Minister to satisfy himself that there will be a fair trial, that the system there is acceptable, has improved and is satisfactory in the dispensing of justice and, above all, that the interrogation methods have been radically altered, would be of great advantage. I hope we do not find some unfortunate being extradited and then having the lard beaten out of him in order to get a confession to convict him on, perhaps, spurious allegations which may have formed the basis of the request for extradition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to take on this task.  In addition to the amendment he has already accepted he should adopt this amendment proposed by Deputy Woods. If the Minister does not agree to the wording suggested by Deputy Woods I have no doubt that suitable wording can be found.  I will be less unhappy about the outcome of the application of this measure when it is passed if the amendment is accepted.  The Minister should give this matter serious consideration. We are not dealing with a kindergarten or play school when we send somebody back up there.  We are dealing with hard realities of which we have too much proof in the past.  I will not detail the interrogation methods adopted up there or the inhuman treatment that has been meted out over the years night and day.  It has <Col N="3441" /> not stopped and we have no assurance that it will.  The Minister would be some bulwark between the unfortunates who might find themselves being sent back there to face that unjust administration that purports to be the administration of justice in those Six Counties of ours.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment has some similarities to one Deputy Woods moved on Committee Stage but there is one major difference which meets the points I made when Deputy Woods's earlier amendment was discussed.  On Committee Stage I said that provisions of this kind could not possibly be adjudicated upon by a court and that it was appropriate if decisions of this sort were to be made they would be made by a Minister rather than by a court.  A court could not be expected to have knowledge in its judicial capacity of the sort of matters referred to here.  It would be impossible to adduce evidence before a court as to these matters because one could be there until kingdom come trying to decide on the rights and wrongs of these matters.</P>
      <P>If a provision of this kind is to be used as a safeguard, it is appropriate that it should be done by the Minister of the day who is more likely to be informed, or have sources of information that could keep him informed, on these matters.  I should like to say to the Minister that this is very different from the amendment put forward on Committee Stage and it should be given serious consideration. If the amendments we put forward on Committee Stage in regard to the <i>prima facie</i> requirements had been accepted by the Minister I would say that the amendment before us was unnecessary but we have to look at the amendment in the context of the Bill as it stands without the safeguards that I, and I daresay a considerable majority of Members, think should have been written in.  The fact is that they were not and, therefore, we have to look at a substitute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately, the amendment I sought to put down on Report Stage was disallowed and that prevents us putting forward in any form a <i>prima facie</i> requirement type of amendment or writing in <Col N="3442" /> any such safeguard of that type, which I think is an essential one, into the Bill. That is a pity but there is nothing I can do about it.</P>
    <P>I see in this amendment a third best because it is far from ideal.  It is very subjective and it will subject Ministers to a lot of pressure of a kind that they would prefer, speaking from my own experience in that Department, not to be subjected to.  That is a pity but the Minister has only himself to blame for this.  If he, and the Government, had acted more reasonably on Committee Stage in the way they were asked by an overwhelming number of people they would not have to consider this amendment.  Although I have described this amendment advisedly as third best and unsatisfactory from several points of view nevertheless it has to be considered.</P>
    <P>The Government have handled the Bill badly, particularly Committee Stage. They have left themselves open to severe and justifiable criticism.  There may be some indication that the Minister is trying to mend his hand now at this late stage, that he realises the error of the Government's approach and the nature of this.  In the context of where we stand now, at 10.17 p.m. with the Bill coming to an end at 11 p.m. and not having got into it what should have been put into it, this is some opportunity, even though to my mind it is not at all satisfactory, for the Minister to introduce a safeguard. This gives some flexibility to the Minister and for that reason he should consider it.</P>
    <P>I am not sure which section in the 1965 Act pertains to a general ability of the Minister to give a direction.  There is some section other than section 50 but I cannot find it at the moment under which a Minister can refuse to allow an extradition to go forward or to be processed if he has grounds for doing so.  The Minister of the day will be helped by the three categories set out in this amendment because they are three that relate to the concerns most frequently expressed here. Almost all of the debate on all sides has related to Britain and Northern Ireland but one point made in the amendment is very valid as far as Spain is concerned.  If <Col N="3443" /> the Minister is not satisfied that the person concerned will receive a fair trial within a reasonable period he can do something about it if the amendment is adopted.  Is 25 months in jail waiting for one's trial a reasonable period?  Would a Minister for Justice here not be justified in saying he would be slow to allow anybody to be extradited if he will be kept in custody for that length of time awaiting his trial?  This does not apply exclusively to Britain and Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>I have considerable reservations about this.  I have no doubt there are better ways that this could be done but the Minister has chosen to set his face against them, a fact that I regret very much.  In my view it has done enormous harm to the Bill and to the whole concept of what we are trying to deal with.  Given the circumstances we are in, in the last hour of debate on the Bill before it is guillotined, this is the third best alternative and the Minister should accept it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment of Deputy Woods.  I do not see any good reason why the Minister will not accept it.  It endeavours to put into the Bill in a legal way something that has been at the background of the Bill at all times.  As initiated, there is nothing in the Bill to state that unless and until we are satisfied that the administration of justice in the Six Counties is satisfactory, including the abolition of the Diplock courts, we will not agree to extradite our citizens to that jurisdiction.  It is obvious that when the Government brought forward this legislation they expected a <i>quid pro quo</i> from the UK.  The original proposal was that the Act would not be put into operation until 30 June 1987, but that date has been put back to 31 December 1987, presumably in order to give time for the other jurisdiction to satisfy us that the administration of justice there would be brought into line.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the years when my party, or the Coalition were in Government, I have objected to the fact that we seemed to get most of our information regarding the background to legislation not from the <Col N="3444" /> Minister in the House but people now known as national handlers, Government sources or whatever they might be called. Since the Bill was published it has been under what is known as &ldquo;the lobby system&rdquo;.  We have read about Government sources giving the media to understand that the Government were awaiting a response from the British Government to the effect that they would abolish the Diplock courts and do various things regarding the administration of justice in the Six Counties.  We have different ideas about who these unnamed persons might be, but it is an unsatisfactory procedure which seems to have grown up in the last seven or eight years.  Those people seem to have more power than the elected Members.</P>
    <P>I particularly object to a spokesman who was reported in last Monday's newspapers as saying that if the Minister accepted the <i>prima facie</i> requirement as set down by Deputies Woods, O'Malley and others, this State would be a haven for terrorists.  That implied two things: that if the Minister allowed the <i>prima facie</i> provision, Ireland would be a haven for terrorists; but, more important, it implied that we have never had extradition here for political offences and the impression given to Ian Paisley and others in the North has been that this State has been a haven for terrorists.  That was the most damaging thing I found about that report because it copper-fastened the idea that those people in the North have been putting forward for years: it implied that if we do not do something about extradition for political offences through this Bill we will continue to be a haven for terrorists in the future. That is not the case.</P>
    <P>The amendment of Deputy Woods endeavours to put into the legislation what the Government are hoping will happen in any event.  The Minister hinted at this in his Second Stage speech.  When referring to the change in the judicial systems which he hoped the British authorities would bring about he said:</P>
    <P>And so the changes I have referred to are still in the course of being <Col N="3445" /> brought into effect.  The Government believe that further progress needs to be made and so do the British Government though, of course, I am not saying that both Governments have agreed about what further changes might take place.  The important point is that the two Governments are agreed that dialogue will continue on measures to improve confidence in the administration of justice in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Later on the Minister said:</P>
    <P>We believe, therefore, that it is right to show a substantial response.</P>
    <P>Later he said:</P>
    <P>I want to stress that it is not the Government's intention that any direct and necessary linkage should be established between the bringing into operation of this legislation and any remedial reform in the administration of justice in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>It has been proved from the debate that we are hoping that it will be possible by 31 December next year for people who may be extradited to receive a fair trial, that we will be satisfied as to the general standards of the administration of justice and that we will have reasonable grounds to believe that a person who will be extradited will not be interrogated improperly.</P>
    <P>All the amendment is doing is endeavouring to insert in the legislation some safeguard.  The Minister has refused to accept amendments on Committee Stage regarding a <i>prima facie</i> requirement though the majority of Members of the House and of the people of the country are not satisfied that we are putting safeguards into the Bill.  It is only reasonable that there should be some <i>caveat</i>.  Such an amendment to the Bill would not make one whit of difference to the purpose of the Government.  Therefore, I urge the Minister to accept this amendment.</P>
    <P>I think I was the first Deputy to refer to the fact that this Bill will apply to many other countries as well as to Britain and Northern Ireland.  Even though they will <Col N="3446" /> probably account for a very small percentage of extraditions from here or to Ireland, we are putting on the Statute Book something that will affect 21 other countries, and additional countries which the Minister for Foreign Affairs from time to time may designate.  If we fear the administration of justice in the Six Counties how might we feel about justice in those other countries?  It is bad to incorporate in any legislation this type of <i>carte blanche</i> provision without any safeguard with regard to Irish citizens.</P>
    <P>The least the Minister could do would be to accept this amendment which would provide some safeguards for people in respect of whom extradition warrants are requested.  I do not think anybody inside or outside this House would be satisfied with the system of justice that is operated in the Six Counties, or would have any confidence in it, good, bad or indifferent. I have absolutely none.  First I do not believe that there would be a fair trial afforded, second, I would have no confidence in the system of justice as administered there and, third, I am not satisfied regarding the methods of interrogation there.  I do not think any sensible person in this part of the island would have any confidence in the system there.  We would want to remember that it is not so long ago the British Government were before the European Court and found guilty on many charges relating to incidents in the Six Counties.  There have also been reports from Amnesty International and so on, all of which have come to the same conclusion.  It is obvious that people there do not get a fair trial.  I have no hesitation in saying that I have no confidence in the system of justice operated there at present.  I would have to be shown without any doubt, before the provisions of this Bill come into effect on 1 December 1987, that that system had improved.  I hope it will have and if the enactment of this Bill helps to further reform the system there, then it will have served some purpose.</P>
    <P>Not one safeguard has been built into the provisions of this Bill.  If Deputy Woods's amendment was accepted at least we would be inserting something, <Col N="3447" /> some little safeguard.  In order to show some goodwill to all sides in the matter, as a minimum, the Minister should be prepared to accept this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Woods began by saying that he is not in favour of giving <i>carte blanche</i> to the Minister, to the Crown Prosecution Service, to the DPP in Northern Ireland or to any other officers.  Yet part of his amendment does just that, it gives <i>carte blanche</i> to the Minister.  I shall revert to that in a moment.</P>
      <P>Deputy Woods insists on safeguards.  I have pointed out repeatedly in the course of this debate what is the system that is in operation under the 1965 Act, what it provides for, what safeguards there are in it and indeed the improved safeguards that now exist following the agreement on a non-statutory scheme of inspection and supervision of these warrants.</P>
      <P>Deputy Woods referred to the position in Denmark and Norway where, he said, a <i>prima facie</i> requirement exists, about which we spoke at an earlier stage in this debate, and where the import of the scheme as operated by those two countries is very much more limited than Deputy Woods would suggest.  He mentioned a number of contracting countries that do not extradite their own nationals, but he did not refer to the fact that all of the countries he mentioned are civil law countries, that they do not have the kinds of difficulties in relation to admissibility of evidence that would arise in our case and do not have the same position in relation to, if you like, cross-citizenship with a neighbouring country that we have.  If Deputy Woods refers to all of these other cases he should refer to all aspects of them and not just to specific ones which, taken on their own, would appear to suit the case he is making but, when put in context, do not suit it at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Woods also complained that we did not get through all the sections of the Bill.  He will have seen that I was very anxious to have a discussion on section 3 with Deputy Blaney.  I think I can fairly say &mdash; even Deputy O'Malley would bear <Col N="3448" /> me out on this &mdash; that I am not the Member who trotted out long speeches, certainly not, on Committee Stage.  I heard this evening two Second Stage speeches on Committee Stage; that was not my doing.</P>
    <P>Then, Deputy Woods had the effrontery to suggest that this Bill was being put through, and I think I quote his exact words &ldquo;to generate conflict and misery&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>This is another example of Deputy Woods looking through all of his papers finding a little wee &lsquo;biteen&rsquo; of green and deciding that is a flag he might take out and wave.  Deputy Woods also alleged that one of the principal functions of taking people into custody in Northern Ireland is for interrogation.  I have made the point very clearly that extradition &mdash; whether under the backing of warrants procedure to any part of the United Kingdom or to any other country, is not, should not and cannot be simply for the purpose of questioning.  Deputy Woods does not seem to recognise that that is the case.  I am sorry he does not recognise the facts before him.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Malley seemed to believe that the change in this amendment, compared with its previous form on Committee Stage, meets some of his concerns, that while it is far from being ideal it is, I think he said, a third best.  He went on to say that it is very subjective and he said, rightly, although without any tincture of sympathy in his voice, that it would place a great deal of pressure on the Minister.  That is true also.  It is the kind of situation in which one should not put a Minister, in a case like this, in the area about which we are talking.  I speak, not with any concern for my own skin or comfort but from the general principle; I do not think it is particularly wise of the Legislature to put members of the Executive in positions where they are exposed to certain kinds of pressure, particularly where such is not necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment in its present form is <Col N="3449" /> different in some respects from its Committee Stage form.  In its present form it would mean that there would be laid down statutory grounds for the refusal of extraditions in relation to which the Minister only would have the power to decide whether the person concerned should or should not be extradited.  There exist already in the 1965 Act grounds on which the Minister can act in this regard. I think Deputy Woods had in mind particularly section 50 of that Act which provides that the High Court and the Minister should have certain discretion in relation to the release of persons arrested.  The High Court has discretion in relation to all of the grounds set out there.  In section 50(4) of the 1965 Act the Minister has discretion on two of the grounds set out; he does not have as wide a discretion as the court.  The existing grounds for refusal of extradition may be acted on either by the Minister or by the court.  In the case of the other existing grounds the Minister for Justice does not have the right to take the ultimate decision as to whether a person should or should not be extradited.  Even in the case of those existing powers, even if the matter were to come before the Minister and he were to decide that he should not interfere and that therefore he should not prevent extradition, the court might still decide otherwise.  If a court decided otherwise the person would not be extradited.</P>
    <P>In the amendment as it is now the power to decide whether to extradite would rest solely with the Minister and the requested person would have no recourse to the court in the event that the Minister decided not to intervene and refused extradition.  That would be an undesirable provision.  Let me add that reflection to the comments that I made about this on Committee Stage, although those comments concerned the wider framework of the amendment as it was then.  Taking account of the grounds that Deputy O'Malley indicated on Committee Stage regarding the amendment then, and which he indicated in part that he still has in relation to the amendment <Col N="3450" /> as it now is before us, I have to conclude that I could not accept this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister seems to feel that he should not be left in the position of being the last defence of the citizen. Given the circumstances of this Bill, as it stands, and Act as it will become in a very short time, there is a need for somebody to stand in defence of the Irish citizen because there will be no <i>prima facie</i> case and a person can be taken out of this country to another place for trial without the presentation here of the normal book of evidence which would be required if the person were to go forward for trial here within the State.  That is what we are facing in this Bill and it is frightening when you consider the extent to which the measures included in this Bill will limit the political offence and will include many more situations and many more people.  As we said on Second Stage regarding section 2, we support that measure in principle but we have insisted on safeguards.  The Minister is not prepared to give the <i>prima facie</i> measure as a safeguard.  He is still insisting on making the measures retroactive and now he is not prepared to introduce this measure as a defence and a vindication of the position of the citizen in the circumstances which apply at the moment, although he knows that there are serious problems, particularly in the North.  This is why he is postponing the application of this Bill.</P>
      <P>Earlier I gave the finding of the National Council for Civil Liberties in the UK the Cobden Trust.  Let us look at their conclusion in relation to the system of justice in the North of Ireland as given in <i>The Use and Abuse of Emergency Legislation in Northern Ireland</i>, page 125:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But now, after 14 years of deaths from rubber, plastic and real bullets, internment, detention without trial, exclusion orders, repetitive early morning arrests for intelligence gathering, surveillance and harassment, oppressive interrogation sessions, house and body searches, aggressive <Col N="3451" /> policing policies by the RUC and army&mdash;</P>
    <P>This is from an academic body who are not emotionally involved: they have done a cold academic study of the situation as it exists on the ground.</P>
    <P>Diplock courts, long periods of remand in custody, the use of supergrasses, the abduction of families, convictions on the basis of suspect confessions and heavy prison sentences all in the name of law and order with little or no means or redress, one can hardly expect that their respect or confidence has increased.</P>
    <P>On the contrary, this, of course has led to alienation.  It goes on, in conclusion, to ask how this problem can be tackled. Mere tinkering with the system would produce no improvement at all.  Nothing less than a radical overhaul is required of the whole legal system as it applies in the North.  Nor should this overhaul be confined to the criminal justice system but should extend to a total reappraisal of how to tackle the situation in the North. It makes out how serious the problems are there.  On page 126 it says, and I quote:</P>
    <P>Police and army powers of stop and question, arrest and interrogation is one area in which reform is long overdue ...</P>
    <P>The repetitive arrests for intelligence gathering...</P>
    <P>The Minister has continued to deny here all night that these arrests are for intelligence gathering.  I know he would not want people taken out of the country purely for intelligence gathering or for interrogation, but we fear that the system he is bringing in now will result in creating such a situation and to leave us open to it.  However it may be veiled and covered, that is likely to come from it.</P>
    <P>The report goes on to suggest necessary measures, such as reducing the length of time the police can hold a suspect in custody which would help to prevent abuse in the interrogation room.  Much <Col N="3452" /> more is needed.  The report suggests many other things but there is no need to go into them at great length.  We are all aware of the problems and we have put down this measure to give the Minister the opportunity of acting as the last defence of the citizen in ensuring that he will be extradited only to a place where a fair trial and fair legal system will apply. I think that is a reasonable proposition and an important safeguard and I am pressing the amendment.</P>

In order to square it with the intention, I suggest that first there should be a marginal note stating: &ldquo;laying of orders in draft before Houses of the Oireachtas&rdquo; and that the amendment should read &ldquo;a draft of any order proposed to be made by the Government under this Act after the commencement of the Extradition (European Convention for the Suppression of Terrorism) Act, 1986 shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and the Order shall not be made until the motion approving of the draft has been passed by each such House&rdquo;.

      <P>Deputy Coogan has been given permission to raise on the Adjournment of the Dáil the Economic and Social Research Institute's report on post-primary school under-age drinking. He has four minutes.  The Minister has one minute.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the Minister for taking this issue on the Adjournment, although I am not quite sure which Minister should be here tonight in so far as the problem that has been thrown up by this report indicates that the response to it would be better if there were three Ministers replying rather than one, namely, the Minister for Health, the Minister for Education and the Minister for Justice.</P>
      <P>The cost to the country of excessive alcohol abuse has been stated to be in the region of £250 million and I am quoting Dr. McCarthy of the Department of Health from 1984.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FintanACoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The cost to people personally and psychologically, through job losses and through absenteeism is also extremely high and is unquantifiable.  The response to this issue would have to be a multi-pronged response.  First &mdash; and I am glad that it is the Minister for Education who is present in this sense &mdash; one part of the response must be through the educational system.  The second response is through the Department of Justice and the Department of Health combined.</P>
      <P>Why are these startling figures thrown up?  It is extraordinary the number of children who are drinking under-age at present.  I shall not have time to go into the figures.  Nevertheless, there are a number of causes, among them obviously is perceived parental behaviour, a simple sociological term meaning that children imitate their parents to a great degree. That in itself might be simplistic but there is another aspect to it which is that the increase in home consumption of alcohol means that there is a ready availability of alcohol in the house for young children if they wish to be tempted.  There is a modestly significant association between the variables of parental behaviour and drinking patterns of young children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another aspect, of course, is perceived peer behaviour.  There is undoubted pressure on young people when they perceive their own group consuming alcohol. I am not sure from a sociological point of <Col N="3461" /> view whether that is true, that young people drink together because they are inclined to come together in a group to support each other.  Nevertheless, there is some element of influence in group behaviour.  An example of this might be in the case of sporting fixtures.  Very often in the past we have seen students imitate their elders after the victory of one team over another, where the cup is passed around and alcohol is consumed.  I recall at some stage that the GAA, who are to be complimented on this, started boring holes in cups.  I do not think that is the real answer to the problem, although it might be one answer.  It indicates the need for a change in attitudes rather than a simple solution like that.</P>
    <P>The report recommends a number of prevention systems that would reflect on the Department of Education and I shall list them very briefly.  The first is to introduce an element of knowledge about drinking for young people; in other words, a simple explanation of the effects of alcohol on physiology and on behavioural patterns.  That in itself can be dangerous in so far as very often the knowledge introduces the young person to alcohol.</P>

      <P>I would recommend to <Col N="3462" /> the Minister the recommendations regarding the solutions given in the report.  The second prong that I was mentioning earlier is the use of identity cards. We have been accused that we would become a police State if we were to introduce them.  Nevertheless, I could see the use of identity cards for 18-year olds.  If the card carried a driving licence with a photograph, it could carry the blood group of the person involved and the social security number and could be used when a person goes in to vote to prove his or here identity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mrs. Hussey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The total number of medical referee personnel serving at present in my Department is 25 including the Medical Adviser and the Deputy Medical Adviser.  Medical referees are full-time officers who carry out examinations of claimants at centres situated in all the cities and main towns throughout the country.</P>
      <P>The medical referee system provides for second medical opinions as to incapacity of claimants to disability benefit, injury benefit and invalidity pensions. Medical assessments of claimants for disablement benefit under the occupational injuries scheme are also carried out.</P>
      <P>Medical referees are an integral part of the control system of payment of benefit. Claimants to disability and injury benefit, in particular, are reviewed to ensure that they satisfy the qualifying condition for benefit which requires that they be so incapacitated as to be incapable of work. The medical adviser considers cases for examination in the light of circumstances including the duration of the claim and the nature of the certified incapacity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where an examination is required, the claimant's medical certifier is invited to provide an updated medical history. Unless the claimant is certified unable to attend, he is then requested to attend for <Col N="3262" /> an examination to which the certifier is also invited.</P>
    <P>The system is continually reviewed and the present cadre includes an additional five doctors recruited during the year.  As a result an additional 5,000 claimants will be called this year over the number called in 1985, that is 87,000 as against 82,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mrs. Hussey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 15 and 17 together.</P>
      <P>The number of appeals received in the Department has increased considerably in recent years, the annual number received at present being in the region of 18,000 compared to a total of about 12,000 in 1982.</P>
      <P>The time taken to process appeals varies in accordance with the nature of the decision under appeal and whether or not the case is dealt with summarily or is the subject of an oral hearing.  Delays can occur when an oral hearing is necessary particularly when further investigation of means by a social welfare officer is looked for before a decision is made as is the case frequently with appeals under the unemployment assistance scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the increased number of appeals received in the Department over the last few years has caused delays in processing certain cases, the appointment of two additional appeals officers in 1984 resulted in significant progress in clearing the backlog of cases.  The current position <Col N="3263" /> is that cases decided summarily are subject to very little delay and while there are still delays in processing appeals which are given an oral hearing, nevertheless the position has shown considerable improvement.</P>
    <P>Every effort is being made to have appeals processed with the minimum of delay and the creation of two further permanent posts recently, which were filled in the last few weeks, will reduce further the time taken to deal with appeals including appeals under the unemployment assistance scheme.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare the number of cases where the free electricity allowance was discontinued during 1986; and the changes which have been made in the operation of the scheme arising from the implementation of the Equality Directive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mrs. Hussey) Gemma Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mrs. Hussey)</NameTxt>
      <P>Free electricity allowance has been terminated in some 21,800 cases in 1986.  This covers the year to 11 December, which is the latest date for which figures are available.</P>
      <P>The implementation of equal treatment does not affect the entitlement of persons whose applications for a free electricity allowance were received in my Department before 17 November 1986. Therefore, no free electricity allowance already in payment has been terminated as a result of the implementation of the directive on equal treatment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the new arrangements affect new claims from 17 November 1986 when equal treatment was brought into effect. From that date, a spouse in order to be regarded as coming within the excepted categories of persons living with the claimant must be a dependant of the claimant or must be receiving a qualifying payment in his or her own right.  This is the only change from the pre-equality position when all wives were accepted as coming within the excepted categories <Col N="3264" /> while only husbands who were invalids were so accepted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mrs. Hussey) Gemma Hussey">

      <P>Most decisions on entitlement to unemployment assistance, other than on their means, are in fact decided locally by statutorily appointed deciding officers at employment exchanges throughout the country.  The function of assessing a claimant's means, however, is largely carried out by deciding officers at head office on the basis of the report prepared by the local social welfare officer. Approximately 700 cases in respect of the means of new claimants are decided each week while a further 1,200 cases have their means re-assessed following review of their cases.</P>
      <P>The policy has been in recent years to devolve these decisions to employment exchanges to the greatest extent possible. All cases where the social welfare officer's report indicated a nil means assessment are now decided at the local employment exchange and in addition responsibility for making decisions in relation to cases where there are means assessed is now being performed at some of the larger employment exchanges.</P>
      <P>The kind of decisions which have been devolved to local offices have, in general, been the more straightforward cases.  It will be some time before the assessment of means can be entirely carried out at local level in view of the complexity of the decisions involved, the large number of local offices and the consequent training programmes involved.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare the number of families <Col N="3265" /> at present in receipt of a family income supplement; the average payment to each family; and if she has any plans to alter this scheme to target more effectively payments to the less well-off.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mrs. Hussey) Gemma Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mrs. Hussey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of families at present in receipt of a family income supplement is 4,834.  The average payment is £10.62 per family.</P>
      <P>I have been concerned at the relatively low take up on this scheme and I have had it examined with a view to relaxing the conditions to enable a greater degree of take up.</P>
      <P>One area of particular concern has been the definition of full-time working. The existing regulations provide for the payment of family income supplement where one or more parent is in full-time paid employment of not less than 30 hours a week.  Experience has shown that some families on low earnings do not qualify for the family income supplement payment as a result.  I am glad to be able to announce today that the Government have agreed to my proposal to reduce the number of hours worked per week to enable families in these circumstances to qualify for family income supplement from 30 to 24.  I am satisfied that this is an important step in improving the scheme to the benefit of those in low paid employment.</P>

      <P>Thirty temporary household interviewer posts for the 1987 <Col N="3266" /> household budget survey were advertised on 22 October 1986.  A total of 1,845 applications were received by the specified closing date of 7 November 1986.  Some 308 eligible applicants were subsequently called for interview.  Interviews were held between the first and the ninth of this month.  Appointments will be made shortly and in doing this preference will be given, as specified in the regulations, to qualified candidates who are unemployed.  While due account must be taken of geographic location a preliminary assessment of interview results indicates that the majority of candidates who will be offered appointment are currently on the live register of unemployed.</P>
      <P>The appointments are being made under an exclusion order under section 5 of the Civil Service Commissioners Act, 1956.  Such temporary appointments are normally made by the Department or office concerned and not by the Civil Service Commission.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Deasy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 92 and 108 together.</P>
      <P>Because of the serious imbalance in the milk market and the unacceptably high stock levels, the EC Council of Ministers have now agreed measures aimed at further reducing milk quotas.  These will be achieved principally by (i) the surrender of quotas under a voluntary cessation scheme under which producers are paid an annual premium of 23p per gallon for seven years to surrender quotas and (ii) the temporary suspension of quotas of individual producers for a two year period.</P>
      <P>The scheme at (i) is a voluntary one, affecting only those farmers who wish to surrender quotas and will not involve any quota cuts for other farmers unless it is under subscribed.  As regards (ii) it is not possible to exempt any category of producer from the linear cuts involved but it is estimated that the level of premium involved at 38p per gallon fully compensates farmers for the temporary quota loss.</P>

      <P>Before MCAs on live cattle exported to Britain can be paid the appropriate T5 forms certifying export and endorsed by UK Customs must be received by my Department.  Some six to eight weeks from the date of export usually elapse before these forms are returned by UK <Col N="3294" /> Customs.  While delay in returning T5 forms lies outside our jurisdiction, my Department deal as speedily as possible with the forms when received and payments are normally issued within two to three weeks.  A longer period can however arise in some cases where additional documentary checks have to be made, for example verification of weights of animals, end use etc.</P>

There are no other proposals to increase the rate of recoupment as suggested by the Deputy but the effect of Council Regulation (EC) No. 3606 is that some 75 per cent of the extra £32 million provided under this years disadvantaged area schemes will be recovered from the EC.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Deasy)</NameTxt>
      <P>In accordance with the normal practice regarding joint drainage projects such as the Ballyfinboy drainage scheme, my Department's role is limited to approving a scheme of works for grant purposes, and to paying the appropriate grant in one or more instalment as the scheme, or portions thereof, are satisfactorily completed.  In the case of the Ballyfinboy project, my Department on 1 March 1982 approved a scheme of works to be undertaken by a committee representing the landowners benefiting from the project. The project was estimated to cost £236,184 and a grant of £122,651 payable to the representatives of the drainage committee was approved, representing 100 per cent of the estimated cost of works relating to county council bridges affected by the scheme and 45 per cent of the estimated cost of the remaining works.  Subsequently, my Department agreed to increase the grant rate for works other than county council bridges from 45 per cent to 50 per cent, thus increasing the overall grant offered to £132,972.  It was also indicated to the drainage committee that, in accordance with normal practice, costs arising from unforeseen expenditure would be taken into account for grant purposes on a standard basis.  I am satisfied that officials of my Department did not undertake to pay the full costs arising from the excavation of rock encountered over and above the quantity included in the original cost estimate. Neither did officials of my Department at any time agree to act as consulting engineers to the project.  My Department first became aware in December 1984 that, in the contract agreement dated 15 June 1983 between the Ballyfinboy drainage committee and the contractor employed by the committee to carry out the works, the Farm Development Service had been named as consulting engineers to the project.  This had been done without the knowledge or consent of my Department and any responsibility in relation to this entry in <Col N="3303" /> the contract has been repudiated by my Department.  Consequently, the issue by my Department of certificates relating to sums due to the contractor does not arise. My Department has no official knowledge of the amounts due to the contractor. This is solely a matter for the drainage committee which has entered into a contract agreement with him.</P>
      <P>I understand that the estimated cost of the works carried out to date on this project is approximately £380,000.</P>

The population figures are taken from the preliminary report on the 1986 census except in the case of Dublin city centre for which the 1981 census figures are used as the relevant 1986 census figures are not yet available.

    <P>I would like to make the point that it would be seriously misleading to regard these figures as any accurate measure of the level of Garda service in the areas concerned.  Population is only one of a number of factors taken into account in assessing the police needs of any particular area and, in any attempt to compare levels of police service in different areas, account would need to be taken of other matters including the overall resources available to an area, such as support staff, transport and other facilities.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 118 to 120 together.</P>
      <P>The detailed allocation of manpower and other resources to particular areas is a matter for the Garda authorities having regard to their assessment of needs, overall resources and the various demands on Garda services that must be met.  In assessing needs, population and the incidence of crime are only two of a number of factors which must be taken into account.</P>
      <P>Regard must be had to the police needs of all areas both rural and urban and it must be borne in mind that certain areas have particular policing needs for security reasons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It must also be borne in mind, when looking at areas of Dublin, that all stations in the Dublin Metropolitan Area have available to them substantial resources of manpower and transport additional to those based at local stations and specialised units such as the Crime <Col N="3306" /> Task Force and the Serious Crime Squad can be called on to assist gardaí in dealing with particular localised crime problems. Overall, the deployment of Garda resources is kept under regular review by the Garda authorities and adjustments are made to meet changing needs and circumstances, as necessary.</P>
    <P>With regard to the incidence of crime in the particular areas referred to in the questions.  I am informed by the Garda authorities that the indications are that the downward trend experienced in 1985 in the number of crimes reported from these areas is being maintained this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Dukes)</NameTxt>
      <P>The decision to close the female section of Limerick prison was taken having regard to the continuing pressures on accommodation in the male prisons and particularly because it has regularly only been catering for between eight and eleven female offenders when there is accommodation for about 30.  In view of this and the fact that most of the offenders were from the Dublin region and that additional accommodation had recently been provided at Mountjoy female prison I decided in those circumstances that Limerick prison should no longer accommodate female offenders and that the female section should be occupied by male offenders.  All female offenders are now accommodated at Mountjoy female prison.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the female staff attached to Limerick prison, I am happy that the most satisfactory arrangements possible have been arrived at.  Five officers who had previously applied for transfer to Cork prison have now been <Col N="3307" /> facilitated; one officer who was recently appointed as a permanent officer was assigned for induction training and five temporary officers have been reassigned to institutions in Dublin.  In recognition of the short time scale involved and following discussion with the staff side the remaining 24 female staff are being integrated with the male staff attached to Limerick prison on a temporary basis for a period of three months from 1 December 1986.  During this period the staffing situation will be assessed by my Department and there will be further consultations with the staff side in the matter.</P>

      <P>The pension at the rate of £4,024.92 per annum was calculated on the basis of 19 years and 242 days of pensionable service which had been credited to the teacher in question, in the records of the Teachers' Pensions Section of my Department.  It has now been confirmed that the teacher had given 23 years and 254 days of pensionable service and her pension is being increased accordingly.  Any inconvenience caused is regretted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Cooney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to taker Questions Nos. 125 to 140 (inclusive) together.</P>
      <P>The position in regard to remedial teaching is that my Department has received applications from St. John Bosco national school, Navan Road and central model girls' national school, Marlborough Street.</P>
      <P>The applications for remedial teachers for national schools are being processed at present in my Department.</P>
      <P>Remedial teaching posts are allocated in accordance with a priority of educational need rather than social disadvantage and the applications referred to above will be considered in the light of the availability of remedial posts for 1986-87.  I will contact the chairpersons of the board of management when a decision is made.</P>
      <P>None of the other 14 schools mentioned by the Deputy has a current application for a remedial teacher or an additional remedial teacher; some of them already have a remedial post.</P>
      <P>With regard to the question of the association of other resources to the schools in question the position is that through participation in a programme of special educational measures for primary schools in disadvantaged urban areas, additional resources have been made available to the following schools:</P>
      <P>&nbsp;(i) Pro-Cathedral Infant Boys' N.S., Lower Rutland Street,</P>
      <P>(ii) Pro-Cathedral Boys' N.S., Lower Rutland Street,</P>
      <P>(iii) St. Laurence O'Toole Junior Boys' N.S. Seville Place,</P>
      <P>(iv) St. Laurence O'Toole Infant Girls' N.S., Seville Place,</P>
      <P>(v) St. Laurence O'Toole Girls' N.S., Seville Place,</P>
      <P>(vi) St. Joseph's N.S., St. Mary's Road, East Wall.</P>
      <P>The measures from which the schools benefit include special grants for books and equipment, the sponsorship of home/school/community liaison initiatives and an inservice training programme for the teachers concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having regard to the total finance <Col N="3312" /> available, £750,000 in 1986, it has been necessary to limit the number of participating schools as the promotion of the scheme on a broader basis would seriously limit the quality of the intervention.</P>
