      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that last evening the Minister for Justice indicated that the Government are opposing the Larceny Bill which we are bringing forward in Private Members' Time?  He indicated that there were defects in the drafting of the legislation. In view of that and if the Government propose to follow through and defeat this Bill, could the Taoiseach give any assurance as to when the Government will bring forward some legislation in this area since I think he would agree, as the Minister agreed last night, that this is an area where urgent action is required?</P>

      <P>The Chair feels <Col N="358" /> that this question would be more appropriately put and answered during the debate on item No. 12 on yesterday's Order paper which will be before the House from 7 p.m. to 8.30 p.m. on Tuesday next.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank Deputies who contributed to the debate on this Bill.  I am pleased at the general welcome which <Col N="366" /> it has received from all sides of the House.  Quite a number of helpful and constructive comments have been made. I look forward to teasing these out on Committee Stage so that the Bill can be improved and strengthened.</P>
      <P>Before I respond to the points made on specific provisions, I would like to deal with a number of general issues which have been raised.</P>
      <P>The first and most important of these is the concern which has been expressed about the constitutionality of certain proposals contained in the Bill.  The main provisions involved are, firstly, sections 33-40 which enable the courts, in certain circumstances, to place children in the care of or under the supervision of health boards and, secondly, Part V of the Bill which proposes new procedures for granting custody rights to foster parents and other persons who are caring for children on a long term basis.</P>
      <P>The doubts which have been expressed about these provisions arise directly from a judgement of the Supreme Court in March 1985 in the case of MC and MC and KC and EC and An Bord Uchtála. The case involved an application by the natural parents of a child for her return from a couple who had hoped to adopt her but who, for reasons that we need not go into here, were not able to do so. The court held that the issue of custody had to be determined in accordance with section 3 of the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964 and in the light of Articles 41 and 42 of the Constitution.</P>
      <P>Section 3 of the Act sets down the general principle to be followed by the courts in determining proceedings as to the custody of children.  The part of the section which is relevant here reads:</P>
      <P>Where in any proceedings before any court the custody, guardianship or upbringing of an infant... is in question, the court, in deciding that question, shall regard the welfare of the infant as the first and paramount consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Article 41 of the Constitution, the State recognises the family as the natural, primary and fundamental unit group of <Col N="367" /> society and guarantees to protect the family in its constitution and authority. In Article 42, the State acknowledges the family as the primary and natural educator of the child.  It goes on to provide in Article 42.5 that, and I quote:</P>
    <P>In exceptional cases, where the parents for physical or moral reasons fail in their duty towards their children, the State as guardian of the common good, by appropriate means shall endeavour to supply the place of the parents, but always with due regard for the natural and imprescriptible rights of the child.</P>
    <P>In the case before the court, the natural parents and the child, who had been legitimated by her parents' marriage, constituted a family within the meaning of the Constitution.  The court held that in that particular case, section 3 of the Act of 1964 had to be constructed as involving a constitutional presumption.  This presumption was that the welfare of the child was to be found within her family unless the court was satisfied that there were compelling reasons why this could not be achieved or unless the court was satisfied that it was an exceptional case where the parents had failed to provide education for her and continued to fail to do so for moral or physical reasons.</P>
    <P>The Supreme Court remitted the case to the High Court to be determined in accordance with this test.  On 25 May 1985, the High Court, applying this new test, ordered that the child be taken from the prospective adopters, with whom she had lived for two and a half years, and returned to the custody of her natural parents.</P>
    <P>I am concerned at the possible implications of these decisions for the new care proceedings and custody procedures proposed in the Bill.  It has been suggested that the Supreme Court and High Court decisions leave the proposed new provisions open to serious constitutional attack.  It does not seem to me that there is an essential difference between the case which was the subject of the recent judgments and the type of cases that are <Col N="368" /> likely to arise under the proposed care and custody proceedings.  In the former case, what was at issue was a custody dispute between two couples, both of whom were fit, willing and able to look after the child.  In care and custody proceedings, on the other hand, the parents would have to be shown to be unfit, unwilling or incapable of caring for their child.  These are fundamentally different situations.</P>
    <P>Article 42.5 of the Constitution, which I quoted a moment ago, expressly provides for intervention by the State where parents fail in their duty towards their children.  The judgement of the Supreme Court has not altered this in any way.  I believe that what the Supreme Court has said, in effect, is that, while there is a constitutional presumption that the welfare of a child is to be found within the family, the courts may decide otherwise where there are compelling reasons why this cannot be achieved or in exceptional cases where the parents have failed in their duty towards their children.</P>
    <P>It is for these exceptional cases that we are trying to legislate in this Bill.  Section 33 envisages the taking of care proceedings only in exceptional situations where the parents have failed or where there are compelling reasons why the child's welfare is not to be found within his family.  I consider that, on careful examination, the section would be found to be in general accord with the Constitution. However, in view of the critical importance of section 33 in the overall context of the Bill and the need to ensure that it is constitutionally sound, I have sought the advice of the Attorney General on the points which have been raised during this debate.  In the light of the Attorney General's advice I will take whatever action may be necessary on Committee Stage to remove any doubts that may exist and to ensure that there are no legal barriers in the way of the health boards intervening to protect a child where this becomes necessary.</P>
    <P>The second area about which constitutional doubts were raised is Part V of the Bill.  This proposes procedures which would enable foster parents and others <Col N="369" /> who have been caring for a child on a long term basis to be granted custody rights in respect of the child.  Deputies have suggested that such procedures might be in breach of parents' constitutional right to custody of their children. I would like to draw attention to section 66 of the Bill which states:</P>
    <P>A court shall not make a custody order unless it is satisfied that&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) every person being a parent or legal guardian of the child consents to the making of the order, or</P>
    <P>(b) the parent or legal guardian of the child is not capable of exercising proper guardianship or does not wish to have the care of the child.</P>
    <P>It is clear, therefore, that the courts will not be empowered to grant a custody order against the parents' wishes unless the parents are incapable or unwilling to care for the child.  This is an important safeguard.  It will ensure that parents who are concerned and interested in their children cannot be deprived of the custody of their children.  Custody orders will be available only where the parents are unfit, unwilling or unable to look after their children.</P>
    <P>What is involved here is an extension of the provisions of the Guardianship of Infants Act which already enable the courts, in certain circumstances, to place children in the care of third parties.  However, in the light of the points raised by the Deputies I shall seek further advice on this aspect also from the Attorney General.</P>
    <P>I think, in view of the constitutional queries that have been raised, that I should make it absolutely clear to the House that, far from threatening the rights of parents or the integrity of the family, this Bill has quite the contrary intention.  The whole thrust of the legislation, indeed its basic philosophy, envisages the child's own family as the setting most conducive to his well-being.  In that respect it is far more protective of the family than previous child care legislation. Section 42, for instance, which deals with the promotion of the welfare of <Col N="370" /> children by health boards, emphasises the principle that it is in the best interests of the child to be brought up within his own family.</P>
    <P>I would make a point, in strenuous counterpoint to the observations of Deputy Alice Glenn, that she should make a serious effort to read the content and intentions of the Bill, because the enormous prejudice which she has displayed and the assumptions which she has cared to develop do not stand up one bit in relation to this Bill.  I regret that I must be so emphatic and reject her serious misconceptions, and I wonder about the source of her advice and guidance in relation to this Bill.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, I should point out to the House that in quite exceptional and precise instances, as I have already indicated, parental rights will have to be circumscribed.  These extreme cases would, for instance, include parents who brutalise or neglect their children to the extent that their entire well-being and occasionally their lives may be at stake. Such instances demand laws that guarantee intervention as quickly as possible and ensure effective protection.  Provisions of that sort are central to this Bill. In drafting them, as I have indicated, the constraints of the Constitution have been fully respected.  However, I would have to say that Articles 41 and 42 do pose problems for those of us who are faced with updating and extending laws touching on children and the family.  I have encountered these problems not only in relation to the present Bill but also in connection with the further children legislation, namely that in regard to the amendment of the adoption laws, now being prepared in my Department.  It seems that we shall inevitably have to face up to a review of those Articles if we are to continue to make progress in the area of family legislation.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies expressed regret at the fact that the Bill does not deal comprehensively with the reform of our child care legislation.  For my part, I would have preferred to have been able to bring in a single Children Bill to deal <Col N="371" /> with all aspects of the law in relation to children.  I regret that it has not been possible to do so.  In working on the preparation of this Bill over the last two years it has been brought home to me, as never before, just how complex and intractable are the problems that arise in the child care area.  To have adhered to the ideal of a single Bill would have meant putting off any improvements in the law until all the issues had been resolved.  I do not think anyone with an interest in child care would have thanked us for doing that.  The Bill before the House marks a long-overdue start; the start of a process which will lead to the enactment of a comprehensive body of enlightened and up-to-date legislation in relation to children.</P>
    <P>I would now like to turn to the queries which were raised in relation to the provisions of specific sections of the Bill.  Some Deputies queried the definitions of child and young person.  As this Bill stands a child is defined as a person under 15 years of age and a young person is defined as a person between 15 and 17 years of age. The provisions in regard to taking into care apply only to those defined as children. Fundamentally these provisions are concerned with protecting from abuse young children who because of their age and immaturity are entirely dependent and vulnerable.  In general, young persons are much less dependent.  They do not require, that is those between 15 and 17 years of age, the same degree of protection and, in any event, some of the care provisions would hardly be appropriate to them.  In fixing the legal dividing line between children and young persons there has to be &mdash; and I readily concede this &mdash; a certain degree of judgment. There is no clear boundary line &mdash; I certainly hold that view, looking back on my own childhood and adolescence &mdash; between childhood and adolescence; children vary enormously in their physical and their emotional development.  In preparing this Bill, I decided after much deliberation that 15 years of age might serve as the appropriate dividing line in the context of the measures envisaged <Col N="372" /> because there is no option but to put an age in if the Bill is to stand up in the courts of the land.  I did not, however, overlook the fact that there may be some young persons over that age who might still require assistance and support. Health Boards already have a general obligation under the Health Act of 1953 to provide shelter and maintenance for persons requiring it.  It seemed that this gives the boards sufficient power to help young persons who clearly need assistance or protection.  A board, for instance, could arrange for a young person to be cared for by another family if he required that sort of support, and again, as Deputies have raised a query on this the word &ldquo;he&rdquo; in our legislation is referring under definition, to both sexes within the framework of the Bill.</P>
    <P>In view of the comments which have been made on this aspect I am prepared, nevertheless, to look again at the age limits and also to consider whether there should not be more specific obligations imposed on health boards in relation to helping and protecting young persons who are at risk.</P>
    <P>Regarding the question of prevention, I have been surprised, indeed disappointed, at the suggestions which have been made, both here in the House and outside, that the Bill pays insufficient attention to the question of prevention.  It has been claimed that the Bill envisages intervention by health boards only where abuse or neglect has already taken place. Nothing could be further from the truth. In the child care area, as in the health services generally, prevention is infinitely better than any cure and in introducing the Bill, I drew particular attention to section 23 which I described as one of the most important provisions of the Bill. This requires health boards to promote &mdash; and I emphasise the word &ldquo;promote&rdquo;&mdash; the welfare of children in their areas by identifying children who are receiving or are at risk of receiving inadequate care and protection and by providing such advice, guidance, services and facilities as may diminish the need to receive children into care or indeed keep them in care.</P>
    <P>This section gives health boards all the <Col N="373" /> authority they need to develop and maintain preventative programmes and services. In fact, it goes further.  It imposes a clear statutory duty on them to do so. In drafting the Bill no attempt has been made to try to spell out what services might be provided under this section. This was done deliberately so as to give health boards the maximum flexibility in responding to the needs of their areas and to ensure that there would be no obstacle to the development of new services to cater for needs which might emerge in the future.  However, it is my intention that the section will be used to provide a comprehensive range of family support services including home helps and home makers, family therapy, child psychology, developmental work with pre-school and emotionally disturbed children, neighbourhood resource centres, day care and day fostering, specialised projects for difficult or disturbed young children.</P>
    <P>It is my intention that the membership of child care advisory committees, which are provided for in section 57, will include representatives of voluntary organisations providing child care services, together with groups and individuals having a special interest or expertise in relation to children's issues.  It has been suggested that there is a need to spell out now how the membership of the committees will be selected.  I will certainly take another look at this before Committee Stage in order to ensure that the committees have a balanced membership and are in a position to comment authoritively on the delivery of child care services at local level.</P>
    <P>Arising out of the establishment of child care advisory committees at health board level, there have been calls for the setting up of a national children's council. Among the many submissions which I have received is a document from the Labour Party's social services group.  This proposes that a national child care advisory committee should be set up to complement the work of the local child care advisory committees.  I would state that in principle I have no objection to having an advisory body such as the national <Col N="374" /> children's council.  I have, however, some doubts as to the need for it at present. As the House will be aware in recent years a number of important reports, notably the Task Force on Child Care Services and the Review Body on Adoption, have provided a thorough investigation of our child care needs and suggested many measures for meeting them.</P>
    <P>In addition I have received many helpful representations from various bodies in the child care field and have always been readily available to meet them.  I can say that, generally speaking, my Department and I are quite clear about where we would like to go in relation to the further improvement of the children's services.  The dilemma is one of getting sufficient resources to bring about all the desirable changes.  The establishment of a national children's council is unlikely to advance change in the immediate future and, indeed, the operational expenses of the council would be likely to absorb resources which could be put to much better use in the immediate future in the provision of day care centres or some such service.</P>
    <P>As I say I am not against establishing a council and I am prepared to consider the various views which have been put forward in support of the idea.  I might add that I already have power under existing health legislation to appoint consultative bodies.  I have used this power, for instance, in regard to the appointment of the National Council for the Aged.</P>
    <P>There has been some criticism of the fact that most of the court proceedings provided for in the Bill will be heard in the District Court.  Deputies have suggested that cases in relation to the care and custody of children would be more appropriate to family courts.</P>
    <P>There have been growing demands in recent years for the establishment of a system of family courts to deal with all aspects of family law.  It has been suggested that judges dealing with family law should have special training, that the courts should be able to provide counselling and conciliation services and that court procedures should be more informal.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="375" /> For my own part, I have to say that I see considerable merit in the idea of courts dealing exclusively with family matters.  However, the question of family courts raises constitutional, social and economic issues which go far beyond the scope of this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Law Reform Commission in its First Programme of Law Reform, set itself the task of considering &ldquo;the question of the best type of judicial or court structure or structures appropriate to deal with the different matters which fall under the general heading of family law.&rdquo; The commission have not yet undertaken such an examination.  While I accept that this is an important issue, I would not have been happy to delay this Bill until a system of family courts had been set in place.  There is nothing to prevent the jurisdiction vested in the District Court in relation to the care, protection and custody of children being transferred to a family court system, if and when this is established.</P>
    <P>Deputies have queried the absence from the Bill of any references to under-age drinking or smoking by children.  I would like to deal with these points now. The phenomenon of under-age drinking and all that goes with it &mdash; crime and vandalism, teenage pregnancies, impaired performance at school or at work &mdash; are matters of deep concern to all of us.  In preparing the Bill I considered the possibility of including provisions to tackle under-age drinking and to tighten up controls on the sale of intoxicating drink to young people.  However, following consultations which I had with the Minister for Justice it was decided that it would be more appropriate to deal with these matters in the context of a review of the licensing laws generally.  The House will be aware that the Joint Committee on Legislation are considering this whole area at present and the need for changes in the law in relation to under-age drinking will be reviewed in the light of the committee's report.</P>
    <P>The Children Act, 1908, imposes certain restrictions on the sale of cigarettes <Col N="376" /> to children.  Except in certain limited circumstances, it is an offence to sell cigarettes to children under 16 years.  There is evidence that these provisions are not being complied with and, in any event, the penalties have not kept pace with changing money values.</P>
    <P>It is my intention to update and extend the controls on the sale of cigarettes to children in a Bill which I expect to circulate within the next few weeks.  The Bill will also provide for stricter controls on cigarette advertising and sponsorship and for the designation of non-smoking areas.</P>
    <P>Before I conclude, I would like to say a few words about an aspect of child abuse which has attracted a large amount of publicity in recent times.  I refer to sexual abuse of children.</P>
    <P>Sexual abuse of children is, and always has been, a very serious criminal offence. The criminal law provides that any person, be he a parent, relative or stranger, who has unlawful carnal knowledge of a girl under the age of 15 years may be liable on conviction to penal servitude for life.  In the case of an indecent assault upon a female of any age, the penalty is imprisonment for up to ten years.</P>
    <P>Despite these severe penalties, it has to be said that the criminal justice system tends to move slowly.  It takes time for the Garda to investigate complaints or allegations, to take statements, assemble the evidence and, in appropriate cases, seek a direction from the Director of Public Prosecutions before a case can go before the courts.  In suspected cases of child sexual abuse it is vitally important that the child be protected from the first moment that suspicions are aroused.</P>
    <P>For the first time in Irish child care legislation sexual abuse is expressly mentioned in this Bill as a ground on which a health board may obtain a place of safety order.  Such an order authorises a health board or, if necessary, the Garda to remove the child to a place of safety &mdash; for example, a hospital, children's home or foster home.  If the child is already in hospital, the order authorises the board to keep her there.  In either case the child may be kept for up to 14 days pending <Col N="377" /> the bringing of proceedings by the health board to have her placed in care.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides that, in cases of emergency, a member of the Garda may without warrant remove a child to a place of safety if she has been, or is at risk of being abused whether physically or sexually.  In such cases the child will be handed over to the health board so that it can consider the need to initiate care proceedings.</P>
    <P>The aim of all this is to remove the child from the source of danger as quickly as possible, both in order to protect the child from further abuse and to ensure that she receives medical treatment, help and support.</P>
    <P>When the health board satisfy the court that the child has been sexually abused, the court may make a care order in respect of her.  This order places the child under the care of the health board and the child may remain in that care until she is 18 years or until the home situation has improved to such an extent that she can be safely reunited with her family.</P>
    <P>The proposals in the Bill will go a long way towards strengthening the hands of the Garda and the health boards in relation to the sexual abuse of children.  However, much more needs to be done.  The immediate need is for reliable information on the incidence of child sexual abuse.</P>
    <P>Some time ago, I approved a grant of £25,000 to enable a group established by the Irish Council for Civil Liberties to survey the extent of child sexual abuse in Ireland.  They are currently completing their deliberations and hope to report in the coming months.</P>
    <P>More recently, at my request, some of my officials have been examining the work of agencies which are involved in the area of child counselling and sexual abuse.  My advisers will report to me on how the work of the agencies can be co-ordinated to ensure that the available resources are used with maximum effectiveness.</P>
    <P>In January 1985, I made available additional staff and resources to launch the sexual assault treatment unit at the Rotunda Hospital.  This unit undertakes <Col N="378" /> forensic examination of victims, including children, and provides essential medical treatment.  The existence of this facility has already encouraged more and more victims of sexual abuse to come forward for help.  This is also helping to establish the extent of the problem within our society.</P>
    <P>I have provided financial assistance for the establishment of the incest crisis service which supports victims and their families by providing a counselling and treatment service.  Additional funding was also given to the Rape Crisis Centre last year to enable them to extend their counselling services.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, there are no short term solutions to the problem of child sexual abuse.  Abuse of this sort tends to be deeply hidden behind a heavy cloak of family secrecy.  In the past the victims, and others who became aware of the problem or suspected that it was taking place, frequently looked the other way or did not know what to do.  More enlightened attitudes have resulted in a greater willingness to acknowledge the existence of the problem and to tackle it at its roots.  In the long term, greater public awareness and understanding offers the best hope for the eradication of this evil in our midst.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should like to repeat that I shall be looking again, before Committee Stage, to further representations on the Bill.  I shall also be considering technical changes in the present draft arising out of the many suggestions made to me by practitioners in the field, including legal personnel.</P>
    <P>I should like to assure Deputies that while the health boards, and their staff, will have their responsibilities and legal powers extended under the Bill there is nothing in the legislation which will diminish the role of the voluntary bodies and the various religious organisations who do such outstanding work in the child care area.  We are very much dependent on them in the Department of Health and we will continue to be.  On many occasions I have commended the contribution of the religious communities in the area of residential care.  I am happy that <Col N="379" /> they have been in the forefront of innovation. I will be happy to have them looking after our deprived children as long as they are in a position to do so and also to have the other voluntary organisations who do excellent work involved.</P>
    <P>The Government are committed to devoting an increasing share of available resources to the child care services in the years ahead.  It may surprise many Deputies to learn that last year I set aside £14 million for expenditure in the child care services under the aegis of the Department of Health.  That represented an increase of £1 million on the 1984 outturn for such services.  I also allocated a sum in excess of £400,000 for entirely new developments in the child care area and that has enabled health boards to support more day care services for children, to improve cash payments for foster parents and to develop after-care services to assist young children who have been in care or to make an easier transition back to an independent life.</P>
    <P>I should like to thank Deputies for their contributions to the Second Stage debate.  I would welcome further observations from Members in writing and I look forward to the Government considering amendments to the Bill.

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="380" /> The purpose of this Bill is to establish formal structures for the preservation of central Government records and to provide for access to such records when they are more than 30 years old.  The Bill also provides for the establishment of a new body, the National Archives.  This body will assume the functions at present discharged by the State Paper Office and Public Record Office and, in addition, will be given a wide range of functions appropriate to a modern archival institution.</P>
    <P>The new institution will be headed by a Director who amongst other things will ensure the preservation, restoration, arrangement and description of archives in the custody of the National Archives and also will have the power to examine and acquire departmental records.  In particular, he will be empowered to inspect the arrangements for the preservation of these records.  The Director will, therefore, have the very positive duty to satisfy himself that Departments are taking proper steps to ensure that their records are adequately preserved.  This is particularly important in relation to the proliferation of computer technology and the stringent environmental conditions which are required for storing data of this type.  This will ensure that departmental records which will eventually become archives will be in the best condition possible when they are actually received by the National Archives.  I should like to add that preliminary steps have already been initiated with a view to the recruitment of a Director of the National Archives.</P>
    <P>The Bill will also establish a new National Archives Advisory Council. The council will advise the Taoiseach on all archival matters and will have a crucial role to play in the initial two years after the commencement of the Act during which most Government Departments will be encountering problems never encountered before in relation to the timely release of departmental records.</P>
    <P>During the Seanad debates, which were very full and led to a number of useful amendments to the Bill, I felt that, in concentrating on specific technical <Col N="381" /> aspects of the Bill, some of the important principles of it were not sufficiently emphasised and I would like to take this opportunity to outline those principles which are essential to the development of a coherent national archival policy and its implementation by the State.</P>
    <P>The fundamental provision in the Bill is the obligation imposed on Departments of State, under section 7, to preserve their records.  This is basic. Provided that records are preserved, freedom exists to make or change or modify policy on other issues such as transfer of records to the National Archives and access to such records by the public.</P>
    <P>I should also like to mention to the House that last year, pending the enactment of the Bill, I instructed that no further records should be destroyed until the opportunity arose for the new Director to examine them because I believe that in the past, unfortunately, many records were lost through destruction without adequate care being exercised to ensure that material of potential historical value should be retained.</P>
    <P>On the issues of the transfer of records to the National Archives and access by the public, I have deliberately created a bias in the Bill towards the release of records rather than their retention in Departments.  Under the provisions of sections 8 and 10, all departmental records must be transferred to the National Archives and made available for public inspection unless, under a rigorous and specific process prescribed in the Bill, specific grounds are shown to apply which would justify their retention.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, I have decided that the power to certify records for retention should be exercised only by departmental officials and even then, every retention certificate under section 8 (4) must have the consent of an authorised officer of my Department.</P>
    <P>The involvement of an officer of my Department, which already has some experience in the orderly release to the State Paper Office of records, will help to ensure that the criteria applied in different Departments will be uniform and <Col N="382" /> that records will not be retained merely because of occasional over-caution on the part of individual departmental officials.</P>
    <P>As a further safeguard, I have, in the course of the debate in the Seanad, included a general power in section 11 under which the Taoiseach can overrule any decision to retain records and direct their transfer to the National Archives to be made available there for public inspection.  The power can be exercised only in a positive fashion &mdash; that is the power is directed only towards the release of records and cannot be exercised to direct the retention of records.</P>
    <P>There are other detailed provisions in the Bill which we will examine on Committee but I am firmly of the view that the specific arrangements which I have just outlined are the key to the success of this Bill and to the establishment of a coherent national archival policy.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes the establishment of a 30 year rule for the release of departmental records and that corresponds with international practice generally.  With the limited exception of Government minutes and associated files, we have not hitherto had arrangements for the general release of departmental records and historians have been largely denied access to this material.  It is long past the time to remove the anomaly whereby historians can gain access to source material about Ireland from the archives of other countries while being denied access to our own records.  That cannot be helpful to the preparation of objective historical studies of our past.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that this Bill has already had a quick and speedy passage through the Seanad although a number of useful amendments were made to it.  I should like to express, unequivocally, my thanks to the Members of that House for their constructive contributions to the Bill.  I wish to assure the House that steps have been taken to ensure the availability of accommodation for the National Archives.  Premises in Rathmines are about to be renovated to provide suitable accommodation in the years ahead pending the construction of a purpose built building at Smithfield which the Office of <Col N="383" /> Public Works are at present fitting into their forward planning.  Space will be available in the Custom House for any material which may be transferred to the National Archives before the premises at Rathmines is fully renovated.  Arrangements will also have to be made to ensure adequate staffing for the National Archives.</P>
    <P>It is appropriate on this occasion to say that down through the years, from the very inception of the State, a number of significant Irish historians have participated in the wider field of Irish political life.  I have in mind our deceased historians such as Alice Stopford Green, Dr. Richard Hayes, a close personal friend of our family, Professor Eoin MacNeill, a member of the first Government and &mdash; happily still alive &mdash; Dr. Edward McLysaght.  In more recent times Dr. Conor Cruise O'Brien and Dr. John A. Murphy have used their very individual historical insights to analyse contemporary problems and were never unwilling to face controversy.  Likewise, the late Donal O'Sullivan, Clerk of the first Seanad, and Dr. Leon O Broin, who still flourishes, have drawn on their wealth of experience as senior administrators to produce major historical studies.  I should like to refer particularly to Professor Emeritus Dudley Edwards who, before his retirement and when he was establishing the UCD archives and since, has never ceased to press me to have this legislation enacted.  I have every confidence that the merits of this Bill will be self-evident to the House and those in the service of the State who will oversee its implementation in the years ahead.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>We welcome this Bill as it is essential for several good reasons which have already been outlined by the Taoiseach.  I have always felt that Irish historians have laboured under a very real disadvantage in regard to the anomaly which existed heretofore whereby historians could gain access to source material about Ireland from the archives of other countries while being denied access to our own records.  In the field of <Col N="384" /> Anglo-Irish relations this has resulted in some distorted comment and historical presentation.  I will leave it at that because I do not want to get into a minefield.  However, the balance needs to be redressed and the very fact that such information has been available from British sources to our historians, commentators and researchers has inevitably placed them under a disability which should not occur.  It is very important that this Bill will enable the balance to be redressed, as I am certain it will, because there is no doubt about the capacity of Irish researchers and historians.  It is just a question of having the balanced source material made available from Irish as well as other sources particularly in regard to the tangled area of Anglo-Irish relations. The need is paramount to get the whole arena of relations between Ireland and Britain into proper focus by having the Irish side of the case and the reasons behind decisions made known to historians for proper analysis and assessment.</P>
      <P>The fundamental provision of the Bill is the obligation imposed on Departments of State under section 7 to preserve their records.  This is fundamental, but the next step is equally important &mdash; the transfer of these records to the National Archives and to make them available to the public.  The creation of the new central National Archives Advisory Council to advise the Taoiseach, who will have the ultimate co-ordinating authority in the whole matter, represents an excellent step forward.  One of the real problems was that there was no central authority available to ensure that departmental records were preserved and transferred to some centre where they could be properly assessed and analysed.</P>
      <P>I agree with another point of view expressed by the Taoiseach when he stated that over the years the real lack has been in the area of departmental records.  Central records have been maintained but records in regard to Government decisions, minutes, agendas and so on are very simplistic in content&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>By tradition we have not given any detailed reasons for decisions within Government minutes and it is a matter which might be looked at in the future as we mature.  I know the reasoning behind this in the early days of independence, but the British have abandoned this kind of reasoning and they have kept far more detailed minutes of Government meetings in Britain for the last 60 years or so.  Our central Government reports in regard to Cabinet decisions are very bare and pared down to the minimum.  It is the reasoning behind decisions based on submissions and information coming from various Ministers and Departments, especially from Ministers as they debate a particular point in Government, which is the real meat in regard to the process whereby decisions are eventually reached.  There should be a greater explanation as to why decisions are made and what points of view were put by different Ministers when arriving at decisions.  I know that is not germane to the Bill but it flows from its general thrust.</P>
      <P>Up to now there has been very minimal recording of Government decisions and there is a wealth of information available within various Government Departments that has never been co-ordinated.  The National Archives Advisory Council represents an ideal vehicle to bring these records together and have available a <i>corpus</i> of information for future researchers and historians.  The obligations placed on Departments in the Bill are important in this respect.  I know from my experience as Minister for Foreign Affairs that that Department has a wealth of such information which has never been properly recorded.  I ventured into the area where the records were kept but I was not pleased because it was very clear that one would have to dig deeply to get minimum information from any source.  I am sure this Department will be the target for the attention of the new Archives Advisory Council as will other Departments.</P>

      <P>Deputy Kelly should not be so cynical.  I want to emphasise that if this Bill is implemented, obliging Government Departments to keep records and compile them in a co-ordinated way and if the necessary staff, facilities and space are made available to do the job, then this Bill is welcome.  Perhaps the central records on Government decision-making might be expanded to include reasons why the Government came to such decisions.  This would be of great help to future historians.  I sometimes look back with regret on decisions which have been made and the reasons are unrecorded. Many Ministers over the years have made contributions to Government, but so far as future historians are concerned there is a blank page on the reasons why certain decisions were made. Now that we are no longer in the revolutionary era which gave rise to the need for these truncated minutes and into a more mature era we should be able to give wider and more expanded information on paper that would be available to future historians.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Everyone in this House and in the historians' profession is glad that this Bill is at last here and I would like to join Deputy Lenihan in welcoming it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This country suffers chronically from a lack of interest in recording things that ought to be recorded.  In my own field of interest, the State's law, if we were to attempt to reconstruct the biography of the judges who sat in the Supreme Court in the twenties and thirties we would be very hard put to do it.  People die, the oldest members of the Bar go, and names which were household words in the legal profession suddenly become mere names <Col N="387" /> and nobody remembers anything about them except for vague recollections of somebody having told a second or thirdhand anecdote.  The same applies to people who were prominent in political life in the early State.</P>
    <P>Obviously, the party leaders and the people near the top of the parties are fairly well documented, but there are reasonably significant people, even at local level, whose biographies would be extremely difficult to establish.  As a nation we are careless about these things. Naturally, we cannot do anything about &mdash; nor does this Bill purport to do anything about &mdash; biographical material but it sets out to do what is in the State's power, namely, to ensure the orderly preservation of official documents which are released to the public on fairly generous criteria within a reasonable time.</P>
    <P>I have some points to make about the Bill which might be described as Committee Stage points, but my experience is that if one waits until Committee Stage to make a point one is less likely to have it heeded that if it is made on Second Stage when the Government will have a chance to decide if they will pay attention to what has been said and perhaps bring forward their own amendment in the meantime.</P>
    <P>I would like to draw attention to the word &ldquo;papers&rdquo; in section 2 (2).  This is in the long list of items which come under the phrase &ldquo;departmental records&rdquo;.  &ldquo;Papers&rdquo; is a word so general that it could be said to comprehend some of the individual items in the list which precedes it.  I wonder if the Taoiseach might feel that the subsection would be better if he added a line or two in brackets after the word &ldquo;papers&rdquo; to make it clear that nothing on a Department's file, even the most informal scrap, is outside the intendment of that word.</P>
    <P>I have occasionally seen very ancient State files, and their content varies between heads of a Bill, a draft Bill and the various stages of a Bill's preparation, but it also includes scraps of paper with notes on them, very often in a hand which is not now possible to identify, but which <Col N="388" /> are full of interest.  They are not formal presentations, formal documents or formal memoranda, but they are full of interest because they show the rivulets by which the stream of Government policy was formed.  Although I know the Taoiseach would agree with this, I wonder if, in order to avoid doubt in the future, he might think it worth extending the word &ldquo;papers&rdquo;, to make it clear that everything on the file comes within the intendment of the word.</P>
    <P>In section 4 (1) (k) which describes the functions of the Director of National Archives, I am very glad to see that one of his functions is the &ldquo;publication of archives, finding aids and other material relating to archives in the custody of the National Archives.&rdquo;  The publication of archives will, in my view, be a very important and interesting part of the National Archives' work.  I am not suggesting a change in the wording of the subsection because I do not see anything wrong with it, but publication should be approached in an adventurous and commercial spirit.  I imagine there are large tracts or categories of material in different Departments &mdash; Finance, Defence, Justice &mdash; which would make a fascinating book, booklet or series.  In my opinion we have here one of the rare instances when the State is sitting on a saleable commodity.  Instead of being ashamed of that, or trying to make sure that the saleable commodity remains unsold, or is sold for less than it costs to produce, I wonder whether the Director of archives will look around to see if there is a role for collaboration with private enterprise in the market-testing and selection of different categories of material which, with a certain amount of risk for the commercial enterprise but also with a commensurate opportunity for profit, could be made commercially available.</P>
    <P>I have a very high regard for the quality of the publications which the Stationery Office and the Government Sales Office have maintained down the years.  Many of their publications are models of what publications, particularly scholarly publications and those of general interest, <Col N="389" /> should be.  I do not know if on balance that branch of the public service makes or loses money, and I do not want to make a guess about it, but it is safe to say that if the private sector were let into this area on appropriate terms &mdash; in the sense that the State would get a royalty or reasonable remuneration &mdash; we would see an expansion in this sector, particularly in view of the availability of this archival material.</P>
    <P>In section 5 and elsewhere in the Bill a function is attributed to the Taoiseach which he is told to exercise after consultation with somebody; in section 5 (3) it is a Minister, and sometimes it is merely the Director who is not even a member of his Government.  When another Bill from the Taoiseach's Department was being debated here in 1950 and was being piloted through the House by Deputy John A. Costello, the then Leader of the Opposition, Mr. de Valera, disapproved the formula that would require a Taoiseach to consult anyone in his Government before doing something.  This was not because Mr. de Valera considered that the Taoiseach should have an absolutely unfettered or unbrindled discretion and should be allowed to do what he liked, but because he felt it was unseemly in legislation to insert a phrase that even hinted at the possibility that the Taoiseach might take an initiative without having previously agreed it with people who are his daily associates.  I think the point has a certain grace and if the Taoiseach wishes I can produce the exact reference for him quickly.  So far as I can recall it was in the context of the Arts Bill, 1950, and I think the then Taoiseach, Deputy Costello, deferred to the point his opponent made.</P>
    <P>In section 7 (4) there are instances where authorisation is provided for the destruction of State or public documents coming under the general heading of records.  Naturally I can accept that the Department have a space problem &mdash; even newspaper offices have space problems and are now beginning to put their own old files on microfilm and sell off the originals.  I know there is a problem and I do not advocate the wholesale retention <Col N="390" /> of departmental files.  However, there is a danger here, and I am sure professional historians would agree with me, that a judgment made in good faith in 1986 as to what is or is not interesting will turn out to be a lamentable misjudgment by 2086, let alone 2186.  The criteria with regard to interest which seem to us evident may change by 180 degrees between now and the next generation, let alone four or five generations from now.</P>
    <P>I must admit I would not find it easy to draft an appropriate subsection to express this point, but I wonder if the Taoiseach would consider whether, if a decision is made to destroy a complete category of records &mdash; for example, material dealing with applications under a long forgotten scheme which has been wound up and which does not seem to be of any great significance &mdash; there could be a provision for retaining a random set of specimens of the material, not going beyond 1 per cent of the material.  That would be interesting.  In the future there may be scholars interested not so much in the history of a scheme as in the governmental or administrative machinery involved.  Even though the individual records and the personalities concerned may be of no interest, the type of document may tell future historians something, and it may give them a message that may not seem of value today.  I think it a pity to destroy completely any category of records, even a category of bus tickets, without maintaining a random set of specimens.  There are two or three parts of the Bill where the destruction of records is envisaged and what I have said now applies to them all.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach spoke about the eventual home of the National Archives.  I am not up to date on the accommodation facilities or problems facing the State but generally I would have thought the State was lumbered with rather old accommodation, some of it old enough to be historically of interest in its own right.  For example, the military personnel in Collins Barracks inhabit in one wing of the barracks, the oldest military barracks in <Col N="391" /> the world still in use.  At least one part of that barracks dates from the 1750s&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The date is 1707.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>That makes my point even stronger, and I am glad to accept that correction.  I understand it is the oldest inhabited military barracks in the world. There will come a time when it will not be usable for those purposes, and when the State will be faced with the problem of whether to conserve it or pull it down. The city of Dublin in other respects is a grotesque disaster and is an absolute disgrace to the councillors who have had the cheek to represent it during the years. They do not mind wearing cocked hats and gowns and swanking around as the governing body of the city, but neither do they mind Dublin turning into an appalling eyesore, a European-sized eyesore. A general principle for the State should be to try to re-use old accommodation rather than to put up new accommodation. I do not know the plans of the Government with regard to Smithfield. It may be that there is accommodation there that deserves refurbishment in its own right but until the State has gone through its list of existing holdings and has decided if old accommodation could be refurbished and given a new lease of life, as in the case of the ground floor of Kilmainham the State should not put up new buildings.</P>
      <P>Before any contracts are drawn up for a new building to house the National Archives I should like to see the situation with regard to the Genealogical Office and Dublin Castle considered and put right.  I should like the State to carry out a review of all State-held property in this decaying and increasingly seedy capital. In that way we might be able to kill two birds with the one stone, namely, housing the National Archives adequately and with dignity, and saving some old public building.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know what happens at the moment with regard to the files of the High Court of private litigation and I do not know what rules apply to their <Col N="392" /> disposition.  If the Taoiseach knows what happens to them I would be interested to hear about it.</P>
    <P>In section 10 there seems to be a piece of slack draftsmanship.  Subsection (5) of that section reads:</P>
    <P>Archives which were formerly departmental records and which have not been available for public inspection for more than 30 years shall be reviewed by an officer of the Department of State concerned authorised for that purpose at least once in every subsequent period of five years with a view to deciding whether or not they should be available for public inspection and shall be dealt with accordingly.</P>
    <P>Will this officer be the one to decide and, if not, who will make the decision?  The expression &ldquo;with a view to deciding&rdquo; leaves the matter too open.  It could be drafted better.</P>
    <P>The last point I wish to make relates to section 18 which deals with the removal of archives.  Essentially, it prohibits their removal except where such action is authorised.  Special provision is made for material &mdash; which is something of a collectors' item &mdash; in respect of records of the Irish Land Commission transferred thereto under the Irish Church Act Amendment Act, 1881.  I do not know what is the reason for that special treatment.  It is right that there should be a prohibition on the unauthorised removal of archives and that such action should be made an offence; but to make that offence a summary one subject to a fine not exceeding £800 is not to do justice to the seriousness of the offence. I am not saying that the matter would be serious in every case, but there is the potential seriousness of any such offence. If, say, someone either for a politically corrupt or other motive disposed of a State document or for commercial reasons chose to steal one which could realise money elsewhere, that would be the basis for what I think ought to be an indictable offence.  I regard £800 as peanuts by way of a maximum penalty. <Col N="393" /> There has to be a modest maximum if summary trial is involved; but I am wondering whether a mere summary offence carrying a maximum fine similar to what one might be fined for poaching a dozen salmon, for instance, is adequate.  If the offence can be punished more severely under some other legislation I should like to hear that.  I am not saying that in every case the maximum penalty would not be severe enough.  That would depend entirely on the circumstances of the case. It would be a matter for the DPP and for the courts; but in the type of very serious case that I have instanced there should be the option of prosecution on indictment and if necessary custodial sentence by way of punishment.</P>
    <P>I wish the Taoiseach and his Department well in regard to this Bill.  I trust it will fulfil the expectations which the historians' profession have voiced.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasMcEllistrimJnr" hpid="Mr. McEllistrim Mr. McEllistrim">

      <P>I welcome the Bill. It is time we introduced a Bill of this kind if we are to ensure the storage of material that will be of much benefit to historians in 30 years' time.  This is a non-contentious Bill and we are happy to support it. We wish the Government well in the establishment of the new facility.</P>
      <P>I note that a director of the section will be appointed but I should like to hear who the Government intend appointing to the national advisory body.  I suggest that in this regard they select people from all walks of life because that would make the body a much better one than if it were confined to certain groups.</P>
      <P>In the past some records have been lost.  That would not have happened if we had had the kind of facility we are talking of here.  I know from my time as Minister of State in charge of the Office of Public Works that the records in that department are very valuable and should be stored.  This is the oldest arm of government.  Likewise, Land Commission records should be preserved for future generations.  Most of us are not likely to be around 30 years from now but we must ensure that our important records will be available then to historians.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="394" /> I am very pleased that the Bill is before us.  During subsequent Stages we will have more to say in regard to it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>Like the other speakers, I welcome this very important piece of legislation.  The degree to which it will be effective will depend mainly on the availability of staff and on the proper means for retaining public records.  The Bill has been welcomed in the Seanad also.</P>
      <P>The only point I wish to make relates to concern expressed by people who live away from Dublin where the main site for public records will be.  Scholars throughout the country experience difficulty during the working week in gaining access to records.  Obviously, they would wish those records to be available to them at weekends and perhaps during late opening hours.  That is why I am wondering whether the National Archives Council would consider the possibility of making available records to scholars who would be coming from the country outside normal working hours.</P>
      <P>I am happy that new ground is being broken by the introduction of this Bill. This is giving the necessary lead to other bodies such as local authorities to put their recording systems in order.  Indeed, in Clare County Council there is a new filming system which will retain a full account of the transactions made by officers over many years.  I believe that technical advances are to the advantage of this National Archives Council and I hope that full advantage will be taken of technology.  The new council should examine the availability of Irish equipment. I welcome the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not delay the passage of this Bill beyond making a few observations.  I am very concerned about the fire precautions for protecting our archives.  I understand that the National Library, where many of our records are kept, is not a very safe place and could very easily be burned down.  What are the precautions like in the State Paper Office and similar offices which will be housing the national archives?  This is a <Col N="395" /> very serious matter.  If we are to appoint an advisory council and pass legislation concerning the timely release of these documents the Bill should ensure that the records are kept in a safe place free from terrorist attack, accidental burning or damage.  I would ask the Minister to assure the House that steps will be taken to ensure the safety of our records, if this has not already been done.</P>
      <P>There is reference in the Bill to the establishment of a 30-year rule for the release of departmental records.  I welcome this provision and the bringing into line of our archive regulations with European regulations in general.  In view of the fact that we have had some rather controversial exchanges in another State with regard to classified documents in recent times I would ask the Minister to outline to the House what is or is not a classified document.  Is an exchange between Ministers a classified document? Is an exchange between secretaries of Departments a classified document?  Is an exchange between a Minister and the secretary of a Department a classified document?  What is the status of an exchange between a Minister and a Member of this House?  What document can or cannot be released within this 30-year rule?  What documents are covered by the Official Secrets Act and what information is or is not readily available to the public without getting into the morass of classified or secret documents which cannot be released within the stated 30-years period?</P>
      <P>I would like to see not just all Cabinet papers made available under the 30-year rule but also all ministerial papers and any private papers held in Ministers' offices related to Ministers' duties.  I hope the Minister responsible will follow up this Bill with a public information Bill, which I understand is being considered by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a very important Bill but there is little point in passing such information if we do not ensure that the rules are enforceable and that the papers are in such safe custody that they cannot be <Col N="396" /> released earlier than the 30 years stated in the Bill, either by undesirable infiltration or damage by fire.  It is timely to consider not just the deliberate destruction of documents but the possibility of accidental destruction.  There is little point in passing this legislation if it is possible for documents to be acquired or interfered with by undesirable persons or accidentally destroyed.  Practical steps must be taken to ensure that the records of the State are protected for posterity.  I welcome the Bill and I hope the Minister will take those observations into account.</P>

      <P>I wish to make a few observations on this Bill.  I commend the purpose of the Bill in providing for the amalgamation of the Public Record Office and the State Paper Office to form a single administrative entity under the title &ldquo;National Archives&rdquo;.  I might ask the Minister to look beyond that to the situation which prevails around the country and see if it is possible to develop a national policy on the preservation of those parts of our archives which are worth retaining.  In Limerick the Regional Development Organisation under the regional archivist, Dr. Chris O'Mahony, have done tremendous work during a few years.  He is now dealing with records of some of the people who emigrated from Clare to Australia in the last century and has unearthed an absolute wealth of information.  Other very important work has been done.  While looking through a solicitor's office for old records and archives &mdash; Mr. David Fitzgerald's office in O'Connell Street in Limerick &mdash; he unearthed about two years ago a will belonging to a member of the Arthur family dating back to 1650. The Arthurs, be it remembered, provided 46 mayors over about five centuries to Limerick city, the oldest city in the country.  I am glad to inject that point into the dispute between Dublin and Cork about which is the senior of the two. We sent four Danish bishops to Canterbury before Dublin or Armagh got themselves sorted out and we were the ecclesiastical and political capital for this <Col N="397" /> country 1,000 years ago.  The records show that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankPrendergast" hpid="Mr. Prendergast Mr. Prendergast">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Prendergast</NameTxt>
      <P>The records go back to Lanfrance in the 11th century.  I commend the Minister on his welcome refreshing insight into that aspect of our lives.  We are at something of a disadvantage <i>vis-à-vis</i> Britain where they have an unbroken sequence of records preserved over 800 or 900 years.  We do not have that and never had a very great consciousness of it as a people.  Lately the importance of preserving records has become increasingly recognised.  It is supremely important especially since people in such places as Australia and America etc., are seeking the origins of their ancestors. People of Irish extraction in Australia are anxious to establish their descent as being distinct from those who were sent to Australia from the prisons of Britain. People who were sent there from Ireland were for the most part political activists rather than criminals as was the case with those transported from England.</P>
      <P>I am glad to say that my third cousins contacted me about five years ago about our mutual great, great grandfathers who had emigrated from Kilrush in County Clare, and who settled in Otago in New Zealand.  After 150 years we managed to establish contact; we have established our family connections and are now in regular contact.  That is the kind of thing that is going on in very many other situations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is badly needed is a proper national policy in this regard.  I suppose we must get the scene right in Dublin at the beginning and work our way around the country.  Unfortunately, much of the work being done around the country is being undertaken by enthusiasts.  Enthusiasts are notoriously selfish in these matters, in an understandable sense, in that they hoard these things.  They tend to think, &ldquo;I will do what I wish with my own books.&rdquo;  They are loath to share that kind of material with anybody else.  In your county, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, Tipperary, as I understand it, there are four different sets of records, all of which are <Col N="398" /> valuable at present, but they will not be released to anybody else.  The whole purpose of archives is to make more knowledge available.  In the mid-west the RDO in Limerick were the first of their kind to appoint a regional archivist, Dr. Chris O'Mahony.  I know there is one in Cork but I am talking in an RDO or regional context.  I would urge the Minister and the Government to ascertain whether it is possible to appoint that kind of person in each region.</P>
    <P>To bolster that argument I remember the centenary celebrations of the Fenian Rising in 1967 when Seán Lemass, the then Taoiseach commented on the celebrations taking place.  He made a rather startling comment, I thought, at that time, saying that many of the records belonging to the old RIC stations were still in position, that their contents could not be disclosed to the public because there were informers or people giving information at that time &mdash; up to recently at any rate.  Because we were a relatively static society, the descendants of those people remained in the areas where their great, great grandparents had lived in 1867 and the records could not be made public.  Those records are lying around.  I have seen some myself.  I came across some about two years ago.  They are housed in old RIC stations.  There is a need for some central or regional control, a system to record and to preserve for posterity that exceedingly valuable information.</P>
    <P>There is another wealth of social history locked up in the trade unions and their general offices.  I speak as a former president of the Limerick Trades Council, in the Mechanics Institute, which was founded in the year 1810, half-way between the anti-combine laws introduced by the British Government in 1799 to 1824, where there is a wealth of information. In my trade, to which I served my time, and my people for generations before me, I know there are documents dating back two centuries which give magnificent insights into the social conditions that prevailed in the Ireland of those times.  We had the foresight to hand those over to University College, Dublin, in <Col N="399" /> College Green, to their archives, for retention.</P>
    <P>I cannot commend the Minister sufficiently because I know his sympathies and affinities in this area.  When we get the national situation cleared, as part of a follow-up to this Bill we should institute a national policy for archives, putting in competent, qualified, professional people in each region.  Hopefully they would be given access to such material by the enthusiasts to whom I referred earlier.  As a people we are indebted to the enthusiasts because we would have nothing had they not minded this material and carefully preserved it.  We could appeal to these people to let the State and future generations have the benefit of their research, diligence and industry, when students and everybody in education would benefit.  What is at present being done will provide cap and gowns for future generations.</P>
    <P>I strongly commend the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend the Bill and I should like to encourage its speedy passage.  I hope there will be sufficient staff and funding made available to render its provisions effective.  Probably that constitutes the biggest problem being encountered at present, that when the Bill is passed there will not be accommodation, staff or funding available to render its provisions effective.  We lag so far behind other countries we have an awful lot of leeway to make up.  There are masses of material which have been could be made available but which may be left lying in various places.  The legislation would have no effect had we not the staff to handle this material.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the Taoiseach said in the Seanad that there was accommodation available. I am not sure if he has since disclosed where that accommodation is.  Perhaps he would tell us if some building has been located which would be suitable for this purpose.  The Taoiseach should tell us what building he has in mind.  Possibly <Col N="400" /> Rathfarnham Castle would serve this purpose.  I believe a suitable use is being sought for that building which I am sure would provide ample accommodation.</P>
    <P>I might make a few points on the provisions of the Bill which possibly may be dealt with on Committee Stage.  Some of its provisions carry restrictions which need to be teased out with regard to their necessity, for example, the authority given Ministers and Departments to prevent the Director gaining access to material or moving material from Departments.  Such restrictions will have to be examined.</P>
    <P>There were a number of amendments effected in the course of the Seanad debate.  One restriction that could cover almost everything and was not altered was that on material which it is contended would be contrary to the public interest. That phrase could cover almost everything. Every individual could interpret something that in his view would be contrary to the public interest.  It is too loose a phrase and covers too much material. Indeed, it involves too many personal decisions on what is contrary to the public interest.  It is necessary to define precisely what is meant by the phrase &ldquo;contrary to the public interest&rdquo;, or how contrary can it be to the public interest.  The phrase warrants definition in order that it would cover only material which directly threatened or seriously damaged the public interest.  The Minister would need to explain precisely what he meant so that it could not be interpreted to mean something which would not be of a serious nature, that it would have to be something of a serious nature before it could be declared to be against the public interest.</P>
    <P>A Minister can say that the material is relevant to his Department and is still needed in the Department and therefore he will not hand it over to the director. That is perfectly logical, but in some cases the material might be over 30 years old but would still be in use in the Companies Registration Office etc. or even in other areas.  For instance, the Department of Agriculture have been dealing with disease eradication Bills for the past 20 years and we can be quite sure they will be <Col N="401" /> dealing with this matter for another ten. They can be over the 30 year limit and still need the material in the Department. It is all right to have such a provision in the Bill that, even though the material is over 30 years old, the Minister may feel it is still relevant in his Department and should be retained and not handed over. However, there is a danger that Ministers could use that provision for almost anything. If they are reluctant to hand over material they can say that it is still relevant and of use.  Therefore, the Bill should provide that where that is the case, and the Minister is making the case that it is still in use in the Department and is not making the case that it is against the public interest, then the Director should still have access to it for copying, photographing, microfilming or whatever is necessary.  It can still be retained in the Department but it is under the director's care and in the director's archives on the basis that he is leaving it in the Department for the use of the Department.  That should be included in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Generally speaking, there is a need for a freedom of information Act along with this Bill because we are very restricted in the area of freedom of information.  Some of it can be got by parliamentary questions; a great deal of it cannot be got by parliamentary questions, particularly in the semi-State area where Ministers say they cannot take responsibility for the day to day affairs of semi-State bodies etc.  Therefore, information in this area is not available to anyone, even to Deputies in this House.  A freedom of information Act would be essential to allow for this and to allow for much more information to be obtained than is obtainable at present.</P>
    <P>In that regard I feel that the restrictions in this Bill on material which is to be made available to the Director are considerable. Therefore, if the Bill is passed with those restrictions, I see no reason why a shorter period should not be available for some of the material.  In other words, material should be classified. Some material could be made available freely after four or five years, <Col N="402" /> or certainly ten years, if it is no longer of interest or use.  We could have a classification of materials that would be available after ten years, 20 years, or a maximum of 30 years.  A great deal more information could be made available as quickly as possible to historians, social historians, writers, journalists or groups interested in, for instance, local history.  Material could be made available to them if it is not still needed, is not contrary to the public interest or is not barred by the Minister for reasons that are even personal, and a Minister can do that. Material that embarrasses nobody, is no problem to anybody but could be very useful to different groups of society should be classified so that we could say, for example, that this is suitable for release after ten years, that after 20 years and the other after 30 years.  I hope on Committee Stage to have amendments to the Bill on these lines.</P>
    <P>I hope that the Minister will urge the Minister for the Public Service and the Minister for Finance to ensure that the disgraceful position in which we are in in relation to our staff and archivists will be corrected.  It is an absolute disgrace that we have about one-third of the numbers that Northern Ireland have in total staff with possibly three times the amount of material to deal with.  I hope that the Minister will not be backward in pressing the Minister for the Public Service for adequate staff, accommodation and so on.</P>

      <P>I thank very much Members of the House on both sides for the unqualified welcome given to this Bill and the great enthusiasm with which it has been received here.  A Cheann Comhairle, you will accept that this is a welcome oasis in the ordinary necessary cut and thrust of political matters across the House.  Let me say that everything said will be considered carefully because this Bill is not one of a party matter.  All sides and all individuals in the House are trying to get the best possible Bill on the ground and to cover all possible contingencies that are brought up. <Col N="403" /> In that respect the Seanad debate has proved very successful and important amendments have been introduced arising out of the contributions of Senators, and without a doubt it is a better Bill as a result of that.  The same will apply to recommendations made in this House.</P>
      <P>The overall purpose of the Bill is to institute arrangements for the proper management and disposition of a vast body of records generated by Government Departments.  Now, generally speaking, departmental records, except for a limited amount of Cabinet material, are not available at the moment to scholars. The Bill marks a major fresh approach to the manner in which we treat our very valuable archival material and provides a current framework within which comprehensive and accountable arrangements can be made.  Once it comes on stream it will generate a frenzy of very important work and a new insight into many of the areas which have been the subject of necessarily only sketchy and sometimes ill-informed comment because of the lack of records, and will throw a new light on many things that have been of interest over the past years.</P>
      <P>The main purpose of the Bill is the preservation of records.  A number of Deputies here mentioned the question of disposal of records.  Not all records can or need to be kept, but their disposal must receive careful attention.  It is important that the reasons for which records are selected for destruction and the procedures by which this is carried out are recorded properly and follow efficient, widely known processes.  In this regard the Bill provides that no records can be destroyed unless the Director of the National Archives is satisfied that they have no archival value.  Deputy Kelly made an interesting point about the possible retention of a random selection, so to speak, of some documents which are selected for destruction.  This would be more a point for regulations because it involves specific detailed arrangements. However, there are some possibilities here that can be considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Concern has been expressed during <Col N="404" /> this debate and in the Seanad that in operating the mechanisms of the Bill there might be an excessive degree of caution on the part of the civil servants charged with this responsibility.  Civil servants traditionally are supposed to be of a conservative nature but, mind you, I have met many who would not exactly fall into that mould.  Nevertheless that is a general opinion expressed as regards the body of civil servants.  A specific provision was inserted in the Bill during the Seanad proceedings to enable the Taoiseach to overrule a decision made at official level to retain records on whatever grounds.  That is not a provision by which he can order certain records to be retained, but one allowing him to overrule a decision on retention to direct that the records can be made available.  This is a very valuable provision.</P>
    <P>The specific grounds on which departmental records can be retained under the Bill have also been discussed by Deputy Mac Giolla and several other Deputies, including Deputy Gay Mitchell.  I believe that the provision of section 8 (4) strikes a reasonable balance between the need to retain genuinely sensitive records and the desire to make as much material as possible available to the archives.  The overall purpose and spirit behind this Bill is to make everything possible available.</P>
    <P>The grounds for retention relating to the public interest would comprehend sensitive security and other records affecting, for example, relations with friendly Governments.  The definition, for example, would not comprehend records which might give rise to party political embarrassment.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of breach of statutory duty where certain records were required by law to be kept confidential. There is also the matter of a breach of good faith, which relates to material originally supplied in confidence or the release of which could cause distress or danger.  Examples would be where private citizens' personal affairs, for instance, or matter relating to members of the security forces were concerned. Deputy Gay Mitchell had other points to make but these dealt more with current <Col N="405" /> records which might at present be very sensitive but would not be sensitive in 30 years' time.</P>
    <P>I think it was Deputy Mac Giolla who introduced the point about whether the time limit should be 30 years or should be on a phased basis for release of some material perhaps in five years, others in ten years, and so on.  That would be extremely difficult to operate.  Unless there is a reasonable period defined, it could inhibit public servants and Department officials in giving advice freely if there were a possibility that the material might be made public at an early date.  We are dealing here with a 30 year period which is generally accepted by other countries much more active in the archival area in making their records available to scholars.  This is internationally accepted for the release of these records.  I would emphasise again that the overall purpose that was enthuasastically conceived by the Taoiseach, being an area in which he has a great personal interest, is to make as much material as possible available.  I know of the difficulties mentioned by Deputy Mac Giolla and look forward to seeing the various amendments which he will be producing in this area.</P>
    <P>As the Taoiseach indicated in opening, the basic provision is section 7 which requires the preservation of departmental records.  When we have acted to ensure that no departmental records are needlessly destroyed, so we have the freedom to make whatever arrangements best suit from time to time for their release to the national archives and to the general public.  It is very regrettable, as has been mentioned by many speakers here and in the Seanad, that such a very important area of public administration as the preservation and management of our public archives should have been neglected for so many years.  Deputy Lenihan alluded to this fact.  The process of neglect, which has been the responsibility of all Governments since the foundation of the State, is now being halted and reversed.  With the acquisition of departmental records on the scale envisaged by the Bill, the National Archives <Col N="406" /> will become a major State institution and this, in turn, will attract many more donations of privately held records and archives.  That is what is beginning to happen again with the National Museum. When public attention is drawn to a particular collection in the case of the National Museum or to archives in this case that tends to attract further very valuable material.</P>
    <P>Of course, we must have appropriate accommodation.  As the Taoiseach explained, the intention is to have a purpose-built building in Smithfield.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>In Smithfield, Deputy Kelly mentioned earlier the possibility of using some of our existing buildings which might be suitably converted as headquarters for the archives and we have carried out an inspection of many buildings throughout the city with a possible view to use as permanent headquarters. I think it might be possible to get a very good headquarters for the National Archives and at the same time preserve a very valuable or beautiful building of architectural importance. Many such buildings were inspected including churches and all sorts of buildings, but the final thinking was that the best procedure would be to have a purpose-built building.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Mitchell also mentioned, there is the importance of ensuring preservation from another aspect, that is that there is not a fire hazard and that the best preservation and conservation conditions attach to such a building.  The wisest course is to have a purpose-built building. In the meantime arrangements have been made for an existing Office of Public Works building in Rathmines to be used and, pending the preparation of this building as temporary headquarters, accommodation is being made or will be made available in the Custom House. The two year &ldquo;run-in&rdquo; period available to us for the disgorging of the vast amount of archives will give us a little liberty in this area and I hope we shall be able to handle the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="407" /> As far as staffing is concerned, the Taoiseach during the Seanad debate gave an undertaking that there would be adequate staffing.  I accept the constraints that are there at present, but every effort will be made in this respect.</P>
    <P>Deputy Carey mentioned the very real difficulty which exists &mdash; as Deputy McEllistrim will know, living in a country area &mdash; of coming to Dublin to pursue archival studies whether as a hobby or on a profesional basis.  People engaged in such studies find it extraordinarily difficult to get up to Dublin during the week.  Consideration will be given to what Deputy Carey said about keeping the archives open during weekends to facilitate scholars. We must try to make such arrangements if at all possible.  It is very important for people who are busy during the week and who are unable to do research during working hours.  We must keep this in mind.  The Taoiseach has acknowledged that we must provide adequate staff and this will be discussed with the new Director of the National Archives.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lenihan referred to the manner in which Government proceedings are reported.  He said that at the moment the minutes are very brief, and anyone reading those minutes will appreciate the truth of that.  However, in many cases they are backed up by Government memoranda which give some of the thinking by various Cabinet members before decisions are taken.  I agree it would be interesting to have a report of the arguments that go on around the Cabinet table.  That is outside the scope of this Bill but I have no doubt it will receive consideration.  In other countries they record more than the precise decisions of Governments.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell made a very important point in regard to preservation of archives.  That will be a priority.  Deputy Prendergast showed interest in the records, kept in the Public Record Office and the State Paper Office, which embody 30,000 names of people who went from here to Australia.  I have an idea that these should be computerised. We might get some work done on that in <Col N="408" /> connection with the bicentennial celebrations in Australia in 1988.  Further material will be coming in in that respect and it should be of great interest to scholars.</P>
    <P>This Bill will go a long way to awakening appreciation of our history.  The facts cannot be altered, but public perception of them can be.  The Bill is worth while from that point of view alone.  I thank all the Deputies who contributed for their useful contributions.</P>

      <P>That the Joint Committee on Co-operation with Developing Countries shall be empowered to take evidence in public and to include with any report which it may make minutes of such evidence.</P>
      <P>The House will be aware that the existing order in regard to the terms of reference imposes a serious impediment to the full and fruitful execution of the committee's labours &mdash; we are talking about giving powers to the committee to take evidence in public.  Consequently, the joint committee are unable effectively to carry on their very useful work.  As Minister concerned with international co-operation matters, I am concerned, naturally, that the committee should be facilitated in this respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am delighted to see that the work of the committee so far has borne fruit. Their work has been outstanding and their recommendations have been on an all-party basis.  The committee's activities have contributed to a much greater understanding of the issues.  I have considered carefully the committee's proposals to end the existing order of reference <Col N="409" /> so that they will have greater powers in regard to public evidence and the reporting thereof.

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been critical of the proliferation of committees in recent years.  I believe some of them are not working effectively, but I am glad to say the committee now being discussed fill a gap because we did not have a body with a bi-partisan approach to the development needs of disadvantaged countries.  Purely for home consumption, in the past the matter of co-operation between developing countries has been thought of in mercenary terms.  This issue is too big and too wide to be dealt with in that way, although there are strict economic advantages flowing from this sort of co-operation through the contacts established between donor and recipient countries: the donor country can get itself involved in projects, all of which are excellent from the economic point of view.  However, the primary motivation must be wider and more idealistic.  It is very important that all parties should be brought together in a committee such as this.</P>
      <P>I am very glad that, mainly through the great efforts of the Minister, this committee are working effectively.  Now that we have all Oireachtas parties working together on this committee we must do our utmost to get general public awareness of the problems facing developing countries, of the importance of aid and co-operation between countries. Recently we saw how Bob Geldof was able to trap the interest of a world audience in the huge regions and populations where circumstances are so shocking but the world in general did not have knowledge of their enormity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, it is most important that there should be public awareness here of this.  We fully support the thinking behind the Minister's purpose to extend the terms of reference of the committee.  If their hearings of evidence and submissions are held in public the people of <Col N="410" /> the country will appreciate the terrible problems of developing countries.  The public should know that it is not a matter of giving aid <i>per se</i>, that there are priorities, different ways of giving aid and of promoting co-operation, different regions that require aid.</P>
    <P>A number of decisions based on priority assessment must be made.  The most important one is the type of aid to be given.  I have always felt that the advice area is most helpful particularly from a country such as Ireland that does not have the financial resources to give to developing countries.  We have the expertise and technical know how particularly in regard to agriculture.  Traditionally we have co-operated in the area of teaching but we must now consider aid in the area of agriculture particularly in view of the fact that newly emerging countries in Africa are falling down in a disastrous way in agriculture.  One of the great tragedies of newly emerging countries in the Third World is that they have opted for rapid industrialisation to the neglect of their agricultural potential. Such development depends on expertise in basic matters such as drainage, irrigation, seeding, fencing, methods of husbandry, cultivation, breeding policies and so on.  In the whole area of agriculture we have an enormous amount of information and the personnel available to help those developing countries.  We welcome the motion and we agree with the thrust of the Minister's comments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the extension of the terms of reference announced by the Minister of State.  This will help to highlight the problem of hunger that exists in developing countries.  I do not think it has been possible to publicise the scale of the problem through our Parliament up to now.  Voluntary bodies and individuals have been ahead of the Parliament in highlighting the scandalous problem that exists only a plane journey from our country.  This move is welcome given the recent obscenity of the announcement of more imports of beef to the EC while there are huge mountains of <Col N="411" /> beef in intervention.  At the same time vast numbers of children with distended stomachs and bulging eyes go without food in other parts of the world.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the commitment of the Minister of State to developing countries. It is good that he has come to the House to extend the terms of reference of the committee.  I would like to see from that committee pressure on the Executive of the day on an all-party basis to meet UN aid targets for developing countries.  We have fallen far behind in our target and even the initial target set in the Programme for Government between Fine Gael and Labour was revised downwards in the policy document, <i>Building On Reality</i>.  That is sad, given the public support there is for aid to the Third World.</P>
      <P>I hope that at some stage the Minister of State will find it possible to create a full-scale foreign affairs committee of the House because some of the issues to be considered by the joint committee under discussion have wider implications in other areas of foreign policy.  If we do not take an interest in developing countries for altruistic reasons it would serve us well to take an interest in them for selfish reasons.  We must remember that as those countries develop they have the option of either becoming open liberal type democracies such as ours or Marxist type regimes.  The pressure is on a lot of them to opt for the rigid control which Marxist regimes bring.  That is a terrible pity because from the beginning countries should be encouraged to develop along parliamentary lines.  We have an interest in seeing the world develop in a democratic way and for selfish reasons we have an interest in ensuring the well-being of the inhabitants of developing countries.  I support the motion and look forward to the public hearings of the committee.</P>

      <P>I should like to thank Members for their comments.  As Deputy Lenihan pointed out, my approach is that there should <Col N="412" /> be all-party consensus on development matters in the Oireachtas.  That was one of my objectives when I proposed the establishment of a Joint Oireachtas committee. We are also <i>ad idem</i> on what should be our primary motivation for involving ourselves in assistance to Third World countries.  Clearly that motivation must be humanitarian and idealistic but it is proper to point out that there are economic benefits and spin-offs.  In fact, those benefits are far greater than many people realise.  I am not one of those who say that we should shun such spin-offs, quite the contrary, provided we still retain the essential primary motivation for involvement as being humanitarian and idealistic.</P>
      <P>It is important that the efforts which have improved over the years are maintained and improved further in the years ahead.  In that regard the point made by Deputy Mitchell is on the button.  In the years ahead, whatever Executive is in power, I can see the Joint Oireachtas Committee having a role to play.</P>
      <P>The House will be aware that development co-operation has two main focuses, on relief and development.  The relief aspect captures public attention most dramatically.  The House, and the public, are aware of the grim spectre of famine stalking the lands of Africa last year.  I would like to be in a position to report to the House that the position will be better in 1986 but already there are assessments from Ethiopia, the Sudan, Somalia and other countries that there could be a repetition. At official level, and on the part of the public, I will be seeking the same generous response as that given to the crisis which developed in Africa last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The area of activity which has a lower public profile but from the point of view of a long term solution is at least as important, is the development aspect. Essentially, we have to aim to help those countries to become self-sufficient.  Ultimately, that is the solution to the problem.  It is in that context that the development aspect of our programmes is of such great relevance.  As Deputy Lenihan pointed out, there is a major concentration in the official effort on <Col N="413" /> technical assistance and I envisage that emphasis continuing.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell mentioned the question of the UN target and I am glad to say that from a very low base progress has been made, continues to be made and, I hope, will continue in the years ahead.  It is relevant to point out that in 1974, when the bilateral aid programme was first established, the entire development assistance funding at official level was £1.5 million.  When I first came into office in 1981 the figure was £18 million. Under the national plan the figure this year will be in the order of £44 million and it is proposed to increase it to £50 million in 1987.  While we must continue to seek to make progress in monetary terms and in relation to the percentage of GNP, we should realise that the last decade has shown an improvement and an increase virtually every year.</P>
    <P>I am glad that this motion has received the support of all parties.  I reiterate my compliments to the committee under the capable chairmanship of Deputy Nora Owen and I hope it will continue to make as effective a contribution in future under its expanded terms of reference.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Kavanagh) Liam Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Kavanagh)</NameTxt>
      <P>At the stage I moved the adjournment on Tuesday, 3 December last, I had indicated the general objectives of the Bill and the changes it proposes in the area of local authority housing.  I have circulated the full text of my speech of 3 December plus its continuation which I intend to deliver now so that Deputies will not lack any information.  I had also given some of the background to the measures in the Bill dealing with the homeless and had dealt with section 2, which defines essentially any homeless persons for the purposes of the Bill.  The housing needs of homeless <Col N="414" /> persons will be given greater recognition through the new statutory framework for the local authority housing programme proposed in the Bill and outlined by me in some detail on 3 December.  This can be illustrated clearly by reference firstly to section 8 of the Bill dealing with overall housing requirements, including both private and local authority, and sections 9, 11, 17 and 24, dealing more specifically with the local authority housing programme.</P>
      <P>Under section 8 a housing authority will include homeless persons in the estimates of the housing requirements of their area.  Similarly, the annual assessment of the need for local authority housing will pay particular regard to the needs of homeless persons.  In addition, in order that homeless persons who may not have applied for housing might be brought to attention, housing authorities will be required to give advance notice of the making of the assessment to adjoining housing authorities, health boards, and to other bodies providing accommodation, shelter, or welfare in the area.</P>
      <P>Section 11 deals with schemes of letting priorities and provides that a housing authority may determine to set aside a particular number or proportion of dwellings for a particular category of need such as homeless persons.  Housing authorities will be required under section 17 to maintain reasonable balance in their house construction programmes to cater for the various identified categories of need, again specifically including the homeless.  The provision in section 24 for the payment of housing subsidy include the payment of subsidy in respect of hostel accommodation.  Heretofore, housing subsidy was not available for hostels but only for the provision of houses for renting.  The provision of hostel accommodation by some of the larger urban authorities, in particular, may well be an appropriate response to the housing needs of some homeless persons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 10 sets out the new responsibility and the additional powers of housing authorities in regard to homelessness. Housing authorities are being given a <Col N="415" /> statutory duty to take such steps as they consider appropriate to ensure that suitable accommodation is made available for any homeless person who is capable of living independently in a dwelling and unable to provide accommodation from his own resources.  To meet this obligation housing authorities will, of course, under their existing powers be able to provide accommodation from their own rented housing stock.  However, a housing authority may not always have vacant accommodation readily available to meet the urgent needs of a homeless person or the provision of a local authority dwelling may not in all cases be the best response to the particular circumstances of a homeless person.</P>
    <P>Section 10 (2) provides local authorities with a range of possible options additional to their existing powers in order to provide a flexible and appropriate response to the needs of each homeless person.  Local authorities will be enabled to make arrangements with voluntary bodies for the making available of accommodation for homeless persons.  This will, of course, involve the authority in contributing towards the cost in addition to any assistance which the authority might make available to that body under section 5 of the Bill for the actual provision of the accommodation.</P>
    <P>In this context I would also like to refer to the significant improvements which I announced during the course of the Adjournment Debate on 19 December last to the scheme for the provision by voluntary bodies of accommodation for certain categories of persons, including the homeless.  The maximum fully subsidised loan of £16,000 per unit of accommodation which has applied since the scheme was introduced in March 1984 has been increased to £20,000 with effect from 1 December 1985.  This is effectively a £20,000 grant per unit of accommodation provided by a voluntary body under the scheme.</P>
    <P>In addition, where a voluntary body raises the necessary finance by borrowing from sources other than the Local Loans Fund they will qualify for the loan <Col N="416" /> charge subsidy on the same general terms and conditions.  While a number of voluntary bodies have provided accommodation for elderly persons under the scheme, I would like to see more voluntary bodies bringing forward projects to assist homeless persons.  I hope that the revised terms will assist this objective.</P>
    <P>Section 10 also provides for the giving by a housing authority of financial assistance to a homeless person which in particular circumstances could be the more appropriate way of ensuring that the person can secure accommodation.  Finally, as a last resort, the authority may arrange lodgings or contribute to the cost of such accommodation or lodgings.</P>
    <P>Local authorities will be recouped 80 per cent of the expenditure incurred by them in securing accommodation for a homeless person other than in their rented housing stock or in assisting a homeless person financially.  If a housing authority provides a homeless person with a local authority dwelling the normal 100 per cent loan charge subsidy applies.</P>
    <P>These new provisions, taken together with the changes to the local authority housing system contained in the Bill, provide an integrated and effective response to the problem of homelessness in our society.  I should emphasise that the additional responsibility being given to local authorities is to make accommodation available for a homeless person using as appropriate the powers available to them.  These powers do not give to homeless persons a superior right to local authority housing over and above that of other persons in need of housing.  The tenancy of local authority houses will continue to be allocated as heretofore in accordance with approved schemes of letting priorities having regard to the relative needs of the applicants.</P>
    <P>It is my earnest hope and belief that the provisions of this Bill represent a major advance in the position of the homeless and should contribute significantly to the elimination of involuntary homelessness in this country.  At the same time, the approach taken in the Bill avoids upsetting well established policies of ensuring that local authority housing <Col N="417" /> is allocated to those whose needs are most acute in accordance with recognised criteria.  One of the most significant features of the Bill is, I feel, the recognition given to the fact that the best way that local authorities will be able to discharge their duties to the homeless under section 10 may involve formal and ongoing co-operation with voluntary housing groups. Voluntary bodies can often respond to situations more speedily and more flexibly than a statutory agency.  In addition, it must be recognised that a voluntary body can often deliver a more supportive and personal type of care, than a housing authority could.  However, I must emphasise that the duty to secure accommodation for homeless persons will be that of the housing authority and not, as it is sometimes now regarded, a responsibility of the voluntary housing sector.</P>
    <P>It will only be through the mutual co-operation of the housing authorities, health boards and voluntary housing groups that the problem of the homeless will be solved.  In particular, it will be to the mutual advantage of voluntary housing groups and the housing authorities to establish good working relations.  Housing authorities should encourage, foster and promote the development of an active voluntary housing sector in their areas in order that they might better discharge their duties under section 10 and to improve the range and type of housing accommodation available to those who cannot secure adequate housing from their own resources.</P>
    <P>There are a number of provisions in the Bill designed to improve the living conditions of travellers.  Section 6 provides statutory authority for the recoupment by the Minister to local authorities of the salaries and expenses incurred by them in the employment of social workers in connection with the accommodation of travellers.  Section 13 deals with the provision of residential caravan sites and facilities for them.  Under section 9 housing authorities must have regard to the housing needs of travellers in their annual assessments.</P>
    <P>The provision concerning the travellers <Col N="418" /> which has evoked most controversy is the proposed amendment of the City and County Management (Amendment) Act, 1955, contained in section 26.  This amendment would enable a manager to undertake works which he regarded as urgent and necessary to provide a reasonable standard of accommodation for any person.  It would be all too easy to retain the status quo in this area but this would not alleviate to any significant extent the appalling living conditions suffered by many traveller families which must be our primary concern.  Following a thorough and comprehensive review of all aspects of the serious and sometimes intractable problem of the settlement of travelling people, the Government announced on 20 July 1984 a range of measures designed to alleviate their plight.</P>
    <P>This statement recognised that the provision of accommodation was a critical element in the provision of services for travellers and indicated the Government's determination to ensure that the accommodation programme is stepped up rapidly.  The provisions in the Bill to which I have referred, give a statutory basis for doing this.  Subsequent to the issue of the Government statement, I issued a detailed circular letter to housing authorities drawing their attention to suggestions about the approach to the housing of travellers which were recommended by the Travelling People Review Body.  In the meantime a special monitoring committee have been set up under the aegis of the Minister for Health to review progress not just in relation to accommodation needs but also of services such as health, welfare, education and so on, for which other Ministers are responsible.  I am very pleased that the monitoring committee in their initial report have welcomed the provisions in the Bill and regard them as being of importance to travellers.</P>
    <P>Section 3 provides a statutory basis for the mortgage subsidy scheme.  The amount of the subsidy, currently a total of £3,000 payable in annual instalments over five years, may be specified and <Col N="419" /> varied by regulations.  While the mortgage subsidy is normally payable in respect of new houses, it is also paid to persons availing of the £5,000 grant scheme who buy an existing house.  The subsidy may also be paid to a person acquiring a new house who was previously an owner occupier but who is in need of housing following marriage breakdown.  The conditions are the same as those set out in section 22 under which the new house grant may be paid following marriage breakdown, that is, the applicant must be legally separated, in need of housing and refusal to pay the grant would cause hardship to the applicant or his or her dependants.</P>
    <P>With comparatively high real interest rates there is a continuing need for the mortgage subsidy scheme and this has been explicitly recognised by the Government in the rejection of the National Planning Board's recommendation that the new house grant and mortgage subsidy schemes should be abolished.  As was clearly stated in paragraph 5.78 of the national plan the Government regard the new house grant and mortgage subsidy as indispensable incentives to private housing which also reduce pressures on local authority housing.</P>
    <P>Section 5 of the Bill extends significantly the existing powers of a local authority to assist an approved voluntary housing body by a loan, loan guarantee, periodic contribution, grant, subsidy or a contribution in kind.  In certain circumstances assistance given by a housing authority may be recouped by the Minister. This section provides the statutory basis for the scheme of loans and 100 per cent loan charge subsidy up to certain limits which was introduced by the Government in March 1984.  I outlined earlier the recent improvements made to this scheme, in particular increasing from £16,000 to £20,000 the maximum fully subsidised loan for each unit of accommodation. I hope that the revised terms will enable more voluntary housing groups to bring forward schemes for the provision of houses, particularly for the <Col N="420" /> homeless, but also for the other categories of housing need including the elderly. Section 23 deals with the payment of capital grants in the case of accommodation provided for disabled persons, deserted wives, single parent families and families on local authority waiting lists under the voluntary housing scheme which was superseded by the March 1984 scheme.</P>
    <P>Local authorities are obliged under section 13 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1979, to put houses being sold to tenants into good structural condition where they are not already in such condition.  Where a house is not in good structural condition section 20 provides that the local authority and the purchaser may enter into an agreement for a reduction in the house price sufficient to cover the cost of the works required.  This should help eliminate delays in the sale of local authority houses which can occur where there is a backlog of pre-sale structural repairs to be carried out.</P>
    <P>In addition, there are a number of largely technical sections contained in the Bill which I have not addressed specifically so far.  I shall now mention these briefly.  Section 7 validates payments made before the enactment of this Bill if these payments would have been valid after its enactment.  Section 14 removes a doubt about the security for mortgage loans of a title based on a transfer order where houses bought by tenant purchasers are subsequently sold.  Section 15 extends to mortgages advanced by other lending agencies the simplified system for the discharge of fully paid mortgages which has heretofore applied to building society mortgages.  Section 16 extends certain technical provisions regarding the payment or withholding or reduction of grants to all grants, subsidies and other assistance given by the Minister or a housing authority.  Section 18 updates the definition of a housing authority for the purposes of the Housing Acts to reflect the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 21 clarifies and consolidates the power of the Minister to assist by grants towards their administrative and <Col N="421" /> general expenses a small number of representative or advisory bodies in the voluntary housing area, namely, the National Association of Building Co-operatives, the Housing Centre and Threshold.  Section 25 is a technical amendment to afford to purchasers of local authority flats the same entitlement to have their flats put into good structural condition as applies to purchasers of local authority houses.  Section 27 is an amendment of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, consequential on the lapsing of the Housing Act, 1969.  Section 28 amends the Building Societies Act, 1976, in two minor respects.  Section 29 deals with offences under the Act and provides for fines not exceeding £500 for knowingly furnishing false or misleading information or withholding material information in connection with obtaining accommodation or assistance from a local authority.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would now like to draw together the main policy directions running through what is a major and far reaching Housing Bill.  Firstly, and most importantly, the Bill will establish a new framework for the local authority housing programme.  The effect of the Bill's provisions in this regard will be to require local authorities to re-evaluate on a regular and formal basis the type and nature of housing needs which they should meet in their individual housing programmes. For the first time ever local authorities will be obliged in their programmes for the provision of houses to have regard to the results of the assessments of housing needs in their area and to maintain a reasonable balance in their programme between the needs of different categories of persons.  This will ensure in future an improved mix in the type of accommodation being provided so as to reflect the needs of particular groups, for example, one and two person households which now form an increasingly significant proportion of applicants on local authority waiting lists.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the Bill dealing specifically with the homeless are, of course, of major social significance.  New responsibilities are being entrusted to local <Col N="422" /> authorities to ensure that homeless persons have access to housing.  These have been very widely welcomed though some reservations have been expressed on certain points of detail.  I will, of course, be fully considering before Committee Stage all of the views put forward and in particular the contributions of Deputies during the Second Stage debate.</P>
    <P>The Bill also embraces a number of major housing initiatives taken in recent years including the highly successful £5,000 grant scheme for persons surrendering local authority or Army accommodation to acquire a private house, the scheme of remedial works for certain rented local authority housing and the improved scheme of assistance for the provision of houses by voluntary organisations.</P>
    <P>A Housing Bill traditionally affords Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas a valuable and indeed essential opportunity to consider and review the major issues of housing policy.  Members bring to a housing debate a wealth of experience and knowledge gained at local and national level and a shared concern to improve the housing conditions of all our people.  The Bill is, therefore, a significant and important one and I look forward to and welcome the views of Deputies in the Second Stage debate.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for introducing this Bill because it gives Deputies on both sides of the House an opportunity to debate the important issue of housing.  The general thrust of the Bill in relation to the powers of local authorities and the homeless is very significant. There are also some provisions regarding the travelling people but we have some reservations about the power given to managers to solve certain problems with regard to that matter.  Elected public representatives must continue to have a role in the provision of housing and halting sites for the travelling people.  Their plight is one of the great social evils in Ireland and the problem must be solved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure the Minister will agree with <Col N="423" /> me that the councils have played a significant role in providing quality housing.  I have been associated with Roscommon County Council for the past 11 years and they have been first-class in their policies. Housing for the homeless has always been catered for by caring local authorities. The provision of demountable houses has been very important in providing houses for the homeless.  This has been in operation since the 1966 Act.</P>
    <P>The cost of housing for local authorities has increased dramatically over the past few years.  It has placed a major burden on those authorities to continue with their housing programmes which were at a record high level five or six years ago. There is reference in the Minister's speech to mortgage subsidies.  I am sure he is aware that quite a number of people who obtained SDA loans some years ago when they were in employment are having enormous difficulty in meeting the repayments now.  I refer to this matter particularly in relation to the mortgage subsidy which plays a significant part in repayment of county council loans for the first five years.  I ask the Minister to obtain a report from local authorities on loan repayments generally from people who obtained loans when they were employed but who are now probably on unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>I know of instances where the local authority are moving to evict families in my constituency.  The move was made but they were stopped at the eleventh hour.  I am sure the Minister is aware of the difficulty that has arisen.  I have great sympathy for people who are genuinely unable to repay loans.  It would be worth while to obtain reports from the local authorities on the deficit with regard to repayments.  In Roscommon alone there is about £600,000 overdue and quite a number of orders have been made in the courts for repossession of houses.  As a consequence of this action we will create a new form of homelessness.  If local authorities evict families from their homes they make them homeless and under this Bill a council has the responsibility to rehouse them.  In view of the <Col N="424" /> genuine problems of people, there should be some provision whereby the local authorities on humanitarian grounds could rearrange the loan repayments, either by extension of the repayment period or by putting a moratorium on repayments for a period to allow families to readjust to their present circumstances. The managers inform me they have no powers under the 1966 Act to make such readjustments in respect of SDA loans.  The Bill would allow for powers to be vested in certain circumstances in the managers whereby they would have this flexibility in respect of the problems that have arisen.  This crisis is a recent one, but the problem is genuine. From a humanitarian point of view the Minister would be doing a good day's work by providing in some section for power for himself in this area.</P>
    <P>The arrangement whereby a £5,000 grant can be paid to those who are prepared to vacate local authority houses is to be welcomed but I should like to hear from the Minister as to the numbers who availed of this facility in 1985.  Reference has been made to a number in the region of 2,000 but I suspect that in rural areas the response has not been very great. In Roscommon, for instance, only about five people would have vacated their houses during the year.  However, the facility is a major incentive to families who are occupying council houses to provide private housing for themselves.  In addition there is the benefit whereby the opportunities are increased for those who are unable to provide housing for themselves and who are on the waiting list for local authority housing.</P>
    <P>We welcome also the provision relating to letting priorities.  Every authority, as envisaged by the Minister, must make provision for proper letting arrangements. Down through the years, as a member of a local authority I have experienced the difficulty that a proper list was not kept.  This resulted in the situation whereby people who had been waiting for a number of years for housing were passed over when a more serious problem arose in respect of some housing <Col N="425" /> application.  That was unfair to those who had been on the list for a long time.</P>
    <P>Regarding the general housing policy and the development by local authorities of housing estates, there has been a serious lack in terms of good planning in respect of some estates.  In other cases the planning has been excellent, but generally the tendency has been for the planning to be on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis with the result that what have been developed are to some extent concrete jungles. Having been involved as an architect in planning, I can see that the environment has been damaged by the lack of proper planning, especially so far as local authority housing schemes are concerned, though the same applies in the case of many private schemes.  I would urge local authorities to take steps to revitalise housing estates where possible.  This can be done by way of planting arrangements, by redesigning cul-de-sacs and generally by improving the environment in which the estates are located.  The complaint I hear most frequently relates to the drabness of housing estates.  The provision of small support community centres in estates of 100 or more houses would be very worth while.  I understand that local authorities are empowered to provide areas in estates in which services can be provided for the people.  I am encouraging Roscommon County Council to provide, in co-operation with AnCO and voluntary organisations, small rooms where people can come together, receive advice and discuss their common problems. If the Minister could provide within this Bill for a grant for local authorities to enable them to build what would be modest meeting areas in housing estates he would be taking very worth while action.  People on these estates often have difficulty in integrating and in getting to know each other.  The facility I am talking of would be a major help in that direction.</P>
    <P>Regarding housing for the elderly, there is great difficulty in rural areas particularly in relation to the provision of smaller units.  Generally, local authorities have encouraged group housing for the elderly.  That is very desirable in many instances but there are many elderly who <Col N="426" /> are not prepared to leave their own areas or to leave their land, so perhaps county councils could plan for small type permanent housing for the elderly.</P>
    <P>Down through the years we have provided accommodation for them thereby avoiding a serious crisis but that has been only in the short term.  County councils tend to move people from their local areas to the bigger centres of population, but the revitalisation of villages is very important.  I am aware that there is nothing in the Minister's policy that would be against county councils building in rural areas but some county managers and officials tend to orientate the housing, from an economic point of view, towards towns where the various services are available thereby denuding rural areas of housing and of population.  In many cases local authorities are not prepared to build a cottage in a rural area on the basis that the applicant concerned should be provided with accommodation in a town. This policy is a major setback for village life.</P>
    <P>While the grants for disabled persons are to be welcomed they are inadequate in present day values.  Therefore, the Minister should review the £4,000 disabled person's grant and allow for far more flexibility in relation to the categories that can be assisted under this support. The grant that has been available for some time has provided much needed accommodation for the disabled.  It has allowed many families to keep their disabled at home rather than send them to institutions.  In Roscommon the availability of this grant has had a major impact and the Department should be complimented on providing the necessary grants to the county councils.  Again, the special aid for the elderly which is being provided through the health boards has been of considerable support for people in emergency situations.  The Minister may not necessarily be financing this scheme. It may be financed through the Department of Health and Social Welfare.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>The health boards are administering the scheme.  The Minister should bring the scheme totally within the responsibility of local authorities.  The health boards are taking from the local authorities the management of this scheme.  The Minister may not be aware of what is happening.  To date local authorities have dealt with the administrative details of the scheme.  Therefore there was more integration between the disabled person's grant, the essential repairs grant and the special aid for the elderly.  In many cases an applicant was entitled to all three grants.  This had a dramatic impact on the financial circumstances of people who were unable to provide any financial assistance to a builder to undertake this work.  In many cases the local authorities carried out the work and claimed the grant in the proper manner.  That is a very desirable situation.</P>
      <P>Some health boards, particularly the Western Health Board, have withdrawn administration of the scheme from the local authority and taken this task unto themselves.  That occasions a certain amount of duplication between the relevant local authority, health board and the Department of the Environment.  Local authorities are best equipped to undertake the administration of these grant schemes.  They have undertaken extremely useful social work in relation to the special aid for the elderly.  It is a very small grant &mdash; approximately £1 million spread throughout the country.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to County Roscommon it amounts to something in the region of £25,000 to £30,000 per annum.  It constitutes a small amount in relation to what are very desirable works. In many cases it has obviated the necessity of having elderly people rehoused or institutionalised.  It has proved to be a most attractive grant.  It was introduced during the term of the last Fianna Fáil Administration.  I contend it is one which should be fully supported and financed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The needs of the disabled are very <Col N="428" /> special.  Parents and families who provide this accommodation warrant every support it is possible to be provided by the State.  Indeed, it is a good public investment to allow a disabled person remain in his or her own home or environment. The work being carried out under the provisions of this scheme has had a dramatic effect in regard to the care of the disabled.  I contend that this work should be expanded and other categories of people, not necessarily totally physically handicapped or disabled, should be brought within the umbrella of this scheme.</P>
    <P>In regard to the mortgage subsidy scheme and the £2,000 new house grant, under the provisions of this Bill the Minister has allowed a concession to legally separated husbands or wives.  There is an anomaly in relation to widows who have been debarred from obtaining grants because their late husbands may have owned or bought a house at some stage in the course of their lifetime.  Under the provisions of this Bill the Minister is making a concession to people who have been legally separated.  Surely a widow or, for that matter, a widower should be included in this category.  In many cases widows experience great difficulty providing a home for a young family.  I know of a particular case, of a widow who applied for a new house grant because her existing house had been burned down.  The Department refused categorically to give her a grant.  I even went to the extent of making representations to the Ombudsman to ascertain if he could intervene on her behalf but the Department categorically refused her application.  Indeed this Bill affords any Deputy wishing to highlight any such hardship case an opportunity to raise the matter with the Minister.  I will bring this case to the attention of the Minister but it is useful to highlight it here because similar cases could arise.  The widow lost her house through fire.  She had to build a new house.  The Department contended that the house which had been burned was reconstructable and so maintained that she was not entitled to a new house grant.  She was further informed <Col N="429" /> that even had the house not been reconstructable she would still have been debarred from receiving a grant because her late husband had bought or built a home for himself &mdash; in fact he had vested a local authority house.  Therefore that widow was victimised on account of her late husband's purchase of a house.</P>

      <P>I should say to the Deputy that I will look at the circumstances of any given case brought to my attention.  In the case of widows it is usual that they inherit the house of their husband if it is in his name.  However, if the Deputy has encountered particular difficulties in a given case I will have them examined.</P>

      <P>The Minister is here granting a concession in relation to legally separated spouses.  Widows or widowers are permanently separated.  Yet they are being treated less favourably than those spouses who have been legally separated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>It is only where a separated person has moved out of the home, where there is a legal separation, where a spouse has lost the home of, let us say, their estranged spouse and they find themselves without a house but somebody remains in occupation of the family home.  It is only the spouse who is left without a home who will be considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome that concession. Probably it was an anomaly which had been brought to the attention of the Minister.  I believe a widow should have the same facility provided as that afforded a legally separated person.  That concession had been granted by a predecessor of the Minister.  Therefore a precedent has been established.  I contend it should be formally included in the provisions of this Bill &mdash; that a widow or widower would be granted a similar concession to that of a legally separated person in regard to a new house grant.  It would not be very costly because it does not arise very frequently.  The Minister will find from departmental records that <Col N="430" /> there was recognition of these circumstances at one point, that a precedent has been created but has since been broken. I think that concession was granted by a previous Minister for the Environment in 1978 or 1979; I have the relevant letter in my possession.  The Minister should adopt a humanitarian approach to widows and widowers as he has adopted in the case of legally separated spouses who encounter difficulties in this area.</P>
      <P>With regard to the provision of halting sites and housing for itinerants, some local authorities have undertaken tremendous work in this respect.  In my county the local authority have been very progressive and have undertaken major steps to provide such halting sites and housing.  I might utter a word of caution here.  The concept of the halting site has proved to be extremely advantageous in the interim period of itinerants changing their mode of life from the road to housing. But great care must be taken in this transition.  Social workers have a major responsibility here to ensure that the provision of a house for an itinerant in a builtup area will not cause major disruption or repercussions in the area.  There appears to be less prejudice and bias now than there was some years ago.  It is very much dependent on the individual family.  The type of people involved can make a huge difference &mdash; for example, if they are prepared to adjust and become involved in the community, but very often they can be so disruptive as to make life totally intolerable for other families in the area. In fairness local authorities and councillors should be deeply involved in this matter.  The majority of them are so involved.  However, I do not welcome the provision whereby the county manager has been given full power to provide such facilities without recourse to county councillors.  In most areas local councillors have been elected by and know the feelings of the people in their areas.  They are in a position to assess on the ground the acceptable course of policy.  The Minister would be justified in making amendments to this Bill in relation to the power he is proposing to give to managers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="431" /> During the 11 years that I have been a member of a local authority I have seen a dramatic change in the provision of facilities for travelling people.  The greatest difficulty at present is the mobility of people who are not genuine itinerants but traders who are not interested in being housed or in using halting sites. They are causing more difficulties than the traditional travellers who have become established in particular areas and taken up residence there.  The provision of educational facilities for the children of itinerants is of the greatest importance and most of these families are very concerned that their children should be educated.  The educational authorities and the nuns have provided excellent facilities for them and local authorities such as Roscommon County Council have provided school transport for young itinerant children.  Education will in the long term solve the problem. There has been a radical change in the attitude of itinerants.  Younger itinerants are better educated and are not prepared to accept the low living standards which their parents had.  The educational system has had a major impact and I hope that the problem will be solved within 20 or 30 years.  Certain itinerant families having a yearning to go back on the road, in spite of being housed.  This longing for freedom is in their blood and it will take a long time to get it out of their system.</P>
    <P>The local authorities are being given full power to provide facilities for the homeless.  It is not as big a problem in rural areas as in the cities.  The provisions are to be welcomed because the councils are being given full financial support in providing accommodation for homeless people.  The local authorities have been carrying out tremendous work in relation to this problem and by providing demountable houses they have taken many people off the roads.  Some of them were living in substandard houses or caravans. When a person is prepared to stay in their area, the councils have been most caring in their approach.  We must also <Col N="432" /> compliment the work of the Simon Community and the Society of St. Vincent de Paul who have voluntarily accepted responsibility for providing temporary accommodation for homeless people. The health boards have also been very active in the welfare homes, from which no homeless person has ever been turned away.  This Bill gives the local authorities more responsibility as well as the statutory power and financial backing to provide housing accommodation and facilities for the homeless.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the matter of housing grants.  These grants have not kept pace with inflation and the new house grants and mortgage subsidies should be revised upwards.  The new grants for improvements to existing houses are very attractive but the new house grants have not kept pace with the cost of housing and inflation.  The Minister might be able to bring influence to bear in order to increase the amounts available for these schemes.  These grants are very beneficial to those buying or building houses for the first time.  The building industry is in a very serious situation, 45,000 people being out of work.  Any provision which could assist in providing jobs in the building industry would be very welcome and would give a major incentive to young people to build their own homes.  There has undoubtedly been a major drop in the building of houses.  It is very expensive to acquire a house and the grant scheme could assist greatly if it were revised upwards in next week's budget.</P>
    <P>Each local authority has a major responsibility under this Bill and the provisions must be clearly made known.  The Minister and the Department should hold seminars to explain the detailed provisions of the Bill.  Many of these provisions could be operated by voluntary organisations, expecially in such matters as providing houses for the elderly or the homeless, but they are not availing of these grants.  Seminars should be held with local authorities where the Minister's officials could discuss with councillors and officials the details of the Bill.  It would give an opportunity to the councillors to discuss with an expert how best <Col N="433" /> they could implement the provisions of the Bill in relation to the homeless and the travellers so that a scheme could be worked out in consultation with the Department of the Environment.  It would be a very useful exercise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanGriffin" hpid="Mr. Griffin Mr. Griffin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Griffin</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome the introduction of this Bill.  It is imaginative, progressive legislation, one of the most far-reaching housing measures since the Housing Act, 1966.  If I were to be a little critical I would say that it is long overdue but nevertheless very welcome, especially with its focus on the needs of the homeless, the aged, the disabled and the travelling community, as well as other improvements in the housing and related legal codes.  The entrusting of additional responsibilities and powers to the local authorities in regard to the accommodation of homeless persons is particularly welcome.</P>
      <P>I especially congratulate the Minister and the Government on all the recent financial assistance to the housing industry.  I would mention the £2,000 new house grant, the £3,000 mortgage subsidy, as well as the £5,000 new house grant and the introduction of the house improvement grants which have been so widely welcomed.  All these financial enticements encourage people to build their own houses.  It is a great characteristic of Irish people that they wish to possess and build their own homes.  In this we are markedly different from our continental counterparts who are content to live in apartments and high rise flats.  For some reason we do not wish to live in these types of dwellings.  It must have something to do with the Irish mentality and character.  All these recent incentives must give a stimulus to the building sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's invitation to the Members of this House to participate in the discussion and to give their views based on their experience.  I am a member of a local authority for the past 20 years and we deal weekly and even daily with problems such as arise in this Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill. I hope that other Members of the House <Col N="434" /> with longer service on local authorities than I will contribute also so that eventually a fully rounded Act will emerge from this House based on the valuable expertise and experience of the many Members who have been dealing with these problems. I hope that the Minister and his officials will have an open mind and take on board many of the valuable suggestions put forward by Members of this House irrespective of the side from which they come.</P>
    <P>The Bill has been generally well received by all concerned and I am including those who do work which is often unnoticed but of great value for the benefit of the homeless.  I refer to the St. Vincent De Paul Society and the Simon Community.  The Simon Community are a little critical of the definition of he term &ldquo;homeless&rdquo; in section 2.  They feel that it is too narrow and should be better defined and should include a clause about people &mdash; women would be the most affected here &mdash; who cannot gain peaceful entry to or occupation of their homes. They feel that it should include also people threatened with homelessness, as the British law rightly does.  I refer to the British Homeless Persons Act of 1977. The Simon Community feel that people will be put needlessly through the trauma of homelessness in order to qualify under this Bill when preventive measures could and should be taken.  They feel that the exclusion of travelling people and people residing in hostels should at least be up front in the definition of homelessness.  I urge the Minister to have another look at that to see if the fears and worries of a responsible association such as the Simon Community can be assuaged.  They have long experience of dealing with these problems, experience gathered over the years and their criticisms, no matter how small, should not be just cast aside by the Minister.</P>
    <P>The Simon Community are worried about the intentionality clause of the Bill. They maintain that this is based on the British Act which they feel has been a disaster in Britain, that it let loose a flood of contradictory and sometimes miserable case law.  The British Act has been <Col N="435" /> in operation for eight or nine years now. A Bill is introduced in cold print and only after it has been in operation for a number of years do obvious anomalies, failures and weaknesses in it become apparent.  If after the passage of time and the operation of the Homeless Persons Act, 1977, of the British Parliament the obvious failings in it have emerged, we should learn from that Act and avoid the pitfalls.  That Act had no precedent to follow, but at least we have the precedent of that British Act of 1977.  Perhaps our Minister and his officials will consult their counterparts in Great Britain with a view to avoiding these pitfalls and the failures of that Act.</P>
    <P>Section 3 deals with the £3,000 mortgage subsidy.  This subsidy is valuable to many young couples who start out to purchase or build their private dwelling houses.  It eases the burden of repayments. Heretofore, it was over a three year period, latterly it is over a five year period.  Notwithstanding that, it is still a very welcome subsidy.  Many a young couple would not think of building their house but for their eligibility for this subsidy. I urge the Minister that it apply much more than it does at present to existing houses rather than specifically to new houses.  It applies to secondhand houses in some cases, but there should be no question whatsoever that a secondhand house, if it is a worthy house in the sense that a loan should be advanced for it, should also qualify for this mortgage subsidy.  More flexibility and latitude should be applied in this rather than confining it narrowly to new houses.</P>
    <P>Section 3 (2) (h) deals with floor area. I am baffled and amazed that there should be any maximum floor area.  I can appreciate why we should have a minimum floor area, otherwise people would be living in glorified orange boxes or some such thing.  However, the maximum area limit should be abolished and a £2,000 grant should be given to anyone who builds a house irrespective of the floor area to encourage building of more houses and purchase of materials and give very valuable employment.  I am critical <Col N="436" /> of the regulation as regards attics.  Rather than being penalised for doing so, people should be encouraged to develop their attics.  The regulations applying to new house grants provide in respect of attics that only undeveloped attics and basements will be excluded from the floor area and the only development that will be allowable in an attic is that it may be floored for storage purposes.  The provision of one window in each of the two gable ends or one dormer window or one rooflight not exceeding 2.8 sq.m. or 30 sq. ft. to provide light and ventilation is also permitted.  This is absolutely ridiculous. People should be encouraged to develop their attics and also their basements. Housing inspectors run up attic stairs to check out whether the place is to be converted later into a bedroom or other type of accommodation, and they check out the basement.  If the attic or basement do not comply with these very stringent qualifications the person is declared ineligible for the £2,000 new house grant.  I am not being critical of housing inspectors in this regard.  We Members of this House who tolerate and perpetuate this type of legislation are to be criticised.</P>
    <P>Every Member of this House and every member of a local authority have had many of these applicants coming to them in utter desperation, unaware of these regulations and finding themselves excluded from and declared ineligible for these grants because they developed the attic or the basement or, indeed, the garage.  According to the regulations, areas that will be calculated in the floor area include any garage or basement where development works have been carried out which would suggest that it is to be used as domestic or habitable space, and areas described as garages but clearly designed to be integrated into the dwelling area will also be regarded as part of the floor area.  We have had many constituents and other people coming to us because at some later date the garage might be included in the housing area and their grant has been disallowed.  A workshop, office and stores area, boiler house and fuel store will be excluded <Col N="437" /> from the housing area if their area is not more than four square metres or 43 square feet.  It is ridiculous to be taking up the valuable time of housing inspectors with such matters.  I have a particular young couple in mind whose area of house was within the regulations, being not more than 125 square feet.  They wanted a larger fuel store which they built, but that made them ineligible just because the fuel store was larger than stipulated.  I contend that regulations of this type discourage young people from building houses and they should be dispensed with.</P>
    <P>Let me refer also in passing to the house improvement grants.  In the past if a person unknowingly or unwittingly started work on improvements he or she was immediately ineligible for these grants.  I think there should be a nominal fine of perhaps £100 or £200 for starting work before the inspector has time to inspect the place, rather than totally excluding these people from the grant. That would be a more equitable and just way of dealing with the matter.  This matter has been discussed many times, but I urge the Minister to reconsider it.</P>
    <P>Section 4 deals with the £5,000 grant to tenants or tenant purchasers of local authority houses who want to purchase private dwelling houses and surrender their houses to the local authority.  This has proved very popular and there have been hundreds, even thousands of applications, resulting in each local authority having extra houses ready for re-occupation. I would suggest an addition to this scheme to include owners of private dwelling houses who in the autumn of their lives, perhaps for personal, financial, or medical reasons, find their houses too large or too old for them; perhaps due to failing health they are unable to negotiate the stairs.  Some, in fact most, would gladly surrender their family sized house for a smaller, more compact, more manageable senior citizen's house if they got a suitable financial entitlement or some compensation.  At the moment there is no way in which a local authority could pay anything near the value of such <Col N="438" /> houses.  I urge the Minister and his officials to look into this matter to see if perfectly habitable houses could be transferred to the local authority in exchange for a senior citizen's house. One could argue that these people are getting a new house, but it should be made a condition that there would be absolutely no right to bequeath that house to anybody, that it would be strictly for their lifetime alone.  It would serve a double purpose of making available a family sized house to the local authority for a modest sum, £5,000, or <i>pro rata,</i> or perhaps a lesser sum.  A number of people who approached me on this matter would willingly and gladly transfer their house if given something in the region of £1,000. Unfortunately, the local authorities have no scheme under which they can accommodate the wishes of these people.</P>
    <P>Section 4 (1) (a) (ii) provides for a grant to be paid out to a person who:</P>
    <P>in the case of accommodation allocated to a member of the Permanent Defence Force, provides the Minister for Defence with vacant possession by surrendering it.</P>
    <P>Could this concession apply to members of the Garda Síochána?  A number have approached me who are at present in residence in Garda houses or accommodation attached to Garda barracks and they would willingly vacate these houses. Some are building their own private dwelling houses.  They were hoping that this £5,000 grant would apply to their members and I would urge the Minister to heed this request and to be flexible in this matter, if at all possible.</P>
    <P>Section 5 deals specifically with the assistance by housing authorities of certain bodies, whether a housing authority or one approved of by the Minister for the purposes of this section.  I have in mind one such body, the Rural Resource Organisation, Shannon.  Shortly before Christmas, at a seminar held in Clonmel, I met Fr. Harry Bohan, the director of that scheme.  He and his organisation have done tremendous work in revitalising rural Ireland, encouraging people to come back and live there by providing <Col N="439" /> houses for them.  He has given life, vitality and vibrancy to many small towns and villages which would otherwise have been deserted.  I was amazed to learn from him that county councils have not taken, or indeed are not permitted to take, responsibility for public lighting of these small schemes in each of these villages and towns.  I hope the Minister and his officials will examine this matter and give positive proof of their support so that the very scarce resources of the Rural Resource Organisation would be freed for building further houses.</P>
    <P>Section 8 deals with a greater co-operation between housing authorities, not only between local authorities within the same county council area, but between urban councils <i>vis-á-vis</i> the county council and between county councils.  The practice of mutual transfers between urban and county councils and between county councils should at all times be encouraged.  Some arrangement should be made by which a local authority can offer a tenancy or offer to pay compensation in kind or in finance &mdash; a type of exchange control of housing on a reciprocal basis between such bodies.  All Deputies and county councillors have been approached from time to time by emigrants residing in England who wish to return home and I would hope for an extension of that type of mutual transfer between England and Ireland.  I know that there would be many administrative problems, but if the social welfare administrative problems have been ironed out there should be some system under which people residing in local authority houses or in flats in England who wish to return to Ireland could be rehoused here with some arrangement being made for so doing between the two local authorities involved.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare the reason unemployment assistance has been refused, on appeal, to a person (details supplied) in County Laois whose financial circumstances were such that he was awarded supplementary welfare allowance by the health board of £50 per week.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare (Mr. Pattison)</NameTxt>
      <P>The unemployment assistance claim of the person concerned was disallowed on the grounds that his means, derived from the profit from his holding exceeded the statutory limit applicable in his case.  He appealed against the disallowance, and following on oral hearing of his case, the appeals officer also decided that his means, derived from the profit from his holding exceeded the statutory limit, and he was notified accordingly.</P>
      <P>In accordance with the legislation governing this scheme, the calculation of means is carried out on an income and expenditure basis and represents normal yearly net income from the farm, in other words, the gross income less any expenses actually and necessarily incurred in earning that income.  A detailed statement of the items constituting the income and expenditure in this case, was supplied to the person concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is understood from the South-Eastern Health Board that a supplementary welfare allowance is at present being paid to the person concerned at the rate of £70 per week.  In determining whether a <Col N="441" /> payment of supplementary welfare allowance should be made in any case, the health board would have regard to the immediate financial circumstances of the person and where they decide that the person is in immediate financial need, a supplementary welfare allowance can be paid.</P>
    <P>If the person concerned considers that his circumstances have changed since the previous investigations of his means for unemployment assistance purposes it is open to him to make a fresh application for unemployment assistance at his local employment office.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMcCarthy" hpid="Dr. McCarthy Dr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>Without querying how means are computed in regard to social welfare payments, does the Minister agree that it is incongrous that investigating officers of one Department abide by a collection of rules and regulations when computing or assessing means &mdash; they decide that somebody is ineligible for benefit or for means tested allowances &mdash; whereas the South-Eastern Health Board, whose investigating officer is a community welfare officer, are able to determine that the assessment of means by the other method was wrong?  To provide the basic needs for the applicant in this case, the health board have given him an allowance of £70 a week.  How can one Department, with their rules and regulations, decide that this man is not eligible and another investigating officer by another method determines that payment should be made?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>We are dealing with two different schemes, unemployment assistance and supplementary welfare.  There are different criteria laid down.  Generally, unemployment assistance is assessed on a yearly basis in regard to income, whereas the supplementary welfare scheme is based on an immediate there and then need.  Each scheme has its own purpose.  There is a distinction between the two.  They are governed by different sets of regulations.  The applicant in this case has had his claim investigated exhaustively under the employment assistance scheme and the <Col N="442" /> result was as stated.  There was an oral hearing at which the applicant had an opportunity to appear before the appeals officer and give his evidence.  The Deputy can take it that every possible piece of information regarding his means was available.  Nevertheless, his claim was turned down.  The supplementary welfare officer, on the other hand, must have found an immediate need.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not trying to be niggling, it is not my style, but the Minister has stated that the supplementary welfare allowance was being paid to take cognisance of an immediate need.  I accept that, but these are continuing payments of £70 per week.  I do not impute irresponsibility on the part of the social welfare investigating officers, but I would point out that this is not a once off payment, it is being paid on a weekly basis.  Therefore, it was not just an immediate need but an immediate continuing need.  Is there any way in which we can streamline this procedure of assessing means so that they will be in accord with each other and take true cognisance of the financial needs of claimants so that hardship will not be imposed on people?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>The streamlining of these assessment methods is continually under consideration.  The Commission on Social Welfare are considering it.  In relation to this individual, the social welfare officer deemed him to have an annual income of £10,700, but he is heavily in debt and has his own arrangements for repayment. Capital payments are not treated as expenses for the purpose of estimating profits from a holding.  That is one of the distinctions between means testing for these schemes.  Under the Social Welfare Acts this man has a relatively good income but has to make substantial repayments of debt, and these are not <Col N="443" /> taken into account.  Under the supplementary welfare scheme the community officer can take these things into consideration.</P>

      <P>I agree with the Chair that the reason we table questions is to elicit information but in seeking that information we often get long, round-about statements from Ministers.  I am not saying that that is the case today but when we seek information we get answers that are not directly related to the question.  With regard to what happened yesterday I agree with the action of my colleague when the Taoiseach walked out of the House and would not answer questions on unemployment.</P>

      <P>Unfortunately, an error occurred in this case.  The Department of Social Welfare cannot claim to be infallible. It is very difficult to operate a scheme without errors occurring but fortunately, such errors are not that plentiful.  The invalidity pension in this case was kept in payment up to today.  The error and the delay are regretted and the matter has been rectified.  As the Deputy is aware, there is a difference between the rate of invalidity pension and that of a contributory old age pension and that is being made good to the person concerned.</P>

      <P>I appreciate that some of the cases referred to by the Deputy are hardship cases but the scheme for free electricity allowance and free telephone rental allowance from its inception was based on age qualification or infirmity.  It would be a departure from the original intention of the scheme to extend it to cover the people referred to by the Deputy.  One may argue that we should depart from those criteria for widows but if we do an equally strong or better case can be made for extending the terms of the scheme to the unemployed or those on disability allowance.  The minimum age to qualify under the scheme is 66 or those who have not reached that age must be suffering from a certain degree of incapacity, in receipt of an invalidity pension or a disabled persons maintenance allowance to qualify.  There are no proposals in my Department to extend the terms of this scheme to the categories referred to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>

In order to qualify for free fuel under the national fuel scheme a person must be in receipt of one of the payments specified in the regulations governing the scheme and must fulfil the other conditions stipulated. Disability benefit is not one of the specified payments and a recipient would not, therefore, qualify for fuel irrespective of the length of time he has been in receipt of benefit.</P>
      <P>A person who has been receiving disability benefit for at least a year and who is regarded by a medical referee as permanently incapable of work may, however, qualify for invalidity pension, in which event he would be eligible for free fuel, provided the other conditions were satisfied.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMcCarthy" hpid="Dr. McCarthy Dr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that rules must be adhered to but there are many people on long term disability benefit far in excess of 12 months which seems to be the statutory period of time before one can apply for an invalidity pension.  Many people are left on disability benefit and because they are uninformed of their right to apply for transfer to an invalidity pension they lose out on fringe benefits such as free fuel and free travel.  Is there any intention by the Minister's Department to introduce a system whereby people on long term disability benefit, particularly those on monthly long duration medical certification, can, after a certain statutory period &mdash; 18 months or so &mdash; be called in and examined for the purpose of deciding whether they qualify for invalidity pension and to determine whether they are unfit for work for the rest of their lives?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>The whole area of the fuel scheme is continually under review. It was hoped to have a unified scheme and we still hope to do this.  For persons outside the scope of the national fuel scheme assistance may be available under the general supplementary welfare allowance scheme.  That has operated quite well in relation to the type of people to which Deputy McCarthy referred.  I am sure that the Deputy is well aware of the criteria for qualification for invalidity pension and that any people outside that scope can, if their circumstances warrant it, get a supplement towards heating costs if they need it because of protracted ill-health or infirmity.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. D. Gallagher Mr. D. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he is aware that the present system of assessment of means for young people in receipt of unemployment assistance reduces payment to a degree which leaves these people with no other option but to emigrate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>The assessment of the value of free board and lodgings is the main item of means assessed in the case of single applicants for unemployment assistance living with their parents or relatives.  This is in accordance with statutory requirements and each case is decided on it merits having regard to the standard of living of the household and the circumstances of the applicant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The requirement to take account of the value of board and lodgings has been a feature of the unemployment assistance scheme since its inception.  Its purpose is to achieve a degree of equity as between applicants whose parents are well-to-do <Col N="450" /> and those whose parents are in poor circumstances.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. D. Gallagher Mr. D. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that at present the officers of his Department seem to be particularly harsh in their assessment of young people applying for unemployment assistance? In rural areas a person may be living with an old age pensioner which means they are assessed at £7.50 per week, which seems to be the general pattern.  Sometimes a student who has gone through university finds that he or she has to live with parents and it is degrading for them to have to depend on their parents to keep them, especially when they have sent them to university.  Does the Minister agree that this section of the Act should be changed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>This section of the Act is there since its inception and it was embodied in the Consolidation Act as recently as 1981.  I know there is a problem in this regard but it is a question of resources.  I should like to be in a position to give reasonable assistance to all young people without putting them through a means test but the cost factor is too great.  Perhaps the Deputy could tell me where we could get the resources to implement it.  In the meantime, the applicant for assistance who has a free roof over his head is in a slightly different category from someone who is paying £10 or £15 per week for a flat.  With the resources available, one has to make those kind of distinctions to ensure that those who are worst off &mdash; I know they are all badly off &mdash; are helped to the maximum.  In present circumstances, if one were to ignore that aspect it would mean that people in a relatively worse position could not be helped.  I would dearly like to see a situation where there would be no reference to the income of parents or the houses which they occupy but there is a major problem in trying to devise such a scheme.  It is interesting to note that when times were better and the number of recipients was not nearly as <Col N="451" /> high no attempt was made to do anything about it.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister confirm that the means test on single people living at home is not confined to young people but that 30 year old and 40 year old people may be living at home with their parents on as little as £3 or £4 a week unemployment assistance? How does the 12½ per cent maximum deduction for board and lodging operate? Is it 12½ per cent on each individual in the household or 12½ per cent maximum? What income is taken as the basis for assessing unemployment assistance?  Is it annual income?  Is it the previous year's income or next year's expected income, or is it simply based on the income on the day the welfare inspector calls?  When was the last time the £90 parental allowance was reviewed and increased in line with the cost of living?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>I can answer some of the Deputy's questions but I do not have to hand all the information he needs because the question relates to assessment of means. In the case of wage earning families, the method of calculation is to deduct from the net parental income, that is, gross income less income tax and PRSI contributions, an amount to cover rent, mortgage repayments and a set parental allowance, currently £90 for a two parent <Col N="452" /> family and £80 for a one parent family. The remainder is then divided among the non-earning members of the household, including the applicant, and the sum arrived at is taken as the value of the applicant's board and lodging subject to a maximum limit of 12½ per cent of the net income.  It is different for farming families.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister does not have the information today perhaps he would let me know by letter if it is correct that the 12½ per cent should be applied to each individual of the family. In other words, if there are two or more applicants for unemployment assistance in a family, that 12½ per cent applies to each applicant rather than to the gross income.  From cases which have come to my attention it seems that where two young people have applied the 12½ per cent ceiling is applied to each individual rather than both together.  As regards the basis of the income, is it annual income, the income for the previous year or the following year, or is it on a day to day basis taking into account the paid overtime a person works in any given week?</P>

      <P>It was because of the need to review priorities that the Commission on Social Welfare were established in August 1983 to carry out a major review of the whole social welfare code having regard to the needs of modern Irish society.  The commission were asked to report specifically on the <Col N="453" /> financial implications and relative priorities of their recommendations and the Government will take full account of these recommendations in planning the future structure and operation of the social welfare services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Do the Department accept the figures they project for the growth in payment in various categories? Has the Minister not set himself some priorities rather than waiting for a commission?

      <P>The projections are based on various assumptions regarding migration, activities rates in the labour force, participation rates in education, the level of unemployment and growth of disability.  Without a general expenditure model of our own, the Department are not in a position to agree or disagree with these assumptions or with the expenditure forecasts.  However, the main emphasis of the NESC report was on the need to establish priorities in social welfare policy.  This need had already been identified and manifested itself in the establishment of the Commission on Social Welfare.  The commission were specifically requested to include the financial implications and relative priorities of their recommendations in their report.  The commission have been asked to report by March.</P>

      <P>There was a review of widows and orphans in accounts branch, a review of the disability benefit scheme and a review of computerised schemes. As part of their normal functions the Department's internal audit unit, who were expanded during 1985, bring to the attention of management any instances of duplicate functions, excessive checking, wastage or other inefficiencies and suggest remedies.  It is proposed to carry out a management survey in 1986.  Following proposals to examine the operation and working of employment exchanges a joint team from the Department of Social Welfare and the Department of the Public Service with consultants intend to commence a study of three large employment exchanges.  This project has not yet commenced due to objections by the staff unions concerning present staffing levels. Following publication of the White Paper, <i>Serving the Country Better,</i> work has commenced on establishing new management systems to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the services provided by the Department.</P>

      <P>I am surprised at that reply because on at least one or two occasions I discussed with the Minister the question of accommodation and the queues outside the sub-post office.  The information I divulged to the Minister was quite clear and definite and I am surprised something was not done about it.

    <Speaker pid="SeanMcCarthy" hpid="Dr. McCarthy Dr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he will give details of how means are determined for those claiming means-tested social welfare payments; and, in particular, if he will state how these means are assessed in relation to ownership of: property, lands and provision of board and lodgings; and if it is his intention to revise and update these methods of assessment of means in view of the appalling poverty conditions under which many of these applicants are living.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>A social welfare officer interviews each claimant where a means test is required for the purpose of determining entitlement to, and the appropriate weekly rate of, a social assistance payment.  The officer obtains information on all items which, under the statutory provisions relating to a particular scheme, must be taken into account.  The principal items which constitute means are cash income, property other than the applicant's own home, investments and capital and, in the case of certain schemes, the value of any benefit or privilege enjoyed, such as board and lodgings.  Due allowance is made for items which are disregarded under the provisions of the particular scheme.</P>
      <P>The value of a claimant's home is not assessed.  In the case of other property personally used, the value of any advantage accruing to the person is assessed, for example, where the property is a farm the net profit from running the farm is assessed.  In the case of property not personally used, for example a second house, the current market value is obtained and this is assessed, as also are capital and investments, by applying the rules as to calculation of means as appropriate to the particular scheme.  These rules are set out in the Third Schedule to the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1981, and they are summarised in the Department's booklet <i>Summary of Social Insurance and Social Assistance Services.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where the claimant is a farmer, the net profit from working the farm is assessed <Col N="459" /> as means.  If the land is leased or let, the net profit from this is assessed as means.</P>
    <P>The value of board and lodgings, where assessable, is determined having regard to the standard of living of the household and the circumstances of the claimant. Assessments of means under this heading apply mainly to single persons living with their parents.  The amount of the assessment is subject to a maximum limit of 12½ per cent of the net income of the parents in the case of wage earning families. Where the claimant's parent is a farmer, the procedure is to estimate the yearly net income from the farm and to divide the amount between all members of the household, including the claimant, on a weighted basis.</P>
    <P>The objective of means testing claimants under the various social assistance schemes is to ensure that payments are assessed equitably according to need and that the best use is made of limited Exchequer resources in meeting the needs of those depending on these schemes. The various means testing provisions have evolved over many years as, indeed, has the entire social welfare code.  The need to review them was among the reasons for setting up the Commission on Social Welfare to review the entire social welfare system.  The commission will be reporting soon and all aspects of the social welfare code will be reviewed in the light of their report.  Any proposals arising out of this examination will be put to the Government for consideration in due course.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope we will get a comprehensive report shortly because the commission is a refuge behind which the Minister and his Department hide. Will he accept that there seems to be <Col N="460" /> an over-stringent calculation of means particularly in relation to small land-owners whose land is non-viable?  As he knows, small farmers have had to endure much financial hardship particularly after the bad summer last year and it appears that officers of his Department assess their means far in excess of the actual amount.  With regard to the provision of board and lodgings, will the Minister agree that this is discriminatory against single young people who reside at home, who cannot get a job and who are forced to sign on at the employment exchange? The fact that the parents of such people may have reasonable jobs does not mean necessarily that they receive any money from their parents.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMcCarthy" hpid="Dr. McCarthy Dr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have tried that avenue too.  The Minister may even tell me that the Commission on Social Welfare will sort out the problem.  On this matter of board and lodging, can the Minister say whether a precise figure is applied by the Department in general?  In other words, is it the position that when an applicant for unemployment assistance resides with his parents he is means tested on the basis <Col N="461" /> that his means are X amount as a result of being kept and fed by his parents?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>I have made my views known on this aspect of means testing. The rules are set in the Third Schedule to the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1981.  These rules were followed by the Deputy's party when in Government and they have been in existence since the inception of the scheme.  Where assessible, the value of board and lodging is determined in the context of the standard of living in the household concerned and if the circumstances of the claimant. Assessments under this heading apply mainly to single persons living with their parents.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy refers to those people who he says are living in appalling conditions of poverty.  The whole thrust of the means test is to ensure that the maximum resources are diverted to people who are in appalling poverty conditions, to use the Deputy's terminology. People in that category qualify for the maximum rates of assistance.  To abolish the means test at a time when resources do not allow for that would mean that those in the circumstances described by the Deputy would be treated in the same way as people who were, relatively speaking, in conditions that were not as bad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMcCarthy" hpid="Dr. McCarthy Dr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate what the Minister says but he has said that the means test in respect of social welfare payments was devised to cater for those found to be in appalling poverty conditions. From the answer to the first question we know that there are anomalies in terms of the means testing applied by the Department of Social Welfare and the means testing as devised and implemented by community welfare officers and health boards.  The Minister has told us his Department in respect of means testing decided in one case that the individual <Col N="462" /> concerned was not entitled to anything but that a community welfare officer investigating the matter found the person to be in appalling poverty and decided that he should be paid £70 per week.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>Entitlement to unemployment benefit is subject to the condition that a claimant must be unemployed and available for work.  The person concerned claimed unemployment benefit on 9 July 1985 after having been in receipt of disability benefit from January 1979. She had been found capable for work by a medical referee on 11 June 1985 and had appealed against this decision but her appeal was disallowed.</P>
      <P>On 7 November 1985 her claim to unemployment benefit was reviewed and a deciding officer held that she was not available for employment on and from that date.  In reaching this decision the deciding officer considered that the person concerned did not satisfy the statutory conditions pertaining to availability as set down in the Social Welfare legislation. She appealed against the disallowance and attended an oral hearing of her case on 10 December 1985 but the appeals officer decided that she was not available for employment from 7 November 1985.  She was notified of the decision of the appeals officer on 11 December 1985 and she ceased to sign the unemployment register from that date.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>As I understand availability for work it means that one must be fit and seeking work.  In the case in question the person provided specific evidence that she was seeking work.  She provided evidence also to the effect that relatives were available to care for her children but despite that she was denied benefit on the basis of non-availability for work.  Is it true that people are being denied unemployment benefit on the basis of unavailability because they are not trained or capable of carrying out the work available to them?  In other words, if there are no jobs for cleaners in an area and their training and ability is in the area of cleaning, then they are classed as not being available for the work available. Something very strange is going on, particularly in relation to women who are being denied unemployment benefit, having paid contributions over the years, on the basis of unavailability.  Something must be done to sort it out because it is no longer acceptable or satisfactory.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>The poverty trap is caused by a very complex interaction between the social welfare system, the taxation system and health, education and housing entitlements and it is, therefore, very difficult to quantify the extent of the problem.  Corrective measures have already been taken in the social welfare area through modifications to the pay-related benefit scheme and the introduction of the family income supplement. The proposed new child benefit scheme will have an impact on neutralising the relative positions of families at work and those in receipt of social welfare payments by giving a much larger monthly payment for children, regardless of the employment status of the family.</P>
      <P>Further alleviating measures will be considered in the light of the forthcoming report from the Commission on Social Welfare which is carrying out a detailed examination of this whole area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>The term &ldquo;poverty trap&rdquo; was first applied in Britain in the early seventies but to date little or no attention has been paid to it here.  Is the Minister aware that there are many families who when they obtain an increase in their annual income find that after deduction of tax and PRSI they are worse off and have less money in their pockets than before?  Because they receive a rise in their gross income they may also lose fringe benefits such as medical card eligibility.  It would be quite difficult to compute the value of a medical card for any individual because it would vary according to circumstances.  Is the Minister aware that this is happening? On the question of rents, when a low paid worker gets a wage increase his differential rent also rises and he ends up being much worse off, both in terms of final income and in terms of fringe benefits.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of problems in relation to this matter.  As I stated in my reply, the Commission on Social Welfare have been specifically asked to <Col N="466" /> look at the interaction between tax and welfare codes.  There is no easy answer to this general problem.  The possible solution proposed in the NESC report involving the tapering of medical card entitlements and income levies would result in a more complex system.  Steps are being taken and the commission's report will be eagerly awaited in respect of this item because it is a problem area where no easy solution is possible.  A number of proposals have been put into action which may help in some way and we hope to implement other schemes such as the child benefit scheme which would go towards resolving part of the problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that in a household consisting of a man, his wife and two children where income rises from £100 to £110 per week the final income actually reduces from £96 to £90 per week and they are £6 worse off as a result of the imposition of various levies and PRSI charges?  Is the Minister aware that in the case of a man, his wife and five children where wages increase from £130 to £140 per week their final income will be reduced by £10 per week?  That is the degree of loss in monetary terms, apart from the possible loss of fringe benefits such as medical card eligibility.</P>

      <P>I accept what the Minister says about the Commission on Social Welfare and I look forward with great anticipation to what they will produce. Will the Minister not concede that there is a general unawareness of the poverty trap and a non-acceptance by his Department of its existence?  I have shown clearly by the figures I have given that it does exist to a considerable extent. <Col N="467" /> Probably one of the main reasons for its existence is the method by which incomerelated taxes and benefits for families are administered.  For example, the Department of Health deal with eligibility for medical cards, the Department of Social Welfare with children's allowances and unemployment payments, the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners with income tax and pay-related social insurance and then the Department of the Environment with the local authority differential rents scheme. Because it is so diffused between four different Government Departments it has no spearhead or thrust in a single direction.  I am asking the Minister if he is aware that this is the reason.</P>

      <P>As Deputy Griffin said, I am totally innocent; I would not even think remotely about doing something like that.  The Minister mentioned earlier the family income supplement.  We all know that the family income supplement was one of the national jokes.  It was supposed to give benefit to 35,000 low income families.  It was introduced in October 1984, backdated to the previous September, to allow poor Deputy Bell a chance to keep on stream.  Does the Minister realise that of the 35,000 families to benefit on that date only 4,663 have benefited to date?  That is a discrepancy of 30,500.

    <Title>Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, 1985: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanGriffin" hpid="Mr. Griffin Mr. Griffin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Griffin</NameTxt>
      <P>Before reporting progress I had given this Bill an unqualified welcome because it contains some very positive provisions.  It is the first time in the history of this State that the term &ldquo;homeless&rdquo; has been defined.  Also it is the first time that each local authority must take responsibility for the homeless people within its area.</P>
      <P>The Minister urged Members to give the provisions of the Bill due consideration. The 166 Members of this House who are also members of local authorities, together with the Minister and Departmental officials, have a wealth of experience and expertise between them. Hopefully, we can bring forward a Bill that will meet the requirements of housing generally.  I feel certain the Minister will give consideration to and take cognisance of the various proposals and amendments which Members may advance so that ultimately a more rounded and equitable Bill will result.  I am glad he issued that invitation to Members to participate fully and no doubt they will.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would urge the Minister to give due consideration to the views expressed by the Simon Community, an organisation that has rendered great service to the homeless over the years.  They must have a wealth of information and knowledge about the problems obtaining in this area. If they have misgivings about certain provisions of this Bill then it would behove us to take them in tandem and, if at all possible, accommodate them, likewise any held by the St. Vincent De Paul Society, the itinerant settlement committees and all others who have been dealing with the problems of the homeless, the disabled, the aged and so on.  All of them have a worthwhile contribution to make to the formulation of this Bill together <Col N="505" /> with local authorities and elected representatives. As a consequence of the deliberations of all of these groups I feel confident a Bill will emerge that will meet the needs of the homeless and those seeking housing.</P>
    <P>I had been speaking briefly on section 8, urging greater co-operation between the various housing authorities, not only in urban areas within a local authority but also between the various local authorities themselves.  I was advocating greater reciprocal arrangements between these housing authorities.  This would mean that if a person residing in one area, for reasons of transfer of employment or otherwise, must move to another, that person would be accommodated.  Indeed, we might extend that provision somewhat further.  I have no doubt that that provision will be forthcoming, just as in the case of social welfare benefits, where there is a reciprocal arrangement for the payment of such benefits between member states of the EC.  If not in the short term at least in the long term, I feel confident that some such arrangements will emerge whereby people wishing to transfer from one state to another will be facilitated, that member states will make some payment in lieu of rehousing, in lieu of houses that have been left vacant in one state, their occupants having taken up residence in another.  However, perhaps that is looking a little too far forward. I would settle for greater co-operation and understanding in mutual transfers at the moment between urban and county councils and various county council areas.</P>
    <P>Section 9(2)(g) and (h) deals with the provision of houses for the elderly, disabled and handicapped.  Unfortunately, much is left to be desired in this regard especially in the planning and design of these houses.  Most of the residents of them are senior citizens in their sixties or seventies or even older.  I urge that a prototype house be designed by our architects. Surely it would not be beyond the capability of our design team of architects to design and plan a house suitable for the elderly, disabled and handicapped.  I have in mind doing away with steps and <Col N="506" /> the introduction of ramps and suitable handrails and supportive facilities to enable the elderly, disabled and handicapped to go about their houses.  I know senior citizens in my area who reside in senior cititens' houses and in each house is a conventional bathtub.  These people have never used their bath facility.  They are afraid they might slip in the bath and injure themselves and modesty prevents them from seeking a person to assist them when bathing or showering, so they have gone without using this facility.  These are little points that would make the houses more acceptable and beneficial to the type of people whom we aim to rehouse.</P>
    <P>Section 13 of the Bill makes provision for sites for travelling people.  I know this is a very vexed, emotive question. Generally, people are in favour of rehousing itinerants provided they are rehoused far away from those people's own private residences.  We can all come up with the most spectacular and loveliest of sites for rehousing itinerants, but invariably these sites are well removed from our private dwelling houses.  Local authorities need a great deal of diplomacy to reconcile the needs of travelling people &mdash; who live in atrocious and appalling conditions, especially the young people &mdash; with a duty to the settled community. Many a person has put life savings into the purchase or erection of his own private dwelling house, and it would be an injustice to such people if an itinerant halting place was placed alongside them. Whether we agree with it or not, we know that the value of land and houses adjacent to these halting sites has been reduced immeasurably.  Therefore, any housing authority must take the balance between doing justice to those people who need rehousing and to the settled community who have a right in law and in justice and are entitled to the enjoyment and pleasures of their house, the privacy of their home and the maintenance and value of their property if they have sites for sale.  Here the work of social workers who can assess the families who are in need of rehousing and are prepared to be rehoused and to accept the normal living <Col N="507" /> conditions and social graces of the settled community is invaluable.</P>
    <P>I suggest that halting sites to be established should be small sites capable of holding five or six families at the outset. A site should be well managed and discipline should be within it as far as possible and a fulltime overseer should be employed to see that it is properly regulated and managed.  All necessary services should be supplied, particularly a full scavenging service.  Voluntary bodies could be encouraged to participate in playing an active role in the maintenance and upholding of proper standards.  Only along this road can we eventually make any dent in the huge number of itinerant families and travelling families who wish to be rehoused, who wish genuinely to participate in the settled community in a housing estate or in a halting site.  With the co-operation of voluntary bodies many of the problems there could be avoided.</P>
    <P>Great credit must go to the national resettlement committee and the programme they have embarked on.  I have a list here of all the local authorities who have participated in providing housing and halting site accommodation for travellers and in the various schemes. The health and social welfare services are making provision for the service of the travelling community.  I hope that the general impetus of this will be maintained. It is encouraging that the Department will cover up to 100 per cent of the cost of these sites and the cost of rehousing itinerant families.</P>
    <P>Section 12 of the Bill deals with reconstructing houses in need of reconstruction. I have in mind in this case houses normally termed low cost houses build by the National Housing Agency.  In section 12 (2) of the Bill the Minister gives authority to reconstruct houses &ldquo;which are in need of reconstruction by reason of defects in construction or design or of deterioration due to age&rdquo;.  Each county has what I have referred to as low cost housing or NHA houses, and South Tipperary is no exception to that.  I ask the Minister and the Minister of State here <Col N="508" /> present to have a serious look at this type of reconstruction to find out whether we are throwing good money after bad. These houses have been a disaster.  They were built when Deputy Molloy was Minister for Local Government, and the design, shape and type of house are not suitable to our climatic conditions.  They had no solid fuel heating system.  They were supposed to be heated by electricity. At that time the price of a domestic unit of electricity was in the region of 0.7p.  It has gone to at least ten times that amount.  Now the bulk of these houses are without this heating system, and without solid fuel heaters the residents must rely on gas heaters which in themselves are a danger from a fire hazard point of view and I am told that, rather than doing away with condensation, they increase the incidence of condensation.</P>
    <P>Flat type roofs are not suitable for Irish conditions.  As well as houses, schools, libraries and other public buildings have been build with this type of roof which has proved a disaster and many have had to be replaced.  I urge the Minister of State and his officials to discourage the building of such roofs.</P>
    <P>It is becoming evident that many contractors are unable to build chimneys which do not smoke.  This is the case in Tipperary town, where they often need replacing. I would ask the Minister of State to have his officials check these out.  With regard to these low cost houses one must remember the enormous cost to the health boards in terms of medical cards and tenants suffering from bronchial, asthmatic and other chest ailments.  This must result also in a huge amount of officials' time being taken up in processing cases of people who wish to vacate these houses.  I hope that this type of house will never again be built here.  Certainly, the experience in South Tipperary proved that they are not at all suitable.</P>
    <P>Perhaps it might be better to take down these houses on a phased basis and replace them section by section rather than pump extra money into trying to restore them.  If they are to be restored it is absolutely essential that they include <Col N="509" /> solid concrete walls and have solid fuel cookers installed and that an A-type roof be placed on each of these flat roofs.  The services are on hand for the replacement of these houses &mdash; sewerage systems, site servicing such as electricity, water, telephones, roads and pathways.  I understand the moneys are quite generous &mdash; 80 per cent of the reconstruction grants, I am told.  I wonder could that money be better used in the long term by the replacement of these houses <i>in toto</i> rather than by reconstruction and the addition of missing items.</P>
    <P>Section 26 states:</P>
    <P>The City and County Management (Amendment) Act, 1955, is hereby amended by the insertion in section 2 of the following subsection after subsection (9):</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(10)  An emergency situation for the purposes of subsection (9) of this section shall be deemed to exist where, in the opinion of the manager, the works concerned are urgent and necessary (having regard to personal health, public health and safety considerations) in order to provide a reasonable standard of accommodation for any person.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I urge that this power be used very sparingly by all city or county managers and that they take into their confidence the elected representatives of their councils, to get their goodwill.  If it can be shown that works are essential there would be full backing of the council members who are always very reasonable and will accept the managers' advice in such cases.  They should not use the whip hand or bulldoze any work through against the wishes of the elected representatives.</P>
    <P>There are two other points I should like to raise, one being specifically about loans.  Many couples, unfortunately, find themselves in financial difficulties at present through unemployment or redundancy and indeed, not alone young couples but many in their early fifties with varied commitments such as commitments in relation to the education of their families.  Through no fault of their own <Col N="510" /> they cannot meet their obligations with regard to mortgage repayments and other loan repayments.  Inability to meet these commitments puts pressures on the families and sometimes leads to desertion and separation.  At the moment local authorities cannot do anything in these cases as the limits of repayment are laid down by statute.  Perhaps the Minister could encourage the extension of the lending period to enable the overcoming of this, it is hoped, short period of upset for people who up to now have met their commitments.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister of State to have a sympathetic look at the increasing number of these cases and instruct the county managers and those responsible for handling the loans to call in each applicant, decide on the merits of each case and work out a suitable arrangement over a period of time in order to avoid undue pressure on the families concerned. That would mean that the lending authority would get back some part of the loan.  Otherwise, the county councils would have to seek repossession in the courts, with all the attendant downstream evils.</P>
    <P>With regard to any new housing estate, the density of buildings should be reduced.  In Dublin and other areas a too high density has led to many problems, including vandalism.  Our planners, architects and designers should learn from past experience, resulting in more attractive, brighter housing estates, especially for the young people of our community. With the prospects of employment not being great in the short term, there should be playing fields and open amenity areas for boys and girls for sporting activities. Often many houses are clamped together with no such facilities.  It should be mandatory that in proportion to a certain number of houses there should also be a leisure amenity area.  This would reduce vandalism as the young people would be able to use constructively and not destructively the leisure time which they undoubtedly will have in the future.</P>
    <P>These are some thoughts on this very worthwhile Bill.  There are fine, positive features in it.  I hope that the views <Col N="511" /> expressed by myself and other Members will be taken on board.  If it is not possible to include them in this Bill, perhaps the basis would be set for future thinking on housing.  Among the 166 Members of this House there is a great reservoir of talent, experience and expertise which it would be a pity not to draw on or tap to ensure that we will have a housing programme suited to our needs and, above all, adaptable by the local housing authorities and encouraged by each local authority member to be implemented in full.  I congratulate the Minister on the introduction of this Bill, which I hope will be one of many to improve the lot of the homeless and others who need accommodation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I give a general welcome to the Bill and congratulate the Minister and his officials on its introduction.  I particularly congratulate Senator Brendan Ryan on the work he has done in the Seanad to promote the cause of the homeless. People generally do not know of the difficulties from which the homeless suffer.  I was amazed when I read documentation from the Galway Simon Community in regard to their problems in Galway and throughout the country.  Last year there were 3,000 homeless people, sleeping rough and from information I got from the Simon Community I can tell the House that those people are living in squalor and discomfort, some of them sleeping rough in cars, in back streets and in dirty alleyways.  The Simon information tells us of five young boys sleeping rough on a riverbank and of an old woman sleeping in an alleyway.  This must naturally lead to bad health, crime and psychiatric problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Simon Community have made a pre-budget submission to the Minister for Finance concerning the homeless.  I read an article in <i>The Irish Press</i> on 4 January which stated clearly the need for resources to provide proper aid for those without homes.  If this is not done the 3,000 people known to be sleeping rough will increase.  Therefore, next week in his budget the Minister will have to make an effort to reduce the level of need among <Col N="512" /> such people, many of whom have to pay for flats or other inadequate accommodation. Much of their supplementary allowances are taken up in that way.  I hope the Minister for Finance will consider sympathetically the submission of the Simon Community.</P>
    <P>First of all, I will comment on the quality of our local authority housing.  We have improved them remarkably, particularly the design, but we must look at some of our older houses in which, for instance, solid fuel ranges were not provided, or proper bathrooms or toilet facilities. This lack causes severe hardships among large families who have to pay massive ESB bills for heating and cooking. Galway County Council have sent a recommendation to the Department to provide ranges in 300 houses throughout the county.  Ballinasloe UDC have asked the Department to sanction loan finance to provide bathrooms and toilets in one estate in the town in which basic facilities are lacking.</P>
    <P>There is provision in the Bill for care for the travelling community.  Many of the travellers who have been allocated houses are without toilets or bathrooms and they have to spend a large proportion of their earnings on the provision of cooking and heating facilities.  I should like to spend some time dealing with the problems of those people.  For instance, the Department provide a 100 per cent grant towards payment of social workers among travellers in houses and halting sites, but the Bill does not provide for such a grant towards the employment of caretakers or supervisors in housing estates and at halting sites.  The Minister should listen to recommendations by local authorities that such caretakers would be treated in the same way as social workers.</P>
    <P>All public representatives hear complaints from people living in housing estates and social workers say they are not able to cope with this type of problem, that it is more a matter for a full time caretaker or supervisor.  I would like to see a type of community development programme in each housing estate where <Col N="513" /> travelling families would be allocated houses.</P>
    <P>Halting sites provided in the past were too big.  I would prefer to have halting sites confined to a maximum of five families and a number of such sites in each local authority area.  Erecting halting sites for 15 or 20 families did not work because too many people tended to congregate in a small area.  I recommend accommodation for a maximum of five, particularly if the Minister intends giving county managers emergency powers in regard to such sites.</P>
    <P>One problem which relates to housing &mdash; it is not the responsibility of the Minister for the Environment &mdash; is the insistence of the Department of Social Welfare on homeless people or those of no fixed abode travelling to a specific local exchange for unemployment benefit.  I accept that the thinking behind the directive in that regard is to prevent abuse of the system but I am aware of homeless people in some parts of County Galway who must travel up to 25 miles to an exchange to collect their benefits.  What is happening over the years is that such people move their caravans adjacent to the town where the employment exchange is located.  Why is it that the Department of Social Welfare insist on homeless people travelling a long distance to employment exchanges?  At times of bad weather those people will move to the local town thereby causing a problem for the local authority.  It makes sense to permit such people to sign on at their local Garda station like all other citizens who are unemployed and available for work.</P>
    <P>I have given details to the Department of Social Welfare of a man and his two daughters who must travel 25 miles each way once a week to an employment exchange.  That family left a housing estate because they were unable to settle down.  It was their first time to be housed. I am sure the Minister is aware of people in similar circumstances who should be entitled to sign on at the local Garda station.</P>
    <P>The Minister has outlined the type of <Col N="514" /> incentives he has given to the construction industry particularly in regard to housing.  He was kind enough to send us details of the achievements by his Department since December 1982.  He told us of his decision to increase new house grants, a decision we all welcomed, but the manner in which that grant was increased caused some controversy not only in regard to the starting date but also because the grant was delayed due to the increase in the rate of VAT from 5 per cent to 10 per cent.  We were told that the increase in the grant to £750 would offset the amount of the VAT increase and later it was increased to a total of £2,000.  The Construction Industry Federation have stated that the extra grant does not offset the VAT increase.  It is their view that the VAT increased has added £1,800 to the average cost of a private house.  They have also pointed out that the decision to increase the VAT rate has meant that 5,000 people lost their jobs in the construction industry.  I hope that decision in last year's budget will be reversed next week and I call on the Minister for Finance to do that.  It is adding to the cost of housing.</P>
    <P>I had hoped that the decision to increase the amount of the grant would be accompanied by a decision to pay the grant in instalments.  People often have difficulty when they have half of their house completed and would benefit if part of the grant was paid to them at that stage.  House costs are increasing daily and the Minister should consider paying half of the amount of the grant when the roof is completed.</P>
    <P>There is a lot of confusion about floor area limits.  I am glad the Minister clarified the position in a memorandum before Christmas.  We now have a clear definition of a garage, an attic and a basement, but unfortunately in previous years people were not clear about those definitions.  They were told that they are in excess of the floor area limits and did not qualify for a grant.  To refuse a person a grant because he was six square feet over the area limit was appalling.  That <Col N="515" /> person may have been confused about what was permissible.</P>
    <P>One of the achievements mentioned by the Minister was in regard to the work of the Housing Finance Agency.  I dealt with the activities of that agency when the Minister came to the House for more money for its activities.  I welcome the fact that more money has been made available because in Dublin and other counties the local authorities were running short of funds.  Demand for loans from that agency has increased because of the decision to allocate a grant of £5,000 to those who vacate local authority houses.  However, I suggest to the Minister that the loan limit should be set at £27,000, the figure which applies only in special category cases now.  The income limits should also be increased. Many people are hoping that the amount of SDA loans will be increased in the budget next week and that the Minister for Finance will increase the income limits for such loans.  That scheme has been a great success.</P>
    <P>There is duplication in regard to schemes for housing the elderly.  There is a scheme operated by the health boards and local authorities operate an essential repairs scheme.  Most people in that category are applying for both and it is obviously duplication of resources if they are being referred from one to the other. All schemes for the elderly should be under one aegis and indeed more money should be provided for the elderly because the work carried on over the last few years has been very successful.  It is of great benefit for an old person to know that he or she does not have to get a contractor to do the work, that all this will be done by the health board who will appoint a contractor to do essential repairs.</P>
    <P>Grants for the disabled were increased under the home improvement grants and good work has been done in that area. However, disabled people find it hard to understand why they cannot get an extra grant for building a specially adapted new house.  If they are under the floor area limits they will get a maximum grant of <Col N="516" /> only £2,000.  I am sure the Minister agrees that it costs a lot of money to build a new house for a disabled person and that they should get more assistance.</P>
    <P>A number of sections in the Bill have caused concern.  The Simon Community have said that section 2 is a bit vague and perhaps the Minister will clarify the intentionality clause mentioned.  Section 11 (2) (b) mentions people who deliberately depress their housing conditions in order to improve their prospects of obtaining a house.  I wonder how a housing inspector could prove that.  Perhaps some people would go so far as to depress their housing conditions but a housing officer would find it hard to establish that.  I spoke earlier about families who might have to leave a house because of difficulties in an estate.  Could they look for a transfer or would they have to go back on the housing list.?</P>
    <P>Section 4 mentions the extra grant of £5,000 for members of the Defence Forces.  In this context I should like to mention members of the Garda who have been fighting a battle with the Department of Justice in regard to buying their own houses.  They have a conciliation and arbitration scheme to work out how houses could be bought by gardaí who find it difficult to get housing in small towns.  Section 5 deals with the recouping to local authorities of loans assistance and charges.  I should like to see the rural housing organisation included because they are a non-profit body as described in the Bill.  They provide very good housing at a reasonable cost throughout the west and mid-west.  I have already covered section 6 which deals with caretakers and supervisors who are essential in any type of accommodation for homeless people or travellers.</P>
    <P>Section 8 deals with housing.  I appeal to the Minister to initiate a crash programme for houses in rural areas.  I know that the record of local authorities is very good as is that of the Department in regard to public housing.  However, there has been neglect in rural areas and no small schemes have been provided. There are not enough grants for isolated houses for families who have a site.  The <Col N="517" /> Minister should also ask local authorities to build four-bedroomed houses because three-bedroomed houses tend to get overcrowded and people then look for grants to extend them.  Local authorities own many serviced sites which they should advertise for building purposes. People in towns have great difficulty in getting a site and perhaps local authorities could help in that regard.</P>
    <P>Section 26 gives a manager powers in an emergency to go over the heads of local councillors and I am opposed to that provision.  I have already stated that halting sites should be small and I tried to impress that on the Minister.  Deputy Griffin said that he hoped that the manager would not use this except on very rare occasions but the section is there and people are concerned about it.  If every political party believes that local councillors should have more powers and more authority given to them they must realise that this section is in conflict with that kind of thinking.  If every local authority had a housing committee to deal with the question of travellers or the homeless I am sure they would be able to get smaller sites which could be identified more readily than one big site.  That would solve some of the problems and there would not be any need for this section.</P>
    <P>The report by the construction industry for 1984-85 mentioned the type of incentives given to the housing industry, the increase in loans and the increase in income limits for SDA loans.  They mentioned the £5,000 subsidy for local authority tenants to buy houses, the increase in the new house grant to £2,000, the removal of the clawback of stock relief and tax incentives for refurbishment. There were about six points they welcomed in the history of this Government but naturally there were more than six on the debit side and they were very critical of them.  I have already mentioned one &mdash; the increase in VAT from 5 per cent to 10 per cent.  This has had an effect on the price of houses and employment in the housing industry.  They also referred to the cut in the public capital programme, the abolition of the wet time scheme, the virtual abolition of section 23 incentives <Col N="518" /> from April 1984, the reduction in mortgage interest relief, the introduction of a residential property tax and the increase of PRSI for employers.  One item they feel very strongly about is the planning and development charges which are causing serious problems especially where people have to reapply for planning permission.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>The planning charges are unfair to the development and construction industry and the Minister should look at cases where people have to reapply because the local authorities keep all the development fees.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, I welcome the general provisions of this Bill.  This Bill deals with categories of people, the homeless and travellers in particular.  I welcome what the Minister and other Deputies have said about it.  The Minister spoke about grants for refurbishing houses under the new house improvement grant scheme but I would like him to look at the problems people face when they have to put down the name of a contractor when applying for a grant.  I do not see why the Department will not accept an application form without the name of the contractor because it takes time for people to get tenders and quotations for the work which needs to be done.  As Deputies we do not speak often enough about the homeless, the travellers and the aged and I am glad this framework is being established to ensure that local authorities have a housing programme for these people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill has been welcomed by all.  When it was introduced in the previous session the Minister outlined the main purposes of the Bill &mdash; to revise and update the statutory framework, to entrust the housing authorities with additional responsibilities and powers and to provide backing for grant subsidies and so on.  He also included a number of amendments to the housing quota.  This <Col N="519" /> Bill is breaking new ground because it is trying to provide for people who up to now have not been housed in accordance with the law.</P>
      <P>A great deal of what is in the Bill is already the practice in many local authorities. Most of the good work done by local authorities has been included in this Bill.  Representatives of voluntary bodies have spoken very favourably about the positive features of the Bill.  They particularly welcome the first attempt to provide a legislative framework for the homeless. This is a positive and constructive development on which the Minister and the Government are to be congratulated.</P>
      <P>People concerned with the homeless, the Simon Community, have put a great deal of work into this area.  They, too, welcome this Bill and point out the pleasing features in it but they have some reservations.  They are concerned about the definition of &ldquo;homeless&rdquo; and other aspects of the responsibilities which will now fall on county managers.  They are particularly concerned about the use of terminology which they claim has been borrowed from British legislation.  In particular they are disturbed by the use of &ldquo;independent living&rdquo;.  I have regard for their reservations and if the Minister can facilitate them by coming up with some other wording it would be very much appreciated.</P>
      <P>As a member of a local authority I have found that the county manager and the councillors who review the allocation of houses give a sympathetic hearing to people who are in great need of housing.  I believe local authorities have been successful in this area for a number of years. Many of the grey problems which were highlighted from time to time have been eliminated.  Nevertheless, as has been shown in statistics published recently, there has been a growing number of homeless people.  In my office in Ennis the number of single people who come looking for local authority accommodation has increased enormously in the last three or four years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problem facing the local authorities will be the limitations imposed on <Col N="520" /> them by this Bill.  I appeal to the Minister to examine the criticisms made by such bodies as the Simon Community and the nuns who are closely allied with the social services.  They are very concerned about the definition of &ldquo;homeless&rdquo; people and the effect of &ldquo;independent living&rdquo; or &ldquo;intentional homelessness&rdquo;.  They say the duty on the local authorities to provide housing is imprecise.  They allege that this Bill allows local authorities to contract out provision to voluntary and other bodies but without guarantee of minimum standards.  Some local authorities could therefore provide for the homeless in very substandard overcrowded bed-sit conditions.  This should not be allowed.</P>
    <P>I understand major amendments may not be possible but the people who asked me to make representations are anxious that we include in the definition of a homeless person the words &ldquo;hostel&rdquo; or &ldquo;caravan&rdquo; and &ldquo;a person who cannot secure entry due to violence&rdquo;.  They want a time limit of three months after which a person who is ruled to be intentionally homeless may reapply.  They also want a requirement that an assessment as to whether a person is capable of independent living be made by a professional team of social workers.  I know that local authorities have employees who are social workers and in my constituency those people have been of great assistance especially in the resettlement of travellers.</P>
    <P>In Ennis we have a major halting site for travellers.  It will cater for 16 families and I am sure it will be successful after considerable initial teething troubles. The difficulties were highlighted on RTE on the &ldquo;Late Late Show&rdquo; much to the embarrassment of some people.  There was some delay in the occupation of the halting site but at present there are 11 families there comprising about 100 people.  This was worked out as a result of liaison between the county manager, the local authority and the voluntary bodies.  It was successful because it was a partnership but that cannot be said of this Bill which will not lead to partnership at the local level.  It is my view that it will be counterproductive.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="521" /> I am disappointed that the Minister considered it necessary in section 26 to amend the City and County Management (Amendment) Act, 1955.  The county manager always had power in an emergency to house people and I do not know why that matter should be highlighted now.  The housing regulations could have been used rather than including the provision in the Bill.  By giving the power to the county manager exclusively, are we not giving a greater power to councillors who can delay giving their approval with regard to loans?  I should like the Minister to reconsider this matter.  We should aim at partnership at local level.  I do not think we will improve dramatically the accommodation for travelling people without the goodwill of the community, the various voluntary bodies, the local authorities and the county managers.  The project in Clare has been successful because of co-operation between the parties.</P>
    <P>A problem has arisen lately, namely, the insistence of resettlement committees that houses previously allocated to travellers should continue to be used by travelling families in the future.  This causes a certain amount of stress, especially if the family vacating the premises have caused annoyance or problems.  It is very difficult to get a community to accept such a continuing arrangement.  More flexible arrangements should be drawn up at national level rather than at local level. The resettlement committees should consider the position that has arisen as a result of their insistence on housing a travelling family in one house in each <Col N="522" /> estate.  There is goodwill in the community in which I live and which I represent. We have made great strides in County Clare but, as pointed out by Deputy Kitt, the number of families has grown.  There are also numbers of mobile travellers who park their vans in prominent commercial areas in Ennis.  This is causing great disturbance and at times the help of the Garda Síochána is necessary to ensure that they comply with the law.  The genuinely homeless person is suffering as a result.</P>
    <P>The Minister is asking the local authorities to make an annual report but I do not know how this will work.  It has been the policy of local authorities to respond to needs and when councillors bring matters to their attention they conduct an examination of the housing needs in areas.  If local authorities have to submit an annual list they may overstate their case.  It will also give rise to another layer of bureaucracy, thus creating difficulties for the authorities.  The present system used by local authorities has worked effectively in rural areas, even though it may not work in urban areas.  Housing problems in rural areas have been eliminated and at the moment there are no long waiting lists of people seeking accommodation.  However, as the Simon Community have pointed out, there are difficulties for single people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13 and 25 together.</P>
      <P>In the last year there were more than 50,000 new applications for qualification certificates for unemployment assistance. Persons claiming unemployment benefit are advised of the need to apply for a qualification certificate about three months before exhaustion of their benefit.  If they apply when advised to do so they should be able to go on to unemployment assistance without experiencing any delay.  In general applications for unemployment assistance are processed in six to eight weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The need for individual investigation of cases and assessment of means by a social welfare officer, combined with the continuing rise in numbers claiming <Col N="471" /> unemployment assistance has, however, given rise to longer delays in some cases. Despite reorganisation and redeployment of staff within my Department and streamlining of working methods and systems, it must be said that the overall amount of staff available to my Department has not matched fully the huge additional workload placed on it in recent years.</P>
    <P>As regards delays in processing appeals, significant delays can occur where an oral hearing is necessary and particularly where further investigations of means by the social welfare officer are looked for before the decision is made. There has, however, been, in recent months, a considerable reduction in the time taken to deal with all appeals under the unemployment assistance scheme, including appeals which are the subject of an oral hearing.</P>
    <P>The improvement arises largely as a result of the appointment of two additional appeals officers at the end of 1984 and the appointment of a number of temporary appeals officers last May to deal with oral hearings of appeals by smallholders. In conclusion, I would like to emphasise that every effort will continue to be made within the available resources to ensure that unemployment assistance claims and appeals are processed as quickly and efficiently as possible.</P>

      <P>Old age pension is payable at age 66 years and this age can be anticipated by applicants who may in their own interests claim in advance.  Under the legislation claims to pension will be accepted up to four months in advance of the applicant's 66th birthday.  Claims which are made at the start of this period are, generally, decided and, where <Col N="472" /> appropriate, put into payment by the due date.</P>
      <P>Where transfers of land are involved, a certified copy of the deed of transfer must be produced.  The time factor here is not within the Department's control and, as in the case of pension applications, timely attention to this matter pays dividends in terms of avoiding delay in the payment of pension entitlement.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed unemployment assistance on 8 October 1985, following exhaustion of her entitlement to unemployment benefit.  Pending a full investigation of her means by a social welfare officer, she was paid the maximum appropriate rate of unemployment assistance on the basis of details furnished by her at the time of her claim.  However, she failed to co-operate with the social welfare officer in the investigation of her means and her claim for unemployment assistance was, accordingly, disallowed on the grounds that by failing to furnish particulars of her means she failed to show that her means did not exceed the statutory limit. She refunded all unemployment assistance overpaid to her and ceased signing as unemployed.  She claimed disability benefit from 25 November 1985.  Benefit was authorised from 28 November 1985, the fourth day of incapacity, at the weekly rate of £39.50, the maximum rate for a single person.  Pay-related benefit was also authorised from 16 December 1985, the 19th day of incapacity, at the weekly rate of £16.35.  All benefit payable has been issued on receipt of medical evidence of incapacity to 13 January 1986, the date of the latest medical certificate received.</P>

      <P>Under the terms of the urban fuel scheme, administered by local authorities in 17 cities and towns (including Dublin and Dún Laoghaire), mainly along the eastern and southern seaboards, persons in receipt of non-contributory old age and blind pensions, widows' pensions (contributory and non-contributory) and unemployment assistance recipients with dependants have automatic entitlement to fuel vouchers. The scheme is confined to eligible persons resident within the functional areas of the <Col N="474" /> local authorities concerned or to eligible persons rehoused by the local authorities outside those areas.  Persons resident in the Shankill area do not qualify under the urban scheme on residence grounds.</P>
      <P>However, persons in that area who wish to apply for fuel allowances may do so under the national fuel scheme, administered in Dublin by the Eastern Health Board.  The situation wherein there are two separate fuel schemes with different conditions for entitlement is undoubtedly unsatisfactory.  Proposals for rationalisation with a view to the introduction of a single scheme with uniform criteria of eligibility, based on need, are, however, under consideration at present.</P>

      <P>The unemployment assistance claim of the person concerned was disallowed on the grounds that his means, derived from the profit from his holding exceeded the statutory limit.  He appealed against the disallowance of his claim and arising from contentions made by him in support of his appeal, the case was returned to the social welfare officer for further inquiries.</P>
      <P>On completion of the inquiries, the case was referred to an appeals officer, who assessed his means at £67.30 weekly. The person concerned is, accordingly, entitled from 23 October 1985, to unemployment assistance at £32.75 weekly, being the appropriate maximum rate payable in his case of £100.05 less means of £67.30.  Payment will commence this week and all arrears due will be paid. Weekly payments will continue to be made as they become due.</P>

      <P>Where a person has at least 26 but fewer than 156 contributions paid at the appropriate rate since entry into insurable employment payment of disability benefit is limited to 52 weeks.  Every effort is made to ensure that claimants are notified in advance of cessation of payment.  All claims which are subject to the 52 week limitation on payment are examined as they approach the end of the payment period in order to make absolutely certain that there has been no change in the claimant's insurance record which would alter the duration of entitlement. Claimants are then advised of the forthcoming termination of payment and normally this notification is issued in advance of the last date for which payment is due.  Occasionally due to pressure of work and the severe limitation on staffing resources payment of benefit has actually ended before the notice could be issued to the claimant. However, this has occured in only a relatively small number of cases and every effort is being made to prevent its recurrence.</P>

My Department are, however, in the process of recruiting two additional medical referees to bring the cadre to 20.  The equivalent figures during the years 1982 to 1985 were, 15, 17, and 18 respectively.  All medical referees are registered with the Medical Council of Ireland and they carry out their duties under the general guidance and control of the Department's medical adviser.  Their main function is to express professional opinion on the medical condition of insured persons to enable deciding officers and appeal officers to determine entitlements under the provisions of the Social Welfare and Occupational Injuries Acts. I consider that in furnishing medical reports the medical referees fulfil the objectives of the Department's schemes in a satisfactory manner.</P>

      <P>The Department are at present undertaking a review of all their various payment systems with a view to providing a better service to recipients, more efficient administrative systems and greater security.  Preliminary discussions have already taken place with banking institutions and An Post who are involved in the payment of various social welfare payments.  An Post, through their country-wide network of post offices, provide a very acceptable level of service to social welfare recipients which would not necessarily be provided by alternative systems in the short term.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department's programme of computerising their major payment area is progressing and arrangements are being <Col N="477" /> made to ensure that their new systems will be able to avail of the most modern methods of payment.  The problem of security at post offices is primarily a matter for An Post.  It is understood, however, that within the post office network as a whole, considerable progress has been made in reducing losses due to robberies.  Security arrangements at all post offices including Tallaght are regularly reviewed and improved.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he recognises the hardship and despair which was caused before Christmas to pensioners, the chronically ill and disabled by his decision to reduce the Christmas bonus by 25 per cent; and if he intends to recompense this section of the community in the near future for the loss incurred.</P>

      <P>A Christmas bonus amounting to 75 per cent of the weekly entitlement was paid to all long term social welfare recipients in the week ending 7 December last.  In all some 524,000 recipients benefited from this special payment at a cost of £20.4 million.  This was the first time the long-term unemployed were included.  Some 105,000 persons are at present receiving the long term rate of unemployment assistance. Because of the consequential increase in the numbers benefiting from the Christmas payment and the limited resources available, the bonus was fixed at 75 per cent of the weekly payment rather than a double payment as in previous years.  This was the most equitable arrangement and the payment provided a very worthwhile addition to the spending power of both pensioners and the long term unemployed at Christmastime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Government are fully committed to protecting the living standards of social welfare recipients.  During the period June 1983 to July 1985 long term payments such as pensions have been increased by some 28 per cent and the long term unemployed have received an <Col N="478" /> increase of some 33 per cent.  The increase in the consumer price index for the period mid-1983 to mid-1986 is expected to be in the region of 20 per cent.  Further increases in the rates of social welfare payments will be announced in the budget.</P>

      <P>This Act provides for the implementation of EC Directive 79/7/EEC on equal treatment for men and women in matters of social security. The Act was passed by the Oireachtas in July 1985.  The views referred to were made available prior to the discussion of the proposed legislation by Dáil Éireann and were fully taken into account at that time.</P>
      <P>Section 24 of the Act states that it will come into operation on a date to be fixed by ministerial order.  As is generally known, the delay in implementing the Act is due to the fact that the trade union which has the highest staff membership in the Department has taken the view that the implementation of the Act cannot go ahead until such time as certain staffing issues have been resolved. Discussions are actively under way on this matter at the present time and it is the intention to begin implementing the Act as soon as these difficulties have been resolved.</P>

      <P>The urban fuel schemes have existed since 1942 in 17 cities and towns, mainly along the eastern and southern seaboards, and are administered by local authorities.

    </Speaker>
    <P>The national fuel scheme was introduced in 1980 and was designed to provide, on a uniform basis, for all persons throughout the State who are unable to supply their heating needs from their own resources.  It is administered by the health boards and under the regulations governing the scheme a person in receipt of one of the long term social welfare or <Col N="480" /> analogous payments specified in the regulations who is living alone or only with certain expected persons may be eligible for a fuel allowance provided that he is considered by the board to be unable to provide for his heating needs.  The schemes will continue in their present form for the 1985-86 season but proposals are being considered in the meantime for rationalisation with a view to having one scheme only for the whole country with uniform conditions.</P>

In about 123,000 of these cases couples have elected or have been deemed to have elected to have the income of both spouses assessed on the husband, giving a total of 738,000 taxpaying units.  The breakdown of the 738,000 by marginal tax rate bands is estimated as follows:</P>

If any further change in rate were to be made it would have to be applied on the same basis as the present <Col N="494" /> treatment.

      <P>I assume that the Deputy is referring to the export refunds paid on the export of cattle and beef from the European Community to third countries.  The level of export refunds payable from time to time is a matter for the Commission, in consultation with the Beef Management Committee.</P>
      <P>The principal market opportunities for &ldquo;downstream&rdquo; or processed beef products are within the Community, and are thus not affected by the levels of export refund.  As regards such market openings as exist outside the Community, export refunds on processed products are not directly comparable, for a number of technical reasons, with those on cattle and beef.  The test is, rather, what level of refund is necessary to enable efficient EC exporters to compete on third country markets.  I am, of course, concerned to see that the maximum value be added to our beef prior to export.  If any genuine instances are brought to my notice of efficiently produced beef products which cannot be marketed at the current level of refunds, I shall have the matter taken up with the Commission.</P>
