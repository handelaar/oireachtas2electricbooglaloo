    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. A. Doyle Mrs. A. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not the first effort. I think the Deputy will manage to follow the three lines I have read.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Bill proposes to amend the electoral law to ensure that additional sheriffs appointed solely for the execution of tax certificates will not take on the duties of returning officer at Dáil and European Assembly elections and referenda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The explanatory memorandum circulated with the Bill explains fully the purpose and content of the Bill and it does not appear necessary for me to make a lengthy statement on the matter.  Briefly, section 1 provides that in the event of a sheriff being appointed for a county or county borough outside of Cork and Dublin, the sheriff will have no function in relation to Dáil elections and referenda. Section 2 makes a similar provision in relation to European Assembly elections. Section 3 provides that a polling <Col N="2032" /> card, containing the statement set out in Irish and English in the appendix to that section must be sent to every elector including postal voters.  The statement will also be displayed on posters in and in the precincts of polling stations.  Presiding officers will be authorised to assist blind, incapacitated and illiterate voters by reading out the statement to them, where necessary, and asking them whether they wish to vote in favour of or against the proposal and then marking the ballot paper in accordance with the voter's answers.  These arrangements are identical with those made in relation to previous referenda on Bills to amend the Constitution.</P>
    <P>The information arrangements provided for in this Bill are additional to the permanent provisions of the referendum law under which copies of Bills to amend the Constitution are made available in post offices for inspection, free of charge, and for sale at a nominal charge.</P>
    <P>The Bill is a technical one.  Section 3 of the Bill is identical in form with previous similar measures.  The important part of the content is the proposed statement in the Appendix to section 3 which sets out in full the text of the new subsection which the Tenth Amendment of the Constitution Bill proposes to substitute for Article 41.3.2 of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>The effect of sections 1 and 2 will be to maintain the present position in relation to returning officers in the event of additional sheriffs being appointed for the purpose of executing certificates of tax liability under the Income Tax Act, 1967.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a matter of regret that the Minister started on such an aggressive note on this issue which, as she said, is merely a technical Bill to put the machinery regarding the referendum in place.  There is no question of any controversy about the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sections 1 and 2 deal with sheriffs.  This is also a technical matter and I have no intention of getting involved today in the rights or wrongs of the appointment of such sheriffs.  That is a matter for another <Col N="2033" /> day.  Suffice it to say that this structure of sheriffs was promised last October with a great fanfare of trumpets by the Taoiseach but has not yet been put in place.</P>
    <P>The referendum is a basic fundamental issue affecting society as we know it and all electors should have an opportunity of voting.  It is quite obvious, from the response given by the Taoiseach this morning to a query in regard to postal voters, that the Government do not intend to take the opportunity of giving all the electors an opportunity to vote.  I ask the Minister of State to assure the House that all voters who are disabled through age and illness, will be entitled to vote in the referendum and that the machinery to allow them to do so will be in place in time for the referendum.  Such machinery already exists and has been used in local elections.  In introducing this technical measure, the Minister of State should ensure that incapacitated persons should have the opportunity of voting.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister would also take the opportunity of clarifying the position in regard to personating agents?  Government parties are, regrettably, campaigning in the referendum.  Will they be using personating agents?  Are those involved in the anti-divorce campaign entitled to nominate personating agents?  Who is entitled to nominate personating agents to be present in the booths on polling day?</P>
    <P>I will not delay the House.  I appeal once more to the Government to allow the disabled and the elderly who, through no fault of their own, are unable to go to a polling station, to vote on a fundamental issue.  It is their basic human right to exercise their choice in this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a technical Bill and there is not likely to be any controversy surrounding it.  I am glad that the matter has been clarified in legislative form.  These sheriffs have been appointed for the purpose of ensuring that tax collections are done properly in accordance with the law and they will not have any role to play in elections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2034" /> I support the previous speaker regarding the right of extending postal voting to disabled persons and others who may not be in a position to vote in person. This is the most important referendum since 1937 when the Constitution was framed and everybody has the right to vote.  I hope that persons who normally depend on the election machines of the various parties will exercise their vote.  I do not intend to campaign in this matter, I will leave it to the intelligence of the electorate but I am concerned that disabled persons and those who are temporarily hospitalised will have the opportunity of voting.  I ask the Minister of State to give serious consideration to that aspect of this amending legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to add my support for the extension of the postal vote to disabled and handicapped persons and to those who are in hospital.  This is a fundamental issue which will have a far reaching effect on everyone, including the disabled and, in fairness, they must be given an opportunity of participating in the referendum.  This referendum should not go ahead unless every person over the age of 18 years is given an honest opportunity to vote in a particular way on referendum day.  It would otherwise not be constitutional to allow this referendum on the amendment of Article 41, which will have a devastating effect on 70,000 families if carried by the Government. I regret that the Government are proposing to campaign in a political manner&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, you may try to rule me out if you wish, but if you read through this Referendum Bill it refers to the item to be put before the people.  Seeing that I was deprived for two days of contributing to this debate, I must get an opportunity of expressing my views in relation to the contents of the referendum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy <Col N="2035" /> will bear with the Chair for a moment, as the Chair sees it, the Bill deals with the machinery for holding a referendum.  It does not form a platform or an occasion for opening up a discussion on the merits of the referendum or the matter which is being placed before the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely, if contained within this Bill is the actual wording of the proposal to amend Article 41, I can make a comment on that as a passing reference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair will not rule out a passing reference, but from his experience the Chair knows that passing references can very often develop into debates and can be abused.  The matter which the Deputy wishes to raise now was dealt with in the House this week and last week and was agreed to.  Certainly, it cannot now be re-opened.  That is only reasonable, as well being in accordance with procedure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>I can refer to referendum day.  First, the referendum should not take place at the end of June, before we know the result of the recent census. The facts from that census will not come forward until autumn in 1986.  That April census was taken at considerable expense, and I wonder at the unnecessary haste in putting this referendum before the people before they can be made aware of the facts arising from it?  Some people have mentioned 70,000 families being affected, but we would like to have the exact number.</P>
      <P>The referendum should also be postponed until the postal vote is introduced. People who have left these shores temporarily seeking employment should be given an opportunity of casting their vote in relation to this very important issue.  I appeal to the political parties, particularly on the Government side, not to abuse the free postage available to Members of this House and the Seanad in relation to promoting a particular aspect of this referendum.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree.  I know that you would be above reproach in this regard. You would never lend an Oireachtas envelope to anybody, no matter what issue was involved.  Deputy Flanagan made the point here last night on this matter and it should be investigated if Oireachtas envelopes have been made available to the pro-divorce group to promote their campaign.  In relation to free postage, will this apply to the referendum campaign as to general election campaigns and other elections?  If the Government side are promoting their side of the campaign, people with different views should have an opportunity to avail also of the free postal service, to convey their point of view, their concern and their objections to the changing of Article 41.</P>

How can the Government agree to deprive disabled people of their vote on this major issue?  It will deprive them of voting yes or no to a change in Article 41 of the Constitution. The result could affect their personal lives fundamentally.  Perhaps the Government want to ensure that the disabled will not cast their votes, which could be the crucial votes in this campaign, to defeat the Government's proposal.</P>

      <P>I wish to be associated with the remarks of some of the speakers who spoke on behalf of a postal vote facility for disabled people.  I listened with interest to Deputy Leyden accusing the Government of various kinds of connivance. I do not know if he reads the national newspapers.  One possible reason for postal votes not being available on this occasion is because it was abused.  Councillors of a particular party have been accused in court and, according to the newspapers, found guilty of abusing postal voting.  That is the real difficulty in which the Government find themselves.</P>
      <P>Postal voting was abused on the last occasion when this Government brought it in and it was also available at the previous election when this Government brought it in.  The generosity with which Deputy Leyden expects the Government to act amounts to bending over to accommodate his views at all times.  I must commend the Ceann Comhairle for his patience.  He is very accommodating to Deputy Leyden.</P>

As far as personation is concerned, this is a great opportunity for <Col N="2042" /> all the political parties to get together to provide personation agents to see that the poll is properly conducted.  Deputy Haughey, because he is not involving himself in the campaign, can make a generous gesture to the public by ensuring that personation is prevented.  The Fine Gael Party in County Clare would be quite willing to meet with the Fianna Fáil organisation and arrange for suitable personation agents to be at each polling station so that everything would be conducted fairly and above-board.</P>

      <P>I want to express my pleasure at the number of speakers who have so far supported the call for postal voting for the disabled.  This is a very important issue.  Legislation in the area has been promised over a long number of years and we still have not got that legislation.  Despite the fact that the regulations introduced last year and in 1974 were abused to some extent we should still have a scheme in place for this coming referendum.  No matter what scheme we introduce, people of one kind or another will find some way of abusing it.  The disabled should not be put at a disadvantage because of that reality.  I would press the Minister of State to introduce a scheme for the referendum.  Some speakers have already mentioned that the local elections scheme is in existence.  I do not know what the legal position would be in relation to implementing that scheme but some method or means should be found to do that.</P>
      <P>Dublin Corporation are at present putting together a new scheme of polling places.  I wonder whether or not that procedure will be sanctioned by the Department of the Environment in time for the referendum.  In my area in particular there are anomalies where people have to travel long distances because of old polling boundaries.  I would urge that that scheme be finalised in time for the referendum.  I hope the Minister will seriously consider the postal voting issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VincentBrady" hpid="Mr. V. Brady Mr. V. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>We cannot make the point strongly enough or often enough in relation to the disabled voter.  I am very disappointed that this facility of postal voting has not been extended to cover the disabled on this occasion.  One may ask why this facility was extended during the local elections last June.  I recall that when the Minister brought the legislation to the House he made the point that the Government were going all out to give every possible facility and to give rights to the disabled to enable them to vote by post.  We welcomed that on this side of the House.  There was unanimous agreement that the postal vote should be with us to stay.  It is most regrettable that <Col N="2044" /> that facility is not being extended on this occasion.  The reply given by the Taoiseach a couple of weeks ago to a question from Deputy De Rossa on this subject was that there was not sufficient time and the Government were still looking at it because of some abuses that took place during the local elections.  It is very obvious that if the Taoiseach had been sincere and genuine about this facility he would have seen to it that whatever the problems were, and they cannot be that great, would have been ironed out and got out of the way before the forthcoming referendum.</P>
      <P>Apart from the disabled, many business people and commercial travellers are away during the week on business and are deprived of their democratic rights.  I hope that the Minister when replying will give the House a much more satisfactory response than we got from the Taoiseach.</P>
      <P>The question of free postage has been raised.  It is not my intention to enter into the controversial aspect that was raised by Deputy Flanagan last evening.  I would like to know if free postage will be available to the parties and to groups who are involved in campaigning on both sides of this referendum.  It is very important that this facility should be made available.  The campaign will receive massive publicity but nevertheless the ordinary voter likes to receive the paperwork and documents from the parties or groups putting forward their case for either a yes or no vote.  I hope the Minister will clarify that point when replying.</P>
      <P>Personating agents have been referred to by Deputy Burke.  This is very important because we all know from experience if there are not personating agents at the respective polling stations there is the very great risk of serious abuse.  We must all be conscious of this.  Irrespective of how we approach the referendum, it is in the interests of democracy that the referendum should be carried out in a straightforward way and with the highest integrity.  The presence of the personating agents will certainly help that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The voters' register is a matter for respective councils and local authorities. It is well known, in Dublin in particular, <Col N="2045" /> that the content of the register has been to say the least somewhat inaccurate from election to election.  I know that Dublin Corporation in particular have gone to a lot of trouble to try to ensure that the register is up to date and is as accurate as it possibly can be.  Despite those efforts, unfortunately we find names on the register of persons who have been dead for three, five or ten years.  We find names of children of two and three years of age on the register.  This is most unsatisfactory. Although it is the responsibility of the local authority it is the overall responsibility of the Minister.  The Minister should take some positive step to ensure that that type of error would not appear on the register.</P>
    <P>I hope the referendum will be fought out in a very sincere fashion by all parties concerned.  It is with that in mind that I regret that all the electorate, the disabled, the commercial travellers, the business people and those who will not be available in their respective areas on the day of the referendum, will not have a chance to vote.  I appeal again at this late stage that, if at all possible, the extension be made to give that facility.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamSkelly" hpid="Mr. Skelly Mr. Skelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Deputy Brady, I regret the limitations involved in so far as incapacitated persons are concerned. In this day of high technology we should be able to extend the facility to persons such as commercial travellers and those who have to be away from home because their livelihood warrants that they do so, because they are employees and have not the freedom to delay their journey or to stay at home for polling day.  We should encourage in every possible way the democratic process to take place.  We should enable people to cast their vote at elections by making it easy for them to contribute to the democratic process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People on doorsteps have told me they did not vote because they were fed up, or that they could not be bothered, that the weather was bad, that they were feeling a little ill or had some minor errand to do on voting day.  I have pointed out to them that there are very few countries where people have freedom to cast their <Col N="2046" /> votes, in totalitarian states, or dictatorships, or in one-party systems.  The ability to cast one's vote is a tremendous freedom which was fought for.  Though the system here is imperfect and the voters' choice is not always great, we have a party system and the parties do not put up candidates at their peril.</P>
    <P>If the franchise were operated as it should be and if people want to have a say in the destiny of their country and their children, we must ensure that parties would put up unsuitable candidates at their peril.  Because of the system we have, however, an elector is really voting for the party, and even if an individual candidate is entirely unsuitable for public office, if he will not make a good representative, if he will not be a good legislator and even if he were to decide to come in here but not to perform&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I was making a passing reference.  If the voter does not exercise the choice very carefully and fully we will have a slipshod system and democracy, of its nature, will bring mediocre parliamentarians. I should like to see the voting system extended to its maximum. Physically incapacitated people who wish to exercise their votes should be able to do so.  We must make that possible.  I have met many incapacitated people who feel they are treated not just as second class citizens but as if they are mentally deficient, morons who do not count.  I get complaints from incapacitated people all the time.  Blind people have commented on this by wearing badges with the slogan &ldquo;I am blind but not stupid&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Paragraph 6 of the explanatory memorandum deals with incapacitated people or those who are illiterate, who need assistance.  Caution should be exercised here because we all know there have been abuses in the past.  In the past, disabled people and geriatrics who are hospitalised have been wheeled into polling booths which are often set up near hospitals <Col N="2047" /> and homes.  The patients have been collected and wheeled in to vote.  The presiding officers can tell patients how to vote, but very often they are in such a state of incapacity that they have no idea how to vote.  It is a terrible infringement of a person's freedom and a terrible insult to his dignity to be treated like a product or counted as a number.  In an election in which I was involved, I went around the hospital wards and saw supermarket tags pinned on the patients so that members of a certain political persuasion &mdash; I will not go into which party because all parties may be involved &mdash; would more easily be able to identify the patients whom they would bring down to vote.</P>
    <P>I have also seen wheelchairs which are made available in the hospital hidden the night before under stairways and cubby holes so that the first members of a particular party to arrive would be able to get the patients first.  I have seen old people being wheeled down to the polling booth.  I saw a 90-year-old man being lifted into a polling booth, held under the arms by two people, and they were able to walk straight into the booth and mark the ballot paper.  I heard others being instructed to call out a name and the electors did not even know which party they were voting for.  The patients had been indoctrinated or brainwashed during the campaign to vote for a particular candidate.</P>
    <P>My late father-in-law was a quadriplegic, paralysed from the neck down, but he was <i>compos mentis</i> and very alert until the day he died.  He told me that, as he was being carried from a hospital in Castlebar into a polling booth, a campaigner came over to him and whispered into his ear that the bishop had said he was to vote for so and so, or that the bishop had said not to forget so and so. He said to the campaigner, &ldquo;I will not&rdquo; and on his way out he said to the campaigner, &ldquo;I did not&rdquo;, not telling which way he had voted.  Even though he thought it was a bit of a joke, he was very upset at the way people like him were treated.</P>
    <P>To their credit, the Government have <Col N="2048" /> enacted many pieces of social reform legislation, and electoral legislation has cleaned up the system somewhat.  In a highly competitive campaign one party is goaded by another to come up with better tactics, better techniques to get out the vote, as it were.  Now, with the help of technology we should be able to make improvements and wipe out many of the anomalies that exist.  Parties go around collecting itinerant voters, but we have not catered for commercial travellers and others who cannot vote, either because it is cumbersome or there might be abuses.</P>
    <P>The Minister might have a look at the system whereby Dublin Corporation and perhaps other local authorities are computerising their registers to keep them up to date.  There is no reason why our registers should not be up to date at all times.  Deputy Brady referred to a matter that annoys and concerns all of us on all sides of the House, about people being crossed off the register, that children are put on the register and that there is duplication.  My wife and I were crossed off the register a few years ago and it was very frustrating to have to drive around the Dublin west area to find out where we could vote.  Deputies are aware of the many people who wish to exercise their vote but who cannot do so because of some mistake.</P>
    <P>By having a computerised register we could keep up-to-date.  Simply by making a telephone call the necessary changes could be made and a security system could be incorporated in it.  If a public representative wishes to obtain up-to-date information he should be able to get a copy of the computer read-out.  When results are tight in an election, seats can be won or lost because of mistakes made in the register.  If a few streets are not included that can mean a considerable loss or gain for the various parties.  I know that in the Dublin area the local authorities assign people to check various districts.  Like the postman who knows about the people in his locality, these people have considerable local knowledge. The percentage of mistakes in the registers can be significant and it should <Col N="2049" /> not be necessary to wait for a year before they are sorted out.</P>
    <P>Deputy De Rossa referred to the situation obtaining in polling stations and the review that goes on in county council and corporation areas.  Many people are reluctant to go to the trouble to vote. This may be because they are fed up with all of us and with the system, or perhaps they may be suffering because of the recession.  If a polling station is situated too far away from them, and particularly if they have to pass another station, they will not exercise their right to vote.  I know of one or two estates in Dublin and for the past three elections as a protest there was no vote cast by the people in those estates.  I am not talking about ten or 20 houses but up to 1,000 houses where the people would not go out to vote.  If they have young children, if the weather is inclement, or if the polling station is distant, many citizens will not bother to vote.</P>
    <P>All of these points should be taken into consideration.  The returns from rural areas, even in local elections, are very high but in some parts of my constituency the turn-out has been as low as 30 per cent and even in the general election there was a turn-out of only 50 per cent or 51 per cent.  That is a serious threat to the democratic process and we should give careful consideration to the problem.  In the local elections there was a 34 per cent turn-out in the Ballyfermot area and a turn-out of 50 per cent for the general election.  However, in another part of the constituency there could be a turn-out of up to 85 per cent.</P>
    <P>The question must be asked: what kind of people are not bothering to vote in such a crucial matter as a general election when people elect representatives to represent them at national level?  I do not want my remarks about the shenanigans and the competitive one-up-manship that has been going on in polling stations to be taken as a criticism of any particular party or branch.  I am only saying what has developed.  It is particularly degrading when the disabled, the illiterate or geriatrics are the victims of such tactics. <Col N="2050" /> I will describe to the House what happens. A convoy of cars comes to a hospital to pick up patients who wish to vote. Then two cars come out of a side entrance and block the way while a bus comes along and takes the remainder of the patients away.  All of that kind of thing must be stopped.  We may not be dealing with very many people but we must not forget that we are dealing with human beings and we must respect their dignity.</P>
    <P>We should ensure that the situation with regard to presiding officers is above board.  Members of parties should not be able to wheel in people to the polling stations or to be present when they vote. Presiding officers or people in authority in the polling stations should not be active members of political parties.  We should use the high technology and the computers that are available to keep accurate and up-to-date registers and we should extend the postal vote.  I know we have given that facility to members of the armed forces and members of the diplomatic service abroad in the past few years&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I should like to voice my concern for those who will be unable to travel to polling stations due to illness or disability.  They will be deprived of an opportunity of voting in the referendum. It is not enough for the Minister to tell us that presiding officers will be authorised to assist the blind, the incapacitated and the illiterate.  We must remember that a large segment of the population are hospitalised or confined to bed at home and, consequently, will be unable to make the journey to polling stations. Those people are concerned about this issue and, having had a lot of time to listen to the radio, watch television and read the newspapers are well versed in the issues involved in the referendum.  It is not enough to say that those people are being refused the opportunity to vote because there were abuses in the past in the postal voting system.  I have listened to one Member allege that a political party abused the system and I can recall that in 1974 in my constituency there were serious abuses which were not carried out by the party which I represent. However, last year, when postal voting operated for the local elections, we did not have any reports of abuse in my constituency.</P>
      <P>I appeal to the Minister to adhere to our request in regard to postal voting. Others have made a plea on behalf of commercial travellers and those who will be away from home on polling day on business or abroad on holidays, but I am concerned about the person who will be lying sick in bed and unable to make the journey to the polling station.  Surely the Department can arrange for such people to have a postal vote.  It is worth nothing that the issue being put to the people on this occasion is more emotive than a general, presidential or local authority election.  When a group from developing countries met a delegation of voluntary workers in Africa recently the first question they were asked was if there would be postal voting in the constitutional referendum. The Minister should try to facilitate those who are hospitalised or bedridden on referendum day.</P>

      <P>I should like to add my voice to try to impress upon the Minister the need to provide postal votes for the disabled, the handicapped, the old and the infirm as operated for the local elections.  Those who will be unable by reason of their business to cast their vote at their local polling stations should be given the same facility that applied at the time of the local elections last year.  I accept that there were allegations of abuse in some parts of the country but, generally, it worked well.  It is important that postal voting facilities are made available for this referendum because the issue is more important than most others that were put to the people.  I find it difficult to understand how the system can be abused because employers are responsible for certifying the application forms of employees who may not be able to attend their local polling stations.  General practitioners can certify on behalf of their patients whom they feel will be unable to travel to the polling station and all applications are scrutinised by the returning officer.</P>
      <P>I do not think we are entitled to take this right from such people.  The votes of those people may be a deciding factor in the outcome of the referendum.  I can appreciate that it will be difficult to distribute litir um tógchán envelopes in the run up to the referendum and to decide on how many either side in the campaign should get.  If a decision is made to make those envelopes available they should be distributed in an equitable manner.  I should like the Minister to establish how personating agents will be appointed.  It is my understanding that in the past personating agents came from the different groups but it is difficult to decide which group is bona fide.  However, I accept that this will be carried out fairly and my only plea to the Minister is in regard to postal voting for the disabled and others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mrs. Doyle) Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mrs. Doyle)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mrs. Doyle)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to express my thanks to the House for the way in which the Bill has been received and to thank Deputies for their <Col N="2053" /> contributions on this very simple technical measure which is designed to do two quite separate things.  In the first place it provides for certain formal steps to be taken to help the people about the proposal contained in the Tenth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1986.  As we know, the Bill will be the subject of a referendum, probably next month, although on the issue of the date there is a procedure to be followed.  Once the Bill has been passed by both Houses it is open to the Minister for the Environment to make an order fixing the polling day.  The day fixed must be at least 30 days after the date of the order.  I am not aware of the date but speculation suggests that it will probably be the end of June.</P>
      <P>The arrangements proposed are identical in every respect with those taken at each referendum over the past quarter of a century.  A formal statement is prescribed and this will be printed on all polling cards and on posters which must be displayed in and in the precincts of all polling stations.  The statement is prescribed in the appendix to section 3 of the Bill.  The statement is an entirely straightforward, factual indication of what is contained in the Constitution Bill.  It presents the subject in a totally neutral way with no attempts whatsoever to make a judgment or express an opinion on the merits of the proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second purpose of the Bill is to preserve the existing situation in relation to returning officers in the event of additional sheriffs being appointed for tax enforcement purposes.  At present the duty of conducting elections and referenda rest on the four sheriffs in the Cork and Dublin areas and on the county registrars in the rest of the country.  In order to improve the position in relation to the collection of income tax arrears and thus help to lighten the burden on the ordinary conscientious taxpayer, the Government have decided to appoint a number of additional sheriffs for this purpose.  It is intended that the new sheriffs will have this function only and, in particular, that they will not have functions in relation to elections.  As the electoral law stands, a <Col N="2054" /> sheriff automatically becomes responsible for the conduct of elections and it is only in cases where there is no sheriff that this duty devolves on the county registrar.  To maintain the present position, therefore, it is necessary to make a minor wording change in the electoral law to preseve this existing situation.</P>
    <P>Much mention has been made of postal voting and I find myself very much in sympathy with and agreeing with the comments and sentiments on this.  To introduce an extended system of postal voting for Dáil elections and referenda requires legislation.  I understand that a scheme which will allow for special voting arrangements for the disabled and, hopefully, other categories is being examined. The scheme will operate on the basis of applications made at the time when the register of electors is being drawn up. Obviously, it will not be possible to have such a scheme in operation in time for the referendum which is likely to be held next month and will be held on the basis of the April 1986 register of electors, a copy of which all Members have.  Therefore, only gardaí and members of the Defence Forces may vote by post at this referendum.  Many Deputies have asked why we had postal voting in the local elections last year we cannot have the same facility for the referendum.  In the case of local elections the Minister has the power to make regulations governing postal voting under section 82 of the Electoral Act, 1963.  For local elections we do not require specific legislation for postal voting.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies referred to abuses and expressed the view that we should not allow abuses to put us off ensuring that all categories referred to, particularly the disabled, are not disenfranchised.  I feel strongly about this.  We cannot allow abuse to put us off but I should like to point out to the last contributor that in Donegal alone two-thirds of the postal voting applications for the local elections were refused.</P>

We will ascertain the experience of other countries because it appears to be very difficult to draw up this legislation. It is my wish that we allow the categories mentioned to have a postal vote as soon as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. A. Doyle Mrs. A. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am stating a fact. I could go through every constituency but I was responding specifically to the Deputy's contribution and expressing my view as to the difficulties involved in regulating and legislating for what we all want.  I assure the House that I share their anxiety that adequate arrangements be made to enable the disabled and other categories to exercise their right to vote. I am on record as having said that and I know I speak for the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another important point made by Deputy Burke and the others was in relation to personation agents.  The arrangements for personation agents at this election will be exactly as they were for all other recent referenda in the last quarter of a century.  Under section 17 of the Referendum Act, 1942, any Member of the Dáil or Seanad may appoint a personation agent for as many polling stations as he or she thinks fit.  It is up to the parties to ensure that there is aequate representation in terms of personation agents.  However, no Member may appoint more than one agent in respect of <Col N="2056" /> any one polling station.  An unduly high number, in theory up to 226, of personation agents could be appointed for any one station.  By using this provision a group of Deputies or Senators could pack a polling station with agents and thus inconvenience or intimidate voters.  The provision has not given rise to any real problem at previous referenda and it is not likely to do so on this occasion.  The right to appoint agents to attend the counting of votes is vested in Deputies and Senators representing the constituency.</P>
    <P>Polling schemes were referred to particularly in relation to Dublin.  The making of a polling scheme is a matter for the elected members of the local authority and requires the approval of the Minister before it comes into force.  As a matter of convenience a new polling scheme is usually brought into force at the same time as a register of electors, that is in April of any year, If a new polling scheme is being proposed by Dublin Corporation &mdash; Deputy De Rossa and Deputy Skelly referred to this &mdash; it will not be in force for this referendum.</P>
    <P>Free postage was mentioned.  There is no provision for this.  Political broadcasting in relation to the referendum is a matter for RTE.  We have heard some horrifying stories in relation to illiterate voters.  Rule 18 of the First Schedule of the Referendum Act, 1942, sets out the conditions under which a presiding officer may assist the blind, incapacitated or illiterate to vote.  The rule applies where the voter is illiterate or does not request that his ballot paper be marked for him by a companion or the companion is not eligible to mark the ballot paper.  The presiding officer is required, in the presence of the personation agents if there are any, and no other person, to mark the ballot paper in the manner directed by the voter and place it in the ballot box.</P>
    <P>The relevant instruction is if the companion is not eligible to act, or if the blind or incapacitated voter does not ask to have his ballot paper marked by a companion, the presiding officer should in the presence of the voter and the agent, and no other person, mark the ballot paper <Col N="2057" /> as directed and put it in the ballot box. The agents present have the right to hear the instructions given by the voter and to see that they are complied with.  No other person is entitled to know how the voter wishes to vote.  The position will differ from station to station but the following general procedure is suggested: ask the poll clerk to take charge of the table.  If necessary ask him or a garda to suspend admission to the station.  With the voter and the agent, retire to the voting compartment or to a part of the station where converstion in normal tones can be carried out without being overheard.</P>
    <P>We are heading into a constitutional referendum.  In a democratic State a proposal to amend the Constitution, the basic law of the country, is probably the most important thing the electorate can be called upon to decide.  The present proposal is a very highly important one and an issue on which many feel very deeply indeed.  It is no secret that differing views on the subject are held by people within virtually every party in the State.</P>
    <P>What I would like to say to the voters is: listen very carefully to what is being said on both sides, consider carefully the arguments on both sides and then make up your mind.  And, above all make sure your voice is heard by coming out on polling day.  I cannot underline that strongly enough.  We have the franchise. Not to use the franchise is a major abuse of democracy.  We do not have to remind ourselves how people in other countries have fought for it and failed to get it.  I hope Deputies on all sides will join with me in this call.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to register my <Col N="2058" /> disappointment with the Minister of State's attitude to postal voting.  She said it would require legislation to implement postal voting.  We already have a system of postal voting which operates for local elections.  We have legislation before us now and the Minister should have taken the opportunity to introduce postal voting in this referendum by extending the system.</P>
      <P>The Government will be judged by their actions and not by their pious platitudes. The Government say they are in favour of giving postal votes to the disabled and elderly, but they are not doing so.  They are introducing a system with regard to sheriffs but no sheriffs have yet been appointed.  They are talking about this since last October.  They have been in Government for almost four years and they have not amended the law with regard to postal voting.  This Bill should be amended in the Seanad so as to allow for postal voting.</P>
      <P>At the end of her speech the Minister of State made a sanctimonious plea to people to come out and vote.  There are many thousands of people who will be unable to take advantage of this pious plea because of their age or disability. Over the past few months the Taoiseach has been asked by various Members about postal voting for this referendum. He has consistently said the matter is being examined.  He said that again this morning, yet a junior Minister says it will need legislation.  The vehicle for the legislation is in front of us and I appeal to the Minister of State to have this legislation amended to allow the elderly, the disabled and those who through no fault of their own find themselves unable to be in their constituencies on polling day to vote.  The Minister of State's plea would sound more sincere if she had taken the opportunity which this Bill provides to allow for postal voting.  The same form of postal voting which we have for local elections could be used.  There is no reason why it cannot be done and I appeal to the Minister to do so.  How many sheriffs have been appointed since last October?</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin North-West):</i> On the last day I referred to the number of families living in poverty now, caused in many cases by unemployment and in some cases by illness.  I outlined the experiences of many of my constituents. There is an urgent need to create employment and the Government should take immediate action.  The fact that we have joined the EC has in part been responsible for the high rate of unemployment, particularly in urban areas like Dublin. We got some benefits from our entry into the Common Market but we seem to have got to the end of those that came to the farmers.  It is time for the Government to consider renegotiating terms with the EC in regard to the creation of jobs.  Between 70,000 and 80,000 jobs have been lost in the manufacturing and service industries since we joined the EC.  Many businesses that were in operation when we joined the EC have closed down.  Very little is manufactured here now; it all comes in manufactured.  I have no doubt that joining the EC has brought this about and resulted in poverty and misery for many families.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People who have worked all their lives and have become unemployed through <Col N="2061" /> illness are being treated shamefully by the Department of Social Welfare.  Married women who have been employed for years and have lost their jobs and applied for social welfare are being continuously harassed by staff in the employment exchanges as to why they are not getting a job.  They are not very long on social welfare before they receive a letter from the Department indicating that the Department are not satisfied that they are making an effort to find a job.</P>
    <P>There are also widespread complaints about the medical referees in the Department.  They make decisions which would indicate that they take no account of medical reports from highly qualified specialists.  In some cases they do not examine the person who appears before them and yet write a report stating that the person is capable of taking up full time employment.  Are these medical officers fully qualified medical doctors?</P>
    <P>There are widespread complaints about the abuse of the social welfare system.  People who are not entitled are in receipt of benefits while people who are entitled have been cut off.  I refer in particular to the small farmers whose dole has been cut off.  Fianna Fáil introduced this small farmer's subsidy, described by many as the small farmer's dole. The decision of the Government to do away with this has put many on the poverty line.  At the time Fianna Fáil introduced this subsidy there was widespread emigration from the west, where a very high number of small farmers live. The subsidy was introduced to encourage farmers to stay on the farms which were not big enough to provide a livelihood. Many small farmers whose valuation did not exceed £20 were entitled to that subsidy. When I was working in the by-election in County Donegal, in which Deputy Cathal Coughlan was elected to this House, there was widespread concern among the small farmers there about the Government's decision to remove this subsidy.  Deputy Brendan McGahon raised the problem of the abuse and fraud that exists in the Border areas where people from the North took millions of <Col N="2062" /> pounds from the Republic in the form of social welfare payments.  Deputy McGahon also expressed his concern on radio and said that he had all the details of the fraud.  Has the Minister ever carried out any investigation into this?</P>
    <P>Some years ago Fianna Fáil introduced the supplementary welfare scheme as a replacement for home assistance.  This was a step in the right direction and was a great improvement.  But there is still room for improvement.  The community welfare officers should be given greater flexibility in the face of the increasing demands made on them.  The community officer has no authority to provide for extra special payments and this could account for what happens in cases such as I outlined when I spoke in this debate before.  I said that I hoped that the Combat Poverty Agency would, when set up, take account of this.  I am disappointed at the length of time the Government have taken in bringing in this Bill into the House.  When the Government came into office they abolished the National Community Development Agency.  It is most unfortunate that we have had to wait for over three years to have this Bill introduced in the House and I know it will be quite some time before it becomes law.  In 1982 Fianna Fáil allocated £2 million to fight poverty. When the present Government took office they decided not to honour the Fianna Fáil commitment but instead talked about their proposal to set up agencies.  This Government brought back a number of small grants which were directed to the voluntary organisations.</P>
    <P>I think we would all agree that the situation in regard to poverty is contributed to by the levels of education, job insecurity, health conditions, and the low rate of income, particularly where the family are on long term social welfare assistance and there is not sufficient money to buy essentials.</P>
    <P>This Government have a bad record in relation to poverty and it can be said that many Government policies have been responsible for creating poverty.  Under the National Community Development Bill a body was set up with funding provided. <Col N="2063" /> It is sad that the Government have seen fit to abolish that board on which there was a wide representation of voluntary organisations, such as St. Vincent de Paul.  That organisation are very familiar with the extent of poverty which exists in this country today.</P>
    <P>By dismissing that National Community Development Board the Government saved about £8 million over three years. This was part of the Government's policy on cutbacks.  I would like to pay a tribute to members of the St. Vincent de Paul Society for their tremendous dedication and work in the area of poverty, for their work among the poor and those affected by poverty.  The present financial constraints make the job of that organisation more difficult.</P>
    <P>There are many people who wait for the St. Vincent de Paul's representative to visit them.  In Ballymun alone there are 3,000 and 4,000 families waiting for the St. Vincent de Paul representative to give them a few pounds each week.  There is something seriously wrong with a society when people living in poverty have to depend on a voluntary organisation like St. Vincent de Paul.  Will the Combat Poverty Agency change the position in any way and ensure that people living in poverty will not have to depend on the small weekly donation from St. Vincent de Paul?  When the Combat Poverty Agency are established I hope they will not be just another layer of bureaucracy but will help all who need it and be free from red tape otherwise the exercise of setting up such a board will be useless.  There is a great need to identify those in need of assistance and the machinery must be there to give this assistance without delay.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to another matter which will have a terrible effect on our old people.  The Government decided in the 1986 budget to introduce a retention tax. This means the old, the sick, the most vulnerable in our society will have their savings taxed for the first time ever.  A case brought to my attention recently was that of a small self-employed shopkeeper who retired because of age and health. <Col N="2064" /> He invested his money in a financial institution and the interest was paid every month &mdash; £250 a month, or roughly £60 per week.  He is very worried now because he knows his interest will be taxed.  He will have to live on a mere pittance.  He does not get any pension or assistance from the State but it appears that from now on he will have to look for assistance from St. Vincent de Paul.</P>
    <P>Many old and sick people who got the free fuel allowance in 1984-85 were refused this allowance in 1985-86.  Many old, disabled and sick people could not understand why they did not qualify for the allowance this year but we all know this is part of the Government's cutbacks.</P>
    <P>Many people no longer qualify for the medical card.  Even though there are members in the household with serious health problems because of the income of the household they did not qualify for the medical card.  The health boards referred these people to the drug refund scheme.  Many of these people cannot afford the drugs the doctor prescribes and have no option but to do without the drugs or medicine.  Even if they did manage to pay for the drugs they would have to wait until the money is refunded and poor people cannot afford to wait until it is posted to them.</P>
    <P>There is also a need to review the number of diseases listed particularly bronchitis.  Because of our very severe weather many people are affected by bronchitis.  Such people should be entitled to the medical card since this would help to alleviate hardship on them.</P>
    <P>In 1985 the Minister for Health got great publicity when he said he was extending the double payment at Christmas to all social welfare receipents, but he did that at the expense of the pensioners because there was a 25 per cent reduction in pensions to compensate for extending the double payment at Christmas.  This was a rob Peter to pay Paul decision.  When Fianna Fáil were in Government they gave all old age pensioners the double payment at Christmas and they were the first Government to do so.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2065" /> Many young people who have completed their studies have great difficulty in getting employment.  If they are living in the family home and have reached the age of 18 they may apply for social welfare assistance.  Because they are living at home there will be a means test and more than likely they will be granted between £8 and £10 per week.  Many applications will be rejected because of the income in the family home.  This is deplorable because it means a young person of 18 years or over has no independence. In order to gain independence many young people leave home and live in hostels or local authority accommodation. When that happens, it costs the State a lot more because the local authority have to provide accommodation at a low rent and the health board have to furnish that accommodation at a certain cost to the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>During the Committee Stage of the Social Welfare Bill this question was raised with the Minister of State.  The Minister Deputy Pattison, stated that if they were to extend this scheme and abolish the means test it could cost the taxpayer an additional £30 million.  Many young girls nowadays get pregnant and this is a terrible situation.  Some of these girls have to leave home because they cannot get work and they cannot get social welfare while they are living with their family.  This should never happen. This is a matter of great concern and is a great expense to the taxpayer because when a young girl has a baby she is given the unmarried mother's allowance and she gets local authority accommodation which must be furnished by the health board.</P>
    <P>I am anxious to know what resources the Government intend to provide for the most disadvantaged people in our society.  We cannot think seriously of doing something about poverty if we do not outline the resources that will be available.  The main cause of poverty is unemployment.  In fact, it is the main cause of all the evils we have to tolerate in our society today.  At present the poor here receive incomes which are inadequate <Col N="2066" /> and the services and financial assistance provided by the health boards are also inadequate.  Cutbacks in the hospital services are massive particularly in this city.  As far as I am aware only one hospital in this city is on emergency service at night, and this is a great problem for the seriously ill.  Some people who are seriously ill have great difficulty in getting into hospital, as was outlined in the House by my colleague, Deputy O'Kennedy.</P>
    <P>Recently I called to see a woman in my constituency whose husband had died. She told me that she took him into a Dublin hospital and there the doctor decided to perform a slight operation on him but the hospital authorities told her that there was no bed for him, that she would have to take him home.  She brought him home by taxi and there she discovered that he was bleeding severely. She had to call her neighbours and he had to be taken back to hospital by ambulance. He was 77 years of age and she herself was over 70.  Unfortunately, because of the extent of bleeding the man died.  Had a bed been available in that hospital that man would be alive today.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>This Combat Poverty Agency Bill is one we have awaited for three and a half years.  It has been a political football between the Fianna Fáil Party and the Coalition Government.  We have seen the National Community Development Agency and so on set up and at last we have this Bill to establish the Combat Poverty Agency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will outline some aspects of poverty which I would like to see this agency dealing with.  There are many forms of poverty in our society and the most important one in terms of the scope of this agency is the institutional poverty that exists here which we have created by the various schemes we administer.  I will give a few examples of what I am talking about when I speak of institutional poverty.  Consider our higher educational grants system.  We see a means tested scheme whereby up to a certain level you get some grant aid and that slides down as income increases.  However, at very <Col N="2067" /> low income levels with parents on social welfare there is no extra higher rate of grant for them.  In other words, with all these schemes there is a point at which the maximum grant for board, lodging, fees and so on is reached.</P>
    <P>Take a theoretical income of £10,000. If you are below that you get the maximum but that is not to say that someone on £5,000 who is much more deserving of an even higher rate of grant than someone on £9,900 will get such a higher rate.  Therefore, we have a form of institutional poverty where, even though we may allocate more resources to higher education grants, those in great need do not benefit proportionately to their needs.  Therefore, I am somewhat sceptical of many schemes which represent a perquisite, an incentive or an aid to someone who is going to avail of the service anyway rather than bringing something like third level education nearer to the poorer sections of our community.  If you do not give educational opportunity to the children of parents who never sat for the Leaving Certificate, you are getting no nearer to bridging the poverty gap in the next generation.</P>
    <P>The house improvement grant scheme is another example of what I am talking about.  Here we operate a system whereby if you conform to the criteria, the nuts and bolts of the scheme, a registered contractor, not having got a grant previously and so on, you can get a grant of two thirds, but if you are a social welfare recipient there is no provision to finance the remaining third.  Yes, we have various incentives which are excellent in themselves, but basically they facilitate people in doing what perhaps they are going to do anyway rather than meeting the special needs of the people in the poorer section of our community.</P>
    <P>I am sure that you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, and every Member of this House have had people coming to your clinics who are on social welfare, disability benefit, unemployment benefit, widowed, a pensioner or whatever and need to get their windows replaced.  Say the cost is £1,500.  A grant of £800 makes <Col N="2068" /> it just as remote from them as if there were no grant at all because they cannot finance the balance.  Therefore, this new agency must see their role as reviewing existing schemes around the spectrum of every Department of State to see how we can bring the benefits of certain existing schemes nearer to the poorer sections.  In Britain up to 90 per cent grant is allowed under the house improvement grant scheme for those on social welfare because there the special needs of those who are on the lowest incomes are recognised.</P>
    <P>This Bill does not contain a definition of poverty.  The Oxford Dictionary's definition of it is somewhat subjective. My definition of poverty is people being unable to afford the most basic conveniences and facilities, a reasonable standard of living, a reasonable standard of accommodation and a reasonable standard of opportunities for themselves and their children whether in employment or education.  A basic necessity nowadays is electricity in the home.  People are in extreme poverty if they have not electricity in the house.  Yet the Department of Social Welfare have no scheme whatsoever to facilitate people who have not got electricity installed in their houses.  That hallmark of poverty is ignored by all the administration and all the schemes.  If someone who is living in a mobile home, a flat or a remote, very dilapidated house asks the ESB to instal electricity and the cost is £2,000, that person cannot afford it, and there is no scheme whatsoever to provide such people with what is almost a basic, human, social and economic right, electric lighting and heating.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I hope that this agency, once established after this Bill is enacted, will be a totally independent organisation who will be able to review in the same way as the Ombudsman the anomalous features of our administration code and pinpoint to the Departments of State areas where existing schemes bypass the poor, leave them behind and facilitate people who are only marginally in need of various group services and benefits. The new agency's most important initial role would be not to pioneer new areas <Col N="2069" /> but to review all the State schemes and pinpoint areas of institutional poverty and see how they can be revised to help the poorer sections.</P>
    <P>This morning I am sure all Deputies received a submission from the Cork combat poverty resource project.  They said they had met local representatives in Cork and that they were seeking substantial amendments to this Bill.  Basically, the point they make is that they represent underprivileged and unemployed groups in Cork and that they would like to see a direct role for those whom this agency purport to represent.  That could be in the form of direct financial support for projects put forward, perhaps by direct representation on the board of the agency or in an indirect consultative role.</P>
    <P>I hope that at the end of Second Stage the Minister or Minister of State will assure the House that their practical approach to dealing with underprivilege and property will be responded to when the agency are established because there is a great fear that agencies like this permit politicians to compartmentalise the problem.  When politicians talk about poverty, there is an instinctive response to set up an agency, committee or commission which will compartmentalise poverty into one area of thinking and do nothing else.</P>
    <P>There is also the danger that the agency will become a professional and bureaucratic organisation which will produce regular glossy annual reports full of statistics and good intentions, but which will not get to the meat of the problem which is to introduce simple changes in existing schemes so that there is a higher rate of grants for house improvements, a scheme to help people to install electricity and higher education grants for the less well off.  I hope the submission from Cork will be considered sympathetically and that various groups, especially in inner city areas, will be allowed to play a direct role with the agency.</P>
    <P>I should also like the Minister to ensure that the agency will try to establish centres in certain areas because there are many forms of poverty.  I accept that the financial form is the root of all evil but <Col N="2070" /> there is also poverty in the sense of loneliness of elderly people and of those who are extremely unhappy at being neglected by their families and at having to live in institutions because of their geriatric condition.  Money will not solve the problems of many people.  Without being too philanthropic, there are those who are poor in spirit and we should do something to help them.  For example, last week I visited a day care centre in a geriatric hospital where old people come in from Monday to Friday.  They play bingo and other games; they knit and crochet and these activities are very important to them.  If we take that analogy and apply it to the unemployed, many of whom are bored and frustrated, it is obvious that they have financial problems but that they also have other needs because of their impoverished position.</P>
    <P>I should like the agency to set up resource centres on a localised basis where people can go to get information about job opportunities, adult education courses, social welfare information and what is available from private organisations. It is very important not to see it in terms of a financial problem only and to recognise that there is a need to involve people in a community sense.  The Combat Poverty Agency should be able to utilise existing schemes to ensure that unemployed people could visit the elderly, extend meals on wheels, install burglar alarms and so on.</P>
    <P>One cannot deal with poverty without reflecting on the supplementary welfare allowance scheme because our response to poverty at present operates through this scheme.  The purpose of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme is to close the gaps in the system as it operates at present.  The role of the health boards, through their community welfare officers, is to help someone with funeral expenses or an ESB bill if the person involved cannot claim under an existing scheme.  The current State response is through the supplementary welfare system and, therefore, in examining poverty and the role of this agency we must look at these allowances.  There is a muddled policy in this regard.  It is <Col N="2071" /> subjective in its application between individual community welfare officers.</P>
    <P>For instance, in my constituency you can get different interpretations of the same regulations relating to the availability of supplementary welfare allowances and the same applies in relation to medical card approvals and free fuel allowances. There are a variety of circumstances in relation to people who do not strictly conform to a scheme but to whom mitigating circumstances may apply.  They may have a huge debt with the credit union or have run up bills because someone in the family is on expensive drugs which are not available under the medical card scheme.  All these needs should be dealt with.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and I wish the agency well, but if all that money was poured into supplementary welfare assistance and community welfare officers were allowed to be a little bit more generous, we might do something more practical and realistic for the poor. I hope one of the strong voices heard from the agency will say there will be no budgetary cutbacks in the area of supplementary welfare allowances and that they will use their influence to ensure that the training and instructions to community welfare officers will give the benefit of the doubt to recipients and applicants.  It is important that the agency are seen to be independent.  They should not be seen as another arm of the Department of Social Welfare or a propaganda unit of the Minister for Social Welfare.  They should have a clear, unambiguous and independent role.  I hope they will be able to take the inconsistencies and anomalies out of the supplementary welfare allowance code and ensure that poorer sections of the community get a meaningful benefit.</P>
    <P>When discussing the question of poverty we should pay an enormous tribute &mdash; not in any patronising way &mdash; to the voluntary organisations and charities that have been to the forefront in assisting the poor.  The Society of St. Vincent de Paul spring to mind but there are many others.  It is important that we go beyond <Col N="2072" /> lip service when complimenting voluntary organisations.  One of the targets of the agency should be to ensure that the Departments of Health and Social Welfare utilise the goodwill that exists in those organisations.  They should try to match the finance raised by voluntary organisations for different schemes.  I am mindful of the Radio 2 Lions Club appeal at Christmas for non-perishable goods and other appeals for toys at Christmas. I would like the Department to be able to say to charitable organisations that if they legitimately raise a certain amount of money it will be matched to the tune of 50p for every £1 raised.</P>
    <P>I hope the agency, and the Department of Social Welfare, will not be moving in one direction because it suits the administrative structure while at the same time charitable organisations move in another direction.  It is important that we have a convergence of the private sector and the State in those areas.  The State, through the agency, should complement the work of voluntary organisations.  At the end of the day it is important that we have a community response to poverty and not leave everything to the State.  We have failed to date to have any type of matching response to the charitable work done by organisations such as the Society of St. Vincent de Paul.  The State, when a need is identified in an area, whether it is meals on wheels, the provision of electricity services, heating materials or basic nutrition for certain categories should match the amount raised locally with a certain contribution.  That would give the local organisation confidence to do more good work.</P>
    <P>The problem of unemployment has been mentioned by all contributors to the debate.  Members have referred to the difficulties that arise as a consequence of unemployment.  There is no doubt that the black economy is a by-product of poverty.  Necessity is the mother of invention and people find that they have to work outside the legitimate system to supplement the meagre payments they get from the Department of Social Welfare. I do not condone that but such a situation is State created.  It is up to the <Col N="2073" /> State to respond to those needs.  The agency should go beyond a handout mentality and try to be more imaginative. They should carry out research into the number of people who find they must supplement their unemployment assistance by working outside the official tax and social welfare codes.  In some cases people deliberately break the law in that regard.</P>
    <P>The agency should prepare a scheme for casual work.  It should be possible to introduce in some part of the country such a scheme that will suit employers and employees.  Employers should be able to go into an employment exchange and take on a person for one day without having to deal with a mass of paper work or the employee being cut off the social welfare system for four or five weeks. It should be possible to devise a simple mechanism so that people can clock off the dole onto casual work.</P>
    <P>Another form of poverty that needs to be dealt with relates to housing.  The housing grants scheme, because of its two-thirds maximum grant aid, militates against the poor.  We should follow the housing benefit scheme that operates in the UK.  Under that scheme an emigrant, a person evicted from private accommodation, or a person who is without accommodation following the break up of a marriage is considered for assistance. Those people are considered to be in the poverty category.  The social welfare code should have some form of housing benefit for those who are homeless.  It should be in the form of a weekly cash payment over a number of months so that people do not have to live in impoverished conditions. The agency should deal with those matters.</P>
    <P>I hope the Government will ensure that the European Community come up with a more coherent response to poverty.  I accept that £17½ million was allocated over a four year period under a combat poverty programme and that the EC approved various pilot projects here. However, I consider that to be crumbs from the table and a haphazard response. <Col N="2074" /> We do not have an integrated Community policy.  There is no doubt, given our fiscal position, that there should be a Community response through the Council of Ministers dealing with social welfare. There should be a real response from the Community and it should not amount to more talk about training and retraining.  We need new ways to deal with the 20 per cent to 25 per cent of the population in the Community who are classified as being in the poverty bracket.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal with some of the anomalies in the social welfare code.  The agency should go one step further than the Ombudsman who pinpoints anomalies but does not deal with the need for changes in the social welfare code.  There are anomalies concerning deserted wives which in some cases lead to poverty.  It is grossly unfair that a deserted wife with a family can be refused a deserted wife's allowance by virtue of the fact that she left her husband of her own volition.  It does not matter that she was battered, beaten, or otherwise illtreated; to qualify for this allowance she must not have left her husband of her own volition.  He must have walked off.  That is a quite clear anomaly.  These people had no choice but to desert their husbands and often have to live in the worst possible conditions in hostels and mobile homes.  They should be entitled to a deserted wife's allowance or a separated wife's allowance.  I hope that anomaly will be prominent on the agenda of the agency.</P>
    <P>There is no point in bringing in a number of new schemes which deal with what could be dealt with under the existing codes.  I hope the agency can impress on the Department of Social Welfare the existence of another form of poverty &mdash; degradation.  This is, perhaps, the most insulting form of poverty.  It concerns the attitude of medical referees and of social welfare officers, but I do not wish to generalise or be unfair to these people who are doing a difficult job and trying to weigh up the balance and find out where the truth lies.  The balance should come down most definitely on the side of compassion and the benefit of the doubt should be given to the applicant.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2075" /> This morning a 61 year old constituent of mine came to me saying that his disability benefit had been cut off because he knows that he cannot work, being very ill and old.  That will be very degrading because he will be many months without the allowance before it is again paid to him.  That is a form of poverty arising from an attitude, perhaps, of a medical referee.  Deputy Barrett also mentioned this matter.  We are not just talking about money.  We are talking about attitudes <i>vis-á-vis</i> spongers, people milking the system, a mentality which ensures that the innocent suffer with the guilty.  I hope the agency will insist on training schemes for employees of the Department of Social Welfare, officers of the health boards and community officers to ensure that at no stage is any feeling of degradation suffered by the applicants and recipients of social welfare benefits.</P>
    <P>I hope the agency can deal with the grey and confusing area of young people between the ages of 16 and 20 years who are in and out of education.  There are a number of anomalies there.  If Deputy Lyons or I were the recipient of a disability benefit and had a child who was perhaps a slow learner in second level education and doing the Leaving Certificat at 19 years of age, once that child goes over the age of dependant's allowance, the allowance is cut off.  Child allowance payments continue until the child is 18 years old but those who continue their studies to improve their employment opportunities are victimised by these allowances being cut off.</P>
    <P>Conversely, there is also the unfair anomaly in the case of people who leave school early, have done the Intermediate Certificate but are under the age of 18. They are not entitled to unemployment assistance because one must be 18 years old to be so entitled.  These people between 16 and 18 years have no dependant's allowance, are no longer at school and are not entitled to any payment whatsoever. People who are at school later or have left school earlier than anticipated are at the mercy of community welfare officers, through the health boards, as to <Col N="2076" /> whether they are entitled to supplementary welfare allowance or not.  This is not good enough and it should be investigated by the agency to see whether arising out of the uncertainty, confusion and gaps in the system, there will be comprehensive reforms to ensure that those gaps can be plugged and cases of need dealt with.</P>
    <P>There are overall areas of discrimination that need to be looked at, in terms of the fringe benefits, free telephone rental, free electricity allowance and so on.  Why are widows under 66 years old less deserving than those over 66 years old?  That makes no sense.  That is not something which the Ombudsman can rectify because the Department are administering the scheme according to the way it is laid down.  I hope the agency will acknowledge that in many cases widows under 66 years of age who have six and seven children, and whose husbands died suddenly, have a need far greater than some widows over 66 years.  Those changes could be made.</P>
    <P>I ask the agency to be practical above all else, to ensure that they deal with the real problem and do not become a highfalutin, airy-fairy, ivory tower organisation who preach to all about what they should do, but do not get down to solving the problems.  They must remember that they are the creation of this House.  As a statutory body, they have more influence than the individual TD or the particular pressure group.  We have no lobby group for the poor.  They are without any pressure group or trade union so I hope that the agency, in these areas on which I have spoken, will act as a pressure group against poverty.  They will thus be playing a very important role.  There are many anomalies in other areas such as prescribed relative's allowance, free fuel allowance and such, but I understand the debate is somewhat limited and is due to conclude.</P>
    <P>I wish the agency well.  I hope they are unequivocal in their role and make an outstanding, pioneering contribution in terms of being outspoken, forthright and unambiguous on behalf of the poor of our community.  I do not want glossy <Col N="2077" /> reports, endless research and statistics which would get the agency into analysis paralysis, as with so many agencies.  I hope that the Minister, arising out of the report each year, can point to many changes being made in the schemes within the Department of Social Welfare and to higher education being brought nearer to the poor and that house improvements and adjustments to existing schemes will recognise that people cannot afford to avail of current benefits. I commend this Bill to the House and wish the agency well in their programme.</P>

      <P>Ag tagairt don Bhille seo um ghníomhaireacht do Chomhrac na Bochtaine, tá sé thar a bheith soiléir go bhfuil an-chuid bochtanais sa tír seo.  Tá an fhadhb chomh mór sin nach gceapaim go mbeidh an t-ochtar nó, ar is mó, an deichniúr atá luaite mar bhaill den ghrúpa a chuirfear i mbun na hoibre in ann an bochtanas san a réiteach.</P>
      <P>In paragraph 5 of the explanatory memorandum to this Bill it is suggested that the agency should consist of not less than eight and not more than ten members, including a chairman and vice-chairman. My contention about the exercise of setting up an agency to examine the poverty which is widespread right across all sections of the country at this time is that it cannot be seriously tackled by a group of eight to ten people.  The people who should be addressing this problem, and who have available the facilities and knowledge of each of the Departments in Government, are the Cabinet.  They must address the problem of poverty and must address the causes which are much more in line with the phrase &ldquo;prevention is better than cure.&rdquo; The Cabinet with the backup of the Civil Service, reports, advisers and consultants who have been appointed and utilised by the Government, should be able to address the extent of poverty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know what is hoped for by the setting up of this agency.  As I have already said, that agency could not be expected to address the problem and find solutions if the Government and their <Col N="2078" /> Departments have not to date found ways and means of alleviating the poverty which stalks this land.  I do not know how in the name of goodness this agency can be the equivalent of Solomon and all his glory.  What are the Government doing about the causes of poverty?  The Oxford dictionary describes poverty as indigence; want, of which there is plenty; scarcity &mdash; there is a tremendous scarcity of employment for people which is the beginning and the cause of poverty &mdash; deficiency of and deficiency in property, for example, as in small holdings throughout the country.  The poverty that exists in small holdings must be well known to the Department of Agriculture and other Departments.</P>
    <P>The dictionary also describes poverty as poorness.  Poorness and poverty are synonymous words.  Roget's Thesaurus of English words gives other names for poverty such as feebleness.  God help the feeble people at this time who are subject to the crime, lawlessness and vandalism which stalk the land.  We ask those feeble people to put their money into financial institutions and the Government then come along and impose DIRT.  &ldquo;Necessity&rdquo; is also used by that same Roget's Thesaurus &mdash; the necessity to do something about unemployment, the necessity to create an atmosphere of investment in industry so as to provide employment and thus help to eradicate the causes of poverty.  &ldquo;Scarcity&rdquo; is another word in the same terminology, scarcity of people's resources through loss of their jobs.  &ldquo;Empty purse&rdquo; is a very simple phrase for poverty.  The Government should be well aware that there are many empty purses at this time.</P>
    <P>To imagine, think or expect for a moment that eight to ten people in a new agency can solve these problems is unacceptable.  My colleague who spoke before me made reference to the social welfare code, some of which has not been updated.  Take, for example, the Unemployment Assistance Act of the thirties or forties.  Nothing has been done with it since.  Insufficient income is one of the basic causes of poverty.  One gets insufficient <Col N="2079" /> income by jobs not being available. One gets insufficient income when one is on unemployment assistance.  Young people living at home are presumed under the terms of the Act to have assessed income of varying figures from £15 to £24 and sometimes higher.  That is deducted from the allowance under that scheme of £33.85.  These young people have been given paltry sums.  I have had constituents insulted to the extent that they have been offered £1.50, £5 or £8 a week.  It was expected that their mothers and fathers would keep them.  That is insufficient income if ever there was a description of it.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Reduced circumstances&rdquo; is another description of poverty.  &ldquo;Reduced circumstances&rdquo; is similar to insufficient income.  Of course, it creates poverty. Reduced circumstances are the order of the day in recent times.  People who have lost their jobs and those who have mortgages have had their circumstances reduced and reduced.  They are a group of people we tend to forget about, the people who tried to do something for themselves and who became redundant. Their redundancy money was compensation for the loss of their jobs.  This was taxed in the first instance.  They had to account for the spending of every penny of it following which they are assessed for unemployment assistance.  If they do not have the receipts for the few pints they had over the bar counter, they will not get much compassion from the Department operating under the legislation they have to work under.  This is no fault of the officials.  They are only carrying out their duty.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Subsistence level&rdquo; is another description of poverty.  The number of people at or below subsistence level is alarming. This must be well known to the many Government Departments, in particular the Department of Social Welfare. Nevertheless, as I have said already, these magic eight to ten people are expected to solve all these problems.  In all honesty, it is more than an insurmountable task.  I am wondering what will be the outcome of setting up this <Col N="2080" /> agency?  How are they expected to do what the Cabinet, and Government Departments have failed to do?  They have failed to address the problem of poverty and its causes.</P>
    <P>The proposal to set up the Combat Poverty Agency is relevant to EC Directives. It is fair to say that in 1971 the Kilkenny Conference on Poverty concluded that one quarter of the population were poor.  It does not stretch the imagination or common sense of people to realise how much worse off we are in 1986, 15 years on.</P>
    <P>I am sure it would be reasonable to suggest that we could now double that percentage and say 50 per cent of the people are poor.  They are poor in many categories and strata of society.  The number of registered unemployed people in 1971 was 57,238.  The current number of jobless registered &mdash; I emphasise registered &mdash; is in the 250,000 bracket.  I said in this House that the real number of people unemployed is much closer to 300,000.  That has been confirmed in recent articles and statements by people who have studied in the matter in depth. We are told by the Department of Labour that there are a number of people in temporary employment schemes.  Otherwise the number unemployed would be 300,000. there are between 40,000 and 50,000 people involved in industrial training schemes, special job schemes, or other Government sponsored programmes.</P>
    <P>The Department of Labour indicated that 9,000 workers claim between £70 and £85 per week in return for two and a half days work under the terms of the social employment scheme.  The document <i>Building on Reality</i> indicated that the number would eventually reach 10,000 per annum over a three year period at a potential cost to the State of over £50 million a year.  Participants in this scheme cease to appear in the live register figures which are 232,000 at present.  I am not complaining about the social employment scheme.  For the benefit of people, for their morale, their well-being and their sense of identity, it is better to have them employed under <Col N="2081" /> the social employment scheme for two and a half days a week, or on a week on and week off basis as operated by various local authorities.  It is soul destroying for people to find themselves without jobs or without the prospect of a job.  It is only on that basis that I welcome that sort of scheme.</P>
    <P>The next most popular of the temporary employment schemes is the enterprise allowance scheme.  In all there are about 5,000 people involved in this scheme.  There are another 2,000 workers, on average, involved in the team community work sponsored by the Department of Labour or one of their agencies.  The Department indicated that the throughput under these headings is about 3,000 persons.  In addition, 5,000 persons are engaged in the work experience programmes organised by the National Manpower Service.  Like the social employment scheme, I welcome the work experience programmes for people with no hope of attaining jobs.  It is a short-term relief from the boredom and the feelings of hopelessness that are rampant and widespread among our unemployed.</P>
    <P>On average there are 19,000 participants in the social employment scheme, the work enterprise programmes, the enterprise allowance scheme and the community work programmes.  Subsidies are paid to employers which contribute to the temporary recruitment of about 5,000 workers.  There are 20,000 people being trained by AnCO at present.  They are doing a tremendous job in training and retraining but what is there for those people at the end of the day?  It is frustrating for the instructors, the officers and the administrators of An Comhairle Oiliúna that there is not even a 25 per cent guarantee of employment for their students.</P>
    <P>Taking all these special schemes together it is obvious that the Government are sponsoring in one way or another somewhere between 40,000 and 50,000 persons who would otherwise be claiming the dole and adding to the official total on the live register.  With many of these schemes it is like the <Col N="2082" /> revolving door.  One group finishes and another group starts the next month.  It continues in a merry-go-round of temporary employment, training and retraining but with no sustainable jobs in the end. How can the Combat Poverty Agency find a solution to this when the entire Government cannot do it?</P>
    <P>Mention must be made of the poverty that arises from the extent of emigration. In previous months a question has been raised by my colleagues and, in particular by Deputy Fahey, about the number of people who have emigrated to the UK or to America.  It is deplorable that we have not got a head count of those people in the CSO or in any Department.  Many people leave in desperation in search of employment.  As Deputies and Senators know from their experience in their constituencies, not just one or two people but three or four people are idle in many houses these days.  Can we imagine the frustration, the uncomfortable feelings that arise from so many members of one family being unemployed?</P>
    <P>A group of people from the Irish Centre in Britain told us recently that many Irish people now there drew the few pounds that were given to them at some local labour exchange and rather than face back to the home environment and the poverty in those households, they got on the boat in the clothes they were standing in and went to England to seek employment.  That statement has not been contradicted by the Government. The problem that causes poverty is not being addressed by the Government who are not making any effort to eradicate the causes.</P>
    <P>Roughly 50 per cent of those on unemployment assistance and benefit have dependants.  The increased numbers of jobless have swelled the numbers of poor in our society.  As unemployment has spread across the EC it has impacted on the nature and extent of poverty in each of the countries, increasing the number in marginal groups in society, but with Ireland's unemployment rate at 18 per cent compared to a European average of 11 per cent, poverty, deprivation and <Col N="2083" /> inequality have increased correspondingly here.</P>
    <P>Even if the increase were only marginally above that reported at the Kilkenny Conference in 1971 when only 57,000 people were unemployed, and now we are on the 300,000 mark, the problem of poverty has become more acute and complex, and I fail to see how the setting up of an agency under this Bill can be expected to solve it.  I will continue to emphasise that poverty is being created through unemployment.  This must be addressed by the Government.</P>
    <P>Certain urban areas, sprawling residential estates, have massive unemployment problems.  There is a cause and effect relationship between unemployment and the growth of social problems in underprivileged urban areas, including vandalism, crime and drugs, as an escapism from social and other pressures.  I am sure the Government have not been waiting until 22 May 1986 for me to point that out to them or for a debate on this Bill to indicate it to them.  It is no exageration to say that poverty is increasing instability in our society.</P>
    <P>That sentence could be analysed but it would take up too much time to do it in this limited debate.  It is no exaggeration to say that poverty is increasing instability in our society.  For this reason a concerted effort to boost growth, economic output and jobs must form the basis of the fight against poverty.  Close examination and analysis will be a prerequisite if we are to tackle seriously the problems of the underprivileged.  At the same time, I should like a clear commitment from the Minister and the Government that the many excellent voluntary organisations working with the underprivileged will be closely involved in the various research activities undertaken by the Government. It is not possibloe to have this matter totally dealt with by the Combat Poverty Agency.</P>
    <P>Recently, we have had requests for questions on the Adjournment here because finance had been cut off from voluntary groups who had been trying to do something for the underprivileged, the less well off, the poverty stricken in the <Col N="2084" /> huge sprawling residential areas in Dublin.  To cut off the lifeline of support from these voluntary agencies is no answer to the need to ease proverty, because these agencies had been trying to do something to save a society which is crumbling.  The experience and expertise which the voluntary organisations have garnered through the years of humanitarian work among the poor can be used in a very practical manner.  Close links will have to be forged between the work of the researchers and the needs of the people.  In this way we may avoid the danger of academic research being conducted and pursued on a purely theoretical basis, because a similar agency in the past achieved nothing but the appointment of people through friendship with particular politicians.  I do not have to elaborate on why that agency was set up and why people were appointed to it whose political affiliations were well known: even when they came on television they could not resist indicating their politicial affiliations.</P>
    <P>That is not the way to deal with poverty here, and if that is what is proposed in this Bill and the setting up of this group, the Government had better have another look at it.  I do not think it is possible to over emphasise the need for this matter to be pursued not on a purely theoretical basis, but I am afraid that is what will happen.  I said earlier that the Government must address themselves first to the causes of poverty.  This agency of eight or ten people will be expected to do that, though the Government up to now have failed to do it.</P>
    <P>The structure of the proposed organisation has not been clearly indicated.  In my opinion Government policy should be, but is not in this case, such as not to combat poverty but to prevent it.  That is the theme I want to emphasise.  Prevention is better than cure and it is well established that Ireland already has a surplus of State and semi-State bodies covering a wide and varied spectrum of activities, many doing excellent work but many more overlapping and resource consuming.  I acknowledge the Government's acceptance in May 1985 of one <Col N="2085" /> of the few Private Members' motions tabled by us which were not voted down by the Coalition Government.  In that motion we proposed that a number of the many different agencies should be brought together to eliminate overlapping and the misuse of financial resources. That was in May 1985.  The Government tabled an amendment on Tuesday night, accepted the motion on Wednesday night but they have done nothing since.  If the Government accepted 12 months ago that it was necessary to restructure and reorganise many of the agencies, is it not time that they did something about it?  That is why I question the advisability of setting up another body that may be suspect in its ability to combat poverty.</P>
    <P>What is this poverty we speak about? There is no doubt that the unemployed are poor.  The income of the person who does not receive a wage is often inadequate to maintain a family or even an individual.  The loss of status for the unemployed is deeply demoralising.  Can this Bill do anything for the jobless?  Will it lead to increased levels of unemployment assistance and unemployment benefit?  Will it change the attitude of the Government and the mainstream of society towards the unemployed?  Even if 1 per cent of those objectives are achieved it might be worth setting up the agency, but I am not convinced it will have any effect on the causes of poverty. It is a job for the Government and it will have to be addressed by them.</P>
    <P>As a result of this Bill, will we demand economic policies that will generate jobs? Will we address ourselves to the painful problem of unemployment that is long past being acceptable and that must haunt any citizen who reflects on the untapped potential of the country.  If the Combat Poverty Agency stimulates real debate on these subjects something worthwhile may be achieved.  At least it gives us the opportunity here to talk about poverty as a separate issue.  Discussion on eliminating the causes of poverty must be the principal thrust of this debate <Col N="2086" /> rather than setting up a board of eight or ten people.</P>
    <P>Our society and our economy are going through a period of great change.  It is obvious that our overly centralised bureaucratic structures are unable to respond with the necessary degree of flexibility to the challenges posed by a rapidly changing society.  I am not suggesting that the Government by themselves can create jobs for the 300,000 unemployed.  I accept that a percentage of people registered as unemployed are physically unable to work but that number is small.  I do not say that any Government could create the jobs that are needed but the Government should be able to create a climate that is conducive to industrial expansion and the creation of jobs.  In that way the root causes of poverty could be tackled.  It is quite clear that this Government have failed totally to create that climate for industrial expansion.  They have done nothing to restore confidence in the economy.  They have not given the necessary leadership.</P>
    <P>This Government will be remembered for many things.  They will be remembered for their broken promises, for deficit budgeting and for foreign borrowing. The latter two items were planks of their general election campaign in 1982 but they have gone by the wayside.  The priorities of this Government have gone completely askew following the Taoiseach's social crusade for contraception, abortion and divorce.  The Government will be remembered for these things, not for the creation of employment or the expansion of industry.  In an effort to divert the attention of the public from the economy they introduced these items of social change, as they describe them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps a limited number of people want that kind of social change but that is not the general view throughout the country.  Deputies opposite must be aware that people are interested in the creation of jobs and employment, but these are not a priority with this Government. I often wonder how Government <Col N="2087" /> Deputies respond to callers to their clinics who ask them about jobs for their sons and daughters.  Do the Deputies reply that such matters are not a priority for the Government, that divorce is their priority at the moment?</P>
      <P>The task of rectifying the budget deficit has been abandoned and this Government have borrowed more extensively than any other administration.  They may say that the rate of inflation has gone down and that as a result of tremendous pressure in the past two weeks by the Minister interest rates have gone down by 1 per cent.  I can tell Deputies opposite it is no solace or comfort to the poverty-stricken people to fob them off their referenda, with the drop in interest rates, welcome though it is, and with the reduction in inflation if jobs are not available for their children who are sitting for their examinations this summer.</P>
      <P>This Government will be remembered also for the many closures, liquidations and the contraction of enterprise and business.  It is well known throughout our society that at the first sign of problems in an industry the first reaction of this Government is to close it down.  There are plenty of such examples.  I am sure I may be permitted to refer to some of them.</P>

      <P>The hauling down of the Tricolour from the ships of Irish Shipping in ports around the world to the eternal disgrace of this Government was one of the saddest things which happened in this country.  There was no sense of pride or confidence.  At the first sign of trouble they close everything.  The Panamanians and Liberians are drawing the bauxite into Arigna and the coal into Money-point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>The lack of proper policies have contributed in an alarming manner <Col N="2088" /> to the poverty which stalks the country. Worse still, the Government have no solutions to offer.</P>
      <P>I have asked them on numerous occasions to encourage investment in industry.  The money in pension funds and financial institutions is invested in Government gilts and safe equity.  However, if we removed some of the barbed wire from the designated trust funds to encourage investment in industry and give a reasonable tax allowance to people who invest money, something positive would have been done to eradicate the cause of much of our poverty.</P>
      <P>Let me refer to another national disgrace. I remember that word was used in almost the same context a few years ago when it was described as a thundering disgrace.  I am talking about the closure of Cork Verolme Dockyard.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>It is just a passing reference. It is relevant to the cause of poverty in the Cork area.  The last ship that was built in that dockyard was the pride of this nation, the pride of the workforce and the design team.  It was the P31. We said so on 29 November 1984.  We indicated that it should be marketed around the world.  The Government voted down our proposal but this week at least four prototypes of that vessel are being built in foreign shipyards.  By leasing the design of the P31, which was named the <i>Eithne</i> the Government will get £1 million from each boat that is built. Our people are living in poverty as a result of the errors made by this Government.</P>
      <P>Institutional failure is to a certain extent responsible for the growth in unemployment.  I do not expect the Government to create jobs by waving a magic wand, but there are policies which could be adopted which would eliminate the cause of poverty by getting people back to work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problem of poverty is bound up with other socio-economic problems. Only by a profound reappraisal of <Col N="2089" /> society, its institutions and structures and emphasising the importance of involving all sections of society in the search for a solution, will we begin to seriously address the challenge posed by poverty and its related problems in the Ireland of 1986.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The late Cardinal Conway made reference to the comparison between dire poverty and relative poverty.  As I recall, he said relative poverty could be every bit as bad as dire poverty because people were poor in circumstances where others did not share the same poverty.  I do not know if that is entirely accurate.  When one sees young children on television suffering from dire poverty a short journey away, with distended stomachs and bulging eyes, one realises that there is dire poverty which needs to be tackled.</P>
      <P>Deputy Lyons referred to the causes of poverty.  One of the greatest causes is gluttony and avarice on the part of people who have but do not want to give away to those how have not.  That attitude has been encouraged by Fianna Fáil administrations for almost 16 years.  Badly needed resources to combat poverty and bring about change have been hocked to buy votes from the relatively well off. That is the kernel of the problem.  The reason why we give £34.95p to a single person living alone is that Fianna Fáil abolished the wealth tax, reduced the capital gains tax, minimised the farm tax, refunded the resource tax and cut down on the capital acquisitions tax.  They abolished car tax and rates.  They abolished all sources of funds.  Why?  It was not because it was the right thing to do at the time or because those who got that money particularly needed it.  It was to buy their votes.  One of the central problems we face in society today is that we cannot redistribute wealth without collecting it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Lyons said prevention is better than cure.  There was not much prevention in that action.  It is extraordinary to hear Deputies speak about poverty in the community when their party seem to be <Col N="2090" /> orientated towards those who are privileged in the community.</P>
    <P>When the combat poverty body was set up before it was abolished by the then Fianna Fáil Government.  I refute any suggestion that Sister Stanislaus had any party affiliation or that she was appointed because she was a member of any particular party and did not have a particular interest in poverty.  That is the implication in what is being said here.</P>

      <P>I am particularly concerned with one group within the community. I have raised it with consecutive Ministers for Social Welfare.  I have raised it privately and I have raised it in the House.  It is a well know fact that I have raised it in our own parliamentary party.  I refer to single persons in receipt of assistance of £34.95 a week, out of which they are expected to pay for their heat, light, rent, food and clothing.  It is true that they can get supplementary assistance from the health board if they are stuck.  But if a person on £34.95 a week gets a gas bill or an electricity bill which is in arrears and goes along to the health board with a bill for £50, they will be offered £10 or £15 off that bill.  In all honesty, how can we expect people to live on £34.95 a week?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know there are problems because if we increase that there is a relativity knock-on along the social welfare scale. But surely there should be some minimum <Col N="2091" /> amount of income that people are expected to live on.  It often happens that an unemployed or unemployable person lives with a parent who is in receipt of an old age pension.  When the parent dies that person is left with no income other than £34.95 per week and is at the mercy of the community welfare officer he may have to visit from time to time to get assistance.  It is a terrible situation and I hope this Combat Proverty Agency will address themselves to this group.  We cannot expect these people to survive on £34.95 a week.  They suffer greatly and if it means fighting every other section of the community to give these people special status without creating a knock-on effect, then we should do that.  It is not right to expect people to live on that amount of money.</P>
    <P>For seven months, I was Opposition spokesman on health board reform.  I am not happy with the performance of the health boards, particularly in assisting people who are in a poverty trap.  Too much depends on the community officer of the day as to whether he will or will not help people who are badly in need.  I accept that there are many people who are coming in and abusing the system but there are many who are not abusing the system and they do not always get the reception they deserve.  The problem is that the health boards are not answerable to the Dáil directly because the Minister does not have a day to day responsibility for them, and they are not answerable to the local authority.  They are a sort of hybrid body with representation from doctors and public representatives operating away on their own, and because they are not called in by public representatives and held accountable, it is not possible to make them as responsive as we would like them to be.  If, for example, they were administered by local authorities, then councillors could call them in and ask them why they were not devoting more of their resources to helping the real poor.  I remember the setting up in Ballymun of a pilot scheme to examined poverty and we provided £100,000 to the scheme; £60,000 was gone in a flash on <Col N="2092" /> administrative overhead costs.  The whole question of the way the health boards go about their job leaves a lot to be desired.  I want to put it on the record of the House here that I want to see the health boards abolished and I am calling for that here today because they are not&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>This is relevant because they are not responding in the way I would like to see them respond to poverty in the community.  They do not have to, because they are not answerable as they should be to public representatives. They are not effective in helping those who are striving to survive.  There are many who are abusing the system but there are many who are striving to survive who only occasionally bother them but do not get the response they deserve.  I feel very strongly that we could divert more resources into combating poverty if the health boards could be made more responsive.  The way to do that is to put them under the direct scrutiny of public representatives in some shape or form.</P>

    <P>We all know there are people who are unemployed who suffer from poverty. But there are people who are employed who are suffering from poverty as well. Let me give an example.  There is a constituent of mine, a man and his wife and two children aged two and four, living in Crumlin who have a mortgage on their house and a small loan from the credit union.  The husband works.  But this man now has to give back his house although he strove in very difficult circumstances for the past 18 months to try to meet his commitments.  He now has to allow the house to be sold so that he can pay off the mortgage to the local authority because he simply cannot continue to meet the mortgage repayments and feed his children and look after his wife and family as he should.  Often this man comes up to Friday without any money, getting by skimping on food, by borrowing from his parents and sisters living <Col N="2093" /> nearby who themselves are not too well off.</P>
    <P>This is a man who is making the effort. If he got a leg up for may be 18 months or two years he would be on the straight and narrow and would be able to get by. But at the moment he is not able to get by, and he is working.  This man is paying income tax.  It is an obscenity that he is subject to a tax liability that he cannot afford while whole sections of the community protected by Deputy Lyons and his colleagues, farmers with more than 50 acres, are contributing damn all to the revenue resources of the country.  That is the reality of the situation.  People like this man are being crippled to carry the burden for large farmers who will not contribute and who are being protected by Fianna Fáil, among others.</P>

      <P>I am sick and tired of seeing large farmers being protected from contributing to the revenue of this country when young men and women have to hand back their house because they are paying tax and cannot afford to continue to pay the mortgage on their house.  That is an obscenity and, unless we have the guts in this House to bring about more social justice, this sort of thing is going to go on.  According to the Opposition everything is the Government's fault.  Nobody else is at fault; the civil servants are wonderful fellows; AnCO are wonderful people; they are all wonderful people except the Government.  Even Fianna Fáil are wonderful people.  That does not answer the problem of my constituent who has to hand back his house while farmers with more than 50 acres are being protected and are not contributing a tosser to the Revenue.  All that was taken up from them last year in taxation was £37 million, yet we handed them out a net £365 million.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>There are some big fields and they are not paying any tax on what they reap from those fields, before we include the hand outs they got from the EC.  The whole thing is a sick joke. The small farmers have my sympathy but there are large farmers on very good land not far from this House who are not contributing their fair share and are being protected by a ranchers' organisation which Deputies in this House are running scared of.</P>
      <P>Unless we are prepared to tackle these areas and bring in the revenue, people like my constituent will have to give back their houses and go into local authority houses where they will be further subsidised by other taxpayers because we are not in a position to help them to reach their objective which is to be self reliant. My constituent put a lot of sweat, tears and effort into becoming self reliant and now he has to lose that house.  If we in this House are interested in combating poverty we will have to have the courage to have equity in our system and that starts with tax equity across the board.</P>
      <P>That is my contribution.  I wish the Combat Poverty Agency well.  I hope they will try to tackle the problems I have mentioned.  I also hope the Minister will bear in mind my comments about single people living alone and the need for health board reform.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this Bill.  I also welcome the establishment of this agency and hope they will have the resources to deal with the increasing problem of poverty throughout the country.  The timing of the establishment of this agency is very relevant.  It is the Government's response to their failure in a large number of social and economic areas.  On a number of occasions in this House I said the level of poverty and deprivation in any country is related to the success or failure of the Government in the areas of economic and social reform.  It is my view that the present increasing and disastrous level of unemployment is one of the main <Col N="2095" /> contributing factors to the need for the establishment of this agency.</P>
      <P>There can be no doubt that unemployment is the major breeding ground for all kinds of social problems and is responsible for the greater part of the problems we face at the present in terms of law and order.  I had hoped that the Government, of any Government, would have identified much earlier the economic and social folly of deliberately creating an economic climate where unemployment continues to grow.  However, we must deal with the proposal before us and try to provide the best possible level of protection for those who are becoming more and more dependent on the State for support.</P>
      <P>I will give an example of the State's failure to provide adequately for those who are totally deprived and compare it with the work being done by the voluntary organisations and the response from the public to any worthwhile assistance for the socially deprived.  The response from the voluntary organisations and the people has not been reflected in the level of services being provided by the State.</P>
      <P>I did not hear the earlier speakers in this debate.  I have no doubt that, in addition to the establishment of this agency, there is a far greater need for the Government to streamline their own agencies for the purpose of dealing with the problems of those people who must rely on State aid and support.</P>
      <P>If one were to contrast the views and needs mentioned by the Minister for the establishment of this agency with the performance of, say, the Department of Social Welfare in caring for these same deprived people, I would have to say there is definitely a conflict of interest.  I am sure the Minister will agree that it is becoming increasingly more difficult for the people to get from the State what they are entitled to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recently I attended a seminar and heard from the floor criticism of the role of public representatives who pretend they are getting for their constituents what they are legally entitled to from various Government agencies.  I was <Col N="2096" /> asked to deal with that question.  My immediate reaction to what was a very well intentioned question was that it is extremely difficult for people to get what they are legally entitled to.  Members of this House and other public representatives have to spend an increasing amount of their time trying to get what the various State agencies should be providing for our people without any representation from grassroot level.  It must be admitted that to some extent the criticism of public representatives is justified because I hold the view that I should spend more time in this House contributing to the formulation of policy &mdash; I like to spend as much time as I can in this House &mdash; but, on the other hand, I see my role as a public representative as ensuring that the people who are looking towards Dublin, to the various State Departments, get the help to which they are entitled but which is not as readily forthcoming as it should be.  This applies particularly to the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>In my last contribution I asked the Minister to give serious consideration to totally decentralising the Department of Social Welfare in order to streamline the efficiency of the Department in the first instance, but, more importantly, for the purpose of making the Department more easily accessible to the people who look to the Department for help.  This Government spend a lot of time talking about the reorganisation of the Government services but has there been any reorganisation in the Department of Social Welfare? Never was it more difficult for an individual applicant to have his unemployment assistance claim, his unemployment benefit claim, or any other social welfare claim processed within a reasonable period.  We have evidence of that in this House day after day at Question Time when Deputies find it necessary to table questions to the Minister for Social Welfare about the Department's delay in dealing with legitimate unemployment assistance claims.  To prove my point, my invariable experience is that when I table a question in relation to some aspect of social welfare I get an immediate response.  I am not saying that the <Col N="2097" /> response is always favourable in terms of the applicant having the claim granted, but at least the applicant will know how he or she stands in regard to that claim.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I ask the Minister to set up some study group or whatever he has to do to consider this.  I do not know what Ministers have to do in such situations.  I am not an expert on any kind of reform within Government Departments, but it would not take a great deal of intelligence or foresight to envisage Department branches in each county receiving applications, processing them, having them investigated and making decisions in relation to individual applications. OK, it might be necessary for centralised Government to arrange for the payment, but I have no doubt that this is a major area where reform is needed at present.</P>
    <P>I want to bring to the Minister's notice that, while he is bringing in this very welcome legislation, under various other agencies under the control of Government Departments people are being forced into poverty.  Earlier, speakers in this House referred to recent decisions. For example, the decision to terminate and cut out clinic transport affects the poorest section of our community.  At present people in my constituency find it necessary to attend, say, the county clinic in Portlaoise and have no transport of any kind of their own.  They reside in remote parts of the constituency, many of them old people who rely on the generosity of a neighbour to drive them to the clinic for the regular medical attention which they require.  What is the use of talking of setting up a new agency to combat poverty if other Government agencies are creating poverty?  What I am saying is known to every Member of this House as fact, reality.</P>
    <P>Patients who attend the rehabilitation workshops throughout the country &mdash; in my constituency they are in Portlaoise and Tullamore &mdash; have had their weekly allowance reduced by £12.50, and this Government and this Minister are talking about setting up a new agency when as an alternative they should be asking the existing agencies of Government to ensure that poverty is minimised as far <Col N="2098" /> as it can be by the various Government Departments.  It is nothing short of a disgrace that the people I have referred to have had their meagre weekly allowance reduced by £12.50.  What can the Combat Poverty Agency do about that?  Will they not represent just another duplication of effort in being set up as one body to deal with the failures and inefficiency of all of the other agencies of the State when prior consideration and support and proper organisation should have been given to the existing Government Departments? The Ministers in charge of those Departments should be told that they have a priority and duty to examine their various programmes for the purpose of minimising poverty in our society.  That is not being done.  The opposite is happening as a direct result of Government policies.</P>

      <P>We have had a long debate on the Second Stage of this Bill.  Many of the contributions were valuable in that they raised some very basic considerations which underlie the whole poverty debate.  I suppose it was to be expected that the Opposition would use the opportunity presented by the Bill to launch a major attack in their familiar self-righteous tones on this Government's record.  Unfortunately, the length of the contributions by Opposition speakers on this question was not matched by their quality or their relevance to the provisions of the Bill.  For example, we had long denunications of the social welfare code, and many Fianna Fáil speakers seemed to forget that most of the provisions which they condemned in the social welfare code were reinserted in the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act which they passed in 1981 just before they left office.  The proportion of the Opposition contribution which was specifically directed to the contents of this Bill was very small and the opportunity was taken to try to make political points in relation to matters on which those Deputies have had and will have ample opportunity to express their views on more appropriate occasions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite all that has been said, I still <Col N="2099" /> find it difficult to find where Fianna Fáil stand on matters contained in the Bill. Deputies Woods and O'Hanlon have stated that they are not opposing the Bill, while Deputy O'Kennedy questions the need for the establishment of the agency at all.  Only a short time ago we listened to Deputy Lyons, who appeared to be totally opposed to the Bill.  The only consistent feature of the Fianna Fáil contributions was their ambiguity in this issue as on many other issues.  Some of the Opposition speakers tried to create the impression that there was no poverty in Ireland when Fianna Fáil were in Government.  Sometimes I marvel at the complacency of Opposition speakers when they talk in these terms.  The 1971 conference, which was referred to many times in this debate and which was held in Kilkenny, highlighted the scale of poverty nationally for the first time.  This was a time of unprecedented economic progress, and that conference concluded that 20 to 25 per cent of the people in the country were poor.  Deputy McCarthy can talk about that conference now without realising, apparently, that his party, who at that time had been 15 years in Government with an overall majority, did nothing at that time about it.  They failed to examine the underlying causes of poverty and how it could be redressed.</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods and Deputy O'Hanlon accused the Government of having lost an opportunity in not maintaining the National Community Development Agency introduced by Fianna Fáil.  If we want to talk about lost opportunities we must go back further and look at the opportunities which successive Fianna Fáil Governments had to tackle this problem when the resources to do so were more readily available than they are now.  Only when the Coalition Government of 1973-77 were in power did the problem come to be taken seriously when something was done to tackle it through the national combat poverty programme and through the introduction of an EC poverty programme in which this country was instrumental.  I recognise fully the contribution Deputy Woods made later <Col N="2100" /> as Minister for Social Welfare in pressing for an extension of the EC programme. However, it was under Fianna Fáil that the combat poverty committee were wound up and nothing put in their place. Under the shortlived Coalition Government of 1982 proposals were in hands for the re-establishment of a combat poverty agency but Fianna Fáil did not proceed with it subsequently.  They went instead for the National Community Development Agency.  Of course, there are similarities between sections of the present Bill and sections of the National Community Development Agency Act.  The Minister, in her opening remarks on this debate, made it clear that the present legislation is an attempt to build on the best features of the previous work in this area with a view to reaching broad agreement on the best way forward.  Let us at all costs avoid the possibility of having the experience of those early years repeated and give the new agency some guarantee of permanence.</P>
    <P>This is why I was pleased to see that Deputy McCarthy, the Opposition spokesman, and Deputy Woods who was previously involved, seemed to be generally in favour of the establishment of the agency.  I hope, however, that this is not based on any misunderstanding of what the new agency is about.  For this reason, I should like to say a few words on what I see as the essential differences between the approach now being taken and the Fianna Fáil approach embodied in the National Community Development Agency.  The essential approach now being taken is based on a broader approach to the whole poverty problem and how it should be tackled.  The primary function of the NCDA was community development and their mandate in relation to poverty was secondary and imprecise.</P>
    <P>The concept of community development is in itself admirable and its importance as a means of overcoming poverty is recognised in the Bill which specifically refers to it in two paragraphs in the section dealing with the functions of the <Col N="2101" /> agency.  Poverty was not the primary concern of the National Community Development Agency.  In the Act setting up that body, references to poverty were inextricably intertwined with concepts of self help and community development so that the agency's hands were tied in regard to the way they would have approached the problem of poverty.  For this reason, their viability and potential for effectiveness in combating poverty were doubtful from the start.  The agency were further hamstrung by having to administer the functions of the National Social Services Board.  These functions relate primarily to the provision of information on social services and are quite distinct from the examination of the causes of poverty and the testing of means for its elimination.</P>
    <P>The Government felt that what was needed was an agency whose sole function was to determine the nature, causes and extent of poverty and to find new ways of eliminating the problem at source.  They considered that the problem of poverty was sufficiently complex and important to merit a single agency which could concentrate exclusively on these aims.  It was clear also that this agency should have the independence to look at State policies in other bodies, statutory or voluntary, with regard to their effects, positive or negative, on poverty.  The NCDA had a similar aim but they were very much restricted as they were specifically confined to advising the Minister on the social aspects of economic and social planning.</P>
    <P>The new agency will have considerably more freedom which is written into the Bill.  We have been accused of delay in bringing in this legislation.  It would conceivably have been possible to bring the legislation in earlier but it was considered that thorough preparation was necessary before setting up a permanent body of this sort.  The previous Minister, therefore, in setting up the Commission on Social Welfare, asked them as their first priority to advise him on the implementation of an anti-poverty plan, the establishment of an organisation to combat poverty and the introduction of a new and <Col N="2102" /> comprehensive EC poverty programme. Having received the advice of the Commission he established the interim board of the combat poverty organisation to advise him on the structure, membership and other aspects of the permanent organisation.  This was the correct approach to ensure that a broad range of expert advice was available before the legislation was drafted.  Every effort has been made to incorporate the best features of all previous efforts in this area.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies referred specifically to the question of research and expressed the view that we have had enough research and that action is required.  I do not agree that there is no scope for further research.  The new agency will take account of all the information and research already produced and it is not intended to duplicate research already done.  it is necessary, however, that the agency should be in a position to commission research in any area where they feel more information is required.  For this reason, we are enabling the agency to promote research where they consider it necessary but it will be for the agency to identify the areas where such research is required.</P>
    <P>There is certainly a need, in any event, to go beyond the sort of facile assertions made by a number of Opposition speakers that the cause of poverty is the Government and that the solution is obvious if only the Government would recognise it.  A simplistic approach like this confirms the view that whatever prospect there is under this Government of identifying and facing up to the basic issues, there would be none if the Opposition had their way.</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods questioned the statement that many people do not accept that poverty exists.  In this connection, I should like to direct his attention to a report published by the ESRI as recently as 1984 which was based on a survey carried out some time before that which indicated that 50 per cent of people surveyed believed there was little real poverty in Ireland and 50 per cent thought that only a small percentage of <Col N="2103" /> the population had experienced poverty in their own lives.  A lot depends of course, on how one defines poverty. Some people say they are poor if they do not have enough resources for bare subsistence while others argue that people are poor when they cannot have the things which everyone else has.  I do not think, however, that it would be appropriate or helpful to become involved at this stage in trying to define poverty.  It is a very difficult question. There are wide differences of approach and it is one which it is appropriate for the agency to examine.  It can be said, however, that poverty is not just a matter of money or one to be solved by the Department of Social Welfare alone.  It affects all aspects of Government policy and it is the business of all Departments.</P>
    <P>The State provisions in education, housing and health are also of major importance and must be taken into consideration in any examination of poverty and the effectiveness of Government policy in tackling it.  Every area of Government activity has some impact in relation to the poverty field.  The social welfare system obviously is of central importance and there will have to be changes over the coming years following the report of the Commission on Social Welfare.  Again it will be a question of directing our resources in the most effective way to meet evident needs and to identify categories and groups which are not adequately catered for under present arrangements.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies referred to the importance of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.  I agree that there is need for a fundamental review of that scheme and this will be undertaken in the light of the recommendations of the commission in this area.  I deny the suggestion made by Deputy Woods that a saving of £30 million has been achieved as a result of the introduction of the child benefit scheme through the abolition of child tax allowances under the first phase of the child benefit scheme.  The whole basis of the scheme is that the resources released as a result of the abolition of <Col N="2104" /> child tax allowances are being redirected towards the provision of direct cash support to families.  Far from making a saving, the Exchequer is paying an additional £11 million in 1986 over and above what would have been spent if the present system of support had been left unchanged.</P>
    <P>In relation specifically to social welfare increases, a number of allegations were made by Deputy O'Kennedy which were so wide of the mark that I must refer to them.  He referred to the increase of only 1.5 per cent in the Estimate for non-contributory old age pensions although the number of pensioners is supposed to have gone up by 4,000.  I do not know where Deputy O'Kennedy got his figures. The number of non-contributory old age pensions is showing a steady decline as more elderly people qualify for contributory pensions and it came down from 134,000 in 1978 to a little under 128,000 a year ago and is 125,000 at present.  The Estimate for 1986 takes account of the expected number of claimants and there is no question of more stringent conditions being applied to people claiming pensions.</P>
    <P>It has also been alleged that there have been cutbacks in the fuel scheme.  I wish to make it clear that there has been no change in the criteria for eligibility under this scheme.  On the contrary, we improved the scheme by increasing the weekly rate of allowance from £4 to £5 from the beginning of last October.  I am amazed that Deputy O'Kennedy should make allegations of that kind without checking the facts.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to a number of other points in the debate which referred to specific aspects of the Bill.  Deputy De Rossa considered that the agency should come under the aegis of the Department of the Taoiseach rather than the Department of Social Welfare on the grounds that poverty should not be treated purely as a social welfare problem.  I said earlier that poverty is a much wider concept than merely one of social welfare.  The establishment of the agency will necessitate the Department <Col N="2105" /> of Social Welfare having a broader perspective in relation to policies in the poverty field and it will be through that Department that the agency will make an input into the policy making process. There are obviously a number of options with regard to what should be the reporting Department but the Government consider that the agency most appropriately should be located under the aegis of the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>I have tried to cover the main points which arose in the course of the debate and which relate directly to the purpose of the Bill.  I am confident that the establishment of this agency will be a major landmark in the fight against poverty here.  It is easy to blame the Government or, indeed, any Government, for the existence of poverty.  The problem, however, is not one which is amenable to easy solutions as some people imply.</P>

The Convention was signed by Ireland in 1978.</P>
      <P>I must point out to the Deputy, however, that even when the legislation has been passed and the Convention ratified by us, it will not enter into force here unless and until it has been ratified by all of the original six member states.  Up to now only five of the original six member states have ratified the Convention.</P>
      <P>I might add that the legislation, when passed, will also enable Ireland to ratify the Convention, signed in October, 1982, on the accession of Greece to the 1968 Convention as adjusted by the 1978 Convention.</P>

Is the Minister aware that many contractors who have provided services here for citizens from other EC countries have not been paid and as a result are in serious financial difficulty?  Is the Minister aware that because of commitments those people entered into they now find themselves almost penniless and their property about to be taken from them by financial institutions? Is the Minister aware that those people cannot take action against people <Col N="2107" /> from other member states?

      <P>With regard to the question about the delay in bringing the matter to a conclusion in the House I should like to point out that the convention was signed in 1978.  The Deputy should ask elsewhere for the reasons for the delay between 1978 land 1981.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>More important, as I pointed out to the Deputy, even had we taken steps to pass the legislation to enable us to ratify the convention up to now it still would not have had any effect because it cannot come into effect until all the original six member states have ratified it.  One of the original six member states who has not ratified the convention is Belgium and I understand the legislation necessary for that country to ratify it is now before the Belgian Parliament. It is expected to be enacted at the latest before next October but we do not have any control over that.</P>
      <P>The convention was drawn up in order to provide a speedy and informal procedure whereby civil judgments given in one member state could be enforced in another.  I hope we will have the necessary legislation before the House soon but I must point out that were we to ratify before ratification by Belgium we will still have to wait for the Belgian procedure to be concluded.</P>

Furthermore I have learned that the Danish Government have recently introduced into their Parliament the measures necessary to ratify the convention there.  It would appear that we are approaching the point at which it will have full force in all member states that have ratified the convention.</P>

    <P>I do not regard it as appropriate that announcements in regard to legislative <Col N="2109" /> proposals of any kind that I might have in mind should be made in response to Parliamentary Questions.  Any such proposals will be made in the normal way.</P>
    <P>It has not come to my notice that there is at present any widespread public concern at the levels of penalties imposed by the courts on persons convicted of offences involving the use of firearms.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. L.T. Cosgrave Mr. L.T. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L.T. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Having regard to the possible serious consequences arising out of offences being committed by people who carry firearms &mdash; including the likelihood of serious injury or loss of life &mdash; will the Minister agree to establish a special minimum sentence to be imposed on people who carry firearms?  Those people are not carrying firearms for show. Will the Minister consider having a minimum sentence for such offences in an effort to discourage people from carrying firearms?  In recent times serious crimes were committed by people carrying firearms and loss of life has resulted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to remind the House &mdash; Deputy Cosgrave will not have overlooked this &mdash; that the Criminal Justice Act substantially increased the penalties for offences relating to firearms.  For example, for armed robbery the maximum penalty is life imprisonment; for armed aggravated burglary the maximum penalty is life imprisonment; for the use of firearms to resist arrest or aid escape the maximum penalty is life imprisonment; for the hijacking of a car when armed the maximum penalty is 14 years in prison; for the possession of firearms in suspicious circumstances the maximum penalty is ten years; for carrying firearms with criminal intent the maximum penalty is 14 years imprisonment.  On the matter of mandatory sentences there is a question underlying that which goes further than the question of offences concerning the use of firearms.  The House will be aware that there are certain views among the Judiciary in relation to the application of minimum sentences.  Since it would apply in a number of areas other than firearms <Col N="2110" /> it is a debate that should not be conducted solely on the basis of offences related to firearms.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but if Deputy Taylor wishes to put that question to me, either in the House or privately, I shall be very happy to see that information will be given.  I would not like to raise his expectations too far in terms of an average sentence, but since the number of offences and convictions is relatively limited compared with some other categories of offence, we should be able to get the information for him within a reasonable time.</P>

I do not think the Deputy is suggesting that there should be a smaller penalty in the event of an offence involving a licensed firearm.

      <P>If the Deputy will stop interrupting me, he will hear the answer. I have said in this House, and this morning to the Annual Conference of the Prison Officers' Association in Mullingar, that the arrangements that we have put in place, given the concern underlying those arrangements, to ensure the security and safety of prison officers would be maintained at whatever is regarded as the appropriate level.</P>

The information available to me is that they are not available and that important security posts within the prison are not being manned by the Garda at present because of the serious cutback in finance.</P>

That is the first point. Secondly, the special arrangements for the security of prison officers and their families do not consist only in the presence of patrols by gardaí in the areas where they live.  Thirdly, that mixture of measures is monitored by the Garda to ensure <Col N="2114" /> that we get the desired effect from it.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The allocation of Garda manpower to units such as the special task force is a matter for the Garda authorities.  They inform me that the strength of the special task force is reviewed from time to time to take account of changing needs and circumstances and that the current strength of <Col N="2115" /> the task force is considered adequate to meet present needs.</P>
      <P>It would, of course, be misleading to use the strength of the special task force alone as a measure of the Garda response to robberies at banks, employment exchanges and post offices.  While the special task force have a particular role to play in dealing with this type of crime, their resources are additional to the measures taken by other specialised units in the force and by the gardaí at local level.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister satisfied, from his discussions with the authorities from time to time, that the operation of the special task force is reviewed regularly to see that the best use is got from a force which has proved to be effective, certainly partly effective in ensuring that there have not been as many robberies committed?  Unfortunately there still are some robberies committed from time to time.  Is there a review on a regular basis to see if any changes in that task force are needed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>In the nature of things, the operations of the special task force are kept under constant review, particularly since, as the Deputy knows, this is a very flexible unit which is deployed as the need arises at any given moment.

      <P>Would the Minister agree that it would be important that the special task force or any other task force operating under their control would have a preventive function in relation to banks, supermarkets, post offices, community centres and other areas which have been robbed repeatedly in Dublin in recent times?  This is a feature of the nature of crime at present in Dublin.  I note that the Minister says that when something arises the levels of overtime and flexibility required would be supplied.  Surely, the problem is to provide the surveillance in advance of that?  Can the Minister give <Col N="2116" /> us an undertaking that where these problems exist and are known to exist the task force will have the resources, overtime and flexibility to prevent crime happening in those circumstances by doing stakeouts and pursuing the people involved?</P>

I would direct his attention to Question No. 59 on today's Order Paper about allegations which appeared in the <i>Evening Herald</i> on the date he mentioned.  With the greatest of respect to the group in question, that is an extremely bad source of information. That article was, to say the least, tendentious and inaccurate.  No serious crime in the period referred to was left uninvestigated. In fact, in the case of the violent death not only was the crime investigated but a person was apprehended.</P>

      <P>I was quite prepared to accept the Minister's answers in October and November last that he had not time to consider the implications. But I am surprised now.  I would ask the Minister to indicate if he has not had time to absorb some of the recommendations which could easily be implemented straight away.  I would ask the Minister if he has looked at recommendations such as the development of the liaison service. This has been there for years.  Whitaker pointed out the importance of developing this service.  Has the Minister considered that?  The question of non-custodial sentences has been continuously discussed and reviewed.  Specific recommendations were made by Whitaker.  Has the Minister considered such issues as the confiscation of assets, as recommended by Whitaker?  Finally, the recommendation in regard to an open regime for women prisoners, has the Minister considered that as a fairly simple matter to operate? Could the Minister give us an indication of some of the more easily operated recommendations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I can give Deputy Mac Giolla an indication of one decision which was very easy to make which was the <Col N="2119" /> appointment of a director of medical services to the prison service.  Deputy Mac Giolla will agree with me that that is something which we would have had to do even if we never had set up that committee of inquiry.</P>
      <P>On the other issues Deputy Mac Giolla has raised, I can only ask him to accept that the problem is not with my absorption capacity but rather with the fact that there are a number of other groups which have to be consulted.  If I could very briefly indicate one of the areas which illustrates the difficulty, the committee recommended the setting up of a prisons board.  They did not make any specific recommendations as to the relationship that should exist between the board on the one hand and the director of the prison services on the other.  There are a wide number of options there.  Even that relationship does not finally answer the question of the relationship that should exist between the prison board and the Minister for Justice.  There are a good many issues in that report which need a lot of discussion with other involved groups before I would be in a position to put proposals to the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I can understand that.  I did not even mention the prisons board because I recognise it would be one of the more difficult items to come to a final decision on.  What I am trying to ask the Minister is whether the recommendations of the Whitaker report are being considered in the day-to-day developments which are taking place.  For instance, in regard to the building of the new Wheatfield prison, which was originally to be a women's prison, the Whitaker report recommends an open regime for women prisoners apart from a very small number.  Has that altered the Minister's view of the Wheatfield prison?  Is there to be a women's section in that prison?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Whitaker report has not altered my view on Wheatfield Prison; but I should point out for the <Col N="2120" /> information of the House that the Wheatfield facility, which will be completed towards the end of next year and which will come into operation early in the following year, has been built in a way that makes it capable of a series of different types of use at the same time.  In other words, it can be broken into sections with different uses for each section.  Therefore, it is not just a single purpose facility.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister agree that the appointment of the director of medical services was one which was forced in effect by this House through the protestations of Members who brought the bad situation which was in existence to our attention?  Would the Minister agree that there is a very strong suggestion that the prisons' report has been shelved or at least given a low priority for the present?  Would the Minister say whether this report is getting the priority which it deserves?</P>

      <P>In view of the fact that a driver could feel quite capable of driving and could be over the limit without being aware of it, is the Minister anxious to make available facilities for self testing?  Does the Minister consider that the system is fair in the absence of the opportunity for drivers to self test their alcohol level?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I consider the system fair. I recognise that there is a certain body of opinion which takes the line that Deputy Mitchell started off with.  In any case of this kind no matter where one draws the line there will be cases on one side or the other that are possibly marginal.  I do not have any official view &mdash; I will put it no stronger than that &mdash; on the question of self testing.  I do not think that justice requires that we make any specific provision for self testing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Mitchell knows that alcohol is not the only drug the abuse of which can lead to proceedings.  There are offences that are concerned with driving while under the influence of an intoxicant, which can be alcohol or which can equally be a number of other preparations. There are some difficulties in relation to other drugs in devising tests that would reveal the presence of those drugs. I am not in a position to say whether any new developments can be expected on that front but it is a problem that is receiving some attention.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that prosecutions for drunken driving have been bedevilled in recent times by technicalities on the issue of summonses, particularly during the current year and last year, as a result of signing difficulties by District Court clerks and computer problems, and that many hundreds of <Col N="2122" /> these cases are now being dismissed or cannot be dealt with?  Does he have any proposals to simplify the procedures in order to get around these technicalities?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have proposals to simplify the procedures because they are not very complicated as, I think, the Deputy will agree.  What I am anxious to do is to ensure that those involved observe the procedures, relatively uncomplicated as they are.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the number of High Court decisions which are at present under appeal to the Supreme Court dealing with the procedures on the issues of summonses which are relatively complicated when the procedures involving complaints and issue of summonses, dates and District Court clerks are taken into account? They are complicated enough to become the subject of High Court and Supreme Court decisions.  At present the system is not working, certainly in the greater Dublin area.  All these are in a state of abeyance and will clog up the system for a long time even after the situation is resolved in the Supreme Court.  Does the Minister not regard it as an emergency that would warrant bringing in a quick amending Bill to resolve these technicalities so that the procedures can get moving again and these things can be dealt with?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said, I do not regard the procedings as being particularly complicated. I think it essential however that those involved operate them properly.  I am sure the Deputy will agree with me when I suggest that a complicated procedure is not necessarily needed to give rise to litigation in the High Court.</P>

That is the highest strength that we have had for a number of years.  I do not think it would be proper for me to discuss here requests from various Garda divisions for different levels of manpower.  Within the overall strength, which, as I have said, will remain at 11,400, the deployment of manpower resources is a matter for the Garda authorities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice the number of applicants at present awaiting decision by the Criminal Injuries Tribunal: the date since which the oldest application is unattended; when these applications will be dealt with; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been estimated that at the end of April 1986 the Criminal Injuries Compensation Tribunal had 4,530 cases on hand.  No application remains unattended but I assume that what the Deputy has in mind is the oldest active application with the tribunal in respect of which no award has yet been paid.  That was lodged in February 1979.  I understand that there are special reasons <Col N="2126" /> for the delay in this case which are outside the control of the tribunal.</P>
      <P>I clearly could not indicate when each of these applications will be disposed of. Perhaps, however, I might outline the procedure for dealing with them.  All claims are acknowledged and later are thoroughly checked to ensure that the documentation is in order.  Frequently there is correspondence with applicants and/or their legal representatives concerning documentation such as medical reports.  Garda reports have to be obtained also.  When awards are decided by the tribunal the applicant is notified and payment made if he accepts.  Total payments in any year are governed by the allocation in the Estimates.  Perhaps I ought to add that in dealing with applications the tribunal are independent.</P>
      <P>As I told the House in reply to a question on 10 December 1985 &mdash; Official Report Volume 362, columns 1679 and 1680 &mdash; the delay in finalising claims is partly due to the increase in recent years in the number of applications for compensation being received by the tribunal and, also, the necessity to keep the amount of money which the tribunal may pay out in any one year within the allocation for that year.  The allocation for any year is decided on the basis of the requirements of the particular service, the requirements for other services and the overall budgetary position.</P>

It seems that it takes three to four years to get most cases completed.  This is agonising for people concerned.  Can the Minister confirm that there is a shortage of staff to deal with the number of applications before the tribunal due to the budgetary situation?

    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. J. Leonard Mr. J. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice the action he proposes to take to reduce the incidence of moving large amounts of cash around the country, and thus to reduce the opportunities of robbery of the cash in transit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Cash is used to a large extent here for the payment of wages and benefits and as long as this remains the position there will be a need to move large amounts of cash.  Any movement away from cash transactions to payments by cheque and the use of &ldquo;plastic&rdquo; money would be of great benefit in reducing the amount of cash in circulation and, therefore, vulnerable to robbery and I would very much welcome a move in this direction.</P>
      <P>As the House is aware, many large movements of cash have the benefit of Army/Garda protection and I have been informed by the Garda authorities that following a recent review of the position arrangements are in train to effect a 25 per cent reduction in the number of such cash movements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. J. Leonard Mr. J. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that with all the saving accounts, bank accounts, lodgment machines, credit machines and so forth involving frequent movements of cash, it is not only desirable but necessary that we should not have large convoys of Army and Garda bringing large amounts of money to outlying areas?  Will the Minister agree that little has been done in the past few <Col N="2129" /> years to reduce the amount of cash being used?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with that. In the past three and a half years on a number of occasions we have reviewed the possibility of reducing the amount of cash in circulation where the matter lies within the power of the Government or semi-State agencies.  I do not think it is correct to say it is in any way ridiculous that large amounts of cash are in circulation. The fact is that many people who are in receipt of various social assistance and wages do not have bank accounts. Therefore, there is a problem of paying or supporting people in those situations without the movement of cash.  I can assure the House that, to the extent it proves possible to reduce the number of large cash movements and the amounts being moved, we will take those measures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. J. Leonard Mr. J. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister not agree that many private concerns pay by cheque?  Various Government Departments, including the Departments of Social Welfare and Labour, could take an example from the private sector.  Even small concerns have made the change because of the danger of robberies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course I recognise that, but I invite the Deputy to consider this point.  Even in cases where we can make the primary payment by cheque &mdash; I am talking now of social assistance and various social welfare payments &mdash; at some stage the cheque has to return into cash.  In many cases the recipients of payments by cheque do not have bank accounts and they will have to turn the cheque into cash.  Therefore, somewhere along the line that means there is a requirement for a substantial amount of cash to be moved to a point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. J. Leonard Mr. J. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister not agree that when it is reduced to an individual level only a small amount of cash is involved and there is no great problem in monitoring it?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take priority Question No. 27 and Question No. 22 together.</P>
      <P>The provision for overtime in the Garda Síochána Vote in the current year is £12 million and no cutback in this amount has taken place or been proposed.  This provision was made for the whole of 1986 and there is no question of there being a specific provision for any one month, though obviously as part of their internal management of resources, the Garda authorities must and do make arrangements to ensure that in so far as demands on their services require, the resources will be fairly spread over the various parts of the State and also throughout the year. Expenditure on overtime is at present being reviewed and monitored by the Garda authorities to ensure that the best possible return is being got from it.  Any such review is likely to lead to some changes in the use of resources &mdash; indeed that is its purpose &mdash; but effective policing will be maintained in all areas.  There is, of course, no question of the withdrawal of any essential Garda services.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that on basis of that expenditure it is most unlikely that the remainder of the money will be able to meet the requirements for the rest of the year?  In that event what <Col N="2137" /> are the Minister's plans in relation to the remaining period?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Lest the Deputy be under any misapprehension I would point out to him the fact that the level of policing does not depend primarily on the provision that is made for overtime.  It would be wrong for the Deputy to infer that there is any particular approach to the total level of services in the provision made for overtime.  It is only part of the total picture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>In an earlier reply the Minister said there was never any question of a reduction in the provision of £12 million.  Would the Minister accept that one cause of the alleged chaos among the gardaí in relation to overtime was his instruction following his finding that the amount of money spent so far this year was well in excess of the anticipated amount?  One has only to look at the newspapers, in particular the <i>Evening Herald</i> of 14 May.  The gardaí felt they would not be paid overtime to pursue criminals after hours, so to speak.  Such statements were made by superintendents and other members of the Garda. I saw some of them in writing.</P>

      <P>I suggested to the Deputy before that, with all respect to the newspapers, he should not take the evening papers as a bible or a basis for making statements.  Overtime provision is only one element in the total provision of Garda resources.  The Deputy is well aware that it is not part of the function of the Minister for Justice to give specific directions as to the allocation of Garda manpower in any particular area or at any particular time of the day.  That is an operational matter for the gardaí.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister give a forthright assurance, which can be conveyed to the superintendents and gardaí who are quite worried about this, that the anticipated level of overtime to the end of the year will be available for each month from now until the end of the year so that gardaí will be able to <Col N="2138" /> pursue criminals at weekends and outside their normal hours?  Will he give a firm assurance that even if the £12 million allocated for the year is exceeded, no instruction will be issued to stop gardaí chasing criminals outside of normal hours?</P>

The number of gardaí on duty at any particular time in any particular area depends on factors such as the available resources, local circumstances, demands on Garda services and the time of day or night.</P>
      <P>The Garda authorities have informed me that there has been no reduction over the past six months in the overall Garda strength of just over 4,000 which is allocated to the Dublin Metropolitan Area. They have also informed me that, while the manpower resources allocated to units such as the technical bureau and the special task force or to particular duties such as protection at courts have fluctuated from time to time for different reasons, there has been no reduction in the overall level of service in these areas during the past six months.</P>

I have equally told the House that no change has been made to the total allocation for overtime that has been allocated to the force as a whole for this year.

      <P>I do not accept that there is, as the Deputy puts it, a breakdown of law and order.  In fact, the position is that the level of indictable crime recorded by the Garda Síochána has decreased in each of the past two years and the indications are that this downward trend is continuing this year.</P>
      <P>The question of availability of insurance to household and public institutions is not a matter for me as Minister for Justice.  I am informed by the Minister for Industry and Commerce that he is not aware of any insoluble problems in the availability of insurance to households and public institutions.  Moreover, I understand that the incoming president of the Insurance Institute of Ireland told a recent meeting of the institute that the drop in crime is reflected in the lower number of insurance claims arising from specific criminal operations such as burglary.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister appreciate that there has been a very substantial increase in the cost of house insurance? I appreciate that the details of these increases are not a matter for this Minister. But the cause of the increase is a matter for this Minister, and the cause is the breakdown in law and order in particular areas.  It is becoming almost impossible to get insurance in these areas. The Minister has denied that these things are occurring and referred me to the overall drop in indictable crime on the last occasion I spoke here.  Since then further churches have been burnt, schools have been vandalised, shops have been vandalised and set on fire.  This has happened in the last ten days, and in the same areas that I referred the Minister to.  The problem for the Garda Síochána is that they cannot, with the resources being made available to them at present, provide the manpower.  That is the reality.  They are not able to meet the situation.</P>

I do not accept that there is a break down of law and order and I retail it to the House as a fact that the drop in crime is reflected in the lower number of insurance claims being made.

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mrs. A. Doyle)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann confirms the following Order, as made by the Minister for Finance on 5 February 1986:</P>
      <P>New Coinage (Twenty Pence) Order, 1986,</P>
      <P>a copy of which Order was laid before Dáil Éireann on 11 February 1986.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This order, which provides the necessary statutory basis for the issue of a 20p coin, was made on 5 February 1986, under section 3 (5) (a) and section 4 (2) (a) of the Decimal Currency Act, 1969.  The Act provides that it shall not come into force until it has been confirmed by resolution of each House of the Oireachtas. <Col N="2163" /> It was confirmed by the other House on 12 March.</P>
    <P>Since the adoption of the decimal system in 1971 the coinage has consisted of six coins.  There are three bronze coins, the halfpenny, the penny and the 2p and three cupro-nickel coins, the 5p, 10p and 50p pieces.</P>
    <P>The primary purpose of coins is to serve as a medium of exchange.  In a modern economy they are used mainly to pay for the many small purchases and services that are an essential part of daily living.  It is, therefore, important to provide coins in the denominations that best serve the needs of the public.  They should also, of course, be of convenient size and weight.</P>
    <P>It has been clear for some years that the six existing coins no longer satisfy these criteria.  As the value of money has declined the number of coins required for daily transactions, especially the number of higher denomination coins, has increased progressively.  At the end of 1985 there were almost 40 million 50p pieces, more than 186 million 10p pieces and nearly 150 million 5p coins in circulation. By international standards these are large and heavy coins.  They are inconvenient to handle and carry about in quantity.  A British study a few years ago showed that the average pocket or handbag at that time was likely to contain an assortment of coins to a value of 81 pence and weighing about 84 grams or three ounces.  We may be sure the situation has not improved.</P>
    <P>The Central Bank, which issues the coins, were also concerned at the growing cost of providing increasing quantities of coins.  They advised that the introduction of a denomination between the 10p and 50p would relieve the situation and make the coinage more suitable to the demands being made on it.  A new coin of 20p or 25p seemed to be needed.  The bank favoured a 20p.  It would fit better into the decimal progression and studies suggested that it would take more 10p coins out of circulation than would a 25p coin. I might mention at this point that within the European Community, most of our <Col N="2164" /> partners use the 1:2:5 or 10:20:50 sequence in their coin systems.  Australia and New Zealand also issue 20 cent coins.</P>
    <P>In order to ascertain as well as possible public feeling on the matter, my Department canvassed the views of a wide range of public and private sector groups.  A substantial majority expressed a preference for a 20p coin.  In 1982 the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Mac-Sharry, announced that the provision of this coin was being considered.  Following further work in my Department and the Central Bank it was announced in August 1984 that the Government had decided on the introduction of the coin.  Since then work has continued on the details of the specifications and the design.</P>
    <P>The Order before the House provides for a 20p coin weighing 8.47 grams and composed of a metal alloy containing 79 per cent copper, 20 per cent zinc and 1 per cent nickel.  It lays down also the remedies or maximum acceptable variations from the weight and standard composition. At 8.47 grams the coin will be heavier than the 2p and 5p but will be lighter than the 10p by almost 3 grams.</P>
    <P>The alloy of copper, zinc and nickel has not been used before in Irish coins. It has several advantages.  It is a yellow colour, which will help in identifying the new coin; it will yield a cost saving of up to 25 per cent against cupro-nickel in the production of the coin and it will make possible a reduction in weight <i>vis-a-vis</i> cupro-nickel.  Since the Central Bank meet the costs of the issue of coins and receive the proceeds, any increase in the profitability of the coin issue will be reflected in the amount of the bank's surplus income, which is paid over to the Exchequer.  The bank have indicated that they plan to mint between 30 million and 50 million pieces initially, and that it will take approximately six months from completion of the statutory procedures to produce the new coin.</P>
    <P>As soon as the Coinage Order has been confirmed I propose to make regulations under section 3(6) and 4(5) of the Decimal Currency Act, 1969, prescribing the dimensions and the design of the new coin.  The regulations do not need to be <Col N="2165" /> confirmed by the Oireachtas but it is proper that I should indicate their content to the House &mdash; as the Minister did to the other House &mdash; in view of their bearing on the order under discussion.  I believe this will facilitate the debate and enable members to take a comprehensive view in their contributions.</P>
    <P>I will take the design first.  The reverse side of the existing series of six coins contains two design motifs.  The cupro-nickel coins carry original designs from the series produced by Percy Metcalfe for the first coinage of the State, introduced in 1928.  The three bronze coins were designed by the late Gabrielle Hayes, Mrs. O'Riordan, for the decimal series. They bear adaptations of Celtic ornament.</P>
    <P>The Government were concerned to find a design for the 20p coin that would fit in with the designs of the existing coins, that would be acceptable to the majority of people and that would not involve undue delay in the issue of the coin.  We considered that a design competition would be difficult to justify for one coin and would be likely to hold up the issue. The Government concluded also that the introduction of a third design motif into the series would not be desirable.</P>
    <P>After careful consideration the Government decided that one of the Metcalfe designs from the discontinued pre-decimal coins should be used.  The designs available were the hen, the sow, the hare, the hound and the horse.  The advice of the Arts Council was sought on the selection and adaptation of one of these designs, considering that the coin would be different in size and colour from all the pre-decimal coins.  The council recommended the use of the horse, the Irish hunter, which figured previously on the half-crown.  The Government accepted this recommendation.  The Arts Council subsequently had the opportunity to view a manufactured sample and expressed satisfaction with the transfer of the design to the new coin.  Indeed, the Director of the Arts Council reported, and I quote:</P>
    <P>There is a unanimity of view as <Col N="2166" /> regards the excellence of the design. The Council believes that this new coin will be a worthy successor to the many coins of fine design which Ireland has produced.</P>
    <P>I concur with this view.  The Metcalfe designs are of a high standard and are particularly pleasing designs, in my view. They have always been acclaimed at home and recognised abroad as being distinctively Irish.  I feel sure that people will welcome the reintroduction of this particular emblem, the horse, to the national coinage.  I feel it is very apt that we have the horse back on our coinage. We must remind ourselves occasionally that the National Anthem was played abroad over Irish horses many decades ago.  As on all our existing coins, the harp together with the inscription &ldquo;Eire&rdquo; and the year will be on the obverse of the coin.</P>
    <P>Next the dimensions.  The coin will be round, 27.1 millimetres in diameter and, although this is not specified in the regulations, it will be about 2 millimetres thick. Thus it will be larger and thicker than the 2p coin which is, of course, a different colour.  It is intended also that, as an aid to tactile identification, the edge of the coin will have alternative arcs of plain and milled surface.  I trust the blind and persons with limited vision will find this helpful.</P>
    <P>The coinage does not often come up for discussion in the House.  I would like to take this opportunity, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, to mention some other relevant matters which I think Deputies will find of interest.  When my Department sought the views of public and private sector groups on the 20p coin the opportunity was availed of to seek reactions to other changes in the coinage.  There was much support for the issue of a £1 coin. The Central Bank Act of 1971, however, provides that the Irish pound shall be issued in the form of a legal tender note and the legislation would have to be amended before a coin could be issued. The matter is being pursued by my Department and the Central Bank.</P>
    <P>The idea of making the coins smaller <Col N="2167" /> and lighter also drew a favourable response.  As I have said the current coins are inconveniently large and heavy.  The have become quite expensive to produce, especially the bronze coins.  Since our entry into the European Monetary System, and the ending of the one for one parity with sterling, there is every reason to differentiate our coins clearly from their British counterparts.  All these factors were taken into account when the specifications for the 20p coin were settled.  It will not have escaped notice also that it is quite different from the corresponding British coin.</P>
    <P>The reintroduction of a uniform design series is something which will be considered. The co-existence of two design series is not completely satisfactory in my view and I believe that a uniform series, as was the case with the Metcalfe designs for the pre-decimal currency, would be preferable.  A strong case exists for a return to the Metcalfe series, which, as I said earlier, I regard as particularly pleasing and I think many would share my view on this.  The ultimate decision, however, will have to take account of artistic and technical factors, such as the decisions on the sizes and metallic composition of the various coins.  It is the Minister's intention to consult fully with the Arts Council in due course about the best way to proceed.</P>
    <P>I would like to mention two other relevant matters to the House.  First, it is the Minister's intention to make an order in the near future, under section 12 of the Decimal Currency Act, 1969, calling in the halfpenny with effect from the end of this year.  The purchasing power of this coin is now less the one-fifth of what it was in 1971 when it was introduced and it costs significantly more to produce than its face value.  Demand for the coin has declined steadily, except for numismatic purposes.  Much modern point-of-sale equipment, cash registers for example, do not provide for it and this is making the coin increasingly inconvenient to traders and members of the public.</P>
    <P>Representations have been received seeking the withdrawal of the coin from <Col N="2168" /> circulation.  A survey on the prevalence of the halfpenny in pricing was conducted by the National Prices Commission which concluded that it is not used on a large scale in the pricing of food items.  Under the terms of the proposed order and in accordance with the Act, the demonetisation would take effect in January 1987. The coin would cease to have legal tender status and would be withdrawn progressively from circulation.  The Central Bank, however, would continue to give value for quantities of coins presented after the effective date.</P>
    <P>The second matter which I wish to touch on is one which is raised from time to time inside and outside the House. This is the issue of coins for commemorative and numismatic purposes.  As has been indicated to the House on several occasions, it has been our policy to provide coins for domestic use and not to venture into the international numismatic market.  The only departures from that policy were the ten shilling silver coin issued in 1966 to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the 1916 Rising and the issue of some polished sets of the decimal coins in 1971.</P>
    <P>The numismatic market has grown greatly and many countries, including some of our EC partners, have become active in it.  The issue of commemorative and special coins could be profitable and could enhance the prestige of our country, if undertaken in a suitable manner. I think we would all be at one that our coins must be dignified and must be presented in a manner that would enhance our reputation.  I can say &mdash; and I think all Ministers for Finance had the same experience &mdash; that the commercial propositions that are constantly presented to me leave me less than happy on that score.  If we enter this market the Central Bank should control the entire process, from design through production to marketing, from beginning to end.  For the present the Central Bank's mint will be fully occupied with the issue of the 20p coin and then with the redesign of the coinage, which I mentioned earlier.</P>
    <P>There is one other point to be made about commemorative coins, to which I <Col N="2169" /> attach great importance.  A coin is much less ephemeral than, say, a postage stamp.  It is a long lasting artefact that reflects its time and culture.  Some last so long that they become invaluable historical records.  I believe the issue of commemoratives should be relatively limited, that the occasions should be of major significance and that they should tend to unify rather then to divide.  I am sure these are sentiments with which the House would concur.</P>
    <P>I know some Deputies have a strong interest in numismatics.  I hope I have said enough to show that our participation in that market is not ruled out and, provided it is done in a suitable manner, would be to the national benefit and would meet with general approval.</P>
    <P>To return to the order before the House, I hope all will welcome the new 20p coin.  The issue of this coin is a first step towards making our currency more convenient to handle.  Like the Arts Council I believe it is worthy of the national coinage.</P>
    <P>I therefore commend this order for approval by the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>This makes a pleasant change from discussing the Committee Stage of the Finance Bill.  After a little absence from the House I am glad to be able to offer my views on the proposed coinage order and the issues which the Minister of State touched on in her comprehensive, if relatively brief, address.</P>
      <P>As the Minister of State has indicated, the status which the design of the Metcalfe series represents for our country is something that we are very conscious and very proud of.  I would like to place on record the fact that the coins, and particularly their relevant designs, have enhanced the status of the country in that in the early days of the State we were able to present in a very sensitive and artistic fashion coinage of the order that has since been a feature of our system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to make reference purely for the purpose of artistic theory to the committee who dealt with the coinage of <Col N="2170" /> Saorstát Éireann in 1928 under the chairmanship of none other than the late W. B. Yeats.  It is worth putting on the record what Yeats had to say in relation to the decision on the design of the coins and particularly the one we are dealing with there today &mdash; the reintroduction of the horse for the 20p coin &mdash; which we would all recognise as being particularly appropriate. It is not often that one has the opportunity of putting again on the record the comments of such a gigantic figure in the field of literature, who was a Member of these Houses in the early days, something of which the current generation are not as sharply aware as they should be.  Wherever one goes around the world &mdash; as recently at a seminar I attended in France &mdash; the name of Yeats is of such reverential proportions that it is important that we look at any views he offered in any matter relating to the Irish identity.  In this instance he had views to offer as chairman of the committee in relation to the new coinage and I think I would do well to put them on the record.  I quote from <i>Coinage of Saorstát Éireann 1928</i> at page 5, where Yeats said:</P>
    <P>As certain of the beasts represent our most important industry, they were submitted to the Minister for Agriculture and his experts, and we awaited the results with alarm.  I have not been to Chartres Cathedral for years, but remember somewhere outside the great door figures of angels or saints, whose spiritual dignity and architectural effect depend upon bodies much longer in proportion to the length of their heads than a man's body ever was.  The artist who must fill a given space and suggest some spiritual quality or rhythmical movement finds it necessary to suppress or exaggerate. Art, as some French critic has said is appropriate exaggeration.  The expert on horse-flesh or bull-flesh, or swine-flesh, on the other hand, is bound to see his subject inanimate and isolated. The coins have suffered less than we feared.</P>
    <P>Now he refers to the horse: <Col N="2171" /> The horse, as first drawn, was more alive than the later version,</P>
    <P>&mdash;the one we have adopted since&mdash;</P>
    <P>for when the hind legs were brought more under the body and the head lowered, in obedience to technical opinion, it lost musclar tension; we passed from the open country to the show-ground.  But, on the other hand, it is something to know that we have upon our half-crown a representation of an Irish hunter, perfect in all its points, and can add the horseman's pleasure to that of the children and the artists.</P>
    <P>In a sense we recognise that we have passed from the open country to the showground, but Yeats' comment there in relation to the design and the restrictions, on appropriate design, as many of us would see them because it would not relate to our general observation, become particularly significant in that we are now reintroducing the horse from the showground rather than the open country that he spoke about.</P>
    <P>In that connection when we look at the level of analysis, preparation and artistic consideration that went into the presentation of the first coinage of Saorstát Éireann, it is a great tribute to the analysis, design and preparation that not only have they stood the test of time but we are even at this stage, 60 years on, going back to those designs for the new coin that we propose to introduce here this afternoon. I appreciate, as the Minister has said, that it is not a matter that has to be brought before the Dáil and it is not in that sense being introduced here, but it gives us an opportunity to offer some comment on it.</P>
    <P>I would like to make two or three general comments in that context.  The whole history of coinage in Ireland was very well documented up to the introduction of this coinage.  If we go back over the history of coinage we find that in 1810 a very comprehensive essay on Irish coins was written by Simon James.  He called it an essay, but it is a very detailed analysis <Col N="2172" /> of the whole historical derivation of the value, nature and artistic presentation of coins.  Twenty-nine years later, a very short period in view of the lapse in our experience, we have what is regarded as being the comprehensive view on Irish coinage.  It is entitled <i>A View of the Coinage of Ireland from the Invasion of the Danes to the Reign of George IV</i> published in 1839 by a barrister-at-law called John Lindsay.  Since then we have had an essay on the earliest Irish coinage by William O'Sullivan in 1949 which does not relate to current coinage.  From the absence of any study or literary analysis of our coinage since the State was established I suggest that we should stress particularly the artistic role of coinage.  I am in sympathy with what the Minister of State said, that the commercial propositions that are constantly present leave her less than happy on that score.  Of course, commercial propositions must be taken into consideration, but these coins will outlive any of us in this House for generations, it is to be hoped, and they will tell a story in 100 or 200 years' time which will enable people perhaps to get a relatively flattering view of the Ireland we live in today.  For that reason I encourage the Minister to proceed with the issue, as she seemed to be suggesting, of special commemorative coins, albeit of a specific designation for a specific purpose.  Even if the coins are not going to be in constant and daily use, they will in their time be &mdash; apart from literature or some of the visual arts which we hope will survive &mdash; some of the most permanent hoards that from their study will tell people much about our priorities in this period, 1986. I hope they will tell them in a flattering way, because I think that anybody looking at the general nature of our society at the moment cannot be too encouraged as to our sense of Irishness in terms of wealth, culture, character and what we regard as priorities.  It is time, in presenting our sense of Irishness, that we demonstrated it through all the official records in this instance.</P>
    <P>The Minister indicated that in the European Community one generally finds the coins follow a sequence of one, <Col N="2173" /> two, five or ten, 20 or 50.  While I can see that there has been maximum consultation since this idea was first mooted by the Minister's predecessors and that such consultation has resulted in the conclusion that this is the most appropriate coin for the 20p, I have certain reservations, if not regret, that we could not, from the practical point of view, move more in line with the sequence of European coins simply to facilitate the exchange of coinage from visitors and business people who find it much more reassuring to deal in coins of the same sequence and denomination as they are accustomed to doing in their own countries.</P>
    <P>We all face that when we travel to other countries and we should do everything possible to facilitate those who come here.  I should not like to impose a mould on everything used on a daily basis in each member state of the EC but, in terms of the regular transmission of currency for normal usage, it would be desirable where possible to fall in line with a general sequence followed in the Community. I do not say that as an objection to what is proposed here but I hope the Minister will bear it in mind in any further developments in coinage promotion.</P>
    <P>I am sorry I did not hear about this motion earlier.  I do not say that as a criticism of the Whips because they could not have been aware of the fact that I did not have the opportunity to look into it in detail.  I welcome the introduction of this new coin but I should like to think that we would move, as soon as possible, towards the issue of further special commemorative coins which would demonstrate that the values which W. B. Yeats spoke about over 60 years ago are still a priority.  While the material usage of coins becomes obviously the major priority, the artistic element also remains a prime consideration.</P>

      <P>I should like to thank the Deputy for his contribution and I am glad there appears to be a general welcome for the new coin.  It is a sign of the times that a 20p denomination should now be necessary but it will facilitate <Col N="2174" /> the general public.  There will be a great welcome for the design of this coin.  As has been pointed out by the Deputy and by me in my opening remarks, the old Metcalfe series were greatly loved and were distinctively Irish coins.  Many visitors and people abroad commented on them from time to time.  I have missed them in recent years and I very much welcome the re-introduction of the horse because most people love it and I know it will be very welcome.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing this matter to be raised on the Adjournment.  I would point out to the Minister that I raised this matter this morning on the Order of Business.  I am glad he has come into the House to hear the points we wish to make concerning this school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The extension to this school was first approved and deemed necessary six years ago.  The Minister may be aware that earlier this year a programme on this school was featured on an RTE &ldquo;News-time&rdquo; television programme.  Last January a strike in this five teacher school was organised because of frustration on the part of parents and teachers at the delay in getting the approved work done. The school has 155 pupils at present.  It has the same meagre classroom accommodation and facilities as when there were only 85 students.  It is a five teacher school with three classrooms.  One of the classrooms is divided by a temporary partition which was erected three years ago when the fifth teacher was appointed.  I understood, and it was also the understanding of the teachers and parents at <Col N="2175" /> that time, that this was to be a temporary measure until such time as the extension was built.</P>
    <P>Lavally national school was originally a two teacher school and remained so up to 1973 when Argloragh national school was amalgamated with it.  It then became a four teacher and later a five teacher school.  The parents of children attending Argloragh national school were given a commitment at the time of the amalgamation that full facilities would be given to their children at Lavally national school. I am asking the Department to honour that commitment, in other words, to carry out the extension as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>The figure I have been given by the Department for the cost of the extension is approximately £180,000, which includes three new classrooms and renovation work to the existing building.  The local contribution of £20,000 was collected through fund raising three years ago by the parents and teachers.  I am sure the Minister will understand the frustration of the parents and teachers who worked so hard to raise that money that nothing has been done to have the extension built. Every possible means of raising money and getting started has been carried out by the board of management.  They were told by various officials in the past that work would start very soon.  They are concerned about the summer holidays approaching because they would like the work to be done during the holiday period, with minimum disruption of classes.  The number of pupils in this school has been on the increase over the past few years and these are now cramped in very overcrowded conditions which are proving, I understand, a health hazard as well as causing obvious discomfort to the pupils and teachers.</P>
    <P>I visited the school on a number of occasions and one of the amazing things about the divided classroom is that there are 53 pupils in a classroom which originally held 30.  This is unacceptable.  There is also the problem of the playground, which is at present flooded.  Could the Minister tell us what the Department's <Col N="2176" /> responsibility is with regard to play areas? We hope the Minister will be able to give us the timetable involved in the extension of the school and tell us that a decent play area will be provided.</P>
    <P>The board of management would like to carry out necessary improvements to the existing building pending the extension, but are unable to do this at present because they do not know the exact position. Would the Minister tell us when the Department will be inviting tenders for this work?  I compliment the Minister and his Minister of State on advising us of the timetable of tenders in other areas of County Galway, and when tenders will be invited for schools like Aughrim and Kilconnell.  I understand Lavally national school is in the same situation, that it has reached the stage where tenders are to be invited.  With regard to the health hazard, medical certificates have been sent in to the Department.  The toilet facilities are sadly lacking and, as I said, the playground is a hazard of major concern. I hope the Minister will bring the frustration of the parents and teachers to an end by telling us that tenders are being invited very shortly for this work, which is overdue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, wish to thank the Minister for giving us this opportunity to raise this very important matter on the Adjournment.  I want to reinforce the request of my constituency colleague that urgent and immediate action be taken in this very serious matter.  Lavally is a rural area, located in the mid-northern region of County Galway.  There is tremendous enthusiasm on the part of the board of management, the school manager, the staff and the parents to ensure that these facilities are made available.  They have made every effort over a long period of time and have been very patient and very reasonable.  They are not looking for a new school.  All they want is an extension and the renovation of the existing building to blend with the new extension and ensure that all the facilities will be of a standard comparable with any school in the constituency or, indeed, in the country. That is something to which they are <Col N="2177" /> constitutionally entitled.  They also want a proper playground and recreational area for the pupils.</P>
      <P>This is a mixed and very large school of over 150 pupils.  It is different from a situation in an urban area where one has separate boys' and girls' schools.  We have a very large mixed school and it is important that there should be proper playground facilities let alone school structural facilities.  A proper environment should be created so that parents can be assured that their children are within a proper school environment and that teachers will be teaching in a proper environment.</P>
      <P>In times of such serious unemployment in our country and throughout Europe the children should be assured through the State and the Department of the best possible educational facilities so that they would come out of their first level education with the maximum opportunities and input from the teachers in a proper environment.</P>
      <P>This extension was approved six years ago.  I have raised this matter by way of formal representations and by way of parliamentary question.  I am now delighted to be reinforcing this request by my colleague, Deputy Kitt, to the Minister asking that the work be carried out.  The school has five excellent teachers who have a tremendous interest in the locality.  Some of the treachers who did not come from that locality moved in to live and have a total commitment to the area.  The board of management, the teachers and the parents have been very patient for a long time.  It is my information that this extension is third on the list.  The two ahead of it have now been decided upon.  If that is the case, I would be very grateful if the Minister could make a positive decision in favour of the children, the parents and the people of the Lavally area of County Galway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the Minister for his contribution in a very short time to education in our country.  The Minister has got an <i>ad hoc pro tempore</i> settlement in the teachers' dispute.  We all welcome that <Col N="2178" /> and we are delighted with it.  The Minister's personality and attitude has helped in a substantial way in bringing that about.  I would like to pay tribute to him and to his Minister of State, Deputy Kenny, who comes from the other side of the county boundary which is close enough to Lavally and who should have first hand knowledge of this area.</P>
    <P>I hope that the playground, in particular, will be included in whatever development goes ahead.  The amount of money to be expended <i>pro rata</i> per pupil is very minimal in comparison to the amount of money being invested by the State in other students in our country.  When one considers it costs the taxpayers of this island in the region of £23,000 <i>pro rata</i> per head to educate a dental student and the amount of money being expended here is £1,000 per pupil in order to provide teachers, pupils and parents with a proper teaching environment and teaching facilities in the heart of rural Ireland, it is saving the State a lot of money in not having to build a new school.  Both of us as Oireachtas Members for the constituency are appealing jointly to the Minister for Education to ensure that the small amount of money needed to be expended will be spent immediately and that the work will be carried out during the summer.  This is very important because we have six to seven weeks of summer holidays coming up.  It would be very unfair to expect teachers and pupils to go back into a similar teaching environment next September.  Considering that we have had very inclement weather over the past few years &mdash; this year is no better &mdash; we hope that teachers and pupils will not have to go back into that same environment where the weather is having a major effect on the school's facilities and environment in Lavally.</P>
    <P>I am appealing on behalf of my colleague, the parents, the pupils, the board of management, the school manager, the teachers and I to the Minister for Education to ensure that this decision is made <i>quam celerrime.</i></P>

      <P>Having regard to the nice things the <Col N="2179" /> Deputies opposite said about me I can hardly do anything except to say I have listened with great sympathy to what they have had to say.</P>
      <P>I have been aware of the need to provide additional accommodation at Lavally national school.  As Deputy Kitt has indicated, it has grown very significantly over the last number of years.  My Department have agreed to grant aid the erection of an extension which will comprise three new class rooms and the conversion of part of the existing school to a general purpose room.  When the work has been completed we will have a school comprising five class rooms, a general purposes room and there will be ancillary facilities which will include teachers' rooms, library, medical room, stores, car park and, as the Deputies will be glad to hear, a full size ball park.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I acknowledge that there has been some delay.  Part of that delay has arisen because of the need to make a revised submission to Galway County Council in connection with the final planning permission for the object.  That, I am glad to say has now been satisfactorily concluded and the preparation of the contract documents is virtually completed.  The Deputies will be aware that there are many cases of extensions to national and primary schools all over the country.  These have to be ordered in a methodical way. Lavally national school can expect to be <Col N="2180" /> got under way quickly.  I cannot put a precise date on it but I expect and will urge the speedy completion of the technical documents, if that has not already been achieved.  As soon as that has been done, I will arrange for the invitation of tenders.  I am certainly convinced by what I know of the subject and by what I have heard from the Deputies that it is an urgent problem.  I will give it urgent attention within the Department to ensure that when the matter comes to me, and I will ask that it be brought to me at the earliest possible moment, it will get priority.</P>

There are no proposals at present to reopen any of the stations which closed at that time. <Col N="2146" /> Apart from the high capital cost involved in providing stations the manning of additional stations tends to absorb Garda manpower which, according to the Garda authorities, can be used more effectively on outdoor operational duties.</P>

      <P>The Law Reform Commission submitted a report and recommendations last year on offences under the Dublin Police Acts and related offences.  The commission's recommendations in relation thereto will be considered and appropriate legislative reform undertaken as soon as resources permit.  I should mention that a number of provisions of the 1842 Act, such as road traffic offences, are within the area of responsibility of the Minister for the Environment and their review and updating would be a matter for him.</P>

      <P>Particulars of Garda strength and administrative staff in each Garda district in County Cork on 31 December in each of the years 1983 to 1985 and on 31 March 1986 are given in the form of tabular statements which I propose to circulate in the Official Report.  The Garda authorities inform me that the information sought in respect of 1981 and 1982 is not readily available and that its compilation would involve diverting Garda manpower from other more pressing duties.</P>
      <P>The Garda authorities report that the current Garda strength in each Garda district in County Cork is considered adequate having regard to overall resources and other demands on Garda services. The needs of these districts will continue to be kept under review.</P>

In addition the handing over to the prison service of the new unit at the Central Mental Hospital will make available a further 31 places.</P>

      <P>The deciding officer was not satisfied with the evidence of age provided because the date of birth shown on the birth certificate submitted was not sufficiently clear.  Several requests for a new certificate were made but the claimant refused to supply another certificate and indicated that she did not wish to pursue her claim further.</P>
