    <Title>Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission (No. 2) Bill, 1986    [Seanad]:    Committee Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That section 6 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>When I moved the adjournment on the last occasion we were discussing section 6 and, in conjunction with it, the Second Schedule setting out the provisions relating to an improvement scheme.  One of the problems with that scheme is the complete lack of public participation and An Taisce, for example, feel very strongly about that.  In their view, the improvement scheme drawn up by the proposed commission will supersede the existing local authority development plan when sanctioned by the Minister for the Environment under section 6.  The whole public participation process for the creation of a development plan as provided in the planning Acts is thus set aside.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The alternative provision for public participation in the drafting of the improvement scheme by the proposed commission as set out by the Minister in the Bill is extremely limited.  Section 3 of the Second Schedule to the Bill states the commission must have regard to the existing development plan.  The provision made in section 3 (d) of the Second Schedule is in complete contrast to the detailed procedure for public involvement in the drafting of local authority development plans established under the planning Acts.  It provides merely that the commission make arrangements for submission by interested persons and for the consideration by the commission of any such submissions.  Of course, the reality is that, in practice, this leaves the commission with complete liberty to <Col N="2708" /> determine the degree of public participation. The provision that the commission shall make arrangements for the consideration of any public submissions is loose in legal form.  I should like the Minister to comment on that point.  In contrast to the consideration given to the public submissions, the commission &ldquo;shall have regard to the existing development plan&rdquo;.  The special position of prescribed bodies such as An Taisce contained in the planning Acts is not considered in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 6 (5) (b) further provides that any development carried out by a person other than the commission which is certified by the commission as being in accordance with the improvement scheme may be exempted from the requirements of the Planning Act.  This section completely eliminates the existing procedures whereby third parties may make submissions to the planning authority on a particular development at planning application stage.  It also eliminates the right of a third party to appeal against planning permission decisions.  Under the Bill as now proposed a development may proceed by private agreement between the commission and the property owner or developer, without any procedure to give information to third parties.  Not only will third parties lose the right to appeal but they will not even have the right to information about what is going on.  The provision by which plans of proposed developments and copies of all planning permissions and decisions are available for public inspection in the planning authority premises is a very important feature of the Planning Acts.  That will not be available.</P>
    <P>Section 6 effectively disregards public information and third party submissions and appeal rights.  A major element of planning is the right to information, the availability of the planning registers, appeal rights, the rights to see applications. These rights are being done away with because of the private arrangements that can be made under section 6 and the Second Schedule, where the metropolitan commission will decide their <Col N="2709" /> improvement scheme and then any developer or property owner who is prepared to develop his or her property in line with the improvement scheme does not have to go through the whole planning procedure. I am interested to hear the Minister's views.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Boland) Minister for the Environment (Mr. Boland)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already basically outlined the situation in relation to the provisions of this section and the Second Schedule. The onus will be on the commission to prepare an improvement scheme or schemes.  If the scheme is as detailed as to provide for detailed treatment of facades of property, for example, it will allow a property owner who is prepared to redevelop or refurbish in line with the scheme to carry out that work without having to seek any other approvals, except by-law approval which would in the normal way be necessary.  If an improvement scheme is not in existence in that particular part of the central area, or if a proposal is at variance with the improvement scheme, an applicant would have to apply in the normal way for the permission of the local authority. That application would be subject to the provisions of the Planning Acts in relation to appeals and the like.</P>
      <P>The situation is radically different from that represented by the Deputy in that the only type of development which would not have to receive planning permission and be subject to appeals procedures would be a development which was wholly in conformity with an improvement scheme prepared by the commission.  Where the commission have prepared a detailed improvement plan for a section of the area and property owners are prepared to improve their property exactly in line with what is proposed by the commission, they will be allowed to go ahead without having to go through any further procedures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is provision in the preparation of the improvement scheme for consultation with Dublin Corporation to take into account the corporation's development plan.  There will also be provision <Col N="2710" /> for the commission to receive and consider submissions from interested parties. Then the improvement scheme has to be sent to the Minister for ratification.  There is also provision for the Minister to consult with and hear the views of Dublin Corporation before the improvement scheme would come fully into operation. Procedure for hearing the views of voluntary or other bodies is provided for at the stage of making of the improvement scheme.  In all other cases the planning application procedure will apply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>In theory it sounds fine. The Minister must submit to the corporation the scheme suggested by the commission.  They have one month in which to make comments and send it back.  The Minister may or may not listen to the views of the corporation.</P>
      <P>Section 6 (4) states:</P>
      <P>Where an improvement scheme is submitted to him by the Commission the Minister shall consider any objections made to the scheme by Dublin Corporation within one month of its submission to him and may modify the scheme in such manner and to such extent as he thinks proper and may approve the scheme or the scheme as so modified.</P>
      <P>That is the full extent of the consulation procedure.</P>
      <P>The role of the third party is a very important aspect of our planning law but it is totally ignored in this Bill.  In the light of the special arrangements between the developer and the commission, that right of appeal no longer exists.  Let us consider the case of a premises in O'Connell Street.  Will the commission be working on the basis of improving the facade or designating the use of the building or even the internal design?  Will they change the facade of some of the take-away places or have they the power to decide that a particular premises will no longer be used as a take-away food establishment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It is envisaged that an improvement scheme would deal with <Col N="2711" /> such questions as facades and the external appearance of properties in the streetscape. The question of usage may well arise and I remind the House that this matter will be dealt with in section 11.  It is not envisaged that matters such as the internal layout of premises would form part of the matters which might fall to be considered in the context of an improvement scheme.  At the time when an improvement scheme is being prepared for an area an onus falls upon the commission to take the views of interested parties into account.  People who have such views should make them known when the scheme is being prepared.  The commission also have an onus to consult with other authorities such as the Dublin Transport Authority and Dublin Corporation. In turn they refer the proposed scheme to the Minister for consultation with the corporation and his eventual decision as to whether the scheme should be adopted, with or without modifications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The commission will have power to decide not only on the facade but on the use of particular buildings. They have the power to change and take action on unauthorised development but where a shop or take-away is built and is an authorised development, whether authorised by the local authority or by An Board Pleanála on appeal, will the commission have the right to say that they no longer believe that is the correct usage for the building?  For instance, can they say to Kentucky Fried Chicken on the corner of O'Connell Street and Abbey Street that in the context of what is good for that area, the commission do not believe that that business should be on that premises, and they will rescind permission and pay compensation?  What way does this work?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the subject matter for a later section&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>It is but it is also relevant to the Schedule we are discussing in conjunction with section 6.  This Schedule <Col N="2712" /> talks about the provisions relating to an improvement scheme.  I believe it is appropriate to discuss this matter on this section because in the development of an improvement scheme the Minister says the usage of a building as well as the facade will be taken into account.  Therefore, it is relevant to ask what happens to a building the use of which has been decided by planning permission granted by An Bord Pleanála or the corporation, if the commission put before the Minister a proposal for a change of usage of, say, Kentucky Fried Chicken so that it might revert to being a newspaper office?  If the Minister sanctions the improvement scheme as prepared under the Second Schedule, does this mean he is liable for compensation?  Who pays the compensation for the change back to, say, a newspaper office?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin North-West):</i> I want to ask about a building at present occupied by Aer Lingus in O'Connell Street.  I understand this office will be vacated in the near future.  Will the commission be able to decide what kind of development will be there?  Will he guarantee we will not have a chip shop or a take-away on those premises, but that the commission will be able to decide on a suitable development for that premises?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It is always very difficult when we get into specifics.  We have now mentioned two particular existing users in O'Connell Street, and it might be better if we tried to avoid that.  As a general principle, if a building is vacated by a current user, in the context of the preparation of an improvement scheme or in the context of section 11, the commission would have the power to indicate the type of usage they felt most appropriate or which they felt ought not be permitted.  As regards Deputy Burke's question, if I were to respond to it in detail I would be prejudging the discussion on section 11.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair feels that the change of usage is much more <Col N="2713" /> appropriate to the discussion on section 11 (1) (b).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no strong views on that except that this comes under the provision relating to the preparation of an improvement scheme.  However, I will wait until we get to section 11.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a case of Tweedledum and Tweedledee.  I will wait until we reach section 11.  I am worried because it appears that the Minister is not clear in his mind as to what exactly is in this Bill. On the last occasion we discussed the improvement the Minister wants.  The idea in this Bill is to improve the spine of our capital city.  During the debate the Minister made what to me was a very revealing statement.  He said he viewed Upper O'Connell Street as being dead and that it needed a particular improvement scheme.  I mentioned what was in Upper O'Connell Street.  That area is exactly what this Bill should be trying to improve rather than declaring it a dead area.  Starting at the corner we have the Ambassador, the Parnell Monument and a bank on the corner of Cavendish Row and Parnell Square.  On the other side of the road there is a bank, the Aer Lingus offices, the Royal Dublin Hotel, the headquarters of Dublin County Council, the Carlton cinema and CIE premises. On the far side of the road there are An Bord Telecom, the Gresham Hotel, the Savoy Cinema and Bord Fáilte headquarters. There are two takeaways and a restaurant in this area, as well as a building society.  As far as the facade is concerned, that is probably the best part of O'Connell Street.  If the Minister views this as a dead area, does that mean he views the other side of O'Connell Street, from Abbey Street to the river, which I would describe as the honky-tonk area, as the ideal world?  I would like the Minister to let the House know that he is clear in his mind as to what is required of <Col N="2714" /> this commission, because if we are talking about facades and ideal usages.  Upper O'Connell Street, which he considers to be dead, would seem to be the way we should be going.  In that area there are hotels, two cinemas, banks, offices for Aer Lingus, Bord Fáilte, Bord Telecom, CIE and the county council&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>This is an enabling Bill and it would be unfortunate at this stage if the debate were to develop into a discussion of whether the premises owned by &ldquo;A&rdquo; could be improved.  That is another day's work for when the Bill becomes law.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I disagree with you because this Bill is about improving the streetscape and the quality of life in our capital city streets &mdash; O'Connell Street, Cavendish Row, Westmoreland Street, D'Olier Street, Nassau Street, Grafton Street.  It is about improving those streets or portions of them.  It is very important that we know the Minister's mind We have taken many strolls down O'Connell Street.  There has been much television and newspaper coverage.  There has been much of the type of talk that we must return Dublin to its state of 20, 30 or 40 years ago.  When we get down to the nitty-gritty of what is involved in the Second Schedule, in the provisions relating to an improvement scheme, it is important to know the mind of the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister says Dublin has become <Col N="2715" /> too gaudy and so on.  I suggest that the gaudy end of O'Connell Street is comprised of the portion running from the river to Abbey Street where there are all of the take-away shops of various descriptions. The Minister, in a scathing way, described Upper O'Connell Street as being dead.  I would make the point that Upper O'Connell Street comprises the Gresham Hotel, the Royal Dublin Hotel, three banks, the head offices of Aer Lingus, Bord Telecom, Bord Fáilte, CIE and Dublin County Council. There are also the two oldest cinemas in the city located there, the Savoy and the Carlton, which are absolutely associated in the public mind with O'Connell Street.  That portion of the street, as the Minister described it, is dead, needing improvement and up-lifting.</P>
    <P>Within the provisions of the Second Schedule relating to an improvement scheme I want to know what exactly the Minister has in mind for that area.  For example, has he in mind that that end of the street should be converted into what is now to be found at the far end of the street?  I understood that the whole objective of this Bill was to get away from that.  That was what the Minister's own backbenchers were speaking about.  It must be remembered that we cannot have it both ways.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I really do not think we are getting anywhere.  This is the second day on which the Deputy has endeavoured to trot the House up and down a small section of the central area of the city.  His description of it is less than accurate.  For example, he conveniently omitted to mention the fact that there has been a major derelict site in the area about which he speaks for the past seven years.  He conveniently skipped that site in his perambulations down one side of the street.  The Deputy, I and others know very well that in the building in which he has his office the original planning permission was given on the basis that there would be four, five or six shop <Col N="2716" /> fronts fronting onto the street.  A different usage was made of that building.  A combination of various developments like that means there is less activity to attract the general public to that end of the street.  The Deputy is being disingenous in representing my remarks about that end of the street being dead as meaning that I favoured or somehow felt that the opposite end of the street was in some way superior or constituted the goal at which we should aim.  My views are quite well known and have been expressed in the House in some detail.  In the course of our discussion on Committee Stage on the last day I made every effort to be as helpful as possible.  The result is that the Deputy now has us running up and down 75 yards each side of Upper O'Connell Street.  It is pointless to the activities of the House and does not improve the standard of debate.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 7.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 11 not moved.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 7 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies Mac Giolla and De Rossa raised an interesting point in their amendment &mdash; which unfortunately they have not moved &mdash; where they say:</P>
      <P>Such work as the Commission may require undertaken as a road authority, or in relation to the cleansing of streets, shall be carried out on behalf of the Commission by Dublin Corporation under such terms and conditions and for such sums of money as may be agreed between the Commission and the Corporation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This section covers the whole question of the transfer of road functions to the commission.  Who has the Minister in mind to undertake the work and who will pay for it?  Will it be paid for by the commission out of the £10 million which is to keep them going for three years? Is that meant to keep the commission <Col N="2717" /> operational, to undertake all of the functions the Minister intends giving them even down to street cleansing, road naming and so on?  Who will do the work and who will pay for it?  This is relevant because, after the lifetime of the commission, under the provisions of section 4 (3) (a) if the commission decide to use private contractors, the Minister has the power to insist that Dublin Corporation continue to use private contractors.  I believe the work should be undertaken by Dublin Corporation.  I would be interested to hear from the Minister if that is what he has in mind.</P>

        <i>(Dublin North West):</i> I should like to raise two questions raised also by Deputy R. Burke.  I would be concerned if the power is to be taken from Dublin Corporation and transferred to the commission because under the provisions of this section the commission will be responsible for the cleansing of the streets in that area.  Like Deputy R. Burke, as a member of Dublin Corporation I would be concerned to know who would be engaged to undertake this work.  For example, would the staff members of Dublin Corporation cleansing department be made redundant?</P>
      <P>I heard the Minister say in the course of the Second Stage debate that he took a stroll through the city from Grafton Street right over to Parnell Street, and he intimated that O'Connell Street was in a deplorable condition.  I wonder was he referring to the litter on the street.</P>

      <P>As the House knows, local authorities carry out work of this nature in a number of different ways, sometimes by way of direct labour and on other occasions by employing contractors to do the work for them.

What I am concerned about is that the £10 million being devoted to this task over the three year lifespan of the commission will not be used as a means of reducing the overall rates support grant of the local authority. I am concerned that this will constitute additional funds for Dublin rather than a diversion of funds from Dublin Corporation to the commission.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a classic example of where this Bill is merely a cosmetic exercise from the Minister.  The various powers of the Garda and the local authorities in this area were transferred by way of recent legislation to the Dublin Transport Authority.  Last week there was the first meeting of the Dublin Transport Authority.  Even as this Bill is being discussed and as the Dublin Transport Authority are being established part of their powers are being swiped and given to the Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission. That is confusion upon confusion. If this commission was about improving the facades of the buildings it would have some merit.  As a result of this Bill I fear that rather than improving traffic management in the city we will have greater confusion than at present. Powers are being transferred from the corporation and the Garda to the Dublin Transport Authority and then to the Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission. That leads to endless confusion especially when one is being established at the same time as the other so this is a totally unnecessary section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>This section is an integral part of the functions the Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission will be expected to carry out.  If we are to have any substantial improvement in the Dublin central area the entire question of the control and management of traffic will be very much part of the activities of the commission.  As I explained previously to the House, it is hoped that O'Connell Street can be restored to a street where the pedestrian is supreme rather than the traffic.  For example, if the commission are to prohibit heavy traffic from using O'Connell Street or to have power to make regulations regarding the usage of the general area by traffic &mdash; the hours at which goods vehicles may come to make deliveries and the <Col N="2720" /> pedestrianisation of streets and so on &mdash; they need to have these powers.</P>
      <P>It is coincidental that the Dublin Transport Authority Act predated this Bill. The Dublin Transport Authority had just come into operation this week.  I remind the House that were it not for the obstructionist tactics of certain Members this Bill would have been enacted last June and the commission would have been in operation since July.  Presumably, we would then have another side of the argument and the suggestion that it was wrong that the commission had assumed these powers in advance of the setting up of the Dublin Transport Authority.  The commission will have these functions for a three year period and they will then revert, in the case of this section, to the Dublin Transport Authority.  In this case, as in other cases relating to functions such as this, the success of the commission in this area will depend largely on close co-operation between the commission in their activities as empowered under this section and the Dublin Transport Authority in relation to their responsibilities generally for transport and transport management in the general Dublin area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I support what Deputy Burke said with regard to the taking of powers from the Dublin Transport Authority. Despite what the Minister has just said, the Dublin Transport Authority could have been predated by this Bill being enacted some time ago.  The Fianna Fáil Government after many months of discussion and after modifying their proposals had prepared and sent to the draftsman four years ago a copy of the Dublin Transport Authority Bill.  It did not surface for many years and when it did surface it was a weakened and emasculated form of the Bill that finally reached this House.  It was not welcomed by anybody.  Notably, many members of the Minister's party found it weak and unsatisfactory compared with what could have been done.  I refer particularly to a very good contribution &mdash; his contributions are always good &mdash; by junior Minister.  Deputy Richard Bruton, who went along with my thesis that the Bill <Col N="2721" /> was weakened so much that it was not going to be very useful with regard to transport in Dublin city.  There was a battle between the Department of the Environment and the Department of Transport and the Department of the Environment won.  Now there is another battle with still more power being taken from the Dublin Transport Authority.  I would like this House to give that Department a bloody nose after its two victories by rejecting this grab for power again, admittedly over a three year period.  The basic parts of the original, proper and healthy Dublin Transport Authority as envisaged was that there would be a traffic plan which would cover all points made by the Minister in his answer to Deputy Burke and that there would be a budgeting power and so on.</P>
      <P>If we had a decent Dublin Transport Authority Act the taking away of the powers for three years would be more fatal than it is but as it is taking power away from an already largely powerless transport authority perhaps we should not get too excited about it.  The whole question of traffic management, budgeting, co-ordination of plans between the various local authorities and so on could have been incorporated into a decent Dublin Transport Authority Act but that was not done.  Whatever powers were given to the Authority are now, before the ink is dry, being taken away by the Department of the Environment.  The House should register its objection to this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that a fundamental part of the powers of the <Col N="2722" /> commission will be traffic management. It is not as if one could decide on and control the volume of traffic in that area in isolation, as if one could decide whether the traffic should be heavy or whether there should be a move back to pedestrianisation.  It is not as if we can decide those things in isolation from all of the remaining traffic through the remaining portions of Dublin, whether it is Parnell Street, Abbey Street, the quays area or any other portion adjoining the streets mentioned as the areas to be dealt with by this commission.  To suggest that one can discuss traffic in isolation in O'Connell Street without it having an effect on Marlborough Street, on Gardiner Street, on Talbot Street, is a nonsense. I oppose this section of the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I referred to this during the discussion on section 7.  It refers to the employment of private contractors for the control and prevention of litter in the affected area.  We on this side feel that such work should be done by corporation staff under sub-contract to the commission rather than by private contractors. The Minister has taken power to transfer this work back to the corporation at the end of the lifetime of the commission and he may permit the local authority to continue the services provided by the commission during their lifetime.</P>
      <P>Therefore, we suggest that instead of using private contractors for this work, the commission should employ corporation staff, because at the end of the commission's term of office the work will be performed again by the corporation, and rather than have private contractors continuing to do this under the administration of the corporation it would be far better to have the corporation staff employed throughout the period of the commission's administration.  Otherwise we would have private contractors doing street cleaning jobs in the area under the jurisdiction of the commission and corporation staff cleaning other parts of the city.  This would lead to intolerable confusion.  We also want to ensure that the funding for this work will be adequate and will not affect the corporation's revenue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>First let me apologise for being absent when my amendment came up.  I expected to be back before it had been reached but unfortunately other events intervened to prevent that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me say in relation to section 9 more or less what I had hoped to say in relation to section 7 in my amendment to that section.  The position we have adopted on this Bill from the beginning has been that if the powers and money which the Minister is giving to this new authority he is setting up had been given to Dublin Corporation they could just as easily have done the job which he is hoping to do through this authority and it is totally <Col N="2726" /> unnecessary to proceed with this kind of authority.  The Minister, having got through this Bill in the Seanad and with the likelihood of his getting it through this House as well, at least should ensure that the local authority in the area who have the expertise, the staff and the structures to carry out such functions as road repairs, cleansing and the maintenance of litter free streets should be directly involved in that work and it should not be contracted out to private contractors. Apart altogether from the fact that this could undermine the morale of Dublin Corporation staff and would be a slap in the face for the very good work which Dublin Corporation staff have carried out over many years with very little resources, it would be the thin end of the wedge for hiving off other functions of the local authority and other work carried out by the local authority.  Therefore, I urge the Minister strongly to ensure that where work which is normally carried out by the local authority is being transferred to this new streets authority, the job itself, the sweeping of the streets, the maintenance of clean streets, the repair of streets and so on be done by the local authority who have the staff and so on.</P>
    <P>I am also concerned about section 4.  If the new authority were to enter contracts for the cleansing of streets, for the digging up or repair of streets with private contractors, when the Minister &mdash; this or any future Minister &mdash; decides either at the end of three years or before the end of three years &mdash; which may happen &mdash; that the contractors would be entitled to maintain those contracts, Dublin Corporation would be duty bound under section 4 to continue with those contractors to provide the services which they themselves are in a position to provide. There is no guarantee that at the end of the period, while the corporation would be saddled with these contracts, the extra funding which the Minister is providing now for the duration of the life of this authority or additional funds would be available to pay those contractors and the local authority would be faced with the additional task of paying <Col N="2727" /> funds out of their own resources for contracts which they had no hand, act or part in entering into but were obliged under this Bill to take over when the streets authority had been dissolved.</P>
    <P>Those are my concerns on how this Bill would operate in relation to the functions which Dublin Corporation have at present and which they should retain.  I urge the Minister to ensure that where this new authority are seeking to have these functions carried out, Dublin Corporation will be the one whom they will engage to carry out this work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett (Dublin North-West) Mr. Barrett (Dublin North-West)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin North-West):</i> Once again I would like the Minister to explain to the House who is going to take over the work at present being done by Dublin Corporation.  As a member of that corporation I do not agree that this authority should be taken over from the corporation.  It is nothing short of undermining the whole authority of the corporation and casting a reflection on the workmen in Dublin Corporation.  If this work is hired out to private contractors it would appear that the men in the cleansing department who do the work already will be made redundant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I refer again to the walk the Minister had from Grafton Street back to Parnell Street when he described here in the House how he was appalled at the condition of the streets.  I take issue with him if he is talking about the cleansing of the streets.  Again as a member of Dublin Corporation I am very much aware that the cleansing department do an excellent job.  They have special teams continually operating within the city centre cleaning up the refuse.  In Moore Street, Thomas Street and other places where there are markets the corporation workmen have to come in the evening between 5.30 p.m. and 6 p.m.  Anyone who has seen Moore Street or Thomas Street after the markets are closed can see the amount of refuse there and after a few short hours anyone going back there would not think they were the same streets at all.  The corporation workmen are dedicated and do an excellent job.  It would be a shame to <Col N="2728" /> take this authority away from the corporation in view of the fact that they are doing such excellent work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The examples which Deputy Barrett gave are not really relevant to the debate on this section. They pertain to areas which would not be covered by the remit of the Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission.  This section is simply in line with other sections of the Bill to give to the streets commission all of general powers for the operation, improvement and maintenance of the streets and the overground services in the streets to ensure that they are kept and maintained to the highest possible level.  Already I have indicated that I envisage the commission themselves having a very small staff and that they would perform their functions through the commissioning of work on their behalf.  I assume that a substantial amount of the work which would be done on behalf of the commission would be carried out on an agency basis by Dublin Corporation, but that will be a matter for the commission to decide when they are established.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>That is too loose.  I assume that the whole object of the amendment put down by Deputy De Rossa and Deputy Mac Giolla for section 7 is that it is too loose.  I support the point that they require that any work undertaken in relation to the roads authority or in relation to the cleaning of streets shall be carried out on behalf of the commission by the corporation.  For the Minister to come in and say that he assumes that the agency they will use is going to be Dublin Corporation is just not good enough.  It is necessary to tie this down.  I ask the Minister that on Report Stage &mdash; which we will be coming to shortly &mdash; he either accepts that amendment or includes an amendment of his own to ensure that the agency to be used would be the workforce of Dublin Corporation.  Otherwise we will have, for instance, the private contractors cleaning as far as the corner of Cavendish Row and the remainder of Parnell Square being <Col N="2729" /> covered by the corporation.  We would have all sorts of demarcation problems with parts of O'Connell Street and small portions of the side streets being cleaned by private contractors and the rest of the streets being cleaned by the corporation. That is bad enough in the lifetime of the commission, but when the commission's life is concluded after three years, the Minister has retained for himself the power which we rejected in an amendment put forward by me.  Section 4 (3) (a) provides that:</P>
      <P>The functions vested in the Commission (other than those specified in paragraph (b) of this subsection) shall, on the dissolution of the Commission, become and be exercisable by Dublin Corporation subject to such modifications as the Minister shall classify in the dissolution order.</P>
      <P>Paragraph (b) is in relation to the DTA. When we debated that amendment proposing the removal of this clause subject to such modification as the Minister may specify in the dissolution order, the Minister made the point that the reason he wanted, to retain this clause was that if the streets authority had been using some agency or other, he wanted to make sure that the corporation would have to use that agency in the future.  I see total confusion and a recipe for considerable industrial relations problems after the lifetime of this commission if the Minister imposes regulations on the corporation providing that they take back these streets under their control but that they must also use the cleaning and other agencies which may be used under this section 9 of the Bill.  It is bad enough that the Minister is taking these functions away from the corporation in this Bill but to allow the commission to use services of agencies other than the corporation is a recipe for chaos and major labour relations problems in the corporation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's response to the case made in relation to what the commission should or should not do in relation to having work done is not satisfactory.  This Bill is being brought <Col N="2730" /> in to ensure the improvement of Dublin's central thoroughfare, in the main.  This job could be done by Dublin Corporation given the powers and resources which the Minister is giving to the commission.  It is not good enough for the Minister to say that the commission can decide at the end of the day whether to engage Dublin Corporation as the agency to carry out the functions they are carrying out at present and which they will be obliged to carry out once the commission have stood down.  It must be obvious to the Minister that the corporation are the only authority capable of carrying out the general functions which are their responsibility at present, and which will be their responsibility at the end of the three year period of the life of the commission.  It is essential that the commission be given clear guidelines for the carrying out of cleaning, roadworks and so on which are the corporation's functions at present.  The commission should have to engage the corporation to carry out these functions in compliance with the plan the commission will come up with in relation to improving the street.  It is nonsense to argue that the commission should have the right to choose whom they want to do the work.  The corporation have the expertise, the staff, the experience, and the structures needed.  They are responsible for this work at the moment and will be responsible again.  It is nonsense for the Minister to say that the commission should have the right to decide not to engage them.  The likelihood is that they will decide not to engage Dublin Corporation to carry out this work.  I urge the Minister to accept the spirit at least of the amendment which I have put down to section 7, which would ensure that Dublin Corporation are taken on as an agency to carry out that work for the commission.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I dislike having to go into all of this again.  It is less than factual for Deputy De Rossa to say that if the corporation were given the money and the power they would be able to carry out the objectives put forward.  Virtually every power that has been given to the <Col N="2731" /> commission is already vested in Dublin Corporation.  This year the corporation will spend approximately £260 million in the provision of services in their administrative area.  I would have thought that out of resources of that size, had the corporation wished to add additional moneys to central Dublin, they could have done so long before now.  The commission will have, under section 1 (b), the functions of a sanitary authority under the Public Health Act of 1878. Dublin Corporation have those powers. It is interesting that the last occasion on which Dublin Corporation made by-laws in relation to the cleaning of the footpaths and pavements under that Act, the by-laws referred to were those made by the Right Honorable the Lord Mayor Alderman and the Burgesses of Dublin in 1878 and those moved under the Dublin Corporation Act, 1890.  Those by-laws were adopted by the Municipal Council on 5 June 1899.  The last time Dublin Corporation made by-laws under the Litter Acts, despite my exhortation to all local authorities to update by-laws under the 1982 Litter Act, was 11 February 1938.</P>

      <P>The Minister is being too clever by half in relation to this matter of Dublin Corporation and their resources and the laws and by-laws of 1899.  Dublin Corporation have a budget of £260 million this year to provide services for a population of almost 500,000 people.  In my area of Dublin North-West, Dublin Corporation do not have sufficient resources to sweep the streets. At the same time Dublin Corporation have put exceptional resources into the cleansing of O'Connell Street and they have a special team cleaning Moore Street every day of the week.  There are special teams in O'Connell Street every day of the week.  There is a constant round of cleaning that street.  For the Minister to imply, by his clever manipulation of dates and figures, that Dublin Corporation are not concerned about O'Connell Street or its environs is nonsense. Dublin Corporation made O'Connell Street and its side streets a special <Col N="2732" /> litter free area two years ago.  I do not know where the Minister got his 1938 date.  Two years ago Dublin Corporation designated O'Connell Street as a special litter free area.  There are fines for people who throw litter on O'Connell Street and other areas around there.  Dublin Corporation have erected special signs in O'Connell Street designating that area as a special litter free zone.  They have also spent considerable amounts of money in cleaning O'Connell Street and laying out the central island.  It may not be in line with what the Minister regards as suitable for O'Connell Street but they have spent money on it in so far as the Minister has allowed them having regard to the niggardly way he has applied resources to Dublin Corporation.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that most of the powers being given to the commission are available to Dublin Corporation, but he carefully avoided saying what powers Dublin Corporation do not have which the commission have.  Dublin Corporation do not have the power to go to a premises owner in O'Connell Street and say that they do not regard the use for which the building is being used as being suitable and that therefore they will shut the premises down and ensure that an alternative use is made of it.  There are other powers in this Bill which Dublin Corporation do not have and which they should have to carry out their functions. If the corporation were given a special funding of £10 million for O'Connell Street I can guarantee that the work the Minister is giving to this commission to do, over three years, could be done within 12 months.</P>

      <P>For the Minister to start talking about by-laws going back to the last century is ridiculous.  I wish to emphasise the point made by Deputy De Rossa. After the Litter Acts were enacted by me as Minister for the Environment, one of the first authorities to respond with a litter free zone were Dublin Corporation in relation to O'Connell Street.  They put up posters and signs, made an extra effort in the area and did an excellent job.  The Minister is very conveniently moving away from the section and the effects of giving to the commission the right to employ companies to act as cleansing agents on behalf of the commission and to employ private contractors and the confusion which will arise between private contractors doing one part of the street and the cleansing department of the corporation doing another.  There is no point in the Minister having a bash at the soft target of Dublin Corporation.  It may be popular but it is not reality.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to rely on the facts; Deputies can rely on rhetoric.  It is all very well for Deputy De Rossa to tell the House that Dublin Corporation designated a litter free zone but they have made no by-laws under the 1982 Litter Act.  If they had intended to designate O'Connell Street or anywhere else as a litter free zone they did not back it up by taking unto themselves the powers given to them in the Act to do something about it.  I have been exhorting them and other local authorities to make by-laws in this regard but only a minority have done so. The last time Dublin Corporation made by-laws under similar provisions was in 1938 and the last time they made by-laws regarding the proper cleansing of streets and footpaths was in 1889.  The corporation already have all the powers we are now suggesting should be given to the commission.</P>

      <P>I am not attacking the corporation but I must express my profound regret that the majority of local <Col N="2734" /> authorities have not made by-laws under the most recent legislation despite the fact that some months ago I radically increased the amount of fines which could be imposed by local authorities on an on the spot basis.  I changed the situation whereby if court proceedings were taken and persons fined, the revenue from such fines would accrue to the local authorities directly instead of, as had applied, going to the State.</P>
      <P>Deputy De Rossa spoke about the niggardly subvention which I gave to Dublin Corporation.  This year, in relation to current expenditure, the corporation will get Exchequer grants, taxpayers' money, of about £125 million.  Perhaps we are talking about questions of scale but I regard that sum as a lot of taxpayers' money.  It is not a niggardly sum and I am sure the taxpayers agree with me.</P>

      <P>The Minister is a master of the art of rhetoric although he berates us for using it.  However, I merely stated the fact that the corporation designated O'Connell Street as a litter free zone.  They did so and prosecuted quite a number of people many of whom were quite aggrieved at being fined for throwing a sweet paper on the street.  The Minister mentioned the sum of £125 million which is to be given to Dublin Corporation. It may be a large sum but it is not sufficient to run the services.  I gave the example of my own area where the corporation sweep the streets about once a fortnight although they sweep O'Connell Street six or seven times every day. If the additional powers and money which the Minister is giving to the commission were given to Dublin Corporation they could do the job and have proved it in the past.  There is a need to ensure that the commission do not employ itsy-bitsy private contractors to do the work which Dublin Corporation have the staff and experience to do.  They are responsible for that work at present and will be responsible for it again in three years' time.  That is the point at issue.</P>

      <P>We should remember <Col N="2735" /> that we are discussing section 9, the control and prevention of litter.  I want the Minister to ensure that the commission will not be allowed to use their powers to employ non-trade union, cheap labour, cleansing companies.  If that was the case, the corporation would be expected to take them on to continue the operation. It would mean that fly-by-night operators would be cleaning the main streets of the city and the corporation workforce would be coming up to the edge of the commission area.  That is the last thing we want to see happening and the Minister should insist that the commission should use the corporation workforce on an agency basis.</P>

      <P>These amendments would have the effect of giving the local authority the power of veto over a number of activities of the commission which the Bill sets out to assign to them for a limited period.  Quite frankly, I can understand Deputy Burke's motives behind tabling the amendments especially in view of the general line he has been taking in relation to the Bill.  We have been through the debate on a number of occasions and, essentially, what it seems to boil down to is that Deputy Burke would prefer that the commission were not established in the first place.  The effect of these amendments, to a large extent, would be to have the commission operate as some form of <Col N="2737" /> sub committee of the corporation.

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I have previously pointed out that in preparing an improvement scheme the commission would be obliged to consult with both Dublin Corporation and the Dublin Transport Authority; to take into account the development plan made by the corporation under the 1963 Planning Act; to make arrangements for the making of submissions by interested parties in relation to the improvement scheme to the commission and take those submissions or observations into account. In addition, following that procedure, the improvement scheme then being made must be sent to the Minister who would then consult with the corporation before deciding whether to approve, modify or reject any such improvement scheme. That procedure will more than adequately allow for any reservations, objections or more likely, observations which may come forward from an owner or occupier of land, structure or advertisement as this particular amendment adverts to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The principle of planning along with the right of the third party appeal, the right of an owner to appeal and the transparency of the planning procedure is vital.  Under the property rights contained in the Constitution it is essential that no owner should find himself faced with a decision of a commission, confirmed by a Minister, without having a right of appeal.  That is wrong in principle. The Minister should accept the amendment so that there would be a further avenue open to the citizen to appeal against the decision of an appointed commission which the Minister has confirmed. We could find ourselves in a <Col N="2739" /> situation where the commission make a decision on a particular premises in O'Connell Street.  When their improvement scheme is sent to the corporation they take a different view.  The owner favours the view of the corporation.  The improvement scheme within a month is confirmed by the Minister who has ignored the observations of the corporation and the individual property owner.  The property owner will have no rights whatsoever despite the fact that the corporation will have a development plan confirming his view.  The property owner will be going on the basis of the development plan and because of the commission's decision with regard to an improvement scheme he will find himself with no comeback.  He should at least have the right of appeal to An Bord Pleanála.</P>

      <P>I support the contention made by Deputy Burke in this matter.  I am extremely concerned that the approach to the operation of the commission undermines the established practice over the years whereby if a person who applies for planning permission to have work done on a building is dissatisfied with the decision of the planners he has the right of appeal to An Bord Pleanála.  What concerns me, in particular, is that the scheme will be made on the basis of submitting the plans to the Minister who will decide whether the scheme goes ahead or not.  This undermines the functions of An Bord Pleanála.  Prior to An Bord Pleanála being set up the Minister of the day was involved on a day to day basis with decisions relating to planning appeals, and appeals in regard to applications by individuals and companies for building approval or otherwise.  We are aware of the scandals that were involved then in the permissions given.  There are examples of them all over the city.  There is one good example in Donnybrook where a building was slapped up on a bridge.  That building is standing in the way of road widening and many other improvements.  Permission to erect that <Col N="2740" /> building was given by the Minister of the day against the advice of planners, the corporation and local people in various interest groups.  It is a monument to why Ministers should not be involved in the granting of permission.</P>
      <P>It seems to me that the Minister is breaking with the practice that has been established, that plans of this type should go to a disinterested party, or certainly a group of people who do not have a particular axe to grind.  That is why An Bórd Pleanála were established.  The idea was to ensure that Ministers of the day were protected from having to make decisions of this type.  However, there is a proposals in the Bill to establish a commission, the members of which will be appointed by the Minister, and it will be their function to present a plan to the Minister on what should be done with various buildings, streetscapes and so on in Dublin's O'Connell Street and other streets adjacent to it.  There is no facility in the Bill for the people who may be affected by those decisions of the commission and the Minister to appeal against them.  That is extremely dangerous and unsatisfactory and it is the aspect of the Bill I am most concerned about.  I urge the Minister to accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to explain to the House, and to Deputy De Rossa, that the procedure under the Bill is very far from the hypothesis outlined by him.  The commission, in preparing an improvement scheme, have to have consultations with the statutory bodies, the corporation and the Dublin Transport Authority and have to make arrangements for the invitation of submissions by interested parties, take them into consideration and send the scheme to the Minister.  The Minister will then invite further observations from the corporation before deciding whether to agree or modify the improvement scheme.  It will be the Minister's sole function to decide whether to confirm the improvement scheme or to make modifications to it.  Obviously, the modification will be in the light of further <Col N="2741" /> views or representations made by the corporation, or in the light of the submissions made originally to the commission in the course of their preparation of the improvement scheme.</P>
      <P>The improvement schemes generally, if the House can accept the concept of the improvement scheme as such irrespective of whether Members agree with the concept of the commission, will be for all or sections of the area from time to time. The whole purpose of them will be to improve the use, appearance and general character of that area.  Obviously, one of the hopes and intentions will be that property owners will respond to an improvement scheme by carrying out refurbishment in accordance with the objectives of the scheme.  In that regard it was felt appropriate to allow such property owners exemption from the normal planning process if the work they were doing was specifically in accordance with the improvement scheme and would result in the overall objective of having the aim of the scheme implemented in the general area covered by it.  In all other cases the property owner still has the right to apply for planning permission to Dublin Corporation and if he or she feels aggrieved by the decision of the corporation to take the application on appeal to An Bord Pleanála.  Similar provisions obtained in 1982.</P>

      <P>It is worth noting that the Minister's party opposed that Bill and, if such a provision was wrong then, it is wrong now.

There should be <Col N="2742" /> a right of third party appeal against an improvement scheme and I urge the Minister to accept that the owner or occupier of land should have leave to appeal to An Bord Pleanála.

      <P>The Minister made the point that the commission will be obliged to consult with interested parties, including the local authority, when preparing their improvement scheme and that that would be submitted to the Minister who may modify it.  The Minister may decide to do that on the basis of submissions made by individual property owners in O'Connell Street and other streets adjacent to it.  That is what I am concerned about.  The Minister is taking power to himself to decide in the long run what shape the plan for O'Connell Street takes.  He said individuals can apply to him to make changes in the plan and that brings us back to the position we were in under the last Coalition, between 1973 and 1977.</P>
      <P>At that time there were widespread allegations about the abuse of power by the Minister in regard to planning appeals and decisions.  An Bord Pleanála were established subsequently to end that practice and the amendment before us is seeking to ensure that people have a right to appeal to that board in relation to decisions made by the commission and subsequently altered or sanctioned by the Minister.  We want to protect the interests of citizens from the possibility or the accusation that the Minister may in some way be influenced by other individuals in relation to their property or somebody else's property.</P>
      <P>It is time for the Minister to say the commission are obliged to consult with local authorities and so on but that is not an adequate response to the case being made in regard to the right of appeal.  I urge the Minister to reconsider his position on this.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is talking about giving the right of appeal to other persons.  The amendment seeks to give to the property owner or occupier the right of appeal.  The property owner has the right to apply for planning permission to the corporation and if he or she is aggrieved by that decision to appeal to An Bord Pleanála.  The only instance in which the property owner would not have to go through that procedure would be if the property owner intended to carry out an improvement or alteration to his or her premises which was wholly in accordance with an improvement scheme already prepared by the commission under the procedures I have outlined.  Improvement schemes will not be for individual properties.  I imagine that at the minimum they will be for a block of properties from one street junction to another.  Presumably in almost every case they will involve the facade of the street on either side in the area to be covered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The intention of the section is to ensure that if a property owner within that area then decides to take the standard, appearance and presentation of his property up to the standard demanded of him in an improvement scheme, he might do so without having to make a planning application if it emerged there were not suitable or sufficient grounds for consultation between property owners and the commission at the time of the making of the improvement scheme.  I reiterate the provisions are for making submissions <Col N="2744" /> to the commission, not to the Minister. If it was felt the commission were not having sufficient consultation with property owners, the Minister still has the residual general powers under section 10 (8) to give the commission a directive in writing as to the manner in which they should go about ensuring there is a sufficient consultative procedure adopted and adhered to during the initial stages of the preparation of the improvement scheme.</P>

He was asked if the commission would have the power to decide on that and he said yes. He cannot have it both ways.  There are either individual properties concerned or blocks of properties.</P>
      <P>My amendment seeks to give to property owners who are citizens the right of appeal about how the commission and the Minister of the day may say their property should be used.  They should have the right of appeal to An Bord Pleanála about these matters.  I want the amendment put now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>This section gives the proposed commission sweeping legal powers for the removal or alteration of existing structures.  However, the provision fails to discriminate between the powers of the commission to deal with illegal structures as opposed to structures in conformity with the provision of the Planning Acts.  Concerted action to remove illegal structures in the area bounded by the proposed commission would be most welcome and desirable. However, a large number of structures have been erected entirely legally under permission from the corporation, An Bord Pleanála, or the Minister for the Environment before their establishment, the removal of which would be highly desirable if we are to have this clean-up of the city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will give a likely example.  A case would probably arise if the commission were to stipulate a prohibition on advertising signs on the upper floors of buildings as part of the improvement scheme. In order to achieve this, the commission would not only have to remove any illegal signs but would also have to seek the removal of legally erected signs like the Bailey's Irish Cream illumination already referred to.  Section 11 does not give a clear indication of the legal procedure which the commission must follow in seeking the removal, alteration or change of use of the structure or the removal or alteration of advertising structures which have valid planning permission.  It is very important to differentiate between the illegal sign and the legal one.  The application for the Bailey's sign was turned down by the corporation but an appeal was made to An Bord Pleanála and permission <Col N="2748" /> was granted in 1984.  It is possible that the provision might be open to legal challenge.  The effectiveness of this provision will also require compensation provision if the removal of legally erected structures is to be sought by the commission. That is a very important aspect of compensation on which the Minister might expand.</P>
    <P>I would like to hear from the Minister about the clear distinction in the treatment of illegal structures and if there should be a separate procedure for structures errected under earlier planning permissions. Section 11 deals with compensation and compensation claims. I would like the Minister to expand on this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a very clear distinction. Where the commission seek the removal or alteration of an unauthorised structure, they have the power to see that that is enforced without payment of compensation, with which I think the House would agree.  However, where the commission felt that, in pursuance of their desire to see an improvement in the area generally, they required the removal or alteration of a structure or advertisement which had a permission, then the compensation provisions outlined in this section would apply.  I do not envisage that a significant proportion of the commission's money will or should be used to pay large compensation claims as a result of requiring change of usage in the case of authorised structures.</P>
      <P>Where there may be authorised structures or advertisements which are generally regarded as regrettable, or which are not in conformity with the overall objective for improvement of that area, I hope peer pressure or the response of the owner or occupier, will show that the advertisement was clearly out of character with the rest of the improvement works in the area and they might readily respond to the improvement, alteration or removal of the offending advertisement or structure.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 19 seeks to limit the money which the corporation would be obliged to pay to the commission for the services they will be taking over from Dublin Corporation. The section does not put any limit on this money except to say that, if agreement is not reached between the commission and the corporation, the Minister presumably would decide.  We are seeking to delete the words &ldquo;or, in the event of disagreement, as shall be determined by the Minister&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;but such sum shall not exceed the revenue received by the Corporation for commercial rates within the Metropolitan Central area&rdquo;.  That is a reasonable amendment to this section.  There is nothing to stop the commission engaging contractors.  The Minister indicated that the commission will be free to engage whomever they choose to carry out work at present carried out by Dublin Corporation, and Dublin Corporation will have no control over the terms of the contract into which the commission will enter with such private contractors.  For that reason it is important that the extent to which Dublin Corporation will be committed to paying for such services, which the commission control under this legislation, would be limited to the amount they would normally receive in any year in commercial rates from the property holders or lessees in the central metropolitan area.</P>

        <i>(Dublin North-West):</i> Will <Col N="2750" /> the allocation to Dublin Corporation be deducted from this £10 million?  Will the corporation get a reduced allocation or will they get the same amount as the other local authorities?  At the beginning of each financial year the corporation have to submit their estimate to the Minister.  Will the corporation's allocation from the Department be reduced?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the last point, the £10 million Exchequer provision is completely separate from the rates support grant, the subhead in the Department of the Environment's current Estimates from which local authorities are grant-aided.  It would be wrong to respond positively to the Deputy's suggestion that the corporation continue to get the same amount of money as other local authorities because, as the Deputy probably knows, Dublin Corporation receive substantially more money than any other local authority.  As I mentioned earlier, this year they will receive £125 million in current account subventions from my Department.  The allocation to the corporation will be made in the normal way, as if they were still carrying out these functions.  It will be for the corporation and the commission to establish the amount the corporation would normally spend on the functions which are being transferred temporarily to the commission.  The corporation would then transfer that money to the commission, except for any of the functions which the commission might ask the corporation to carry out on an agency basis.  In that instance the transfer might be in the opposite direction if the commission were asking for a higher standard of work than that normally provided by the corporation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to Deputy Burke's amendment, if there is a failure to agree on the amount of money to be spent on these functions this year there is a need for some body or some person to arbitrate. I do not believe the clause which needs to be inserted will actually come into play because the corporation will be able to identify the amount of money they spent. Once that amount is identified, I cannot <Col N="2751" /> see that there will be a dispute between the two bodies when this provision is enacted.  It would be a question of establishing the amount of moneys expended by Dublin Corporation on the particular services and ensuring that that amount is transferred to the commission when they come into operation.</P>
    <P>In relation to the amendment of Deputies Mac Giolla and De Rossa, I am interested to know whether the Deputies feel that Dublin Corporation would be in favour of the provisions of this amendment being incorporated in the Bill.  Perhaps Deputy De Rossa might clarify the point for us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I can clarify that for the Minister by saying the amendment is one put forward by The Workers' Party, not one from Dublin Corporation. Whether or not Dublin Corporation are in favour of it, it is in the names of myself and Deputy Mac Giolla.  It is an amendment of ours, not of Dublin Corporation.</P>

      <P>The need for my amendment No. 18 is self-evident.  There should not be any need for disagreement about the figure being right or wrong.  It should be accepted as it is.  There should be no need for arbitration by the Minister involved.  I do not think the Minister should be involved.  I know what Deputy De Rossa is trying to get at.  I question whether the commission will do better out of it than they might otherwise because of the income from the rates on the streets being covered by the commission. I fear that the commission would make more out of it, taking money out of the pockets of Dublin Corporation rather than <i>vice versa</i>.  That would be my fear in supporting it.</P>

      <P>Perhaps the Minister will allow me to finish.  Part of our amendment reads:</P>
      <P>...... but such sum shall not exceed the revenue received by the Corporation for commercial rates within the Metropolitan Central Area.</P>
      <P>The Minister may well have a point, that if one were to take all of the rates involved in the rating of those buildings in O'Connell Street and say: Well, if we took all of those rates, that would be a lot more than it would cost to provide cleansing services or whatever in that area.  The point of the amendment is that it would be that portion of the rates which applies to cleansing, or would apply to whatever function Dublin Corporation would be handing over.  That is the intention of the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not what the amendment says.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have the Minister's draftsmen at my back to draft amendments.  The Minister may well feel it is a badly drafted amendment.  The fact is that is the intention of the amendment: In the case of the services which are being handed over by Dublin Corporation, it will be that portion of the rates that will apply, and no more than that will be paid over to the commission.  Does that satisfy the Minister?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said earlier, I can only deal in facts.  The fact is that The <Col N="2753" /> Workers' Party amendment would provide for the transfer of the total revenue from commercial rates on properties within the metropolitan central area to the commission.  I endeavoured to be helpful in seeking clarification from the Deputy as to what he meant, whether he intended that the commission would get more money than the actual amount expended by Dublin Corporation on the services in this area.  The amendment is as it is.  I cannot deal now with a modification which the Deputy feels he had better enter.</P>
      <P>I have no strong views on this.  I would be interested in hearing the views of the House.  As the two amendments are being taken together, perhaps Deputy R. Burke would indicate whether &mdash; if we were disposed to accept this amendment &mdash; he would be in favour of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The point being made about the amendment is not to say that all of the rates will be transferred to the commission.  The amendment says that it shall not exceed the revenue received by Dublin Corporation.  That is the important part.  If one reads subsection (3) it says:</P>
      <P>Dublin Corporation shall, in lieu of expenses that would otherwise have been incurred by them in the Metropolitan Central Area, contribute annually to the commission such sums of money as shall be agreed with the Commission...</P>
      <P>It is in respect of the services that they will agree the sums of money.  Then the subsection, as amended, would continue to say:</P>
      <P>but such sum shall not exceed the revenue received by the Corporation for commercial rates within the Metropolitan Central Area.</P>
      <P>It does not say it has to be the total sum of money, it says just that it shall not exceed that portion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I fully accept the point made by Deputy De Rossa that it is clear that the subsection reads that Dublin Corporation shall, in lieu of expenses that would <Col N="2754" /> otherwise have been incurred by them in the metropolitan central area, contribute annually and so on and that refers to the services specified, which services are specified in the rates demands as well.  It is obvious that is exactly what Deputy De Rossa is getting at and it should be clear to the Minister.  The Minister was making the point that, in our day, both of us have had the same draftsmen, probably using the same wording for convenience sake without actually checking.</P>
    <P>The principle Deputy De Rossa is advancing is one that can be supported. We want to ensure there is a limit on the sum of money, not to stipulate that the commission will get all of the rates money.  Rather the principle being advanced is that there be some limit placed on it because, as drafted, there is no limit.  The commission could decide they wanted to do a Rolls Royce job on it within their lifetime, which job Dublin Corporation could have undertaken themselves had they sufficient funding but which, because they have been starved of funds, they have been unable to do.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>In the few years I have been in this House I have dealt with quite a number of Bills and amendments. I have to admit I have never come across the Minister who has adopted the smart-Aleck approach this Minister has adopted to amendments being put forward by Opposition Deputies.  The Minister finds it extremely difficult to suppress his glee because he thinks he has found an error in the amendment put forward by our party.  On previous occasions when I have dealt with amendments in this House I have always found Ministers extremely helpful and courteous in their handling of them, recognising that Opposition Deputies do not have the drafting expertise available to them in their Departments. Having said that, I emphasise that the intent of the amendment is clear.  The Minister may not be satisfied with the wording.  He may feel that the wording is too broad, that it may be read legally as meaning all of the rates for that area being handed over to the commission.  I <Col N="2755" /> am quite prepared to accept the Minister's amendment to my amendment if he accepts the principle that where Dublin Corporation are being asked to hand over money to the commission for services they normally provide there, that sum of money should not exceed the amount they receive from the ratepayers in that area for those services.  That is the principle behind my amendment.  I would appreciate the Minister telling me whether he agrees with that principle. If he does, perhaps he would suggest a wording he feels would cover that intention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I have spent 17 years in the Houses of the Oireachtas and I do not need Deputy De Rossa to tell me how to conduct my parliamentary business.  I suspect I have personally drafted more amendments in my time than the Deputy ever will.  I took some care to endeavour to have the amendments I put forward in the name of my party mean what they intended, that they would be clear, unequivocal and would withstand scrutiny. The Deputy cannot have it both ways.  If the Deputy's amendment is accepted, on the one hand the corporation would presumably seek to pay less and, on the other hand, the commission would seek to have paid to them all of the revenue received by the corporation for commercial rates within the metropolitan central area.  I am quoting from the amendment.  There would be nobody to arbitrate as to what a fair or reasonable compromise was between those two situations.  The Deputy's amendment, as does Deputy Burke's amendment, seeks to remove the obligation on the Minister in the event of a disagreement to determine the appropriate amount.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Bill is drafted it provides that the corporation would contribute annually to the commission such sums of money as shall be agreed with the commission or, in the event of disagreement, as shall be determined by the Minister. That would be in lieu of expenses that would otherwise have been incurred by <Col N="2756" /> them in the metropolitan central area. That is a definable identifiable amount of money.  The information that enables that sum to be quantified rests in the administrative offices of Dublin Corporation. It would only be if the commission felt that for some reason or another the corporation were incorrectly identifying or had made an error in the identification of the amount of money which they would have expended in the area that there could be any disagreement.</P>
    <P>I said when initially responding to Deputy Burke's amendment that the provision in the Bill obliging the Minister to arbitrate will not have to be used because we are talking about a question of fact and the fact can be identified from within the records of Dublin Corporation.  If instead we were to agree, first, to Deputy Burke's amendment, if there was a dispute there would be nobody to arbitrate so as to establish with finality as to the amount of money.  I suspect that if Deputy Burke's amendment was removed and if there was a dispute &mdash; I am speaking very hypothetically and it is extremely unlikely &mdash; there might be no other way to resolve the dispute except for one or other body to turn to the courts.  I do not think that would be regarded by anyone in the House as a very satisfactory way to resolve disputes between two statutory bodies.  We all know that from time to time statutory bodies have negotiations with each other as to the amount of moneys which are due from one body to the other.  Normally there is provision in the legislation for some body or individual, normally the Minister responsible, to arbitrate in the event of such a dispute.  That is all the section seeks to do in relation to this amendment.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, if we accepted Deputy De Rossa's amendment the section would appear to indicate the Legislature felt that approximately the appropriate sum was the revenue received by the corporation for commercial rates within the metropolitan area.  Clearly, from the Deputy's remarks it is unlikely that Dublin Corporation would feel that <Col N="2757" /> the sum of money to be transfered should be all of that revenue.  Yet the commission could reasonably suggest that in view of the wording in the legislation &mdash; if this amendment were to be incorporated &mdash; they were entitled to all of that revenue.  Once again there would be nobody to arbitrate because Deputy De Rossa's amendment also seeks to remove the obligation placed on the Minister to bring the matter to finality.</P>
    <P>There is a basic difficulty with both of the amendments.  I suspect Deputy De Rossa's amendment would compound the difficulties which I outlined in relation to Deputy Burke's amendment.  It would seem to convey the impression that the Legislature felt that the appropriate level, not to be exceeded admittedly, was in or about the revenue from commercial rates which would normally be payable to the corporation in the metropolitan central area.  This is the highest valued area in the corporation's administrative responsibility. It has extremely high valuations. The effect of Deputy De Rossa's amendment would mean that in whatever way the matter was eventually resolved, the corporation would pay substantially more to the commission than is the intention of the section as it stands.</P>

The reason we put down our amendments in the first place is that there is nothing in the section as it stands, other than the intervention by the Minister, to limit the demands of the commission for <Col N="2758" /> the provision of the services the corporation are providing at present.  As I said earlier, the commission will be free to contract out these services presumably at whatever price they think is reasonable. What we are trying to avoid is that the corporation in turn would be obliged to hand over the cost to the commission for these services and that it would be limited to the amount which the corporation would receive in commercial rates for the services involved.  That is what we are concerned about.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;I spent endless hours last week discussing the various amendments and points put forward by Deputy Mac Giolla in relation to earlier sections of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>That is your job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It is unfair of the Deputy to suggest I did not give care or attention to any of the points or amendments put forward.  I discussed a variety of points put forward by the Deputy's colleague in extreme detail.  Proof of that should be evident in the fact that the debate on the first six sections of the Bill on Committee Stage lasted from immediately after the <Col N="2759" /> Order of Business until the commencement of Private Members' time at 7 p.m. on Wednesday last.  I do not think any Minister who is involved in a debate on a Bill where discussion on the sixth section had not been completed by 7 p.m. could be accused of being unreasonable or unfair in his approach.</P>
      <P>Section 12(3) states that Dublin Corporation shall, in lieu of expenses that would otherwise have been incurred by them in the metropolitan central area, contribute annually to the commission such sums of money as shall be agreed with the commission or, in the event of disagreement, as shall be determined by the Minister.  That means quite the opposite to what has been represented by the Deputy.  It means the corporation are obliged by this part of the Statute to transfer to the commission only such sums of money as would otherwise have been incurred by them in the operation of the functions which are being temporarily transferred to the commission.  I cannot envisage why there should be a disagreement between the commission and the corporation in relation to what is ascertainable fact.  The ascertainable fact is available to the corporation and, in turn, to the commission from the internal records of Dublin Corporation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is however, a further procedure which would help in the event of there being any dispute and before the matter might have to be referred to the Minister. Under the Public Bodies Order there is a procedure for identifying the way in which the compilation of expenses towards the operation and the provision of any services ought to be gone about. That procedure under the Public Bodies Order is used, for example, by the local government auditor; when he comes to audit the activities of the local authority he may very well find, from time to time, that one local authority are providing services for another.  A case in point might be in relation to Dublin Corporation which provide the public piped water supply in an area of South County Dublin. On the amount of money which the corporation might charge to Dublin <Col N="2760" /> County Council for providing and delivering a service which is the statutory responsibility of Dublin County Council, if the local government auditor when auditing the accounts of Dublin Corporation or Dublin County Council felt that the money being charged was wrong or was unfair to one or other of the authorities, he would turn to the provisions outlined in the Public Bodies Order, and would conduct his own compilation to establish what he felt was a fair and reasonable amount for one body to charge to the other in those circumstances.</P>
    <P>It is very unlikely that there would be a dispute between Dublin Corporation and the Metropolitan Streets Commission regarding this sum of money.  But if there were I see no reason that the same procedure would not be used.  We are talking about discussions between two sets of officials about the correct amount of money to be transferred from one body to another and I think the apprehensions and reservations being expressed by the Deputies are mistaken.</P>
    <P>There is a further and much more dangerous point.  In the event of there being, for some reason, absolute dispute which is apparently irreconcilable there must be provision for some body or person to arbitrate on the appropriate amount to be paid by the corporation to the commission.  If Deputy Burke's amendment were accepted it would prevent the Minister from carrying out that function.  If Deputy De Rossa's amendment were accepted it would prevent the Minister from carrying out that function and does not provide for anyone to arbitrate in the event of a dispute.  The subsection would then place an obligation on the corporation to pay expenses to the Metropolitan Streets Commission which they would otherwise have incurred in the metropolitan streets area and would provide also that the sum of money would not exceed revenue received by the corporation for commercial rates in the metropolitan central area.  If the Deputy reflects upon this he will realise that this would result in a greater likelihood of disagreement because the corporation <Col N="2761" /> would opt for the initial part of the subsection in lines 42 and 43 of the Bill while the commission would feel disposed to opt for the wording in the Deputy's amendment which would then be contained in the new lines 46 and 47 of the Bill.  Also, in the event of the amendment being accepted there would be nobody to arbitrate and I suggest that the likelihood of needing an arbitrator would be far greater if the Deputy's amendment were accepted because the subsection would appear to suggest two different methods of ascertaining the appropriate amount of money.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 21:</P>
      <P>In page 11, between lines 7 and 8, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(5)  The rate subvention grant, as paid by the Minister to Dublin Corporation, shall not be adversely affected by this Bill.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is fundamental to the Bill.  Whatever cosmetic exercise the Minister is involved <Col N="2762" /> in with this Bill, it is vital that the rest of the Dublin Corporation areas should not suffer financially as a result of this commission. This Bill sets out the sum of £10 million as being the total amount of grants paid to the commission under this section.  It also imposes the requirement on the corporation to hand over to the commission the sums of money necessary to allow them to keep services going.</P>
    <P>We on this side of the House are very much afraid that the rest of the corporation areas such as Finglas, Ballymun and the remainder of the Dublin Corporation areas, and the operations of the corporation, will suffer because of this cosmetic exercise by the Minister.  If the Minister had given adequate sums to the corporation to run their affairs this commission would not be necessary.  If the corporation, under the control of Fine Gael and Labour, had done their business properly there would be no need for this commission.  Now that the corporation are running efficiently with a strong Fianna Fáil team since the 1985 local election, the effects of that 18 months' work are being seen.  Much of the work set out for this commission has already been undertaken, some started by the Lord Mayor recently, and this cosmetic exercise is not required.  I am afraid the people of Dublin will be penalised by the Minister reducing the rates subvention for having elected so many Fianna Fáil members to the Dublin Corporation in 1985 against the Minister's party and against their associates in the Labour Party.  For too long Dublin has suffered from Coalition politics at a local level and I do not want to see it suffering at national level as well.</P>
    <P>Question put: &ldquo;That the Bill is hereby agreed in Committee and is reported to the House, and Fourth Stage is hereby completed and the Bill is hereby passed.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I was very anxious for an official opening as indeed was Deputy Seán Byrne who communicated with me about this.  Naturally the most appropriate person to open the room would have been the President, but because of various constraints of which the Deputy is aware, it had to be opened before 28 August 1985.  This was necessary to meet the terms of the will of the late President de Valera.  Also, unfortunately, the President was not available during that period.  Still we had to go ahead because of the constraints and it was in the interests of everyone that we should.  The museum continues to get other artefacts and memorabilia of other Presidents and perhaps on some future occasion when significant ones become available that might be an appropriate time for an official opening.  I would like to see that happen because it would help out so far as the Presidents' room is concerned and it would also help the museum generally.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he gave a statutory direction to Dublin County Council pursuant to section 3 (i) of the Courthouses (Provisions and Maintenance) Act, 1935, requiring Dublin County Council to provide and maintain a courthouse in Tallaght for and in relation to sittings of the District Court; if so, if he will make a statement on the progress which has been made by Dublin County Council in complying with the statutory direction given; and the progress which has been made in the matter since the direction was given in 1978.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Dukes) Alan Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Dukes)</NameTxt>
      <P>A <Col N="2767" /> ministerial direction was issued to Dublin County Council on 12 July 1978, pursuant to section 3 (i) of the Courthouses (Provisions and Maintenance) Act, 1935 to provide and maintain a courthouse in Tallaght for and in relation to sittings of the District Court.</P>
      <P>The direction was issued at the special request of Dublin County Council to give them the legal authority they considered they needed to enable them reserve a site for a courthouse in the proposed town centre.  It was not envisaged at the time that the provision of a courthouse should automatically follow on the issue of the direction and since then no official action has been taken to enforce the directive.</P>
      <P>As explained to the Deputy in reply to his previous questions on the matter on 23 October 1985 and 29 January last, the District Court business from the Tallaght area is handled by Rathfarnham district court.  The court disposes of all its business in two days per week and I am satisfied, therefore, that Rathfarnham district court is adequate to cater for Tallaght business for the immediate future.  In the circumstances, and particularly in these times of financial stringency, I am not prepared to put any pressure on Dublin County Council to provide costly and, in my view, unnecessary accommodation.</P>
      <P>If, nevertheless, the council themselves decide to go ahead with the provision of a courthouse in Tallaght I shall certainly consider whatever proposals they make.  I must emphasise, however, that by law local authorities are responsible for the full cost of providing court accommodation in their functional areas. There is no State contribution of any kind available for such projects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister regard it as somewhat strange, that eight years ago his office directed &mdash; and I presume a direction means what it says &mdash; the county council to provide a courthouse in Tallaght when the population there was considerably less than it is now?  Will the Minister comment on that having regard to the fact that the population of Tallaght is now 100,000 people, that <Col N="2768" /> virtually the entire work transacted in Rathfarnham district court is Tallaght business and that there is no transportation link by public transport between Tallaght and Rathfarnham? Will the Minister accept that this presents a serious difficulty to people who do not have cars and who have to go to the courthouse all the way from Tallaght, using two buses to get there, and having to involve themselves in a considerable and unnecessary expenditure of time and effort?  Surely in this day and age 100,000 people merit a courthouse in their own town?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>As pointed out, the direction given in July of 1978 was issued at the special request of Dublin County Council so that they would have the legal authority to reserve a site for a courthouse in the proposed town centre.  Those were the circumstances in which the direction was issued.  As to the second matter raised, I already pointed out that all of the business done in Rathfarnham district court is done in two sitting days per week.  The Deputy's third point touches on the wishes of the local authority. The provision and maintenance of court accommodation is a matter for the local authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely it cannot all be a matter for the local authority?  The Minister has at least a very important, if not a crucial function, in this because the Courthouses (Provision and Maintenance) Act, 1935, gives power to the Minister to issue a direction to a local authority to provide a courthouse.  The Minister's predecessor in 1978 gave such a direction.  Whatever may have been the background to it, there is no doubt but that the Minister gave a direction.</P>

It was at the express request of the local authority who needed a direction in order to have the legal power to reserve space in what was then a building that was foreseen to be for some time in the future.  It is not at all evading my responsibilities to recall the fact that the provision and maintenance of courthouses is a matter for the local authority.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I have one brief supplementary. The Minister said in his reply that in his view this would be unnecessary. Will the Minister recognise that District Courts were meant to be in local districts and consequently were intended to cater for people locally?  With the growth of Dublin there is a need to review the position at least in that respect along the lines suggested by the chambers of commerce in Howth, Tallaght and presumably in other areas.</P>

      <P>The Deputy's information is incomplete.  Average delays in consent cases are now less than three months. The arbitration cases are currently about three years old but I expect that delays in relation to such cases will be reduced to about one year.

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if it is proposed to extend community policing services in Galway city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am assuming that in his reference to community policing services the Deputy has in mind schemes such as the Garda &ldquo;clinic&rdquo; scheme which operates in the Mervue area of the city, the assignment of designated gardaí to cover specific areas of the city and the neighbourhood watch scheme.</P>
      <P>The deployment of the force and the assignment of specific duties to members of the force in any particular area are primarily matters for the Garda authorities. The authorities have informed me that all the community policing services that I have mentioned are operating successfully in Galway city; a Garda &ldquo;clinic&rdquo; or office has been set up in Mervue shopping centre and has a garda in attendance for three hours each day, two gardaí have been permanently assigned to specific areas in the east and west sides of the city and a neighbourhood watch scheme has been established in the Salthill area of the city.</P>
      <P>With regard to the question of extending these services, arrangements are well advanced for the setting up of a second neighbourhood watch scheme in another part of the Salthill area and it is hoped that further such schemes will be launched in the city in the near future.  There are at present no proposals to extend the other two schemes I have referred to as the Garda authorities are satisfied that current arrangements are making the best use of available Garda manpower. All aspect of policing will, however, continue to be kept under review to ensure that Garda resouces are deployed in ways that most effectively meet the needs of the community.</P>

Will he consult further with the Garda authorities in Galway in regard to the continuing series of late night disturbances which occur on a regular basis in certain parts of the city of which the Garda have been made aware by public representatives such as myself?  If there is a need for a greater police presence in these areas late at night, will the Minister ensure this is done so that the residents and tenants can enjoy the peace and contentment of their homes?

      <P>Regarding the first part of the question, it has been confirmed to me by the Garda that the operation of their clinic at Mervue has been very useful and successful.  As I said, there are no proposals at present to set up another clinic although the matter is being kept under review.  With regard to the second part of the supplementary, I will bring the Deputy's concerns to the attention of the Garda authorities who are, as the Deputy knows, already aware of the difficulties being experienced.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory-Independent</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he considers that there is an urgent need for a specialist Garda drug unit in the Ballymun area, Dublin 9, where the heroin epidemic is rapidly deteriorating; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The allocation of members of the Garda Síochána to particular duties is a matter for the Garda authorities in the light of their assessment of needs, available resources and other demands on Garda services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As has been stated on various occasions, the considered view of the Garda authorities, which is in line with current thinking in many other police forces, is that, while specialist drugs units have a valuable contribution to make, <Col N="2773" /> there is a limit to the extent to which available resources ought to be allocated to them, rather than to the provision of specialised anti-drug training of a much bigger number of members of the force who use the specialised training while also carrying out other police duties.</P>
    <P>The Garda authorities inform me that, in line with that thinking and having regard to the number of gardaí whose duties include the Ballymun area and who have received this specialised training in anti-drugs work, they are satisfied that the present arrangements represent a more cost-effective deployment of resources than would the setting-up of a unit of the Drug Squad at Ballymun station.  As in all such situations, of course, circumstances may change and the position is kept under review.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory-Independent Mr. Gregory-Independent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory-Independent</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the heroin problem in Balymun is the most serious in the city? Is he also aware that heroin is widely and easily available in Ballymun?  As a result of the activities of the specialist Garda drug unit in the inner city, which has eliminated the suply of heroin there, addicts from that area now travel to Ballymun to get their supplies of heroin.  Is the Minister further aware that two or three leading suppliers of heroin in Ballymun are known to the Garda, that the names of various smaller pushers in Ballymun are also known to the Garda but, because of the inadequacy of Garda manpower in Ballymun Garda Station where there are two detectives to cover crime generally and because of the absence of a drug unit similar to that in the inner city, they do not have the ability to deal with the problem?  As a result, no serious or significant conviction has been achieved in the area despite the gravity of the heroin problem.  In view of this will the Minister reconsider my request?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not dispute the Deputy's contention as to the size of the problem and I agree it is very significant and worrying.  In relation to seizures, there has been a development over the past three years.  In 1984, for example, <Col N="2774" /> there were 33 seizures of drugs in the Ballymun Garda sub-district of which 14 were heroin.  The number of seizures of heroin in 1985 was 22 and in 1986 it was 11.  The number of persons charged in each of those years with drugs offences was 37, 73 and 26 respectively.  I am aware, as the Deputy points out, that there is a number of known drug pushers and pedlars in the area.  The resources the Garda Síochána have at their disposal in that area include the total manning of the station.  In addition, two members of the central Garda district which includes Ballymun are specially employed in the prevention and detection of drug abuse and they operate in close liaison with the permanent drug squad.  In addition, a further 11 members of the Ballymun station complement have received special training in anti-drug work and they pay particular attention to that aspect of policing.</P>

Can I again ask the Minister if is he is aware that no member of the Garda Síochána in Ballymun Garda station has brought any significant heroin conviction in recent years in that area despite the gravity of the heroin problem there?  Does the Minister accept that concerned people in the inner city spent considerable time arguing the necessity for a specialist drug unit in the inner city before one was set up?  How long will the Minister wait while the same arguments are being made with regard to Ballymun, while the heroin problem gets out of hand and until the necessary action is taken?  The experience of the inner city unit paralleled in Ballymun.  That is what achieved the cleanup of the heroin problem in the inner city.  The concerned parents movement also played their part. Obviously, the convictions were achieved <Col N="2775" /> by a specialist Garda unit.  Such a unit is needed in Ballymun.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is probably aware, notwithstanding the fact and perhaps even because of the fact, that we have a specialised drug unit in the Garda Síochána, a great many of the drug seizures in the area are made by gardaí who are not part of that unit but who are cooperating with them.  Therefore, I do not attach the same significance to the first part of the Deputy's question as he does. The resources which are available and which have gained experience in various areas of the drug operation throughout the city are available to Ballymun.  The Deputy may be assured that it does not need pressing of me in this House, far from it, to ensure that I stay in very close contact with the senior Garda authorities.</P>

      <P>It is time that the Minister openly stated his position on overtime and gave the numbers working within the prison service.  Is the Minister satisfied with the overtime figure for 1987 of between £10 million and £14 million? Almost 500 people could be taken on within the prison service if the Minister made a commitment and faced this problem realistically which he has not done up to now.  Why has there been such a delay in reviewing the rostering system with automatic built-in overtime costing £5 million?  Compulsory overtime is not wanted by prison staff.  Has the Minister set a deadline for the completion of these negotiations?  This matter needs urgent attention.  In a recent reply to me the <Col N="2777" /> Minister indicated that these discussions were particularly controversial.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I would like to make the point to Deputy Wallace that I have already dealt with the first part of his question during the course of the debate on the Supplementary Estimates in this House a short while ago.  For the sake of clarity I will repeat what I said on that occasion, that calculations which divide the total overtime bill by average pay to give one a figure of 500 extra staff &mdash; I think I am quoting almost the exact words I used &mdash; are so far from reality as to be meaningless.  The second point raised by the Deputy has to do with discussions on rostering not only in relation to the particular problem he raises of built-in overtime but to rostering generally. I did not at any stage say that those discussions were particularly controversial. I said they were going on in the context of the conciliation machinery and that, therefore, discussions which go on in that context under the terms of the scheme must remain confidential.  I would have no other difficulty in discussing those matters with the Deputy. Finally, because I appreciate the difficulties which arise in relation to overtime working in the prison service and because the Government have agreed with that view I recently secured Government sanction for the creation of an additional 184 posts in the prison service most of whom I hope to have recruited by the end of this year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is under some misapprehension.  Interviews took place last January for the recruitment of people to the prison service because there is, in any case, an ongoing need to replace those who retire or leave for any other reason.  In addition, there has been a recent decision to recruit an extra net 184 officers to the prison service.  As I have said, recruitment is continuing with regard to that extra batch and I would hope that the vast majority of these will have been recruited by the end of the year.</P>

      <P>There has not been any `go-slow' in the Probate Office.  On the contrary, I am aware that, out of concern for applicants, the staff of the office have worked very long hours over an extended period in an effort to reduce delays and they deserve credit for this.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>It is for the Garda authorities, in the exercise of their professional judgment, to assess the relative merits of surveillance and of other forms of Garda activity.  Similarly, it is for the Garda authorities to decide whether or to what extent particular duties are to be carried out on overtime or on rostered duty.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that as far as they are concerned there is no overtime problem of the kind suggested in the question.</P>
      <P>As I have informed the House on a number of occasions &mdash; most recently on 7 November when I spoke in connection with the Supplementary Estimate for the Garda Síochána &mdash; adequate finance for essential Garda duties will continue to be provided and, as the Deputy is no doubt aware, the House, on my recommendation, voted an extra £1.6 million in a Supplementary Estimate for Garda overtime in 1986.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, we make an allocation in each year's Estimates for Garda overtime.  We increased that allocation this year by £1.6 million in the context of a Supplementary Estimate.  The use of those resources is a matter for the Garda authorities and they have informed me that as far as they are concerned there is no overtime problem of the kind raised by the Deputy.  I should like to add the reflection that it is a matter for the Garda authorities to decide whether particular jobs are carried out on normal rostered duty or on overtime and that the overtime provision of £13.6 million represents less than 6 per cent of the total pay cost of the Garda.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister accept it is his responsibility to ensure that the Garda authorities give priority to issues such as heroin, to which if one is to judge by the Minister's reply the Garda authorities do not give their priority?  I should like to take the example of Ballymun.  The names of the suppliers in that area are available to the Garda and details of their travelling quite freely to and from their source of supply in London are known by the Garda.  They are also aware of the names of the pushers who serve those suppliers.  The only way of achieving convictions is by intensive surveillance work and the Garda do not have the manpower by way of a special unit or the time, because of overtime limitations, to obtain those convictions. The problem is now reaching the proportions of a scandal because heroin is virtually out of control in the Ballymun area.  Will the Minister ensure that the Garda authorities review this as a matter of priority?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept the Deputy's contention that no priority is given to dealing with the heroin problem or any part of the drug problem.  I do not accept the Deputy's contention that the heroin problem has gone, as he says, out of control in the Ballymun area.  In reply to <Col N="2782" /> a question on another occasion, I said that although we must still be concerned at the level of drug abuse in the country, and in Dublin in particular, we appear to be making headway against it over the past couple of years, although not perhaps as quickly as we would like to see. It is not true to say either, as I pointed out twice in regard to this question, that there is a specific limitation on Garda overtime in respect of any particular type of Garda operation.  While I share the Deputy's concern, and the concern of the House, about effectively combating these matters, the House will be aware of the fact that there is a very clear and specific operational responsibility on the Garda on which this House will not trespass.</P>

      <P>The Minister has told us that the question of overtime is a matter for the Garda authorities but will he agree that his predecessor gave firm assurances to the Garda authorities on the additional cost that would arise in relation to Border duties this year which have to come from the overtime allocation mentioned by the Minister? Apparently, this assurance was not met.  Will the Minister agree that as a result of this gardaí in their operational duties have been left in a very tight position in regard to overtime and that that is the reason why many problems are arising?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy seems to have finger nailed himself into a general discussion on Garda overtime riding on the back of this question but I should like to make it clear that there is no question of assurances given to the gardaí, or anybody else, not having been met.  There is no question of any specific restrictions being imposed.  It was the concern of the House that we should cover the requirments adequately and the Garda were given an assurance by me that funding would be available for overtime to deal with any particular and required duties that could not be handled any other way. I lived up to that because I got the backing of the House for a Supplementary Estimate this year and I hope that is the <Col N="2783" /> last we will hear of this nonsense about overtime.</P>

      <P>The Garda authorities have informed me that estimates for the repair of the official car allocated to the Tánaiste which was involved in a recent accident are currently being considered with a view to deciding whether to repair or replace the car.  Arising from the accident, one claim, for damage to property, has been received and in accordance with normal practice this is being dealt with on behalf of the State by the Chief State Solicitor.

      <P>Article 20 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights requires that any advocacy of national, racial or religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence be prohibited by law. The nature of the legislation necessary <Col N="2791" /> to give effect to this provision is being considered urgently in the context of ratification of the Covenant.</P>
      <P>While I would stress that work on the preparation of this legislation is proceeding as a matter of urgency, I want to make it clear that the matter is more complex than might appear at first sight. It might be relatively easy to prohibit the grosser forms of incitement to racial hatred but the scope of the provision in the Covenant is very wide indeed and its implementation has to be reconciled with the right to freedom of expression, which is also recognised by the Covenant itself and is, of course, guaranteed by the Constitution. In this connection I would mention that a number of countries whose legal systems resemble our own (I am talking here about the major common law countries) have experienced difficulty in either legislating for Article 20 of the Covenant at all or in doing so in anything other than a fairly limited, public order context.</P>
      <P>I cannot, therefore, at this stage give a definite date for publication of the legislation but I hope that it will be in the near future.</P>

      <P>I draw the Minister's attention to the fact that a small group of head cases operating under the style of the NSIWP are regularly sending anti-Semitic literature to Members of this House and also to members of the Jewish community in Dublin.  They are distributing racist literature which is extremely distressing to foreign students, in particular, who are guests of this country. In the light of the fact that the Minister's Department have been preparing legislation in this area for approximately four years, I would ask the Minister to expedite matters so as to ensure that the legislation is published, circulated and passed by the Oireachtas during the next few months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the activities of the group to which Deputy Shatter has referred and I have seen a lot of their literature.  It has not been the case that <Col N="2792" /> we have found it possible to prosecute on the basis of the law as it is, but I assure Deputy Shatter and the House that this legislation will be brought forward at the most rapid pace possible, having regard to the considerations I outlined in the original reply.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. F. Fahey Mr. F. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice the reason the registration of property by the Land Registry is at present taking from 18 months to two years; if he is aware of the extreme hardship this causes, in particular to young couples on bridging finance; and if he will make immediate arrangements to make the necessary staff and structural changes to enable the Land Registry to deal with applications for registration in an efficient manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The current rate of lodgment of applications for registration of title in the Land Registry is approximately 87,000 annually.  Of these, about 80,000, or 92 per cent, are transactions in respect of land already registered.  The average delay at present in finalising such applications is slightly less than five months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Delays of the order stated by the Deputy are occurring in the area of first registration including applications for establishment of title acquired by possession, commonly known as &ldquo;squatters' title&rdquo; or Section 49 applications.  This category of applications accounts for only about 5 per cent in volume of the total number of applications lodged annually in the registry.  They are usually complex applications from the legal point of view and often involve protracted correspondence with solicitors.  While there are, accordingly, inbuilt delays in dealing with these applications, I am nevertheless conscious that the delays are excessive in many cases.  For that reason, steps are being taken, within the limitations imposed by the staffing restrictions affecting the Civil Service generally, which will have the effect of reducing delays in the area of first registration. <Col N="2793" /> These steps involve staff restructuring and redistribution of work.</P>
    <P>As a matter of policy the Land Registry give priority to any application in respect of which it is brought to their attention that exceptional conditions of hardship, such as bridging finance, exist.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. F. Fahey Mr. F. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister indicate the length of time taken for first registration?  Will he consider putting the Land Registry on a more commercial footing so that people who want to have their registrations dealt with quickly can pay for this service, as the vast majority are prepared to do?  This would speed up the work of the Land Registry.  I do not agree it is taking only five months, but even that delay is too long when people are on bridging finance or in urgent need of the registration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have indicated, delays of the order mentioned by the Deputy, that is, 18 months to two years, do occur. I am confirming that.  I appreciate his suggestion that we should treat the registry operation more in the nature of a commercial operation.  There is a requirement that the Land Registry should by and large cover their costs, which is the case at the moment.  There would be a very substantial problem, and possibly some legal complaint, if the Land Registry were to do substantially more than that, because of the nature of the office itself and the service it gives. The thought which has occurred to the Deputy is one which occurred to me, particularly when I was carrying out other functions which I had the privilege of doing until earlier this year.  The average delay in finalising the 92 per cent of ordinary applications is slightly less than five months.  That would obviously mean that some cases take longer but other cases are dealt with more quickly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if, in view of the fact that he has the recommendations of the select committee on Garda recruitment and training (July 1985), and the two reports (December 1985 and April 1986) of the Garda Commissioner's committee on training, he will say what action he proposes to take to modernise and update Garda training; when a revamped training strategy and training programme will be introduced; and if he will make copies of the latter two reports available to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The two reports in question cover very much the same ground relating to the very wide and important matters of Garda recruitment and basic training and the many recommendations which they contain including a number which have major financial and other implications, have to be examined very closely before conclusions can be arrived at.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Aspects of the reports which deal with the qualifications and the procedures for entry to the Garda Síochána are at <Col N="2796" /> present the subject of discussions with the various Garda associations and representative bodies at the Garda Conciliation Council in accordance with the provisions of Garda conciliation and arbitration scheme.  It would be inappropriate for me to make any announcement on these matters pending the completion of these discussions.</P>
    <P>As I have stated on previous occasions, it is my hope that it will be possible to have at least some of the recommendations implemented in time to benefit the new entrants to the Garda Síochána who will come from the next recruitment competition.</P>
    <P>I have not yet come to any decision in regard to publication of the training committee's report.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister know there is widespread concern about these reports and that there is a general view that they have been shelved?  The first report has been with the Minister since July 1985.  The second was requested as a matter of urgency in December 1985 so that early action could be taken on it and the final complete report issued in April 1986.  The widespread belief, as has been made clear in press statements issued by the Garda organisations, is that the Minister has no intention of pursuing the recommendations in these reports in the near future.  Can the Minister assure the House that these reports have not been shelved, as seems to be the case?  With which recommendations will he proceed without delay?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>As I pointed out on a number of occasions, the reports have not been shelved.  They are the subject of very close examination.  As I have already pointed out on previous occasions and again just a few moments ago, I hope some of the recommendations can be implemented in time to benefit new entrants to the Garda force from the next recruitment competition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that at present the Garda training programme in Templemore is being run down, that <Col N="2797" /> it is being reduced systematically?  The higher personnel management courses run in liaison with NIHE Limerick have been stopped.  If the Minister is not shelving this idea, why were these courses stopped?  Will the Minister come up with a dynamic new package urgently, because that is what is required?  The Garda want to get involved in the newer methods of training.  There are three reports lying on the shelves and the third report goes into all the details the Minister would require to implement these procedures.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware that Garda training is running down, because that is not the case.  Nothing that is happening in the area of Garda training should lead the Deputy to the conclusion that reports are being shelved because they are not. I can assure the Deputy that the Garda authorities and I are anxious to ensure that the training available to the force is adapted to the conditions in which they have to operate.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer the Deputy to my reply to Question No. 416 on 22 October.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The staffing and operational costs involved in operating the new unit would largely be similar to the cost of operating the existing facility for women prisoners at Mountjoy.  The precise regime for the new unit has not yet been finalised pending the unit's transfer to my Department and this may have some impact on the overall operating cost of the unit.  The cost of providing a wall and ancillary works to separate the unit from the main hospital buildings is estimated to be of the order of £325,000.  Some further minor internal works may be necessary to make the unit suitable for its envisaged use but <Col N="2798" /> these can only be finalised and costed when the unit is handed over to my Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the total cost of the unit?  The Minister told us the wall will cost £325,000.  This seems like maximum security for women offenders, 80 per cent of whom are non-violent according to studies which have been carried out.  Why is it necessary to provide maximum security conditions in the first instance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The cost of building the new unit was approximately £2.6 million and the cost of the wall and ancillary works would be in the region of £325,000. I want to make it clear to the Deputy and to the House that we are not talking about a maximum security unit.  I believe it would be highly desirable that we bring about a separation between this unit and the Central Mental Hospital for a number of reasons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Would one of the reasons be the security of the women offenders because this unit is in the grounds of the Central Mental Hospital?  Does the Minister intend to have female offenders in that unit who are not psychiatric patients?  The Minister nods, yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I am afraid the Deputy is more than a little confused.  Having started with the proposition that building a wall suggests that this is a maximum security unit he has now come round to the view that the wall might be required for the security of the female offenders. The wall between this unit and the Central Mental Hospital would be desirable precisely to bring about a situation where this unit could not be described as being in the grounds of the Central Mental Hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is playing on words.  Nobody can doubt that this unit is in the grounds of the Central Mental Hospital and the reason for building the wall is not to keep three female offenders in&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but to keep somebody else out.  May I draw the Minister's attention to the report of the Whitaker committee, another report which is gathering dust.  The Minister may say that this report is being considered but it is a long time since that report was published and yet nothing has happened.  I realise the Minister has been in that Department for only a short time, but that report clearly indicates that what we need for female offenders are more open prisons without very big walls costing £325,000 and for a very low cost the Minister could provide these facilities.  Does the Minister really believe this will work?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy knows perfectly well that the health board have not finally agreed to this.  To the extent that the Deputy or any of his colleagues have any influence in the matter, I would urge them to use it in favour of allowing this unit to be taken over by my Department. We are not talking about a maximum security unit here.  For a number of reasons &mdash; with which I think the Deputy will be familiar &mdash; it would be desirable to separate this unit from the Central Mental Hospital.  The House will also be aware from previous discussions on the matter that there is a need for a unit that would allow us to provide a better level of facility and treatment for female offenders who have particular medical problems.  That is the reason I am working on bringing this unit into operation in the prison service.  With regard to the suggestion by the Whitaker committee that it would be desirable to have an open unit for female offenders, the Deputy must be aware &mdash; and the House should take account of the fact &mdash; that we have a very small number of female offenders <Col N="2800" /> in our system.  I am happy to say that is the case.  However, that brings the attendant difficulty, that because of the very smallness of the number of female offenders it is difficult, except in the case about which we are speaking here, to provide totally separated facilities of the kind the Deputy seems to have in mind.</P>

      <P>As regards the first part of the question, I am not in a position to comment except in the context of the information available to the Garda Síochána but I would invite the Deputy's attention to the reply given by my colleague, the Minister for Health, to Question No. 35 on 12 November, in the course of which he said there is no indication that there is any significant problem here in relation to the abuse of cocaine and no evidence at all of &ldquo;crack&rdquo; being available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that &ldquo;crack&rdquo;&mdash; which apparently is derived from cocaine fairly simply &mdash; is highly addictive, has a high fatality rate and, most importantly, provides a very high profit rate which means that if people get into it they are anxious, for profit reasons, to continue to be involved?  Is he also aware that in New York it has caused a 100 per cent increase in crime in recent times?  For these reasons will the Minister make every effort to ensure we are spared this problem?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the factors <Col N="2801" /> the Deputy mentioned although I do not really think it is particularly helpful to the debate to say there has been a 100 per cent increase in crime in recent times without specifying it.  I take the Deputy's point &mdash; there has been an ominous development in New York in particular in this regard.  As I have said, there is no evidence to indicate that &ldquo;crack&rdquo; is available in this country.  The Deputy may be assured that both the Garda authorities and I will use every avenue open to us to ensure that we keep this evil outside our shores.</P>

      <P>The allocation of Garda personnel and other resources to specialised units such as the fraud squad and their training requirements are matters for the Garda authorities in the light of their assessment of needs.  The Garda authorities inform me that the strength of the fraud squad is at present under review and staffing adjustments will be considered when this review has been completed.

Many of these are small depositors, elderly people who have had money on deposit, so that while there might be only 600 in-depth investigations within that number any one may cover thousands of people.

      <P>The Department's Marine Survey Service <Col N="2803" /> have been carrying out an inspection of the vessel since this morning.  The full extent of any damage will be determined when an underwater inspection of the vessel has been completed.</P>
      <P>The operations group set up to deal with any incidents of oil pollution along our coasts under the aegis of the Minister for the Environment has been activated and is monitoring the situation at the scene.  Cork and Kerry County Councils are also on standby in the event of a major oil spillage occurring and threatening the shore.</P>
      <P>The Deputy can be assured that all relevant agencies have been alerted and that all feasible precautions that can be taken at this stage have been taken.</P>

      <P>Do I take it that there are adequate fire-fighting provisions in the bay to deal with any emergency because, to my knowledge, there is no fire-fighting tug nearer to Bantry Bay than Whitegate.  Should a serious explosion occur, as happened in the case of the <i>Betelgeuse</i>, what facilities have the local authority in that area to cope with such an emergency?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>The situation is that an officer of the Marine Survey Service is now on the vessel in Bantry Bay.  He is carrying out an inspection of the vessel to assess the risk of oil spillage and to ascertain what action, if any, should be taken by the Department regarding the vessel and its cargo.  In regard to the point about fire danger the Deputy has just raised, I should say that the Department's Marine Survey Service advised at mid-day today that there is no evidence of oil pollution or leakage from the vessel and that the full extent of any damage will be determined when the underwater inspection of the vessel has been completed. We were advised there was some evidence of an oil leak subsequently but this appears to have stopped.  However, just before coming into the House we had a call from the Department representative there.  The message was that there is no leak.  The further information <Col N="2804" /> is that the divers have arrived on the site and it will be possible to carry out the underwater survey today.  All necessary precautions are being considered and in the light of any finding by the investigators all necessary steps will be taken.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister to allay any fears of the possibility of a major explosion.  It is a well-known fact that it was a serious crack in the ballast tank of the <i>Betelgeuse</i> which caused the explosion and the dreadful fire which occurred a few years ago in that bay.  In view of the importance of the mariculture industry &mdash; the only industry we have in that bay &mdash; will the Minister give an assurance to the House that he will order the tanker out of the bay as quickly as possible and to a safe berthage from the point of view of fire precautions and so on?</P>

      <P>The request for the tanker to come into the bay was made because of the danger to life and the danger to the ship.  As I said, we have just had a report from the Marine Survey Service and there are people on board at present. The response by all agencies involved in this was immediate.  The Valentia lifeboat and a helicopter were requested at the time but they were not necessary. Perhaps under its own steam the tanker will be able to leave.  I assure the Deputy that all precautions will be taken and naturally so because of the dangers the Deputy pointed out and the difficulties that could arise.  I am very conscious of what could happen to Bantry Bay and of the sad experience there in previous times.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I stated that decisions that have been made in the past by CIE concerning the closure of railway lines have usually been based on the premise that to withdraw a service or to replace a train by a bus is usually to save money but that has not been the result.  I mentioned last evening the closure of the Sligo to Limerick Railway line in 1976.  It was claimed that about £250,000 would be saved but that did not happen.  It is a very good <Col N="2842" /> example of the kind of mistakes made by decisions taken to close down railways.</P>
      <P>On the western seaboard we now have developments like the Connaught Regional Airport and the attraction of tourism, and a study has been done on this by the Galway-Mayo RDO in my own area.  The Sligo-Leitrim RDO have done a similar survey.  Groups like Enterprise Connaught are talking about an integrated approach to the development in the western area, so it is important that the railway be an integral part of that project.  I hope the support that Enterprise Connaught have got from every county along the western seaboard will materialise in the Sligo-Limerick railway being maintained and restored, if possible through the Enterprise Connaught project being approved by the EC.  All that organisation are looking for at present is the approval of a study and it will not cost the Government one penny because there are funds available in the EC.  I hope the support that Enterprise Connaught have got will be continued by all the public representatives in the western region.</P>
      <P>I mentioned yesterday the claims that were made for maintaining that railway line in order to link the western region with the south-west and mid-west regions and for having the very major link between Sligo-Limerick and Rosslare. There are other reasons that a railway is important in the western region.  It would also link the Connaught Regional Airport with Cork, Shannon, Galway and Sligo airports.  It is also important to have a rail link with seaports.</P>
      <P>Nowdays there is the very important consideration of transporting dangerous substances.  They can be transported more safely by rail than by road.  The railway would also help to ensure that roads which are underdeveloped and over used would get some relief from heavy traffic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Galway-Mayo RDO group have pointed out the importance of communication with the Euro ports of Rosslare.  Waterford and Cork.  They have also pointed out that speed and time are involved in transporting goods safely <Col N="2843" /> and without pollution from heavy motorised road traffic, especially in built up areas.  There is also the question of pilgrimages to the Marian Shrine at Knock which is close to the Sligo-Limerick line so it is important to maintain the rail service there also.</P>
    <P>Other factors are job creation in the region and services such as warehousing, distribution, haulage, hotels, catering and tourism as well as the normal industrial and commercial expansion.  The study this group have done on the railway line is important and is very relevant in the context of the Bill we are discussing here.  What comes across very clearly in the study is the importance of the linkage between the bus service and the railway service.  I would stress the need to have the provincial bus service and the railway line under the one subsidiary.</P>
    <P>Much has been said about the role of private operators.  They have certainly been successful.  They have shown great imagination and have marketed their service in a very professional way, particularly that from Galway and the west generally to Dublin.  They have also provided a very good service for people who have to travel up to 50 miles to work in the Industrial Estate in Galway.  CIE have been very complacent in this area and have allowed a situation where the private operators have been successful. Late in the day, CIE decided to start that type of marketing themselves.  They showed a bit more imagination in their schedules and on the routes and have now managed to get some of that market but for a long time they were not wide awake enough to what was going on.  I am glad that they have now put on some services at attractive terms.  This is very important for people who must travel long distances to work.  It is a major area in public transport because of the cost of motoring in rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>School transport is under the Department of Education but is organised, in practical terms, by the local area manager. That should be kept under constant review by the Department.  The local area manager has a major role to play in the <Col N="2844" /> organisation of school transport, together with CEOs and the heads of schools.  We have a very fine manager in the local Galway office, Mr. Fitzgerald, but any time I or any public representative contacts him he nearly always has to refer us to the Department of Education.  We will not get quick practical solutions to problems until we give more autonomy to the local area manager.  Many of the buses also need to be replaced.  Perhaps some of the passenger buses could be used for school transport.  I hope the Minister will tell us when such change might be brought into operation.  I hope that the bus company in Shannon who built buses in the past will be allowed to continue to provide replacement buses.</P>
    <P>I came across a situation recently where the Department of Education, after a lot of representations, sanctioned a school bus service in my own constituency. CIE advertised in the local papers for a driver for the service but before they got a chance to decide on a driver, the Department of Education asked us to withdraw the advertisement as we only had nine pupils and not ten.  I think there were 11 pupils at the outset of that campaign to get the service but because a family moved away and because of a delay by the Department of Education in sanctioning the transport for the area the numbers fell to nine. Then the Department came alone and said, &ldquo;We are sorry, you have a child too few now and we cannot give the service.&rdquo; That is what I am referring to.  Because of the delay involved, the Department of Education in this instance delayed the sanctioning of the service and the service has been lost.  Could CIE not be allowed to put on that service even for nine pupils and continue to operate it?  In the months ahead we will probably have more than ten students who could use that service.</P>
    <P>I will conclude on the problem we have had with timetables and the trains stopping and not stopping along the Galway-Dublin line.  I want to give an example to the Minister of two stations, Attymon and Woodlawn, County Galway, which had been looking for a long time for a better service.  Because of decisions <Col N="2845" /> made, we found that the trains were not stopping at these stations at times suitable for people travelling to Dublin.  In fairness, let it be said that CIE have sorted out some of the problems with Woodlawn station but they still have to give a better service to the Attymon station as far as I and the people in the area are concerned.  I hope that will be done and that the Minister will discuss with CIE the possibility of giving that service.</P>
    <P>One of the problems we have with CIE is that we have local management and we have the management in Dublin.  We have access to the Minister but the Minister usually refers all matters to CIE and we get maybe only one official point of view from the CIE management.  Here I come back to devolution or giving more autonomy to local management.  It would be much more practical and democratic at local level if the local manager could deal with the kind of situations I am talking about.  As regards the service from the western area to Dublin, which I am sure the Minister knows about, I hope that will be improved.  We have very fine people working in CIE, but one of the problems we have had in the western region is the type of trains on the route out of Dublin to the west.  They are not of the same standard as the trains that go to the southern and northern regions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill before the House seeks to bring some improvements in the transport situation we have and it comes up with the proposal to have three subsidiary companies under the Companies Act.  I believe this measure will do nothing at all to improve the transport infrastructure or the level of transport service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problem is that CIE in their entirety have been neglected by successive Governments over the years who have failed to provide the necessary capital which this company have required to re-equip adequately and to provide the national services which they are required to do by statute.  That has been the major transport problem we have suffered from over the years.  The Minister now brings in this measure to set up the separate <Col N="2846" /> companies structures as subsidiaries. How is it going to change anything? Where is the improvement going to be from setting up separate companies in this way, a separate company for Dublin buses, a separate company for provincial buses and a separate company for the railways?  We will have three new boards set up with three new sets of directors. On what basis their appointments will come I do not know, but one can guess to some extent at any rate.  Why is it necessary?  What is the real object of the exercise?  For the life of me I fail to see what that can be.  There will be a cosmetic change in the set up, but here are CIE, an integrated transport company with responsibility for all the national transport right across the entire spectrum.</P>
    <P>I can appreciate there are diverse functions in CIE.  The running of Dublin buses is a separate entity.  Country buses are a separate entity.  No doubt there are divisions in CIE that can have organising committees of experts and leaders of the various sections on the maintenance of the buses, the running of the buses, the finances of the buses and so on.  Committees can be formed of the various groups of workers, as probably is the case, to run these divisions.  Of course there must be separate divisions in a large conglomerate like that, but what is the objective of formalising that into separate subsidiary companies?  The Minister said it would bring more flexibility. I wish somebody would explain to me how that is to be.  Where is the lack of flexibility in the present situation?  Is there something in the articles and memorandum of association or the statutory rules of CIE as at present which impede their flexibility?  Are there things they are not empowered to do?  Are some magical new powers to be given to these subsidiaries to do things and to have a flexibility that is not there at present?  I cannot see that.  I should think there is complete flexibility in CIE as they stand at present because they have powers to control and deal with all aspects of transport and all the infrastructural matters that need to be carried out for that purpose.</P>
    <P>It has been said that these subsidiaries <Col N="2847" /> will be a good thing because they are intended to compete with one another. The provincial buses will be competing with the railways.  I suppose in a broad general sense that competition is a healthy thing.  There is nothing wrong with competition, but is it not strange that you would have subsidiaries of the one company competing with one another? That is a new idea.  I have never heard of that previously.  Certainly the giant conglomerate commercial companies operate through subsidiaries but those subsidiaries are working in tandem, as part of an integrated system.  You will not have one subsidiary of one company competing with another subsidiary of the same company.  That does not make sense.</P>
    <P>The matter arises in a kind of bastardised way from the McKinsey report which advocated a complete hiving off.  I would condemn it outright, but at least one could understand the rationale behind it.  I do not approve of the idea of having completely hived off separate entities competing with one another in the context of national transport but one can understand it.  This mish-mash here falls between two stools and is not a recipe for progress in the field of our national transport organisation.</P>
    <P>We have to make a decision on transport. This is something on which we have never been able to completely satisfy ourselves. This Bill will not advance us in that area.  When we talk about transport and about running buses and trains to serve people, are we talking about running a business, like any other business, or are we providing a social service?  That is the dilemma we have to face and which we have never faced.  Transport services are not meant to be run as a business but as a social service to facilitate people who rely on them and to provide an efficient reliable service but most importantly, a cheap service.  Once we accept that premise we should stop this talk about the size of the subsidy to CIE.  If we run a cheap reliable service there will be all sorts of spin-offs.  More and more people will find <Col N="2848" /> that the idea of taking a car is no longer attractive if a reasonably cheap good service is provided.</P>
    <P>It has been said that there will be improvements in the transport system as a result of this measure.  The reverse is true.  The real effect of this measure has not been thoroughly worked out.  A detailed analysis has not been produced in any of the base reports that went into this Bill or in any of the speeches in connection with it.  It has been said that it is in the real interests of CIE but I have not seen a detailed analysis which can show me how it is in the interests of CIE. It is said that it will be a good thing for the staff of CIE but again that has not been set out in detail and there is no guarantee that it will protect the employment transfer from the existing institution or that it will create new employment.  It has been said that in broad terms the Bill will be in the interests of the public and that this will improve matters.  How will it improve matters?  Spell it out, quantify it in a proper accountancy analysis.  Where is the benefit for the public?  It will not benefit the public at all.  It will involve retrenchment in many of the services presently provided by CIE.  It may entail very substantial job losses in CIE.  It is said that it is a good thing because it may improve labour relations in CIE.  If that is one of the pluses behind it, we are getting off on the wrong foot.  The unions involved in CIE oppose the measure. They are dead against it because they were not adequately consulted.  They are, according to information furnished to me, quite prepared to discuss the restructuring of CIE, to discuss the divisionalisation of CIE so as to have divisions running the various functions. They are not adopting a stick-in-the-mud attitude to this question but they have not been consulted about this structure and they totally oppose it.  This kind of arrangement will have very adverse affects on our transportation system, it will reduce services and will not provide cheaper fares or a better level of service.</P>
    <P>One must remember that CIE are on a different basis from the private bus <Col N="2849" /> operators about which we have heard so much.  Private bus operators are an increasing factor which we must face.  Is that factor taken into account?  What are the proposals to deal with private bus operators?  Has any indication been given as to how that facet of transport policy will be dealt with?  How can any forecast or analysis be made of what the position will be for example with the new proposed provincial bus company or with the railways until one indicates clearly the Government attitude to private bus operators? On the Government attitude to that will depend the amount of business that will be done by the provincial buses and the railways.  To date a clear indication of policy has not been given as to what is intended in the context of private bus operators.  The present position is that private bus operators are springing up and operating all over the place.  It is not a lawful operation in which they are engaged and the legal institutions of the State seem to turn a blind eye to that fact.  The private bus operators refer to their situation euphemistically as taking advantage of a loophole in the law.  I do not know what loophole they are referring to but my understanding is that they are not licensed and that controls are not exercised over their operations.  There are no tests of their vehicles to ensure that they are safe or roadworthy and there are no regulations covering the number of driving hours a driver may undertake on these vehicles.  They have many advantages which operate to the detriment of public transport.  They are not obliged to and do not carry old age pensioners free.  They do not fulfil any of the social roles that CIE fulfil in many respects.  They are not obliged to and do not run their services to locations where it would be uneconomic to do so.  They select routes where they can have full vehicles.  They take the best routes and operate in these areas.  They do not have the responsibility as do CIE to provide a service on a full geographical spectrum. That problem is emphasised by CIE in their annual report of 1985 in which the Chairman of CIE made clear in a statement in that report that it was not possible <Col N="2850" /> for any operator to provide scheduled services on the geographical scale, as is required of CIE at times, suitable to the public with standards of comfort and safety required by law and, at the same time, to make an acceptable rate of return on capital invested at no cost to the State.  If we intend to run a transport company which will provide a service to the public, the idea of seeking return on capital investment is not on as that is not the object of the exercise.  We will compound the difficulties if we insist on doing that because the level of service will have to fall.  If fares were substantially reduced, as they should be, there would be increased usage and a greater throughput of finances.</P>
    <P>Improvements are needed in the transport system but CIE should be left as they are.  There is nothing wrong with the structure and if we want to have an national transport service, resources and capitalisation should be provided for the purpose.  The Minister should ensure that CIE's competitors compete on a fair basis and that they also play a social role if they are given franchise rights for running services.  To say that hiving off these divisions into separate limited companies will provide a magical result is not true. It is a cosmetic exercise which will not tackle our needs.  This can be done within the structure of CIE as they exist at present.  Committees can be set up by the key officials to run the various services needed.  Before the House is asked to adopt this measure, the Minister should give clear undertakings regarding the staff position as a result of the setting up of these companies, what the level of fares will be and the ultimate results for the public.  These things have never been thought through sufficiently by the two main parties in the State.  Many members of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael put themselves forward as great advocates of the role of private enterprise and so on but they have not prepared a generalised transport policy.</P>
    <P>I was rather amused to note from the report prepared by the Express Coach Operators' Association dealing with the private sector's input to public transport <Col N="2851" /> in which they analysed the position of the three main political parties on the question of transport.  They said that Fianna Fáil do not have a transport policy.  They said the same about Fine Gael and that the Labour Party oppose the breaking up of CIE and are totally opposed to private enterprise.  Coming from this organisation, I presume that is intended as a criticism but I am proud to accept it as that is a correct reflection of the Labour Party position.  I am sorry that the Progressive Democrats are not mentioned&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill affords an opportunity to address some of the fundamental issues in transport and specifically, the role of CIE in that context.  The Bill contains much ado about very little and misses the central and fundamental challenges in the transport area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Taylor is right in saying there has been very little work done on transport policy.  One of the things about the Bill which interested me, which the Minister proposes as a far-reaching measure, is that it appears to pre-empt the White Paper which we are told is on the way in regard to transport.  I am not sure whether that says more about the White Paper than about the Bill or <i>vice versa.</i> What is clearly at issue in transport policy terms is that there is an absolute need for some mechanism to co-ordinate the various facets and elements which go into transport policy.  To assess, analyse and <Col N="2852" /> propose a change in role and structure for CIE without that broader context makes for an artificial debate.</P>
    <P>How can we rationally propose major changes in the structure of CIE if we have not already made decisions about transport policy as a whole?  It may very well be that if we decide to have a co-ordinated transport policy &mdash; which most of us probably believe is essential &mdash; CIE's responsibilities in that respect might be fundamentally changed from those proposed or adverted to in this measure.  The Bill underlines the essential weakness of dealing with CIE without covering transport policy generally.  It is like dealing with part of the problem without making up one's mind about its scale or totality.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned CIE's social role.  I always felt it was very wrong of the House regularly to address the question of a commercial loss by CIE in the context of an organisation which was clearly intended to have predominantly a social responsibility.  In many respects it is wrong to say that CIE make a financial loss unless their job is to be a commercial company exclusively.  Any reading I have done on CIE does not indicate that.  The fundamental point I wish to make is that this internal management restructuring of CIE is peripheral to the essential problem of transport policy.  In a properly organised society it would not take up the time of the national parliament.</P>
    <P>We should be dealing with the role CIE should have in terms of transport policy. This relates to the obvious need to co-ordinate public transport, rail and bus, private transport, car, freight, road development, regulation of road developments, investment in transport and infrastructure, taxi and hackney services, all the elements which make up transport policy and which have to be addressed.  That to me is the question. Most of us would agree that at present it is not so much ships that pass in the night but that trains, buses and cars pass in the night and there is no co-ordination.  In many cases the people concerned do not even speak to each other.  It is as if they <Col N="2853" /> live in different worlds.  There is, therefore, an urgent need to have a national transportation policy and an authority which will co-ordinate, in an efficient and cost effective resourceful manner, all those elements into one efficient dynamic unit which will serve the needs of the people.  That is what we should be talking about but we are not, unfortunately, because this Bill misses the fundamental point.  The Minister may say that that is not what this Bill is about but we have been promised for a long time that kind of fundamental reform.</P>
    <P>To plan for CIE in isolation is artifical and to a large extent pointless.  I do not know how the Minister can seriously say that his role with regard to CIE is in three aspects.  First, that he has to get the subsidy right, that CIE must never again revert to the excesses of growth which characterised the seventies and that the correction process is well in hand but more has to be done: secondly, that the overall direction of the undertaking has to be got right and, thirdly, that service of the market has to be got right.  What a limited and blinkered vision of what potentially could be the vanguard of a totally revamped transport policy and an organisation who could head up that type of development.</P>
    <P>To give an example, lest anyone might think that one is theorising, on the lack of co-ordination we are speaking about, look at the present arrangements in relation to transport in Dublin city or in any other part of the country.  The local authorities have their road plans.  CIE run buses and they have their plans.  The Garda Síochána enforce traffic regulations. I have often felt that is a marginal duty for them, that it should not weigh them down at all but should be given to somebody else.  The Garda have their own independent existence.  The taxi services and the private bus services all operate independently.  Depending on what financing and planning CIE have they could affect, for example, the road plans but there is no co-ordination.  Let us assume that CIE decided to invest heavily in city rail services, would that mean that medium and long term road plans by local <Col N="2854" /> authorities would be redundant?  We do not know because nobody is bringing all these bits together.  That is the first fundamental criticism I have to make of this Bill.</P>
    <P>There is an urgent need to co-ordinate and regulate road and all forms of transport policy and this should be done under one corporate strategy, one clear policy developed in full consultation with all the interests involved and decided on by Government.  That has not happened so far.</P>
    <P>It is in that context that I want to make my second point.  I would hope that a revamped and dynamic CIE could spearhead that operation.  The general feeling in CIE about this Bill is one of fear.  There is anxiety about its implications.  Much of this has to do with the begrudging attitude which this House has expressed towards CIE and their employees.  I do not know how CIE and their employees feel every year when they read about how much money the company lost.  They have to provide essential services often in very difficult conditions and without appreciable public appreciation either among the populace generally or among their political leaders.</P>
    <P>A new lease of life and a new sense of morale could be given to the company if they were given the responsibility, having been revamped and reorganised to cope with it, of spearheading that co-ordinated transport policy.  I have no doubt that the workers in CIE would rise to such a challenge if they saw themselves as part of a plan and not as something which this House appears to tolerate and begrudge. The Minister says that the subsidy must never revert to the excesses of growth which characterised the seventies.  That is the kind of school master approach which the employees of CIE have had to accept for years.  Therefore, I do not wonder, having discussed this Bill, with the workers and unions, why they are afraid.  They do not trust this House as regards their future.  They feel unappreciated and that we are begrudging towards them.  A national transportation policy spearheaded perhaps by CIE may provide some answers.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2855" /> The third point I wish to make is that until such time as we have clearly assessed what CIE's social role is we will continue to have this artificial argument about commercial success <i>Versus</i> social policy.  I recall asking on one occassion in this House that unemployed people be allowed travel free in off peak hours on the buses so that they could travel to interviews and search for jobs.  That suggestion was rejected because of the fact there was no commercial advantage to CIE.  Some would say that the suggestion sounded like good social policy sense.  I do not see any such role of CIE defined either in the Bill or in the Minister's speech, though he refers to it in his speech.  What kind of decision making process went into cutting off train services to rural parts of this country?  That decision was made in a commercial context, because those services cost too much.  What cost too much?  Did it cost too much to provide that service or did it cost too much to continue to meet the social obligations we have towards the people of those areas?  There is no basic philosophy within which those decisions are being made.  I do not know how anyone can operate in that vacuum.  I would see the social policy of CIE as being extremely important.</P>
    <P>I would like to say also that in the context of a national transport policy, with the social basic philosophy of CIE having been defined, I see a major potential role for public participation and ownership.  I simply fail to understand how people have this incredible view that because some group of people, perhaps pensioners with their savings or ordinary workers who might have managed to put aside a few pounds, who might want to buy into CIE or to help the company by investing in them reaping a reward in due course, financially and otherwise, are regarded somehow as enemies and ideological outcasts.  What kind of nonsense is that?</P>
    <P>There are those who might ask the fundamental question, what exactly the State is doing running trains and buses anyway.  The reason is, as Deputy Taylor <Col N="2856" /> pointed out, that there are many areas which need these services but would not have them unless they were provided by a socially conscious national transportation body such as CIE.  Unquestionably there is a role for involving public investment, people with entrepreneurial investment potential, people who simply want to be part of a State company and people who want to invest in the future of the country. Why should they be excluded on some type of incredible ideological grounds when the joke is that the alternative is precisely the same basic investment except that it has to come through the channel of the Exchequer.  That is taxpayers' money with the expense and the cloak of bureaucracy tagged on.  I cannot understand that mind-set.  People who may make such suggestions are seen as fringe people interested in taking over the State or hostile to its interests but that is nonsensical.</P>
    <P>My philosophy, and the philosophy of my party, is that the State is the guarantor of last resource, not the guarantor that rushes in immediately to strap things down, to tie things up and lock things in invariably and inevitably at major expense.  The truth is that the State should justify its involvement in the transport area in the same way that it should justify its involvement in any other area of commercial, human or social activity before it gets involved.  There is a role for the State in transport policy but that is not the same as saying that there is not a role for anybody else.  Why should those who are presently operating legally and properly run privately owned buses not have a role to play in a transport policy? It might be possible to save public funds if we involved all the transport resources in the State in such a grand plan.  Would that not mean that there would not have to be the same level of investment in comparable but competing services under the aegis of CIE?  What else would it mean provided there was a proper marriage of the various interests?</P>
    <P>I reject out of hand the philosophy that says there is no room for ordinary people in the way the State runs things.  Once those pieces have been put into place, a <Col N="2857" /> national transport policy and authority with a clear social philosophy outlined for CIE to head up such an initiative, the next step should be discussions about management structures and systems. That is the logical order and that is when one gets down to restructuring CIE.  In principle I cannot see anything objectionable about CIE being so internally organised as to be able to efficiently and properly manage itself towards the achievement of stated objectives.</P>
    <P>I do not take the Minister's point in his speech when he said that he had considered various options of whether these proposals could have been introduced without legislation.  The Minister said:</P>
    <P>Another option considered was the re-organisation of CIE's responsibilities as an internal CIE matter without new legislation.  It was rejected also because such a response was not considered sufficiently far reaching to give the results desired.</P>
    <P>The Minister has access to data that I do not have but I am not convinced of his argument.  The proposal before us is essentially a management re-organisation model.  The fact that it has limited companies set up by law is interesting but secondary.  Essentially this is a question of how CIE organise themselves.  It could be that there should be a number of small companies, not three, and I do not think it is an issue of major importance in that context or in the context of what I have outlined as my party's approach to this area.</P>
    <P>I do not think we should spend too long arguing over the internal management model of CIE.  Transportation policy throughout the world has been delivered to the people of different countries along certain clear lines.  There are certain management models and systems that can be put in place.  They are not myriad in number but they are available to us.  It is perfectly reasonable to refine, update and develop management models in order to deliver the service one wishes to provide. I have to admit to an unease about what I am sure was not intended but what comes across to me as a slightly gleeful <Col N="2858" /> suggestion by the Minister that there would be within this new structure a type of internal competition between various parts of the national transport service. The Minister stated:</P>
    <P>There are also I believe arguments based on what is seen as a threat within CIE &mdash; the threat of competition between rail and road services.  This seems to mean that there must be no competition, irrespective of cost to the taxpayer or service to the public, as between CIE's rail and provincial road services.  I utterly regret that approach. There must be some competition to ensure that each new operational company will be kept on its toes... The board will guard against reckless or ruinous competition between the subsidiaries.</P>
    <P>That does not ring true.  I do not know how on the one hand we can have a co-ordinated national transport body in separate management units but yet welcome and, perhaps, even provoke or encourage, competition between them. That competition will, inevitably, lose sight of the total objective which is the provision of an efficient transport service to the people in terms of the short-term interests of the individual units.  There will be overlapping, duplication and waste and, therefore, waste of taxpayers' money in that process.  I do not see the point of that type of attitude to the proposed subsidiaries.</P>
    <P>One has to address the question of staff morale.  The Minister felt the Bill will deal with that but I cannot see how it will. The discussions I have had with people in CIE indicate that that is not the case.  The Minister admits the need to improve staff morale but he said that the route chosen by the Government for delivering the objectives &mdash; he has had a number of main objectives &mdash; is to keep the deficit under control without major disruption to services or employment and, secondly, to improve morale and the working environment generally in CIE.  The Minister is aware that there is great resistance to the proposal to set up three companies as opposed to two and the reasons are <Col N="2859" /> not irrational.  One union says that the possibility of unrestricted competition with the railway by the provincial bus services is causing great concern.  The degree of competition could yield strange results.  The unions made the point that earlier transport legislation had as its main aim the integration of our national transport resources where practicable and where, for example, there would be shared common facilities such as stations, depots, offices and so on.  Has that attitude changed?  Are we going to have separate entities, people setting up their own empires, their own independent republics, and in the interests of competition, playing ducks and drakes with the public?  I do not know if that is a legitimate fear.  It is one that has to be addressed.</P>
    <P>The question of staff morale is not dealt with by restructuring.  It is dealt with by clarifying the national aims and objectives of the company, by putting in place the systems which allow them to be achieved and by doing that in the context of a dynamic transportation plan which is clearly right for the people, in which CIE have a major role and CIE's workers have their own individual roles in that respect.  They are afraid of this Bill, perhaps unnecessarily, but what is important is their perception that this Bill is not so much about giving them a sense of renewed purpose, but threatening them and their livelihoods.</P>
    <P>The Bill is peripheral to the extent that it deals with CIE in isolation, outside the context of the broader transport issue.  I do not know if it pre-empts the White Paper which obviously should be the basis on which legislation should be founded. If it does, its timing does not seem very logical.  I shall come back again to the need for some Government to address the question of the social role of CIE, the absolute need to co-ordinate policy and the various elements that go into transportation and, in that context, to fully utilise every available private and public transport resource.  All of these have a legitimate claim to be part of a national <Col N="2860" /> transport policy and to be treated with respect, not in some cases as some kind of ideological leper.  All offer an opportunity, if we have the wisdom to grasp the potential, to bring them together into some sort of co-ordinated focus.</P>
    <P>The Minister talks about the board of the company vetting the plans of the company, monitoring their performance, assessing their competing demands for investments and funds.  I wonder whether they will fall between two stools, between the internal management reorganisation that is desirable and important in any evolving company and particularly one this size, or whether they will be three totally separate entities.  If that is the case, how will any board be able to keep them in harness; if there are ensuing conflicts, will the board have a job in deciding certain priorities and allocations?  The Minister also said that more generally the board will be expected to foster the development of a more commercial approach across the spectrum of the activities within the overall CIE remit.  I do not think anybody could disagree with that provided it is taken in the context of CIE being an organisation with a fundamental social obligation.  I should like that spelled out more clearly than has been done to date.  There is one reference in the Minister's speech which does not define it.</P>
    <P>I also believe the Minister is fundamentally wrong when he says that the smaller units should be susceptible to more effective management in a manner which is not possible in the case of very large and diffuse organisations and should contribute greatly to industrial relations.  CIE might be somewhat large by Irish terms but they are extremely small in terms of national transporation models, or even regional transportation models, all over the world.  It is diffuse, but that is not the fault of CIE.  It is because this House has never defined the job of CIE and because, by and large, we would prefer that it would go away.  The perception of CIE on the part of the House is largely that of an organisation continually with their hand out.  Size does not have any necessary direct bearing on <Col N="2861" /> an organisation being diffuse or having nebulous objectives.  That is a matter of definition, of clarity, of transparency &mdash; not a matter of size.</P>
    <P>I would appreciate it very much if the Minister, when summing up, would talk briefly about the White Paper on Transportation Policy.  There are many features of transport policy in this country which are unique and unusual; of course, in Ireland we claim to be pretty unusual in most respects.  If we look at the international comparison of road networks published in Irish Road Statistics by the Confederation of Irish Industry in 1985, we see that the length of road per 1,000 road vehicles is well over twice as long as that of other countries.  Somebody one time explained that to me in terms of the famine, or the public works schemes of that time &mdash; that roads were built all over the place.  The fact is, they are there.</P>
    <P>There are transport needs crying out to be dealt with and I should like to see CIE being fundamentally involved in that.  I should like to see CIE workers taking pride in their work again, buses not polluting the city streets as they do at present and staff happy in their tasks, being paid properly, being part of an organisation with a clear role, a clear dynamic, a clear sense of purpose and being in co-ordination with all other areas of the transport network and perhaps, in CIE's case, heading that initiative. However, we are not going to see that from this Bill.  Perhaps the Minister may say that other legislation will deal with that in due course.  I do not believe there will be any more transport legislation in the lifetime of this Dáil.  This is the only chance we have to discuss this issue.  In principle, the fears of the employees should be addressed, particularly their reasonable anxiety about competition between provincial bus and rail services. There they feel, with some rationale behind it, that there would be not just competition, which is not what they fear &mdash; they are not objecting to competition between Dublin city bus and rail &mdash; but that the test will be unequal and inevitably one will wither and possibly die. That would not be to the advantage either <Col N="2862" /> of the public or, in this case, the employees about whom they are quite right primarily concerned.  That is a fear and it should be addressed.</P>
    <P>I look forward in due course to the Minister perhaps taking up some of these points.  In particular I want him to address my fundamental question, which is, how can one deal rationally and logically with a national transportation service and plan for its future when there is no transport policy, when there is not even a White Paper published at present in that respect?  What will CIE's role be then, or is it possible that it might conceivably be changed again in the near future pursuant to the publication of a White Paper?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  It shows the courage of the Minister in tackling the age-old problem of making our national transport company, known as CIE, viable.  Since CIE were founded on 1 January 1945 to take over from the provincial companies known as the Great Southern and Great Northern Railways and the Dublin United Tramways Company, we have not seen any great saving to the Exchequer.  Rather have we seen an escalation of financial injections each year to keep this giant dinosaur of a company in existance.  If there is to be a future for a viable transport company here, it must come from the policy as outlined by the Minister.</P>
      <P>The formation of the three new operating subsidiary companies, with CIE as the parent body, can and will initiate a new dynamic approach to the transport problems of the State.  As outlined, the companies will cater for the railway system, the Dublin city bus services and the provincial bus services.  The problems appertaining to the provincial bus services are as different as chalk and cheese to the problems appertaining to the Dublin city bus services and very different from the railway problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must ensure that our transport companies are geared towards meeting the demands of the general public.  I refer to the service provided in the Kilcrohane Peninsula in west Cork.  The one day per week service proved very popular when <Col N="2863" /> it was operated on Friday but for some unknown reason it was changed to Saturday and then lost its appeal to the general public.  It is easy to understand the reason.  There are no banks, administrative offices or legal offices open to the public on Saturday.  Surely the people of rural Ireland, and particularly the people of the Kilcrohane Peninsula, deserve better recognition by CIE.  The people who live in that peninsula have been contributing their share of taxation to give a State subvention to that company for the past 42 years.  I hope there will be a rapid change in procedures when the new provincial bus company is formed and that the views and wishes of the general public will be adhered to as far as possible.  It is an old-fashioned fact that the customer is always right.</P>
    <P>The Minister must also be congratulated on introducing legislation to transfer the Great Southern Hotels to CERT in 1984 and also on the transfer of the canals earlier this year to the Office of Public Works.  This was a step in the right direction and I look forward to both enterprises progressing.</P>
    <P>Although the DART service is among the most advanced of its kind in the world, I have still to be convinced that it warranted the colossal expenditure of £113 million, while many of our provincial buses are bone-shaker vehicles which are in urgent need of replacement. Some CIE school buses are so worn out that very often school children in my constituency have to walk to school because these obsolete buses have broken down.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's statement that 800 new buses have been purchased since 1980 at a cost of about £100 million. Also 52 new tour coaches have been acquired by the board for this year's tourist season and the CIE cross-Channel super bus service.  I am amazed that in the so-called booming seventies the replacement of buses was not a priority. It was left to our Coalition Government to carry out this task under severe financial constraints.  I am even more amazed that there is not one member of the <Col N="2864" /> Opposition front bench listening to common sense and facts appertaining to this very important service.</P>

      <P>I should like to ask Opposition Deputies who are so critical of our Minister's decisions why they did not display the same concern during the 12 years from 1970 to 1982 when the CIE deficit increased from £3.234 million to £109.373 million.  It multiplied by a factor of 33.8 per cent &mdash; over six times more than inflation in that period.  No wonder our Minister on assuming office in December 1982 set to work immediately on tackling the financial problems confronting the company.  Simultaneously he began to look at the possibility of re-organising CIE in the context of the McKinsey recommendations.</P>
      <P>I admired the decision by the Minister and the Government in June 1983 to reduce CIE's cost to the Exchequer over a five-year period, paving the way for a new operating environment.  The targets set by the Minister for CIE in 1983, 1984 and 1985 have not only been met but exceeded, with a surplus this year of almost £7 million.  This is a vindication of our Minister's and our Government's courage in tackling the problem of 40 years of mismanagement.  The 1985 results reflect the hard work put into CIE during the past three years and they are again on target for 1986.</P>
      <P>Of the normal Exchequer subvention of £104 million for 1986, the railways receive £75.6 million, DART receives £7 million, Dublin bus services £16.8 million, provincial city bus services £2.1 million and other provincial bus services in rural areas £0.3 million.  The canals are to receive £1.4 million and the Galway-Aran ferry receives £0.8 million, almost three times as much as the provincial bus services in rural areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must congratulate the drivers of our rural buses.  Many of them operate a service which covers over 200 miles per day. I congratulate them on their efficiency, <Col N="2865" /> dedication and courtesy which they display on those arduous routes.  It is something of which we can be very proud.</P>
    <P>I am amazed that the Dublin bus services needed £16.8 million last year and the provincial city services needed £2.1 million.  Should the company not explore the possibility of introducing a two week off-peak travel card for Dublin and provincial city services?  This system has been operated in Great Britain with very good financial results.  This off-peak travel card could be used from 9.30 a.m. to 3.30 p.m. and from 6 p.m. to 11 p.m.  It could be offered at a very attractive rate, say, £3.50 per two weeks.  This would be of immense benefit in generating a huge amount of interest in these services.</P>
    <P>CIE was established on 1 January 1945, resulting from the dissolution of the Great Southern Railways Company and the Dublin United Tramways Company Limited.  The undertakings of the dissolved companies were transferred to Córas Iompair Éireann.  What did CIE give to our constituency in those early days?  What did the late Fianna Fáil Minister do for my county?</P>

      <P>In 1985 CIE received £20.6 million from the Department of Education for school bus services.  I wonder if it would be to CIE's advantage if this service was provided by private contractors so far as possible.  A lot of red tape and restrictions as regards the suitability of roads for rural school buses seem to have come into line.  I am amazed that objections have been made by CIE to operating their school buses on rural roads in my constituency, roads that should be suitable for vehicular traffic but which for some unknown reason the <Col N="2868" /> transport manager of that company has turned down.  The Minister should consider transferring the school bus services to private contractors.  I wonder if CIE would be just as well off without this £20.7 million which the Department are providing for the school bus services? If this subvention were given to private contractors, we might get a better service, especially in rural Ireland.</P>
      <P>It is also very informative to note that in 1985 CIE got £1.9 million from the Department of Defence and £23.8 million from the Department of Social Welfare to provide travel for invalidity pensioners, recipients of the disabled person's maintenance allowance, blind adults and persons aged 66 years and over.  My friends across the floor may be critical and say we are not doing enough, but we still contributed £23.8 million as a subsidy for free travel for the unfortunate sections of our community.</P>

      <P>The setting up of the companies will introduce greater flexibility into the CIE organisation, with each having their own board of directors whose objectives will be influenced by the more limited mandates of the individual companies and with managements closer to staff and operations.  I agree with those sentiments.  It is only fit and proper that staff should have a certain input into the operation of the company.  This is a step in the right direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will be the responsibility of the board to agree their annual budgets, including capital investment with the board of directors of the subsidiary companies, to <Col N="2869" /> ensure the subsidiaries achieve any financial targets set for them and to provide an assessment of the performance of the operating companies in the board's annual report to the Minister.  I warn the Minister that I do not want to see an erosion or curtailment of provincial bus services because they are part and parcel of rural life.  The people living in rural areas who are provided with only one service a day, or even service one day a week, should be given a guarantee by the Minister, the Government and by CIE that that service will be maintained.</P>
    <P>The Minister proposes to limit the membership of each new board to six members and to include two of the four members elected to the board of CIE by the CIE work force as directors in each of the three subsidiaries.  This is a step in the right direction.  I have no doubt that it will bring sanity to those boardrooms when discussions of the services to be provided are taking place.  The value of worker directors on State boards is now clearly established.  In order to avoid a situation that would cut across the electoral arrangements in CIE, the provisions of section 14 ensure that the new structures maintain intact the CIE procedure of electing worker directors to the board. The Minister said also:</P>
    <P>The escalation of CIE's losses between 1969 and 1982 was all the more disastrous when it is considered that overall employment in the Board fell by nearly 4,000 in that period.  I am glad to be able to tell the House that I have been assured by the Chairman of CIE that any further reductions will be achieved through natural wastage or, where necessary, by using the existing arrangements agreed with CIE trade unions concerning redundancies.</P>
    <P>The Minister would need to keep a watchful eye lest the proposed companies become top-heavy with executives.  We do not want a conglomeration of companies with a host of directors and assistant directors.  What we want is an effective company dealing with the three main sectors of national transport, the railways, provincial bus services and the <Col N="2870" /> city bus services.  The board and management will be dependent on the support of all the CIE employees in order to effect a smooth transition.  I have no doubt the Minister will ensure to the best of his ability that that will be done. CIE and their employees have shown what it was possible to achieve financially in the company in recent years which should inspire confidence in their future plans.  In this respect it is relevant to note that in 1985 CIE had one of their best years.  Public confidence in the general transport services must be increased. This can be achieved by improving their quality and, especially, their reliability.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that why they are being broken up?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps it is better to break them up into small companies than to do away with a transport service in a constituency such as south west Cork which the party opposite did over 30 years ago.  At least our Minister is endeavouring to maintain the <i>status quo</i> and, if possible, improve it.</P>
      <P>There is an old cliché to the effect that CIE stands for Coming In Empty which we will have to discard.  We must ensure that the public use the transport services provided throughout the country, that the charges are competitive and that the company provide a service to rural communities as well as to the citizens of the capital.  I am amazed there is need for such a large subvention to keep the bus services in Dublin going and yet so little to keep them going in rural areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are also arguments based on what is seen to be the threat of competition between the rail and road services. There is no fear of our having that competition in our constituency because we have not got a rail service.  This seems to imply there must be no competition irrespective of cost to the taxpayer or of quality of service to the public.  It must be realised that the taxpayer can contribute so much only by way of taxation. Let nobody fool themselves.  No State-sponsored body can continue to spend recklessly at length &mdash; as happened from <Col N="2871" /> 1977 to 1982 until our Government rectified the position, rendering it a paying proposition.  Facts speak louder than words&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am pleased the Minister utterly rejects that approach to competition. There must be some competition to ensure that each new operational company will be kept on its toes, that each worker in each company will identify with the public.  To my mind, competition constitutes the best formula for success; without it one will not be successful.  Without competition there will not be a virile, sound, transport system in this country.</P>

The Minister must be congratulated on having achieved the wonderful result he has achieved in the past two years in the company.  He has shown by his actions that the company can be made viable.  He has shown that he has the courage and tenacity to tackle the problems confronting the company.  Given a chance I have no doubt that the proposed three new companies will operate to the satisfaction of the general public.  I believe the correct way of handling the problem is by breaking down such large companies into smaller, sectional ones.  For 35 years under the one umbrella CIE continued to drift more and more into debt, asking for more and more of the taxpayers' money in order to keep going.  With the <Col N="2872" /> formation of the proposed three new companies I have no doubt that parochial problems in each area will be better aired in their boardrooms than was the case in the boardroom of one mammoth company such as CIE.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other Deputies I, too, question the establishment of three companies rather than two, there being a strong argument in favour of only two in this reorganisation.  It may seem strange that a Deputy representing a constituency without a yard of railway line should contribute to this debate.  Indeed it can be said that the bus service is of a very marginal nature.  Without even being able to listen to the tune, we have had to pay the piper down the years by way of the heavy subsidy provided for the operations of CIE.  Bearing in mind the present high cost of maintaining transport, because of the high level of taxation, the increasing, ever crippling cost of insurance and the high price of fuel, very many people will have to review their position regarding transportation to and from their places of employment.  It behoves those who provide public transport, whether it be a State company or the various private concerns, to make the most of their opportunities.  People certainly have decisions to make.  On a continuing basis we meet people who are unable to keep a car on the road.  Some of them have to travel increasingly long distances to their jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For many years it seemed, at least to the man in the street, that CIE were not making a sufficient effort to meet the needs of the public.  CIE and various private companies providing public transport should be waging an aggressive compaign to attract more people to public transport.  I fail to see why, if a satisfactory and reasonably priced service is provided, more people cannot be attracted to public transport.  Previous speakers mentioned competition.  Competition is essential and the stronger the competition the better for everybody, whether companies or individuals.  With more people using public transport CIE and the various public transport concerns <Col N="2873" /> would all benefit by better financial returns and they could give a better service if more use was made of them.  In addition, it would help to ease traffic problems on our roads and it would result in less need for subvention.  It is time that there was less need for subvention from the public purse.</P>
    <P>It should be kept in mind that a good public transport system is essential to our tourist industry.  We must realise that visitors from abroad are in the main used to good and dependable public transport services.  They will rate our facilities very poorly if the transport system is not efficient and dependable.  While it would appear that CIE have made a major effort to be more effective and to provide a better service it still has a long way to go.  A continued effort must be made at the level of management and of workers. For many years management have failed to show the proper drive in seeking business. They spend much of their time demanding more protection from private enterprise instead of facing up to the opposition in the transport field.  This failure lies at the root of many of the problems which CIE have encountered over the past ten to 15 years.  I would like to be able to say that the workers cooperated fully in CIE's efforts to improve their service and efficiency.  Unfortunately, evidence shows that the right spirit did not exist.  In many cases the workers in CIE seem to have a recentment for the private sector in the transport field.  This country cannot afford this conflict.  We welcome competition but we do not welcome conflict between semi-State staff and private concerns.  Both sectors in the transport field should be complementary and not in conflict. Restrictive practices should be eliminated if we are to get the best value for the money that is being spent.  A substantial amount of money has been spent over the last number of years.</P>
    <P>It is true that CIE are saddled with many routes which will always be uneconomic. they are required to maintain those services.  The Minister proposed to break down the present structure of CIE <Col N="2874" /> and to form three companies but the logical approach would have been to form two companies, but only time will tell.  I am always doubtful about any proposal that suggests that a miracle turnabout can be made by merely changing the structure at the top.  Too often over the last number of years in all sectors in the semi-State and private sector many concerns were unable to exist.  It is said that by changing the management structure, by some magical wand everything will be changed. I doubt that, but again time will tell. Much more is necessary than just restructuring. If the three separate companies are to succeed in the tasks that have been set for them the following conditions must be met.  A much more forceful marketing of the company's services should be carried out by providing the kind of service for our needs and by providing that service at a competitive price.  Secondly, there should be substantially better industrial relations from both a management and worker aspect.  One could not dwell long enough on this.  It is one of the sad aspects at present, whether it be in transport or industry, that there is far more discontent between workers in reasonably secure jobs while many workers in the public service are working for substantially reduced wages compared to three years ago and they are content and satisfied to have a job. Thirdly, a constant review of services is needed so as to meet anticipated needs, coupled with a flexible approach by management and staff.</P>
    <P>For many years CIE have lost out with the wide range of private bus operators, not just on price but also on flexibility. For many years the case has been made by CIE that the private bus operators operated at substandard and with very poorly maintained vehicles.  If one was to view the fleet of private buses in a street fairly close to this House or in the square of any town on a Friday night they would see that the bus fleet is very well maintained. I am satisfied that CIE's failure to be flexible in providing this kind of service in addition to their charges have resulted in an expansion of this private fleet.  We should pay tribute to the super <Col N="2875" /> bus service which apart from the revenue it earns for CIE is an excellent advertisement for the country.  By going abroad and showing the flag abroad it would encourage visitors and would have an effect in other countries.</P>
    <P>When looking at the breakdown of State subvention for CIE one cannot but be shocked by the substantial amount provided to support railways, other than the DART service in Dublin.  The first reaction one would have is that they cannot afford to continue supporting the railways to that degree.  While one can close down a bus route one year and on reflection restore it the following year, closing down a railway line tends to be a final and irreversible action.  Up to the fifties in County Monaghan we had one of the best county rail services.  There was the Dundalk-Derry line and the Belfast-Cavan line.  The two lines formed a junction in Clones, very close to where I was reared.  While we have been critical on many occasions about the withdrawal of the services, the economic conditions would probably have forced the closure of those lines at any time.  I was involved in a firm in the early fifties when most companies, co-operatives and merchants were dissatisfied with having to go to railway stations to collect their goods, especially the increased tonnages of fertilisers and heavy goods of that type. Most of them went because transport costs were reasonably low and vehicles were reasonably priced, without the same rake-off in excise duties.  In addition, CIE did not make the effort to modernise and meet that challenge.  That is when fertilisers and feedstuffs and so on were first &ldquo;palletised&rdquo; and CIE did not shift themselves enough to get involved in this and in the container service.  If CIE had made the effort to meet the demand there would not have been the same number of trucks being bought for which replacement parts are now very expensive.  CIE failed to take up the slack with the result that private operators took over the transportation of goods.</P>
    <P>We must maintain a railway network. With modern management and a flexible <Col N="2876" /> approach by workers the railways could give a greater return than they do at present.  In order to avoid competition between the rail company and the national bus company, the Minister proposes that the majority of the directors of the two companies should be common to both companies.  On balance I think that is a bad solution.  It cancels out the prime advantage of having separate companies and I ask him to reconsider his proposals.  We need a strong element of competition.  The Minister said when introducing the Bill:</P>
    <P>Fears were expressed in Seanad Éireann about the risks which had been associated with competition between the rail company and the national bus company.  In response, I agreed to introduce an amendment providing, in subsection (4) of section 11, for a majority of the directors of these two companies to be common to both companies. This should ensure that the boards of the companies will take full account of the interests of the individual companies in exercising their functions.  I see these boards as executive in nature in the interest of efficiency and effectiveness...</P>
    <P>I cannot agree with the Minister on that. I believe we would have been generating and creating in that area the element of competition which is so essential.</P>
    <P>The Minister also said some other distressing things.  He said:</P>
    <P>The escalation of CIE's losses between 1969 and 1982 was all the more disastrous when it is considered that overall employment in the Board fell by nearly 4,000 in that period.</P>
    <P>That is an indication of the overmanning that must have existed in that area when employment could be reduced at that extent.  It happened at a time when the consumer price index was at 5.4 per cent and the deficit was increased by over £100 million or 33.8 per cent.  It is an indictment of the company that that should have been allowed to happen.  With the amount of goods being transported in the fifties, sixties and into the early seventies, <Col N="2877" /> I will never understand why there was not a more aggressive effort made to secure part of that market.  They slipped up by not becoming involved in the trend of &ldquo;palletisation&rdquo; and container services.</P>
    <P>Many speakers have referred to the social service aspect of CIE.  In many areas the travel pass is worth nothing because there is no service to avail of. Many of the people who hold such passes live in outlying districts and have to travel long distances to towns on a weekly basis to draw their pensions: In any restructure of the service every area of the country should have a service even on alternative weeks because it is very unfair that people are unable to use their passes.</P>
    <P>There is a problem with management and worker relations, and management must be called into question.  The management of CIE is similar to the management in many semi-State bodies.  The structure is too heavy.  Empire building has been going on.  The company concentrated on management structures which the country could not afford and now very serious cutbacks have to be implemented.  The Minister should reexamine company structure.  In all probability, my party will be submitting amendments at a later stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanByrne" hpid="Mr. S. Byrne Mr. S. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The operation of the national bus service in rural Ireland over the past number of years is a national scandal.  Buses are being driven around rural Ireland empty and in many cases they only stop evey ten or 15 miles.  Management should remember that rural Ireland is different from Dublin in that if one misses one bus one cannot get another.  It is crazy to have ploughed so much taxpayers' money into CIE for this kind of service, which allows empty buses to be driven around rural Ireland.  I call them &ldquo;Wanderly wagons&rdquo; but they are very expensive ones.  At least &ldquo;Wanderly Wagon&rdquo; on RTE gives pleasure to children but the taxpayers get little pleasure from seeing their money spent in such a crazy fashion.  Charles Bianconi, who set up his system many years ago, provided a fairer service to the people with no burden on the taxpayer at the time and I <Col N="2878" /> think his service arrived on time more often than the CIE trains and buses do. I have used the train frequently over the years since I came into this House and I am not a bit impressed by the manner in which the service is operated.  A better service to the public should be provided and the taxpayer should be given some reason to believe that the money poured into the service is spent well.</P>
      <P>I appeal to the Minister to look at the fares being charged on the bus and train services.  Passenger fares on ships going to the UK have been reduced recently and I read in some newspaper that the Minister said that business on those ships had built up rapidly in the last few weeks.  We are all delighted to hear that.  It is sad to say that we have buses driving all over rural Ireland and old age pensioners and other people with so-called free transport find that it is of very little use to them if the bus passes them by.  They cannot even go out to collect their old age pension on the so-called free pass that they have.  Buses travel from Cork to Dublin every day and five days out of the seven there is scarcely a person on them because they do not stop to pick up any passengers.  I am not blaming the present Minister.  This system has been in operation for many years.  Buses whizzing past small towns and villages do not stop between A and B and there could be 15 miles between them while people are trying to get into or back from the local town and cannot do so.  The system should be changed to accommodate the people and to allow paying passengers as well as people with free travel passes to use them.</P>
      <P>About £112 million was poured into CIE in 1985.  I am not suggesting that all is bad in CIE or that all the people who operate the company are bad.  There are some excellent people in CIE from the top down, but the system is a little crazy, to say the least.  It should be more flexible. Area managers should have more authority to adjust the service to meet the needs of their areas rather than having a kind of blanket policy.</P>

It cuts across the heart of Ireland and provides a good, very important service for tourism and agriculture, our two most important industries.  I hope that when we move out of this terrible recession and unemployment our tourist trade and agriculture will improve.  That railways line is very important.  Alarm bells were set ringing in the last few years to suggest that that line would be closed down.  That would be a terrible mistake.  When we drive from here to Cork, Donegal or any place else and see the state of our roads with potholes, bad bends and so on, we realise that we should do everything possible to keep as much traffic as possible off them and perhaps avoid a number of fatal accidents on them.  At times it is a nightmare to drive from here to Tipperary. Parts of the road are not as good as one would find on the county roads. You need to watch where you are going and the rate at which you are driving. CIE should provide a better passenger service with reduced fares and a better freight service.  Some business people told me recently that it was crazy to send anything by CIE because the cost of doing so is outrageous, particularly for small parcels and boxes.  Most of that business is going to private enterprise because CIE are not competitive.</P>
    <P>The condition of our passenger trains leaves much to be desired, and I speak from experience of using the trains over the years.  The lack of cleanliness at times &mdash; not always &mdash; is embarrassing particularly if there are tourists on the trains. At times the trains are filthy, and a greater effort could be made to clean them.</P>
    <P>On Thursday and Friday evenings the trains going to Cork from Dublin are packed to the doors with women and children in particular many of whom have to stand as far as Limerick Junction at least, where I get off the train.  One very wet evening the roof of the train was leaking &mdash; the train was more like a cattle train than anything else.  A woman with three young children went to the first class carriage and she was told that she <Col N="2880" /> would have to pay so much a head extra. I do not know what the amount extra was.  Perhaps £1 or £2.  I am not blaming the gentleman who told her so.  That woman told me that one of her children had been in hospital that day and that she had to bring the other two young children with her because she could get nobody to look after them.  She had to stand for quite a while until some gentleman got off the train at some point and then she could sit down.</P>
    <P>It amazes me that such a thing should happen.  Surely the people operating those trains should have authority when there is overcrowding and nobody is using this ghost first-class carriage to allow those passengers into it.  A little common sense is necessary here.  Are those passengers classed as second class citizens? Nobody would be using the first-class carriage and it would be known when the train was leaving Dublin that that was so. This happens on that train every week and probably on every train that goes to the west or south.  I ask the Minister to look into this.</P>
    <P>All that I have mentioned can be considered very serious faults in the system and do not encourage people to use the railways as they would like to use them. The fares are steep enough and passengers would at least like to be able to sit down.  Perhaps a few extra coaches or an extra train could be put on on a Friday evening if the business is there.  Students and many people from rural Ireland go home for weekends thus causing crowding. On a number of occasions I have heard people complaining to the ticket checker and he says that it is not his fault. Surely the people at the top must see the need for a few extra carriages or an extra train.</P>
    <P>CIE should look at the timing of trains and buses in various areas, particularly in rural areas as there have been complaints about this.  The prices for the dining services on our trains are outrageous.  The price for a cup of tea and a bit of homemade bread is a rip off.  The Gresham Hotel would provide it cheaper.  In the bars on the trains it is very difficult at times to get Irish made whiskey or any <Col N="2881" /> kind of spirits, beer or minerals.  That is sad when we have so many people unemployed.  We have been told that Irish firms have tendered for those things. Surely we can complete with foreign companies in providing soft drinks and so on. Tourists take a dim view of us when we complain about unemployment while in a national service like CIE we cannot see to it that Irish produced goods are available on the trains.  The Minister should look into that aspect.  Cheaper fares would encourage more tourists to use the trains and buses.  There is no point in having buses and trains running empty. It is a false economy which is costing taxpayers money and giving them little in return.</P>
    <P>I have no axe to grind in relation to the school bus service.  The area managers are doing as much as they can and they are always co-operative and helpful even though the system is a bit crazy.  I pity the drivers of school buses.  If, 30 years ago, we saw one of those big buses coming down a country road we would have thought that the driver had gone astray.  I would not drive one of those buses down one of our narrow roads with its bends and potholes and untrimmed hedges, for £1,000 a day.  The drivers are marvellous but it is dangerous for the drivers and for the 50 or 60 children on those buses, to use such big buses on such small roads.  One often comes across a school bus and farm machinery jammed on the road with neither able to get past. That must be a nightmare for the driver and the children.  I hope there is not a serious accident with a school bus on one of those narrow roads as these buses are only made of fibreglass and would fold up in a bad accident.  When replacing some of the school bus fleet the Minister might consider some of my points.  I pay tribute to those who operate the private school bus service.  Those people provide a smaller school bus and an excellent service although even with the smaller bus it is difficult to avoid accidents because of the state of the roads.</P>
    <P>In relation to the heating on trains, sometimes on a summer day the heating is turned on and one could fry a rasher <Col N="2882" /> on the passenger seat but on a cold winter evening one will find the wind whistling in through the windows and the heating not turned on.  Nobody seems to care. That is one of our failings.  In major State organisations such as CIE nobody seems to care who is inconvenienced.  Is it any wonder we have thousands unemployed? All these things leave a bad impression and lead to a loss of money.  When one complains about the service the complaint is passed from one to the other, gets lost along the way and nothing is done for months.  The Minister should see to it that the managers in each area are given the power to deal with that sort of complaint on a daily basis without having to resort to paper passing along the line.  It is important that the heating on the trains is regulated especially for old or very young people.</P>
    <P>Some of our railway stations are a credit to the station masters and to CIE but most of them are gloomy and filthy with rubbish dumped beside them.  It is a scandal that tourists should see loads of rubbish dumped near the stations by CIE management, old broken wagons and so on.  It would not cost very much money to make a little effort there.  If some station masters can do it, there is no reason the rest of them cannot.  It would help to brighten our image.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will see to it that we will not have wanderly wagons going around empty, and that some effort will be made to give an opportunity to people to use the buses which are costing the taxpayer money.  I do not blame the present Minister.  I know this has been going on for a number of years.  I know there is a rapid service, but on some routes it would not take half an hour if the bus stopped to pick up passengers instead of driving non stop for 15 miles with nobody on the bus.  It does not make sense.  I am sure people in rural Ireland, particularly old people, would appreciate transport in order to get their messages or to collect their old age pensions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>As a pro-CIE Deputy I congratulate all concerned.  I congratulate the Minister, the management <Col N="2883" /> of CIE and the workforce.  I applaud their tremendous feat during the last four years in living within their subvention and in 1985 recording a surplus of £7 million. The Minister can take great credit for it. However, my congratulations are slightly tempered by the fact that he has spent a tremendous amount of money on the locomotive works in Inchicore which were stolen from Dundalk through political expediency many years ago.  In 1983 a sum of £3 million was expended on these works which rose to £14 million in 1986 for capital works.  That underlines the value to a constituency of having a Minister with his hand on the purse strings.  In the Border region we cannot even get money to put up signposts for those Ministers who do not know where we are.  Lucky Inchicore.</P>
      <P>CIE have been much maligned over the years although they achieved a remarkable feat in turning an alarming deficit into a surplus of £7 million.  It reflects great credit on the management and the workforce.  I note that between 1982 and 1985 4,000 people lost their jobs for one reason or another.  However, it is very satisfying to note that assurances have been given that there will be no more redundancies except through natural wastage.</P>
      <P>I was a little apprehensive about the continuation of rail services and I am very glad that there is no threat to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>That is why all those coaches are being built at Inchicore and the Deputy should not resent money spent on them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanMcGahon" hpid="Mr. McGahon Mr. McGahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>I resent everything about Dublin.  Previous speakers referred to various ways by which CIE could attract more customers to the railway and bus services.  The bus services face very unfair competition from private operators and in my area they ply a very lucrative trade.  However, they do not supply a social service and CIE have to run buses on unprofitable routes in the Border region, in areas where private operators would not dream of going.  That <Col N="2884" /> is very unfair.  Private operators offer very attractive rates to people but if they did not have competition from CIE they would soon charge exorbitant prices. Many of these private operators work with indifferent insurance cover and I would be very fearful if an accident occurred.  Their insurance should be checked.</P>
      <P>CIE, especially in the Border area, are very anxious to compete with private operators.  I understand a service is provided from Dundalk bus station at weekends on a voluntary basis which gives an indication of the commitment of the workforce in the area to CIE.  They work from Friday night until Sunday night providing a very reasonably priced service to Dublin and they take no money for it.  I applaud them for doing so.</P>
      <P>I have a gripe in relation to the &ldquo;coffin&rdquo; trains operating from Amiens Street and Westland Row at 5.20 p.m. every evening. Security and safety regulations are very often not enforced.  On several occasions I have been unable to board these trains, indeed one evening I was pushed off a train and had to wait for another.  People cannot breathe in these trains and if there was even a slight derailment there would be great loss of life. I cannot understand why CIE will not provide more carriages to cater for the many people who use these trains every night of the week.  It is especially bad on Fridays.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>CIE should also make railway stations more attractive.  The Malahide station should be emulated as it is very attractive and kept in good condition.  There are also nice shrubs and flowers in evidence. That cannot be said about every station where facilities, in some cases, are well below par.  The provision of newsagent shops and somewhere to have a cup of tea for those who have to wait is necessary. At one time in Dundalk there was a bar and a buffet.  I understand that several people were interested in acquiring them.  They would have paid a very good return to CIE and would also provide a service for the travelling public. CIE should look at that as a means of <Col N="2885" /> encouraging people to use the services provided.</P>
    <P>I should also like to draw the attention of the Minister to the thousands of acres lying unused by CIE all over the country. If this land cannot be put to good use it should be sold and the money reinvested in CIE.  Millions of pounds could probably be raised in this fashion.  In Dundalk CIE have extensive lands lying idle which would fetch a handsome price on the market.  It would be a means of acquiring badly needed money which could be used for rolling stock.  I note that the capital provision for 1986 is £34.4 million mainly for new railway carriages and buses which are badly needed.  We also need rolling stock for the railways.  CIE should also provide more people to clean the trains and buses.  Many young people on the dole could, for a little more, be given jobs in this area.</P>
    <P>CIE have done a great job and it must be a great comfort and consolation to the personnel involved who have lived with the threat of the dismantling of various services.  The Minister has done a good job and I look forward to continuing profits from CIE in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughConaghan" hpid="Mr. Conaghan Mr. Conaghan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Conaghan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to express my compliments to the management and staff of CIE for operating a public transport service down through the years.  We are all aware of how a semi-State body came to be in charge of public transport. At the time that happened transport in this country was in complete chaos. There was no cohesion within the transport systems and because cohesion was considered necessary in providing a social service to the nation, CIE were established. CIE did a good job in the circumstances in which they had to operate. It must be accepted that it was virtually impossible for them to operate on a profit-making basis.  Circumstances have overtaken the transport scene in 1986 and perhaps did so earlier.  The public transport system has been declining for a number of years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister in his speech indicated that the escalation in CIE losses between 1969 and 1982 was all the more disastrous <Col N="2886" /> when one considers that overall employment in the board fell by nearly 4,000 in that time.  I would go further and say that the downrun of CIE started prior to that. They were not competitive in trying to attract new business.  The public transport service they provided throughout the country left much to be desired, and there seems to have been no will within the organisation to develop the freight service. It is significant that the Minister stated in his speech that the road freight service will survive in 1986 because of how it operated in the past few years.</P>
    <P>There is now an effort to contract the public transport service.  When that happens there will be no public transport service in rural Ireland.  Forty years ago in the county I represent we had five railways operating.  There was the Londonderry and Lough Swilly Railway, the County Donegal Railway, the Great Northern Railway, the Sligo-Leitrim and the Northern Counties Railway and there was the railway known as the Clogher Valley Railway.  There are now no railways operating in the north west region. We have no railway system operating in the Counties of Leitrim, Donegal, Fermanagh, Tyrone, Cavan or Monaghan. As will be seen from the map issued by CIE there are railways operating throughout the rest of the country.  It amazes me to hear Deputies complain about the transport system and its inadequacies. I accept that they are entitled to look for efficiency in the transport system, but how would they like to represent part of the country in which there is no public transport system even though the people living in that region who pay taxes, subsidise the public transport system for the rest of the country?  The Minister should take note of that aspect because the bus services provided for passengers from that region leave much to be desired.  These buses operate from depots in which there are no facilities. The Minister should consider up-grading the service and should provide transport at a reasonable cost.  We were led to believe when CIE was established and when in later years the Great Northern <Col N="2887" /> Railway Company and all the other railway companies were closed down that the local authorities would be subsidised for the upkeep of the road system in that region and that other benefits would accrue to us such as the provision of a transport service.  A service was enjoyed and maintained there without any public finance but now we are without any public transport system in the region.  While we have the express bus service to Dublin and Galway there is no provincial bus service.  Neither is there any freight service within the region.  As I have said, the freight services were run down by CIE because of how they were operated. They drove their customers away.  Private operators are now providing a freight service from this city and from the rest of the country to north and west Donegal. CIE operate a service whereby they deliver freight to Sligo and contractors haul it from there to Donegal.  I am firmly convinced that in 12 months time we will be back in this House debating a Bill on the closure of the freight services.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister in his reply to give an indication as to what is the future for an internal transport system.  There is an <i>ad hoc</i> arrangement with the Lough Swilly Company who have been providing a transport service for 150 years in north Donegal.  I hope that arrangement will be maintained.  It is a service that has been supported and which has survived for 150 years against all the odds, even against the private operators.</P>
    <P>Private operators have creamed off the bulk of the traffic.  They go for the profitable routes, but they do give a very good service which CIE are now unable to compete against, particularly on the express routes.  The management of CIE have got to reassess the position and to compete.  That is what it is all about. Ultimately, we could finish up with the position which pertained at the time of the setting up of the semi-State transport company.  I do not think we would want to go back to that position.</P>
    <P>As regards a rail link with the north west region &mdash; there are now no railways in that region &mdash; there have been studies <Col N="2888" /> done on the operation of a rapid rail system between Derry and Dublin.  There should be a link-up because that is the last link we have with the north west.  A rapid rail link should be developed from Derry to Belfast with a link from there to Dublin.  We have got to accept that because of their condition our roads are unable to carry the volume of traffic they are being asked to carry.  There is a future for the development of a rail link system throughout the country.  It could be promoted and utilised to a greater extent if the will and initiative was there to develop it.  Competition is the key factor. If pursued properly there is a future for the development of a rail system, not alone for passengers but also for freight. This should be explored to a greater extent.  I would have preferred to see the provincial bus service and rail service combined as one company with the Dublin city bus service as a separate entity.  It appears the emphasis will be on the provincial bus service and that, once again, the rail service is being shoved aside.  It has all often been said that the rail service was the money spender and the one section of the company that had to be carried.  All losses down the years were put against that service and, consequently, we have had many calls to close branch lines on the basis that they were too expensive to run and were not carrying passengers.  The provincial bus and rail services should be under one management body.</P>
    <P>I invite the Minister to deal with the problems in my constituency in regard to the bus services.  We have had to face many problems since the closure of the link with the Great Northern Railway. There is a need for an extension of the bus service by CIE in the south west of the county and CIE should provide a more efficient express service there.  Will the Minister indicate if he plans to retain the public bus service that operates in north Donegal?</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in a minority on this side of the House, perhaps in the entire House, in saying I have some <Col N="2889" /> admiration for the approach of the Minister in dealing with semi-State companies under his aegis.  I do not think all members of his party, or my party, will agree with that statement but the Minister has tried to rationalise the semi-State companies under his control and I wish him continued success in that regard.  I accept there are huge obstacles to be encountered with those big organisations. One could spend a full day discussing CIE but I will just touch on a few aspects of the company and the proposals in the Bill.  For as long as I can remember successive Governments have produced reports about CIE and I have no doubt that the reports issued would cover the floor of the Chamber.  I do not know how many McKinsey-type reports have been prepared or the number of inter-Departmental reports that have been issued. However, I am aware they are all gathering dust now.  Within a few years it is likely that another report on CIE will be commissioned and that we will pay consultants hundreds of thousands of pounds to produce it.</P>
      <P>I welcome the fact that the Bill intends to do something about CIE.  With the prospect of a general election in the next year some Deputies will be considering the number of CIE votes they have to play for in their constituencies before offending such people in a debate like this.  It is my view that the majority of people in the privacy of their own homes would not praise many aspects of CIE's operations.  Undoubtedly, one can approve of some aspects of the company and one must accept that some people in the company work very hard.  However, in general CIE have been an unmitigated bloody disaster who have cost the taxpayer hundreds of millions of pounds over the years.  It has been a terrible drain on the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill proposes, instead of having one company employing a large number of people, to give us three CIE companies, namely, Irish Rail, Irish Bus and Dublin Bus.  I am afraid that instead of having one big problem with CIE we will end up with three more bureaucracies <Col N="2890" /> and three greater problems.  Semi-State companies are established to fill a need but it is usual here for them to assume a type of organic growth of themselves. They become so large and unwieldly that one forgets the purpose for which they were established.  We all agree that when CIE were constituted as a public utility company there was a need for a public transport company.  The company was set up to fill a vacuum because nobody else was providing a public transport service. However, we must ask ourselves why the company are involved in various roles that private enterprise would do a lot better.  That fundamental question faces the State not alone in regard to CIE but in regard to a whole range of activities here.</P>
    <P>We have to decide whether we are to operate fully in a free enterprise economy or have a State or semi-State socialist type economy.  I put my cards firmly down on the side of free enterprise because I believe the whole system would operate better if free enterprise was allowed to run unfettered.  CIE are in business to provide a service but they have become so large that the mangement and many workers in the company think the Irish people should provide a service for them and should provide them with good wages and conditions. Those involved in the ordinary world of private enterprises who are not able to provide a service for their customers, whether it is a labouring service, an accountancy service such as I am involved in or any other form of activity go out of business very quickly.  If politicians do not provide the service required of them they go out of business in that they are not returned at the next general election.  The management and workers of many semi-State companies &mdash; one could over-run this argument to the Civil Service &mdash; assume that because they are regarded as part of the State sector the remainder of the population, should, through their taxes, provide good terms of employment for them.  CIE must realise they are in the transport service and are there to provide that service for <Col N="2891" /> the rest of the community, not the other way around.</P>
    <P>Why are CIE involved in some of the activities which form part of their operation? What are they doing in the freight service which has continuously lost money?  The private operators in road freight and so on can make a profit and if they do not make one they go out of business.  CIE had a type of monopoly, or tried to have, for a number of years and they could not make a profit.  Why did they go into the freight service in the first place?  For many years CIE were involved in hotels.  What were they doing in that business?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>What were they doing in the hotel business?  Why are semi-State companies becoming involved in areas where free enterprise can legitimately operate?  They only create more management structures, more bureaucracy and further jobs at the expense, in the long term, of the ordinary taxpayer.  A company such as CIE must be involved in marketing.  If they are not able to provide a service at an economic cost, free enterprise must be allowed to do it.  The present Minister has helped to liberalise road freight and haulage with the help of the EC directives.  However, that has been a long, hard struggle.  CIE were a protected species and yet could not make any money, They are a large conglomerate and have got themselves involved in areas of activity in which they should never have become involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take the constituency in which I live. In the past 20 years that area has been the fastest growing county outside Dublin county and the north of the area is projected to grow at an even faster rate.  In the two main population growth centres of County Kildare, namely, the Naas-Newbridge triangle and the north Kildare triangle of Leixlip, Celbridge and Maynooth, there has been enormous growth but yet CIE, for capital reasons, cannot <Col N="2892" /> become involved in that area.  Any private operator would be in to take advantage of the market.  Surely it is possible for CIE to provide a proper rail service for those areas?  The tracks are there as far as Naas and Newbridge are concerned and there is a station in Newbridge.  The branch line from Naas to Sallins was closed off in the fifties but about two miles outside Naas, at Sallins, there is a railway station.  There are hundreds of people who every morning would be very willing to take the rail service to Dublin, to pick up the train at Sallins.  That would take off the roads great numbers of people who travel in and out every day. These towns of Naas and Newbridge are really dormitory towns of Dublin and there is a market there.  The same applies to Leixlip.  It is very difficult to convince CIE that they should provide these services. There is one morning service which operates from Maynooth to Dublin but there would be an increase in passengers if the train stopped at Leixlip.  It has taken a number of years to get the service to Maynooth and it will take many more years before CIE provide a service for and proper rail facilities at Sallins.  They should provide the required services.</P>
    <P>I am in favour of privatisation of the bus service, of allowing private operators to operate within the system.  I appeal to the Minister, who has a very liberal view in this whole area, to consider the granting of licences to private bus operators on scheduled services.  Regarding competition, we have seen what has happened to Aer Lingus since Ryanair got into the market.  The customer is coming off best.</P>
    <P>Every Friday night in Westmoreland Street, Dublin, for the past couple of years a number of private bus operators take people back to the main provincial towns. There is a great social aspect to this as well.  People are brought to Limerick, Ennis.  Clare and Galway in their hundreds at a very economic cost.  This has revitalised those areas.  All the fun is not in coming to Dublin at the weekend for the crack, it is in going back to Ennis, Tralee or Castlebar.  All the civil servants and other young people working in <Col N="2893" /> Dublin take these buses home each week-end and return to Dublin on the Sunday night.</P>
    <P>Other bus operators are operating on the scheduled service routes also and are providing a good service.  There are a number of anomalies in the law at present and CIE are trying to hassle the private bus operators to such an extent that they are attempting to put them off the road, trying to catch them out in illegalities. CIE are trying to protect themselves.  It has been great that these services have been operating for the past three years and I wish them continued success.  Following on the proposals to change the bus services, I do not want the private operators not to be able to operate.  What if the private operators will only take the economic areas?  I say that the people running these bus services are prepared to tender with CIE or anybody else for what are known as the uneconomic runs. Let us then see who can provide a service at the best cost.</P>
    <P>These bodies are to service the customer, not to fleece the customer.  I look forward to further liberalisation.  I am not convinced that the setting up of three independent companies now to be known as Irish Rail, Irish Bus and Dublin Bus to replace the existing CIE company will make any difference whatsoever.  It might even create further layers of bureaucracy but I hope I am proved wrong.</P>

Before going on to that subject, I should like to crave the indulgence of the Chair in that for the second time I complain about the requirement that civil servants wear badges in this House.  It strikes me as very strange that people who have given long and dedicated service to our administration should be required to <Col N="2894" /> carry tags labelling them when they come to serve the elected Ministers here.  The Minister should see to it that this practice is discontinued.  I fully support the need for security, for having an identification badge or card which is to be produced on request or on entry to the House, but it is ridiculous to ask civil servants, particularly those with long and eminent service, to wear badges in this House.  I am merely expressing my abhorrence about something on which I feel very strongly. I suggest to the Minister that he take the necessary steps to have them replaced by cards.</P>

      <P>On a point of order, I note that there is no provision in the list read out by the Minister of State for a speaker from The Workers' Party. I have an amendment down to the motion and it is normal practice to allow time for the proposer of the amendment.  I would ask that the order which has been read out by the Minister be amended to allow time for me to contribute on my amendment. That is the normal practice.  It is unfortunate that I have to stand up here <Col N="2895" /> on every occasion when orders are being made to request that this be done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>Our sympathy and concern are also with the families of many of these people because the burden and anxiety placed on them in trying to provide support and care 24 hours a day, without adequate help or support from the State, is a very difficult problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would also like to take this opportunity to express my admiration for the various community health services provided by family doctors, public health nurses, and community welfare officers, <Col N="2899" /> but taking care of the sick requires manpower and little else.  Surely in a society where up to 250,000 poeple are unemployed, no one can try to justify the present state of affairs.</P>
    <P>The Government have failed in this most important area, not because of lack of money but because of a lack of ideas and lack of courage in confronting the inefficiency which is rife in our health care system.  It is wrong to tackle ineffiency in the vague and ambivalent manner being conducted by this Government. The only real and effective path to efficiency is to recognise that the present system of delivery of health care is inherently inefficient.  It is subject to erratic and directionless interference by Ministers for Health and by bureaucrats, resources are inefficiently used often to provide services no longer relevant to the needs of the community.  Priorities change at a whim and what we have ended up with is very much a smash and grab approach to health care.</P>
    <P>The present system of health care in this country is deficient in two key areas. Firstly, it is not selective.  It does not give priority to the needy.  No matter how often the present Minister says that the poor and needy should get priority, the fact is that they do not.  The system is wrong and health care workers are often unjustly blamed.  The health services are also inefficient because of poor and under-developed management structures. There is too much bureaucracy and too little decision making.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare (Mr. Pattison)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad to have an opportunity to speak in this debate and to refute the inaccurate statements which have been made regarding the current state of the health services.  I would like to concentrate on two important areas of our health services where there have been significant <Col N="2900" /> achievements since this Government took office.</P>
      <P>In Ireland we have built up a wide range of specialised services for our mentally handicapped people.  The quality of our service is recognised internationally. There is no doubt that this is due, in no small part, to the magnificent contribution which the many non-statutory organisations have made.  Their attitude of sharing and caring has ensured that the highest standards are afforded to our mentally handicapped people in keeping with their dignity and worth.</P>
      <P>There are, at present, some 326 units or centres which provide 9,834 places for our mentally handicapped people.  Some 5,800 of these are residential places, the remaining 3,000 are day care places. These figures exclude the 2,000 mentally handicapped people inappropriately placed in psychiatric hospitals.  They also exclude the provision made by the Department of Education for the handicapped in schools and classes throughout the country.  In 1986 over £100 million will be spent by the Department of Health on services for the mentally handicapped.  This is about 100 per cent more than was spent in 1980.</P>
      <P>I must say that I took grave exception to Deputy Briscoe's rather vindictive and untrue remarks made during the course of this debate in relation to the Minister's attitude to voluntary groups who look after the mentally handicapped.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Health has, on numerous occasions, discussed the present state of the mental handicap services with representatives of the non-statutory organisations and impressed his commitment not only to maintain the existing level and high standard of our mental handicap services but to improve these.  We, in Government, recognise that mentally handicapped people must have a particular priority within the health services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since becoming Minister for Health, the Minister has clearly demonstrated that this was no false promise.  Since he came to office, projects have been completed at: Cheeverstown House; St. Michael's House, Belcamp; Swinford; <Col N="2901" /> Cootehill; St. Patrick's, Upton.  Major improvement schemes have been completed in St. Mary's, Drumcar and funds have been given to facilitate the development of community-based services by the Brothers of Charity and the St. John of God Brothers.  Expenditure on these projects amounted to £27.1 million.</P>
    <P>In addition, between 1983 and 1985, almost £3 million was provided to enable minor improvement works to be carried out in mental handicap centres.</P>
    <P>He has also initiated a scheme to enable a planned programme of maintenance works to be undertaken in centres for mentally handicapped people over a 3-year period.  A sum of £600,000 was spent in 1985, £400,000 in 1986 and at least £400,000 for further improvements will be allocated in 1987.  In addition, in 1986, the Minister has provided capital grants totalling £710,000 towards the development of community-based services.</P>
    <P>One hundred and fifty new posts have been created in the programme which has enabled 14 new projects to be commissioned including developments at Cheeverstown House, St. Mary's, Drumcar, Pope John Paul II Centre, Galway, St. Michael's House, Dublin; Sunbeam House, Bray and Galway County Association.</P>
    <P>Of course the Minister is conscious that much remains to be done to bridge the gaps and eliminate the weaknesses which exist in our mental handicap services. There is an urgent need, particularly in the current economic climate to evaluate existing information at our disposal and to draw up guidelines for the future development of all aspects of the mental handicap services.  For this reason he has initiated a review of the mental handicap services.  This task will be carried out by way of consultation with the persons and organisations involved in the provision of the service.  Despite the onerous task, it is expected that the review will be completed quickly.</P>
    <P>I would hope that from what I have said it will be perfectly clear that the Minister is determined to continue to give our services for the mentally handicapped <Col N="2902" /> the highest possible priority and to ensure that the present standards for the care of the mentally handicapped are maintained. He looks forward to continuing to work in partnership with the many non-statutory agencies in establishing comprehensive services throughout the country for a very special group of our people.</P>
    <P>The Minister has also been accused of being uncaring in his approach to services provided for the mentally ill.  Nothing could be further from the truth as is clearly evident in the developments which are taking place in the psychiatric services.  The report <i>Planning for the Future</i> has pointed the way for the future organisation of our psychiatric services based on a comprehensive community-oriented service which will cater for the varying needs of people with mental illness. The components of such a service include prevention and early identification assessment, diagnostic and treatment services, in-patient care, day care, out-patient care, community-based residences together with rehabilitation and training.  These facilities are being provided in the community so that they are close to where people live and work. They will provide an alternative to the largely institutional services now in existence which were planned at a time when more modern treatment methods were not available.  The great advantages of this reorganised service will be that most patients will be able to continue to live in their own homes with the necessary psychiatric support being provided locally.</P>
    <P>Each of the eight regional health boards have drawn up plans to implement the report <i>Planning for the Future</i> in respect of the psychiatric services in their respective functional areas.  The Minister's Department is actively following up the implementation of these plans with the individual health boards and considerable progress has been made to date. The Minister has allocated considerable capital resources to enable the health boards to develop facilities in the community such as mental health centres, day facilities, supervised and unsupervised <Col N="2903" /> hostels, high support hostels, rehabilitation units etc.  A considerable effort is being put into the reorganisation of the psychiatric services in this country which will result in significant improvements for people suffering from mental illness in so far as a comprehensive psychiatric service will be provided in a community setting without the need for admission to large psychiatric hospitals.</P>
    <P>In my own area, the South Eastern Health Board have drawn up a comprehensive plan for the reorganisation of psychiatric services in the region based on the principles which I have already outlined.  This plan provides for the organisation of the service on a sector basis which means that a comprehensive psychiatric service will be provided for a population of known size who are resident within a clearly defined district.  This service will be provided by a multi-disciplinary psychiatric team with a consultant psychiatrist as its leader.  The plan provides for the provision of acute psychiatric units at Kilkenny and Wexford and the upgrading of existing units in Ardkeen and Clonmel together with the development of mental health centres in Waterford, Wexford, Kilkenny, Carlow, Clonmel, Dungarvan and Enniscorthy. The services to be provided in these centres will include assessment, diagnostic and treatment clinics, nursing care, rehabilitation and activation facilities and will be the location of key sector headquarters and administrative facilities where necessary.  In addition, centres for day care and clinics are being considered in association with community care facilities for smaller urban areas such as Thomastown, Clogheen, Kilmacthomas, Tipperary, New Ross, Mullinahone, Gorey, Bunclody, Carrick-on-Suir, Bagenalstown, Cashel, Castlecomer, Tullow, Lismore, Callan and Cappoquin.</P>
    <P>In the context of the development of psychiatric services in the South Eastern Health Board area I would like to refer to the position of Carlow Psychiatric Hospital.  A lot has been said about the present Carlow hospital this year, some of it mischievous.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2904" /> In the plans drawn up by the South Eastern Health Board for the development of psychiatric services, it is proposed to transfer back to the Eastern Health Board the services in respect of County Kildare.  These have traditionally been provided by Carlow.  A new catchment area will be created which will have as its hospital base a new unit at Kilkenny General Hospital.  When the Minister published the report on the psychiatric services &mdash;<i>Planning for the Future</i>&mdash; he said Government had accepted the recommendations.  Subject to any changes as a result of discussion of the report he proposed to implement it.  The report was very widely accepted and to give impetus to its implementation he chose two hospital areas in which the recommendations should be implemented without delay.  He was criticised for that.  No doubt he would have been criticised even more strongly if he had decided not to implement the report. He was in a no-win position.  Despite a slow start, progress is now being made and I expect that that will become clear very soon.  Here again, despite the pressure on resources, funds will be made available to enable the plans to be implemented.</P>
    <P>I would like to congratulate the Minister and, indeed, the South Eastern Health Board for their enlightened approach to the care of people suffering from mental illness.</P>
    <P>Since he was given the health portfolio, the Minister has given priority to the reorganisation and development of the psychiatric service.  The development of this service along the lines which I have indicated is a further indication of the steady improvements which have taken place in the overall health services since this Government took up office.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>I might refer also to the very high rate of activity on the payment of disabled persons' grants.  I have a table before me indicating that in 1985 alone &mdash; and it should be remembered that <Col N="2905" /> these grants are devoted solely to people who are either physically or mentally disabled in some way &mdash; already there has been made available over £3,500,000, through the local authorities and recoupment from the Department on that scheme.  That is another £3,500,000 of public money that has been spent.  Full recoupment has been made on those grants.  I notice that in Deputy O'Hanlon's county of Monaghan 12 projects only were carried out in 1985 whereas in a much smaller county, Carlow, in the same year 49 projects were carried out. It is a pity that the Opposition, when in office, did not devote the same attention to the improvement of facilities for psychiatric patients and for the mentally handicapped, the disabled and disadvantaged. I congratulate the Minister on the progress he has made in that respect.</P>

      <P>As somebody who has taken a special interest in the history of the development of the State I believe the present Minister for Health will be seen, among all the Ministers for Health over the past 60 years, as the one who did more than anybody else to rationalise our health service, to put it on a sound footing and to make it relevant to present and future needs.  When the history of this period is written the contribution of Deputy Barry Desmond as Minister for Health will be seen to have been constructive, at all times courageous and to have been far-sighted.  He will be seen in retrospect as one of our most significant Ministers for Health.  I join with the Minister this evening in reminding the House of the very spectacular growth in spending on health services over the past ten years or so.  In 1973-74 net spending on health was about £143 million, representing just over 5 per cent of gross national product.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>The approved gross expenditure level available for 1986 will <Col N="2906" /> be of the order of £1.3 billion or an estimated 7.1 per cent of GNP.  This figure represents almost 20 per cent of total Government spending on current services. During the period 1982-86 total Government spending on health has increased by 30 per cent and has kept pace with the increase in the consumer price index during the same period.</P>

      <P>This level of funding by the Government has ensured that essential services have been maintained and that much needed developments have been implemented despite the serious financial difficulties which the country face.  I will illustrate these gains by concentrating on Dublin where some very significant developments have taken place during the Government's term of office.  For example, the national liver transplant centre has been opened at St. Vincent's Hospital; there has been a 100 per cent increase in the level of cardiac surgery in the Master Hospital; there has been a major expansion in orthopaedic services at St. Mary's Hospital, Cappagh and there have been developments in geriatric services at the new St. James's Hospital and at the Royal Hospital.</P>

      <P>On the community care side we have seen a most successful measles vaccination campaign which achieved a 90 per cent coverage of the children targeted.  In regard to services for the handicapped, an area which was much maligned and much overlooked by Governments in the past, we have seen the commissioning of the St. Michael's House adult special care unit at Belcamp in my own constitutency.  We have seen the commencement of the building of new residential accommodation for the deaf at St. Joseph's and St. Mary's schools for the deaf in Cabra.  These latter developments are particularly welcome <Col N="2907" /> because they have been left so long on the long finger by so many administrations.</P>
      <P>In addition to the increase in current spending there has also been a considerable increase in the capital resources devoted to the health services during the period of the plan, despite the very obvious financial constraints.  Between 1982 and 1986 capital expenditure increased from £49 million to over £58 million and considerable progress has been made during that time in the development of our general hospitals.</P>

      <P>Since 1983, among a large number of capital schemes, we have seen major developments at St. James's Hospital and the Mater Hospital and a number of the Dublin voluntary hospitals have also featured prominently in this list of developments.  I agree with the Minister in focusing the debate on future resources and future developments. Nobody on any side of this House can honestly claim or expect that in the present financial climate the growth in spending, which has been a feature of our health services in the past, can continue. In fact, it should be obvious to everybody that we will have difficulty even in maintaining the existing level of funding in the short term.  It is imperative, therefore, that a rationalisation of the use of the very significant amount of resources, in financial and personnel terms, be achieved to eliminate unnecessary and wasteful expenditure if we are to ensure that essential services are maintained and developed.  The only way forward for our health service in the immediate future is to create a rational, cost efficient and integrated service which will be able to respond to the reasonable health needs of the community within the existing level of financial provision.  This sound approach, indeed the only approach, has been adopted with evident success in the greater Dublin area with the support of the Government.  It must, and I know it will, be continued by the Minister despite <Col N="2908" /> the opposition which will be generated for sectional or political reasons.</P>
      <P>I am very pleased in the short time I have this evening to welcome the report, <i>Planning for the Future,</i> which points the way for the future organisation of our psychiatric services based upon a comprehensive community-oriented service which will cater for the varying needs of people with mental illness.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>The great advantage of this reorganised service will be that most patients will be able to continue to live in their own homes with the necessary psychiatric support being provided locally. I am delighted to see that a start has been made in the Eastern Health Board area and I wish them continued success with this development.</P>
      <P>I will conclude by returning briefly to the general hospital programme which accounts for over 50 per cent of non-capital spending.  Nobody on any side of the House can claim that this service is now being provided in the most effective or efficient way possible.  Part of the blame for this is due to the proliferation of small hospitals which, because of their age, their condition and their location, are not in a position to meet the needs of the total population who need modern acute hospital facilities.  It has been recognised by all the major political parties in this House that a haphazard development of our hospital system can no longer continue and that an overall planning framework should be devised to ensure the delivery of an efficient and an effective service at the most modern standards available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is further agreed that this plan would result in the closing down of many of our existing old, cost inefficient hospitals and that a lesser number of larger sized, well equipped new hospitals located in the major population centres is preferable. It would be more efficient and it would respond better to the needs of all the population than was the case in the past. It is clear that much of the Minister's <Col N="2909" /> efforts in the acute hospital area have been concentrated on implementing this overall rationalisation strategy.  In Dublin this plan provides at present for the development of six major acute hospitals, St. Vincent's Hospital, St. James's Hospital, and the hospital in Tallaght to serve the south side and Beaumont Hospital, the Mater Hospital and the James Connolly Memorial Hospital to serve the north side.  The plan for the north side is well on the way to completion. At present the State is investing considerable resources in this programme. This network of major acute hospitals will be more than adequate to meet the needs of the total population in Dublin, both in the inner city and the suburban areas.</P>
    <P>As was mentioned by Deputy Ormonde, there have been closures, as was planned, of Mercers Hospital, St. Patrick's infant Hospital and Sir Patrick Dun's but without reducing the level of services.  The other closures which are planned will be implemented in the way outlined.</P>

We all want to see this happen as soon as possible.  The Minister has not spared himself in his efforts to achieve this.  This major transfer of resources will provide fitting evidence of the Minister's sound plan to rationalise our hospital services and to provide and fund an improved service.  In conclusion, the Minister is to be commended for continuing to provide a comprehensive health service despite the overall necessary limitations on cash.  As I said at the beginning, he will be seen in history as <Col N="2910" /> one of the most significant Ministers for Health over the past 60 years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>This motion is most timely.  It condemns the failure of the Government to provide essential health services for the old, the sick and the handicapped and calls on the Government as a matter or urgency to ensure that the necessary level of services is provided.</P>
      <P>Health boards are finding it virtually impossible to cope with the health cuts due entirely to lack of funding by the Minister for Health which results directly in a most serious cutback in the following services, to mention just a few instances:</P>
      <P>1.  Medical cards can no longer be granted on the grounds of hardship alone; 2.  There is an early discharge of patients out of hospitals into the community, without any resources by way of cash or otherwise to improve the community services; 3.  The dental and ophthalmic services are totally under-financed, particularly the orthodontic service; 4.  No effort is being made to enable health boards to operate a decent scheme of refunds of cost of transport to medical card holders.</P>
      <P>It is now a well known fact, whether the Minister knows it or not, that it is virtually impossible for a person to get a medical card on hardship grounds.  There was a time when this was possible.  Has the Minister issued instructions or guidelines to the health boards on this matter?</P>
      <P>There was a time when medical cards were granted on hardship grounds to persons in a bad financial position and marginally outside the eligibility guide scale as laid down by the Minister for guidance to health boards.  Now all this has changed and I know from my own personal experience in making representations to the health board for such persons that this is so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For example, it is now virtually impossible for a married man with two children, with a take-home pay of £99.50 per week and paying £7.50 per week rent for his house, to get a medical card.  This is a disgrace in this day and age and shows <Col N="2911" /> clearly what the full impact of the Minister's health cuts are like on the ground. It is now time that the Minister should tell the health boards to take net income into account instead of gross income for employees seeking medical cards.</P>
    <P>Net profit only is taken into account in respect of farmers and profit, after deductions, is taken into account from other categories who must produce a certificate of assessment from the Revenue Commissioners in support of their application. Why then is gross income taken into account for an employee like my example of the married man with two children in receipt of £99.50 net, per week who had his application rejected?</P>
    <P>There is confusion among the public regarding the discrepancy in means testing applicants for services as between the health boards and the Department of Social Welfare when the latter consider applications for unemployment assistance. This should not be the case.  The system of means testing small farmers in particular should be uniform right across the board.  For example, why cannot a recipient of a non-contributory old age pension automatically qualify for a medical card?  I am saying that because of the health cuts there are many ill persons in this country who are doing without medical treatment because they cannot afford it and the health boards have not got the finance to provide it for them.</P>
    <P>I also ask the Minister to allow health boards to grant medical cards to unemployed persons between 16 and 25 years of age, in cases where the parents have not got a card.  This would be a welcome step if the Minister would permit it.  I would like to inform the House that there are so many prescribed items off the medical card list now that a card is not worth anything like what it was.  This results in some cases in doctors being forced to prescribe more expensive brands of medication.</P>
    <P>Due to lack of funding the health boards cannot develop the community services, particularly at a time when there is pressure on health boards to provide a faster bed turnover in their hospitals. <Col N="2912" /> This means that patients are being discharged from hospitals if they no longer require supervised medical and nursing treatment in the hospital.  They are discharged into the community where there is an inadequate and a completely underdeveloped community service.  The few public health nurses and social workers on the ground who work long and hard hours cannot possibly cope with the transfer of hospital and institutional care to the community.</P>
    <P>If the Minister for Health is serious and if he has care and compassion for the less well off sections of our community, he will make up the huge financial deficit in the Southern Health Board and allow the community services to be properly staffed and developed before people who are still very ill are discharged from hospital.</P>
    <P>I would also like to see relatives who live near elderly people who are ill and who reside in remote rural areas to be eligible for payment of care allowances. As the Minister may be aware, relatives, particularly those living nearby, are debarred from payment of care allowances. An unanswerable case can be made for the payment of such allowances in these circumstances as I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>The dental and ophthalmic services are certainly underfinanced.  This is a clear example of where the weak and less well off sections of our community are suffering as a result of the health cuts.</P>
    <P>In County Kerry there is an 18 month waiting period to get an examination for spectacles.  That is disgraceful.  There is now a five to six year waiting period for children for orthodontic treatment.  I believe this is equally shameful.  It is very worrying for parents, and indeed for the children themselves, to know that when an application is made for orthodontic treatment for developing young persons aged ten or 11 years they must wait five or six years before the necessary treatment can be afforded, and both children and parents know that by then permanent damage will be done.  On the other hand, those who can afford it can have the treatment carried out within a matter of <Col N="2913" /> a few months for about £1,000.  This to my mind is the unfairest cut of all to the young people of this country.</P>
    <P>Due to the failure of the Government to adequately finance the Southern Health Board, there is a lack of funds to refund to medical card holders the cost of transport to and from hospitals and clinics.  Medical card holders, who are not ambulance cases, always had this type of transport organised by the local community welfare officer but such is no longer the case.  The old, the sick and the handicapped must now provide and pay for their conveyance to hospitals and clinics, apply to the health board for a refund and, after exhaustive investigations into family circumstances over a period of months, a refund ranging from 40 to 60 per cent of the cost is then made by the health board.  Is it any wonder then that the less well off, the weakest section of our community, miss out on vital visits to clinics and hospitals and thereby put their health at a greater risk, in the very same way as a certain category of persons to whom I have already referred are forced to put their health at risk, because they cannot afford to pay for the necessary medication as prescribed by their family doctors?</P>
    <P>I wish to take this opportunity to publicly ask the Minister for Health to help the Southern Health Board to set up a unit to cater for mentally handicapped adults in County Kerry by sending down a letter of approval to the health board's application for the revenue costs of operating such a unit which is so urgently required.  The proceeds of the sale of the Old County Hospital in Tralee to Kerry County Council will provide the capital costs of this project which is to be built near Killarney.</P>
    <P>This proposed unit will cater for the adult mentally handicapped who are now being catered for in St. Mary's of the Angels, Beaufort, and are occupying accommodation which should be available to handicapped persons under 16 or 17 years of age.  There is, therefore, no centre now in County Kerry to which this handicapped section of our community can be admitted.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2914" /> To state the case briefly, St. Mary's of the Angels is full.  There is no further accommodation for adult mentally handicapped in Kerry other than St. Finian's Psychiatric Hospital which is completely unsuitable for the purpose, and consequently, also, there is no further accommodation for the young mentally handicapped.</P>
    <P>I am asking the Minister to help the handicapped, the parents and the voluntary organisations concerned, by approving of this application from the Southern Health Board for the revenue costs of operating the proposed new unit near Killarney.  This is a fair and reasonable application and I am calling on the Minister to issue the necessary approval as a matter of extreme urgency.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I am asking the Minister for Health to provide the necessary funds through the Southern Health Board to enable them to adequately finance the services I have referred to here tonight and to help the old, the sick and the handicapped.  If he cannot do so he should step down.</P>

      <P>Week after week we have had to put down Private Members' motions in an attempt to deflect this Government from pursuing the cruel objectives they are trying to achieve.  We have had cutbacks in every area, in social welfare, health and education.  When the Government are not cutting back on what people are entitled to they are closing down factory after factory, and I have no doubt that they will go down as the Government who have specialised in liquidations and closures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fortunately, as a result of the enormous pressure which we have put on the Government from this side of the House in attempting to steer them in the right direction, they have made some attempt to rescue themselves from the cruel problems they have got themselves into.  In relation to social welfare where there were problems with equality and where there was a major public outcry because thousands of families were going to have reduced payments, this evening the Government announced they would <Col N="2915" /> review the situation because of the difficulties in the light of the 1987 Estimates. While we achieved this change, the pressure we have exerted on the Government has made them look at what they are doing and realise they are doing it very badly.</P>
    <P>However, the announcement which they made this evening in relation to social welfare is only a half-hearted attempt to limit some of the hardships they have caused to 20,000 families.  It will not in any way compensate the 20,000 for the huge reductions they will suffer particularly before the Christmas period. This Government are now specialising in U-turns, twisting and turning like political gymnasts and they do not know whether they are going forwards or backwards. In their document <i>Building on Reality 1985-1987</i> the Coalition stated that the main thrust of health policy would be, &ldquo;a shift towards prevention of disease, and an emphasis on community care ensuring that scarce resources are directed more specifically towards those in greatest need.&rdquo;  That document stated further that, &ldquo;The provision of an effective home nursing service, especially in regard to care for the aged, will be a priority...&rdquo;.  This apparent concern of the Coalition for the health of the aged was voiced again by the Minister for Health on 16 May 1985 when he stated, &ldquo;Generally speaking the elderly are less well off than the rest of the population and the care of the elderly is an important issue facing the health and social services.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This rhetoric is mere humbug, as the Government's health cutbacks have ensured that many elderly people are plunged further into poverty and deprivation. At a time when the number of elderly people is increasing the Minister should increase the quota of public health nurses.  At present the public health nursing service is stretched to breaking point. It is a vital service in the care of the aged with almost 70 per cent of all patients over 65 years of age visited by the nurses. Yet, the Minister has cut back on the travelling expenses of public health <Col N="2916" /> nurses to ensure they cannot visit all the people as often as they should be visited and need to be visited.  It will become even more important in relation to the care of the aged over the next few years because by 1991 there will be an increase of some 10 per cent of people over 65 years from the present level of 369,000 old people.  It is ludicrous when the Minister is refusing not alone to increase the number of public health nurses but to replace those who resign or are on leave. It is totally contrary to the commitment in the national plan to a health system based on community care.</P>
    <P>The Coalítion have failed to provide the resources necessary to develop more day hospitals which are a vital prerequisite if a more comprehensive medical service for the elderly is to become a reality.  At the end of 1984 the Minister, while acknowledging that job losses would occur in the health services as part of the national plan, stated that all essential services would be maintained.  How wrong that commitment and that promise have turned out to be.  This pledge turned out to be meaningless.  Financial cutbacks are damaging health care and have led to a total dismantling of the health services. As far as the Minister's aim of furthering community care is concerned, the cutbacks have proved a disastrous step backwards. They have threatened the basic services on which community care must be built up.  Instead of an expansion of these basic services they are contracting, as is evident from the cutbacks in nursing homes, day hospitals, welfare homes, meals on wheels, home help for the disabled and sheltered accommodation for the disabled.  Community services and patient care clearly are being affected adversely by the policy pursued by the Minister and his colleagues in Government.</P>
    <P>Clearly, the Government have failed to heed the advice of the National Planning Board who, when recommending an annual reduction of 4 per cent in real terms in health spending between 1985 and 1987 pointed out that these savings could not and should not be made and that certainly there should be no sacrifice <Col N="2917" /> in the standard of services.  However, the board warned of the danger unless the recommendations were implemented so that the costs were borne primarily by patients and the public in general rather than through increased cost efficiency in the health system.  The Minister has failed to heed this warning.</P>
    <P>This helter-skelter approach to closing down hospitals before devising a community care framework in their place reflects a thoughtless and dangerous attitude to the provision of health care.  The Minister has consistently ignored the advice of health care professionals who have warned repeatedly that the health boards cannot effectively operate community-based care services until such time as the machinery for such services is in place.  The folly of deinstitutionalising care before the necessary facilities are in place is clear from the example of the UK where many patients have suffered tragically in a society which was unprepared to receive them.  Under the Minister the level of community care services, is going down while the burden on such services has increased as the number of dependants has grown, especially in the new suburban areas.</P>
    <P>Patient care has suffered enormously under the present Government.  Cases of seriously ill patients being accommodated in corridors have been documented, as have cases of elderly patients being discharged too early to the care of overstretched community health nurses and day care workers.  The Minister said on 24 September last, &ldquo;The transition to community care could not be made if we skimped on resources.&rdquo;  It is sad the Minister refused to take his own advice. It is clear from the GMS reports during 1985 that there has been an alarming increase in the level of illness which is attributed to unemployment.</P>
    <P>The Minister has also washed his hands of the homeless young.  Since the closure in the spring of this year of the HOPE hostel there has been an alarming increase in the number of young homeless people in Dublin.  Yet, the Minister closes his eyes and will not furnish the EHB with the modest resources required to <Col N="2918" /> establish a shelter for homeless young people and to contribute towards their reintegration into society.</P>
    <P>As regards the future direction of health policy under the present Minister, it seems unlikely that trends will be reversed during the lifetime of this Government.  The Minister indicated last week that further cutbacks in next year's health budget were on the way.  It was stated also that while money was needed in order to implement the proposed policy of moving people out of institutions and back to their communities it was unlikely that this money would be provided.  Therefore, it is clear that the Government have reneged on the central priority of their health policy, just as they have failed to fulfil their pledges on job creation, the public finances and the boosting of investment in the economy.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that history will record that the present Government and the present Minister for Health have an unparalleled record in relation to failures. The health services which we were justly proud of are being dismantled and torn apart.  Hospital wards are being closed down and unfortunate patients are being subjected to inferior treatment. These are not just my views but the views expressed by responsible medical organisations. They have also been endorsed by the insurance companies who insure doctors against claims for negligence and who have warned doctors they should not be seen to support or condone any attempt to diminish the quality of our health services.  Unfortunately, the quality of our health services has deteriorated enormously in the reign of this Government and this Minister.  Imagine now that medical card holders are supposed to be able to travel from their own homes to pick-up points if they need transport to a far away hospital.  How in the name of God can an old woman who has not even a bicycle travel six miles to the nearest pick-up point for transport to a hospital? It is disgraceful.</P>
    <P>This Government advocated to health boards during the past year that moneys allocated from the European Social Fund <Col N="2919" /> should be misappropriated: they suggested they should be used to defray the overrun in the costs because they were not provided with money.  This is a disgrace because those moneys from that European Social Fund should be used to provide workshops for those who are handicapped.  This Minister, in his usual cavalier fashion, has pursued his unworthy objectives.  He even seems to take pleasure in closing institutions.  He has condemned patients to inferior patient care.  He has closed down hospital wards.  He has rendered the community health care services more inefficient.  He has specialised in confrontation with medical and paramedical organisations. He has failed to take the expert advice of those organisations committed to providing the best possible health care service. Yet, without thought and without any show of concern he proceeded coldly and callously in the interests of fiscal rectitude to punish those who are ill.  The sick and the old will never forget the reign of this Minister.</P>

      <P>The Minister, Deputy Barry Desmond, is four years in the Department of Health and in those four years he has done more to undermine the health services and to cause anxiety and distress to poor unfortunate patients than any other Minister in the history of the State.  The Minister is the most hated and despised Minister in the eyes of the public.  Everywhere I go I see patients in distress and old people waiting in queues for attention and they say &ldquo;God forgive that heartless Minister, Barry Desmond&rdquo;.  By the time the Minister relinquishes this Ministry he will have earned the dubious honour of having added a word to the English language &mdash; to desmondise, meaning to destroy, to dismantle or to wreck.  What a mark to leave.  The Minister's attitude is a callous uncaring attitude.  He sees the problem purely as a bookkeeping problem and considers that services should be extensively pruned regardless of the misery and hardship that might bring.  We are lucky that the Minister's tenure of office <Col N="2920" /> will shortly come to an end and that at long last the public can look forward to a more humane approach to the health services.</P>
      <P>It is regrettable that the Minister lost a unique opportunity to make his mark on the Department.  The Minister lost the opportunity to show that he was a concerned, caring Minister prepared to fight his corner in the interests of those in need.  One might compare his abysmal record with that of another Minister for Health, Dr. Noel Browne, a totally inexperienced administrator who took over that Department as Minister in his first day in the Dáil.  With a sense of dedication and concern and a humane approach, in the short space of three years Dr. Browne built or renewed 7,000 hospital beds throughout Ireland and revolutionised the quality of health care here.  The Minister could not understand such concern.  What would he know about illness, hardship, pain or suffering?  The Minister had the audacity last night to castigate one of our members and say that a consultant radiologist from the South Eastern Health board had no right to speak about the economics of the health board services.  The Minister can only see a health board or hospital demand as a deficit bookkeeping entry that upsets the balance sheet and which must be rectified irrespective of the hardship likely to be caused.  He had an opportunity to apply political muscle at the Cabinet table but he might have offended his Fine Gael colleagues and the Fine Gael transfers were more important to a Labour Deputy in Dún Laoghaire than winning more money for patients' needs.  I read what the Minister said last night and I have never read such nonsense in my life. Rather then explain his case he castigated this party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will not waste the time of the House enumerating the deficits in each health board.  There was an overall deficit of up to £20 million in all the health boards up to October 5 last.  The GMS is expected to be £4 million in the red and the voluntary hospitals face overruns by as much as £6 million.  That amounts to a deficit of £30 million no matter what the Minister may <Col N="2921" /> say.  The Minister has not explained how the hospitals and health boards can carry out the new high-tech life saving operations impinging on the other less glamorous essential care services.</P>

      <P>Regardless of whether the Minister acknowledges this fact these services have suffered and the Minister has not attempted to seek the funds to rectify the situation.  It takes four or five months to get an appointment at a hospital's out-patients service.  If a man is in acute pain he will have to wait four to five months to be seen by an orthopaedic surgeon.  I challenge the Minister to say otherwise.  I have medical cases that require urgent attention and who cannot be seen in an out-patients' department until January or February.  Old people in need of hospital care and in need of nursing care have no hope of receiving care in any of the health board hospitals in the Eastern Health Board area.  The doctors are frustrated because the beds are not there and there are no homes available for the elderly who cannot manage for themselves and who require urgent attention.  Many old people who have broken their hips have been put into an orthopaedic hospital as an interim measure and then have been discharged but there is nowhere else for them to go because the Minister has done irreparable harm to the health services.  I am asking the Minister, just as he asked any Deputy in the House to come around with him to see the situation, to come on a tour with me around the hospitals and the home care services.  If I am proved wrong I will publicly apologise in this House and through the press.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no point in the Minister saying that everything is all right, that he gave funds to St. Vincent's Hospital last week. The Minister refused to disclose the amount given.  St. Vincent's Hospital got funds because they were in dire need. The Mater Hospital was put in an embarrassing position because a cheque for £500,000 was refused by the bank when <Col N="2922" /> the Department of Health refused to supply the money.  It never before happened in the history of the State that a hospital the size of the Mater should have its cheque for staff wages, social welfare and PAYE dishonoured by the bank.  All the talk of the Minister will not refute this fact.  It only happened under this Minister.  The sooner he is removed from office the better so far at the interests of the country are concerned.  There are many things which the Minister could have done for the hospital services without money, but he antagonised the medical profession and indeed the whole hospital services.  Everywhere he went he created carnage; he cannot touch anything without destroying it.  The Minister talks about community care and then closes down the hospitals without making community care available.  He has done more harm to this country than any other Minister.  When I wrote to the Minister detailing a very serious case of a man with irreparable brain damage he did not even afford me the courtesy of a reply until I said three months later, that I would expose him in the Dáil.  Then I got a reply from the Department saying they would look into the case.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Health appears to have raised the hackles of the major Opposition party but men of courage tackling difficult Departments run that risk.  On behalf of the Minister I should like to dispel any fears about the funding of our health service.  We have the youngest population in Europe and in 1973-74 the expenditure on health was of the order of £143 million or about 5.2 per cent gross national product.  The approved level of expenditure in 1986 is of the order of £130 million, the vast majority of which <Col N="2923" /> is paid by the taxpayer.  That represents 7.1 per cent of GNP which puts us practically at the top of the European league. For many months we have been bombarded with statements that a cash crisis is looming in the health service, if it is not already here.  One forecast indicated that one health board would run out of money in October.  This has not happened. Opposition Members also said that certain agencies would not be in a position to pay people in December but this has not happened&mdash;&mdash;</P>

We got approval from the Minister on several occasions to advertise for the appointment of an orthondontist but we could not get one.  In many cases the fault does not lie with the Minister and in certain urgent cases private practice was used to deal with certain queries. The doomsday forecasts are ill informed and the crisis cited by the Opposition does not exist.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Health expenditure is funded by cash and approved overdraft, periodically requested, as Deputies are aware.  In the current year, by means of a more efficient cash management system, the Department have monitored the funding requirements of health boards on a daily basis.  By proper management of the system, health board overdraft levels, which were at a peak on 31 December 1985, were brought down to sustainable levels in January of this year and maintained at that level since.  As late as last Thursday, health boards were working at less than half the current approved levels of overdraft.  These are very modest levels which are rarely reached.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I share Deputy McCarthy's concern <Col N="2924" /> about the HOPE hostel in Dublin.  I also worry about young people.  They are my particular responsibility in the Department of Education.  The Minister for Health appointed a task force with a month's time limit a fortnight ago because delays were experienced in this area by the Eastern Health Board. Money has been assured in respect of the setting up of a hostel and it is hoped to establish it within a month.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that and it was because of delays experienced by the health board that a task force were set up with a specific time limit on it.  The Department will continue to monitor funding on a daily basis and they know what is needed between now and the end of the year.  They have a package in place which will meet the demand.  The position in relation to voluntary hospitals and other agencies has also been covered. Where, therefore, is the Armageddon put forward by members of the Opposition in relation to the health service?  I know they have tried to portray Minister Desmond as the hate figure of the Government.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred many times to the need for a shift in emphasis in demands and expectations of the health service.  The essential thrust of the service in the immediate future will be directed towards measures to promote health and to prevent illness, the provision of suitable services on a community or outpatient basis to bring about a redistribution away from institutional services and the closure of outmoded institutional facilities in tandem with the commissioning of large, cost effective flagship hospitals which will be in a position to respond to the acute hospital needs of the population.  I refer to places like Mullingar, Longford and Castlebar.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The maintenance of a range of care and welfare services is required with particular reference to children at risk, the needs of disabled and other disadvantaged persons and the increasing <Col N="2925" /> of the efficiency and effectiveness of all services.  Sufficient resources are available and will be used to meet whatever demands the health service have.  Therefore, I have no hesitation in commending the motion to the House.</P>

      <P>The essential health services for the poor, the old, the sick and the handicapped are no longer available because of the wholesale cutbacks in allocations to the health boards.  Over the past four years the Government made a callous, vicious and cowardly attack on the less well off sections of society.  The health service is in a shambles and the South Eastern Health Board are in such a serious financial position that they are seeking overdraft facilities for £7.5 million from the Minister.  If they do not get this approval many services in their area will have to close.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an 18 months to two years wait for dental treatment in the area and those on medical cards or who are unemployed are forced to take their children to private dentists at a cost per visit of £13 which they cannot afford.  The children of the poor, the unemployed and the underprivileged are neglected by the Government. Medical cards are being withdrawn from people despite the fact that they may be only slightly over the income limit.  The PAYE sector, the backbone of the economy, are being victimised. The amount of take home pay and not gross pay should be taken for medical <Col N="2926" /> card purposes.  There is a two to three year wait for hip operations.  The facilities are inadequate.</P>
    <P>Asthma sufferers are the forgotten people.  No one seems to care about them.  In my four years in the House Deputy O'Hanlon is the only person I heard referring to them.  Asthma sufferers should be automatically entitled to have, under the medical services, whatever medication they need.  In many families two or three people are suffering from asthma and, as a result of the high cost of drugs, find it very difficult to make ends meet.  It is the greatest scandal of all time that such families are not entitled to free treatment.  Asthma is a long term illness and should be included in this context. The Minister stated recently that it would cost £10 million to include such sufferers in the long term scheme. However, I contend that his figures are not accurate as he is not taking the refund scheme into account.  It would cost a very small amount to include asthma sufferers in the drug card scheme.</P>

      <P>The case has been well made for the motion on this side of the House but the Minister failed to deal with any of the serious issues raised.  The two Ministers of State and Deputy Manning also failed to deal with any of them tonight.</P>
      <P>Deputy Kenny said &mdash; and I am sure he is correct &mdash; that only half the current level of overdraft is being used at present by health boards but he did not say that the health boards doubled their overdraft facilities in the past year.  Indeed, when Deputy Ormonde referred to that last night he was abused by the Minister. Deputy Ormonde told us that the South Eastern Health Board now needed facilities of £7.5 million where formerly a sum of £3 million was sufficient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fundamental issue is the funding of the health services at present and the huge deficit which the Government have allowed to arise &mdash; £30 million.  I challenge the Minister to state that there is not a crisis looming in that health board. Will he also say if there are any difficult negotiations taking place with the banks <Col N="2927" /> at present if the banks have been to the Government in recent times and if some banks have written to the health boards to say they are no longer interested in being treasurers of their accounts?  I should like the Minister to come clean in this House and tell us if that is so.</P>
    <P>I should like to know the cost of the increased overdraft facilities and what they are going to cost each year.  It is easy for the Minister to talk about how he monitors cashflow on a Monday but how does he monitor what is happening to the people about whom we are concerned? He told me last night when I informed him about the case of a man who has a potentially serious illness and who has lost his job that he would set up an inquiry.  He uses a big stick if we raise any of these cases.  Not alone will he have an inquiry in his Department but he will have inquiries in the Departments of Labour and the Public Service.  The Minister knows, I know and every Member of this House knows what will be the result of that inquiry.  It will be that due to the cutbacks that man has had to wait 13 weeks more than was necessary for his outpatient appointment.  That is not an isolated case, as the Minister would have us believe.  I will quote to him tonight another letter dated 28 May 1986 which says:</P>
    <P>As your name has been on the waiting list to see the County Surgeon since September 1985, please let me know if you still need this appointment or if you wish to cancel it.</P>
    <P>That is what is happening as a result of the cutbacks.  Neither the Minister nor any of the Deputies who spoke from the Government side dealt with that matter. Each of them in turn told us there was an increase of 29 per cent in the current allocation over the past three years.  The Minister in reply to a question in this House on 12 November stated that there is no evidence of any disimprovement in services during the period in question but he gave me information on 15 February last year that there has been a real decrease in the allocation to health <Col N="2928" /> boards.  This was confirmed in the most recent report by the NESC which stated that in 1985 the real level of spending was below the 1982 level.  It is quite clear there has been a decrease in real terms in the amount of money allocated to the health services.  It is a &ldquo;whitewash&rdquo; to tell us there has been a massive increase in spending on services.  Despite the fact that there has been an increase in the population and an increase in demand for services, there has been a decrease in real terms mainly because of the Government's economic policies.</P>
    <P>There have been ward closures.  The Taoiseach in this House said there was no need for ward closures.  I should like once again to ask the Minister whether he or his officials went to the health boards to tell them they had to close wards?  Staff who have gone on holidays or sick leave have not been replaced. Nurses in the community are doing double duty despite the early discharge of patients from hospital.  The Government give only lip service to the development of community care services.  Both the Taoiseach and the Minister have complained in this House about travelling expenses.  They must realise that if we are going to have proper development of community care services there will be increased travel expenses as there will be more nurses and personnel working in the community.</P>
    <P>No one on the Government side of the House referred to the dental services.  I should like to quote a letter I received dated 4 November which states as follows:</P>
    <P>I wish to refer further to your representations on behalf of ...... who is awaiting dental treatment.  The situation at the moment is that there is no dental treatment for adults or secondary school children due to the suspension of the <i>ad hoc</i> dental scheme.</P>
    <P>That is an indictment of the Government and of the Members who sit behind the Government who have accepted that situation.  The Minister did not explain the logic of people having their x-rays <Col N="2929" /> and blood tests carried out in the city centre and then having to travel out to Beaumont Hospital to be seen by a physician or a surgeon.  Where is the logic in that decision?  If the Government open a small unit in Beaumont for the purpose of appointing a new hospital board composed of the Minister's friends and election workers, Fianna Fáil in Government will disestablish such a board.  Beaumont is a major general hospital and the board must be composed of properly qualified people.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister of State when he says we have built up over the years an excellent service for the mentally handicapped.  No one on that side of the House dealt with the serious issue I raised last night which is that young mentally handicapped adults are being sent home day after day to parents who are unable to cope with them because of age and infirmity.  I am aware of a case where a girl had to give up her job as a manageress in a firm in this city to go home to look after her mentally handicapped adult sister because her parents were unable to cope.  That is only one case and I could quote many others.  The only thing I learned from the Minister last night was that he did not like our posters.  The reason he does not like them is because they tell the truth.  There is a better way than the way the Minister is behaving.</P>
    <P>Deputy Briscoe last night raised the major policy statement which was made at Dromoland Castle, on the abolition of health boards and the centralisation of services but the Minister did not deal with these matters.  I understand we are going to have one health board from Carlingford Lough to Carnsore Point, that the Department are going to have a more pivotal role.  What is going to happen to the traditional input of the local statutory bodies and the voluntary bodies in the decision-making process?  Is it Government policy to centralise administration? Is it Labour policy?  Is it Fine Gael policy to devolve administration for local authorities and for education?  All this is an indication of the confusion which exists between the parties in this Government. The Minister when talking about the <Col N="2930" /> health boards last night said he questioned the extent to which our health board system seems to have the capacity to throw up data as if it were the truth and subsequently tries to embellish that into the absolute truth.  It is a disgrace for the Minister for Health, as it was a disgrace for the Taoiseach, to come into this House and cast a slur on officials of the health boards.  The politics of confrontation which have been the hallmark of this Minister since he came to office is a disgrace.  Health board members, the CEOs, and all those working in the service have made great efforts to deal with the difficult situation created by the Government over the past four years. What thanks did they get?  All they got was abuse from the Taoiseach when he talked in this House about the hyped-up politics of the Western Health Board and the South-Eastern Health Board.  He went on to say that the CEO of the Southern Health Board had produced fictitious figures and knew they were fictitious. What way is that for a Government to treat their officials around the country?</P>
    <P>The morale of the personnel of the health boards is at its lowest ebb at every level of the service.  With Fianna Fáil in Government consultation and not confrontation will be the order of the day. Fianna Fáil have a caring social policy. We are committed to the promotion of good health, the prevention of illness, the development of community services, more opportunities for the elderly to be cared and treated in their own communities, the provision of an adequate dental and optician service and the implementation of the recommendations in the document on psychiatry <i>Planning for the Future</i>.  It was very interesting to listen to the Minister of State, Deputy Pattison, talking about that document tonight but the Minister on 30 January announced in this House that he was going to close the hospitals in Carlow and Castlerea.  The first time the people involved heard this was on their radio at home.  The Minister started on the last page of the document and he discredited what is an excellent document.  That document states that there should be a <Col N="2931" /> phased programme of development over ten to 15 years.  That is how Fianna Fáil will approach that document and not as the Minister did by first announcing in the House that he was going to close the hospitals.</P>
    <P>We will carry out a review of the various drug schemes, the long-term illness scheme, the refund of drugs scheme and we will look for improved out-patients facilities.  Much of this could have been done over the past few years without any major increase in expenditure.  It would have been done if the Minister had not adopted his policy of confrontation.  The Members of our party are sensitive to the needs of the sick, the elderly and the handicapped.  We know that health care is expensive and we are concerned with the high level of taxation in the State but the people who are paying taxes are not <Col N="2932" /> complaining about providing essential services for the less well-off.</P>
    <P>In Government we will discharge what is the responsibility of any civilised Government, to ensure that the necessary level of health service is provided.  I call on the Minister to take the necessary action now to ensure the survival of our health services.  I should like to ask the Deputies opposite to vote with us on this issue.  They will not bring down the Government if they vote with us on a Private Members' Motion but such an action will show that there is some concern on the Government side of the House for the less well-off who are now feeling the harsh and savage effects of the cutbacks brought about by the Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the need for security where visitors are concerned but I do not accept the points made.  If the Committee on Procedure and Privileges <Col N="2937" /> have done this, I believe they have been wrong in so doing.</P>
      <P>Regarding the transport Bill, the Minister who is in the House is the wrong Minister to handle any changes in any State body and I hope that the end for CIE will not be like the end of Irish Shipping or comparable to the dreadful cutbacks in B &amp; I.  CIE over the years have come in for immense criticism.  They have been ridiculed on occasion, usually most unfairly.  The vast majority of those who work in that large and diverse enterprise are committed to doing their best to serve the public.  Like every other organisation, CIE have their weaknesses and strengths.  Of course there is always need for improvement, especially in a very large organisation.</P>
      <P>I support the view expressed by our party spokesman that dividing CIE into three separate parts is not the way to go ahead.  He has advanced arguments as to why it should be broken up into two parts.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to one aspect which has not yet been mentioned.  I was approached recently by people who work in Ethiopia among the underprivileged. They have approached CIE, the Taoiseach and, I presume, the Minister with a view to getting some of the old or obsolete rolling stock for use in Ethiopia. Although this stock may no longer be considered railworthy here, I understand it would serve the need there and would prove adequate.  I thought this was an excellent idea because I appreciate we cannot always meet the needs of the Third World from our resources.  Can the Minister tell me whether there is some obsolete rolling stock and perhaps some road vehicles that could be shipped to the Third World to help the many missionaries, lay and religious, who are working so hard in trying to provide and distribute food to the starving millions?</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Not being an expert I cannot answer that, but I received that request this week.  These people had gone to the Taoiseach and they thought he received them very sympathetically, but a wall of silence <Col N="2938" /> developed from there.  That is not unusual, from what I hear my colleagues say about the performance of this Government.  We experienced it earlier during the debate on health.</P>
      <P>The structure of CIE has its weaknesses and strengths but CIE, to their credit, have something that most other State boards do not have.  I refer to their decentralised type of operation.  One of the most unfortunate developments is the over-centralisation of Government and the siting of the headquarters of so many State boards in our capital city.  Many of them should have their headquarters elsewhere.  There is a need for decentralisation of many of the boards under the aegis of this Minister.  CIE have decentralised their structure more than any other board.  I hope the Minister will encourage decentralisation as a policy to be pursued by the new boards, of which I hope there will be two.</P>
      <P>I am not being parochial when I talk about Cork since I know it better than anybody else.  Centralised Government are often inclined to forget that Cork is more than 160 miles from Dublin, while the Beara Peninsula is more than 110 miles from Cork.  The difficulty of access from the capital to the south-west or <i>vice versa</i> is often forgotten by our administration. This Government have fallen completely into the trap of over-centralisation, something which we in future decades will pay dearly for.  Our decentralisation plan was scrapped because, we were told, it was too expensive.  It is far more expensive not to implement it and the sooner it is done the better.  In the restructuring of CIE I hope care will be taken to ensure that the regions will be remembered and that the structures will be as decentralised as possible.</P>
      <P>There is an <i>esprit de corps</i> among CIE workers and they play a supportive role to many of their less favoured colleagues. This is a credit to them, but it is often forgotten by others.  I have personal experience of how loyal the employees of that company can be and the excellent role they perform in difficult times for their colleagues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One can refer to the Cork-Dublin rail <Col N="2939" /> service, of which I have much experience, as ranking among the finest in Europe. Unfortunately there are many other aspects of the rail service which leave a lot to be desired.  This Minister has presided over many things.  We are at present buying buses which are made abroad although in Shannon a suitable plant still stands idle, another monument to a Government with no commitment to employment.  This is a tragedy because the expertise is there, the equipment and factory all there and the need is great. The Fianna Fáil posters are criticised because they carried the message that there is a better way, and that is what I believe.</P>
    <P>We are told that tourism will be one of our expanding activities up to the year 2000.  Some of the activities in which CIE are engaged are closely related to tourism and this has led to competition.  The coach tours being organised by CIE in competition with other operators are an outstanding success.  We must encourage such a move.  CIE must develop their services to get the greatest benefit from the tourists who are attracted to our shores.  There are many reasons for the tourist industry not being as successful as it might be.  The distribution network is very important.  We must be able to provide services at reasonable prices and of reasonable standards.</P>
    <P>Even today there is still no ferry into Cork harbour from the British mainland. In that regard the Government were &ldquo;Mickey Mousing&rdquo; with a few hundred thousand pounds too late.  A ferry is an essential starting point, whether it is operated by CIE or anybody else.  I do not mind.  If there is a mix of public and private enterprise all the better, but there must be a ferry and buses to collect the passengers and carry them where they wish to go in the Cork and Kerry region. Today I heard some Government backbenchers criticise the service available in County Cork on the grounds that it is very inadequate.</P>
    <P>I am not criticising the subvention to CIE because I believe they are providing <Col N="2940" /> a very important social service, an aspect which all too often is forgotten.  Admittedly, this service must be improved and there must be a more businesslike approach ensuring that transport will be available at the most suitable time for passengers.  I believe CIE have many advantages over other operators.  If I were talking about Aer Lingus I would tell the House of the shameless neglect by this company of the Cork region.  I cannot explain how the flights times are decided, but the company will say that statistics prove they are providing the service at the most suitable times.  We cannot prove they are wrong simply because there are no statistics showing the number of people who leave the night before because the morning flight times are not suitable.  Admittedly, the position is not as bad so far as CIE are concerned but they must maximise their services to suit demand.</P>
    <P>The need for competition in the provision of a road freight service is obvious and it is important that there be competition because private enterprise has done a great deal of good in that area.  I understand the CIE road freight service has not been a success in some areas, but is has been extremely successful in Cork. There are a very committed hard working group of people involved in this service. I can see this operation expanding rather than contracting and we should give it every encouragement.  I would like the Minister to give me an assurance that road freight will be given a priority in one of the companies and that there will be no question of writing off the road freight service, as many of his collegues would like him to do.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am entitled to ask the Minister what he is doing about road freight.  If he is testy at this hour of the night.  I cannot be blamed for the difficult party meeting he had today nor for the fact that the Deputies behind him are getting more and more unhappy.  That <Col N="2941" /> is his problem.  I want an assurance that the road freight service in my area will be maintained and given priority because this Government have done a great deal of damage to Cork.  I can see them writing off the Cork road freight operation. Therefore I want to guarantee that the operation will continue, that it will be expanded if possible and that it will be able to compete fairly with private contractors.</P>
      <P>It is fine to have a rail or road distribution service, but our population is small and the imbalance is becoming more obvious.  The projections for Dublin for the year 2000 are frightening. There will be too many people there and they will be taken from the provinces, whether north or south.  All these imbalances will mean that it will be more difficult for a transport company to operate and the social need will become greater. If the transport infrastructure in one of these regions is diminished, it will be the region which will suffer ultimately.  That must be borne in mind.</P>
      <P>Our spokesman, Deputy Wilson, dealt more than adequately with the CIE subvention and the playacting that appeared with the Government handlers telling us CIE were in profit for the first time.  How silly, how schoolboyish can one be?  I am not criticising the subvention, but what has changed?  There has been an accounting change.  This year CIE got a subvention as they did last year and other years.  This Government starved of good news tried to give the impression that Minister Mitchell had acquired the Midas touch and that subdenly CIE had made a profit.  That was far from the truth.  If I had read that during my school days in <i>Our Boys,</i> It would probably have been in the column under &ldquo;Smiles&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to delay the House but I want to take this opportunity to say that CIE have had problems in the area of industrial relations.  I want to compliment my colleague, Deputy Wilson, for the painstaking way he faced a number of difficult problems and began to plough the furrow which is now so much easier for the Minister.  In his time Deputy <Col N="2942" /> Wilson acquired a fine knowledge of the difficulties in this area.  His trade union experience and his approach to life made him the ideal person to try to tease out the difficulties which would result from any changes in CIE &mdash; and there is no doubt changes are needed.</P>
    <P>I am glad workers are being given an important role to play in the operations of a diverse company like CIE.  They will have many valuable suggestions as to where improvements might be effected, working in co-operation with management. Industrial relations have been a major problem which can be put down to many reasons not least of which is the number of unions operating within the company.  It is a multi-union structure with diverse interests for many members because of the type of operations CIE carry out.  No doubt there are other contributory factors.  I am sure there is also the frustration of Dublin city bus drivers &mdash; that has to be a frustrating experience &mdash; all day, every day, coping with very heavy traffic.  Indeed the same can be said of Cork city, smaller, but unfortunately, a city prominent at present for its filth.  The Government have almost turned a blind eye on the problem there.  However that is nothing strange in the performance of this Government over the past four years.</P>
    <P>I support our spokesman when he said he favoured the establishment of two companies rather than three, and that after mature and serious consideration having been given to the matter.  The Minister is not the man to be handling companies of this nature.  He seems to have a determination to wipe out the public sector, a strange mind for a man who, at one time, used to boast of such a strong trade union connection in the city of Dublin.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>A point arises from what the previous speaker said and perhaps the Minister might take it up with the people who matter in Government, that is the fact that the Eastern Region Development Organisation have undertaken a study indicating that there has been a massive increase in the population <Col N="2943" /> of the greater Dublin area which, as far as I can ascertain, does not address itself at all to the whole question of transport infrastructure in that area.  Although other regional development organisations have carried out similar studies around the country, in response to a question of mine to the Government I was told there was no co-ordination of these studies and no co-ordinated response to them.  It seems extraordinary to have these studies going on and projections being made without there being any coherent approach to the whole question of regional development.</P>
      <P>If I might address myself to the question of public transport, it has to be accepted &mdash; and I am sure the Minister will accept &mdash; there is no possibility of a comprehensive public transport service being provided by the private sector.  CIE exist because of the failure of private companies in the past &mdash; in the thirties in particular &mdash; to provide such a service. The State had to step in to take over because of the utter chaos obtaining on account of the operations of private bus operators at that time.  There is clearly no possibility whatsoever of the private sector taking over CIE railways.  We will have spokesmen for PAMBO clamouring for routes in the Dublin city area and, presumably, profitable routes in other cities, demanding that they should have a share, but they have never indicated that they are prepared to take on the loss-making routes as well as the profitable ones.  The effect of handing over such routes to them would be that the State would still have to carry the can and be responsible for a truncated service, with no co-ordination and, more than likely, the subvention required by the State would be greater in the long run.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill before us has been fairly significantly amended in the Seanad in many important respects.  Many of the objections voiced in relation to the original Bill were met by the Minister to some extent. I know that workers in CIE describe the whole approach in the original Bill &mdash; and I think many would be of the same opinion today of the present Bill &mdash; that it <Col N="2944" /> constituted simply the recommendations of the McKinsey report being introduced under another guise.  I tend to agree with that view.  The point has been made by the workforce and others that there does not appear to be any valid case for splitting up CIE into separate companies. There is no reason whatsoever that CIE could not have been reorganised on a rational basis without the necessity for introducing the type of Bill originally introduced or that is now before us.  That is the fundamental objection to the Bill: unless the long term objective is to hive off parts of CIE more easily into the private sector, then there is no other valid reason for its introduction because the reorganisation of CIE under public control could have been done without it. That is not to deny the points made in the Seanad which have led to its improvement. The Minister is to be congratulated for having accepted many of the points made by those who opposed the Bill in its original form but the basic objection remains valid.</P>
    <P>The point made in relation to splitting up provincial bus and rail services is a case in point.  There are so many points at which these services cross, there are so many aspects of the services shared by both, it does not seem to make sense to split them up.  In my view it can only lead not to a cheaper service but to a whole range of duplication of facilities for both services.</P>
    <P>The Minister has indicated he will ensure that the majority of board members are common to both companies. That does not overcome the fundamental objection to the problem which could arise in relation to the duplication of facilities, staffing, accounting and so on.  There is a very strong suspicion among the staff of CIE that the real reason for this Bill is to render it easier to hive off parts of CIE into the private sector.  Staff numbers have already been reduced from 20,000 to 14,000.  I am told that there was no consultation at all with the unions before the Bill was published. The union representatives still object to the method proposed to be used to establish the new companies under existing <Col N="2945" /> company law.  They argue &mdash; and I think they have a strong case &mdash; that it will make it much easier to liquidate some of them in the future if that is felt to be necessary.  We must be reminded of the ease with which it appears Irish Shipping Limited were done away with virtually overnight.  There is a need to defend CIE against unreasonable and generalised attacks.  Unfortunately I have to say that although, indirectly at any rate, Members of this House are ultimately responsible for CIE, many of the attacks on the company emanate from them.  This is despite the fact that many of them are dependent to some extent on the fact that they can have influence on the services being provided by CIE and can gain kudos from that fact with their constituents.  Many of those who are most noisy in their criticisms of CIE are representatives of private transport operators.  I am not talking about Members of this House.  Many of these private transport operators are only interested in getting their hands on the profitable routes and have no interest whatsoever in serving the wider transport needs of the community.</P>
    <P>A point which must also be borne in mind in relation to CIE's rail services is that they have, over the past ten years, become one of the more efficient services in Europe.  From a study published on international railway economics by Dr. C. A. Nash of Leeds University it has been shown that our services are more efficient than either the British or the German services.  That is something of which both CIE and Members of this House should be proud.  I ask the Minister to indicate in his response to this debate what he proposes to do with the tourist section of CIE which is a very profitable section.  What will be done with Rosslare Harbour which is also under the auspices of CIE and is also a profitable service?  I ask the Minister to indicate what commitment he or his Government have to the extension of the DART service. The service which exists at present has been shown to be a successful service. Unfortunately, it serves a section of the city which is not necessarily the one which <Col N="2946" /> is most in need of such a service.  Nevertheless, it is reaching its targets.  If we are serious about having a modern transport infrastructure for a major city, there is a need to seriously consider the extension of that service.  Tallaght is an obvious point to which the DART service should be extended.</P>
    <P>In the original plans produced by CIE they intended extending the service to a wide range of points around the city and many wayleaves were already provided for this service.  I ask the Minister to indicate what plans or what commitment he has to ensure the extension of that service to the areas which are most populous. Tallaght is an obvious example. Blanchardstown, Finglas, Ballymun and Clondalkin are also areas which would, if the service was extended to them, make the whole operation far more profitable and far more efficient.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to another point in relation to CIE, a point which is fundamental to the whole question of our approach to public transport and that is the extraordinary way in which CIE bus fares continue to rise.  This has a direct bearing on the drop in passenger numbers travelling with CIE.  It now costs a family of two adults and two children approximately £5 to get from the outer suburbs of Dublin into the city centre and back out again.  That is an extraordinary cost for many thousands of families who do not have transport of their own.  If they can afford to buy a car they cannot afford to run it.  We must seriously address ourselves to the whole question of the fare structures and fare levels so that those for whom the public transport system should be primarily provided, those who cannot afford to provide their own private transport, should be encouraged to use it as often as possible.  This would have a spin-off effect because those of us who have our own private transport would be encouraged to use CIE buses and trains.</P>
    <P>On a number of occasions I have asked the manager of the Dublin city services to introduce a pilot scheme in the Finglas area.  Buses which travel from the terminus in Finglas West or Finglas East <Col N="2947" /> heading towards Finglas village are more often than not completely empty in midmorning. The buses pass dozens of women with young children walking up to two miles into the village to do their shopping.  It would make sense, and I have made this case with the manager, for CIE to introduce a cheap fare, a 10p or 20p fare, for that run from the outer termini in Finglas into the village.  It would generate additional income.  The response I got from the manager is that he is obliged under the terms of reference given by the Minister to CIE to ensure that the fares relate to the economic cost of the service.  It does not make sense that we can have a special rate for shoppers travelling from Parnell Square across to George's Street mid-mornings on weekdays and it is not possible to provide the same kind of cheap fare for women in the main &mdash; there are men also &mdash; who are passed every morning of the week by empty buses heading in their direction. They cannot afford to pay £1 to get to the shops.  There is a need to look at the whole position.</P>
    <P>It is clear from that point that I do not accept that CIE are a perfect organisation or that there are no inefficiencies and no waste in CIE.  I believe that there is, and to a large extent it is as a result of historical interferences with CIE by various Ministers and politicians who seemed to think in years past that CIE was their playground and they could place people in jobs and interfere in promotions and so on.  I hope that day is past and CIE can be run effectively and efficiently by effective and efficent managers. I hope that waste and inefficiencies are cut out and that services which the people need are provided.  There would have been no growth in the private bus services which leave Parnell Square and O'Connell Street every week-end for the provinces if CIE had been permitted by top management to be flexible enough to respond to the market needs that exist there.  It is not possible for private bus owners to provide the kind of comprehensive service which is needed in this State.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2948" /> I wish to refer to some points which have been brought to my attention by staff in CIE who are concerned with the direction in which things are going in regard to this Bill.  The points made are mainly that problems are arising and will arise because of the contents of this Bill in relation to the demoralisation of staff. They do not feel that they are getting the commitment, the back-up and the security that they need from this Bill to ensure that they give as much of their services as possible to the company. There is a possibility of duplication or even triplication of some staff positions in the companies it is proposed to establish and that will have the effect of worsening the efficiency of the transport system rather than improving it.  Interdepartmental movement of personnel, difficult though it is to achieve at the moment, will be virtually impossible if separate companies are established.  That development, too, would make it impractical to split up shared office locations, buildings and facilities and would result in various systems of auditing and accounting being duplicated.</P>
    <P>One of the submissions made to me by one of the unions involved was that in regard to staff problems, it was generally felt that the considerable funds going on consultants' fees which seem to be readily available could be more advantageously used in motivating staff at all levels and that this motivation could take the form of greater dispersal of information regarding policy, combined meetings, discussions and endeavours by management, workers and unions to face common problems and competition, to improve image, secure more business, recruit lost business and improve the lot of all.  That indicates that the staff of CIE are willing and anxious to help in the development of an efficient and profitable service &mdash; in so far as that is possible with a public transport system.  The manner in which this Bill is re-organising CIE is wrong.  Unless we change the Bill drastically it can only lead to problems in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>There is absolutely <Col N="2949" /> no necessity for the three companies, Dublin Bus, Irish Bus and Irish Rail under the holding company of CIE.  This could be done quite adequately with two companies.  We have to accept that Dublin Bus is necessary and we would be in favour of that.  But Irish Bus and Irish Rail should not be two separate companies but an Irish bus-rail company.</P>
      <P>With two companies there would be an unnecessary duplication of services with additional costs in the running of the two companies and there would be competition between the two.  The Minister may have suggested, when Deputy De Rossa was speaking, that this would not happen but there would be an extra management structure, additional jobs for white collar workers, additional jobs in middle management and in top management, possibly at the expense of those we should be considering most for jobs, those at the bottom of the scale.</P>
      <P>I would like, in the few minutes available to me, to refer to transportation in my county of Donegal.  Most people in my county would agree with me that in the early days of this century there was a much better transportation service in County Donegal than there is today.  In those days we had the Lough Swilly Railway Company and the Great Northern Railway and one could travel from Dublin to the extreme west of Donegal, to Burtonport, for instance, by train. Those trains were used to export fish, particularly salmon, from there to Derry and then on to Belfast.  The fish was then transported from Larne to Stranraer, and then on the train down to Billingsgate market in London.  That is not possible now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When that era was terminated some decades ago we were given the distinct impression in Donegal that we would not be at a loss as a result of this but we certainly have lost over those decades. We were led to believe that more finance would be made available in County Donegal for the improvement of our roads and infrastructure generally.  That has not happened.  Indeed, the roads in my county, apart from the national primary road which is being grant aided by <Col N="2950" /> Europe, have not been improved since then.  It was a sad day for our county when this era of the rail service within the county was terminated.</P>
    <P>No extra finance was made available then and no extra finance is being made available now to our county.  While other counties can avail of a rail service throughout the country, to west Mayo and Galway, to Limerick, right down to Kerry, we do not have any such link. The Government should take this into consideration.  While we are being deprived of a service the rest of the country is very fortunate to have, we should be given equal treatment at least financially to try to improve our roads and infrastructure in Donegal.</P>
    <P>CIE cannot help us in west Donegal to import the necessary raw materials to the industrial estate in Derrybeg.  They cannot help us with the transport service to export our fish from Burtonport and Killybegs.  Indeed, CIE are unable to help us with a roll-on roll-off refrigerated service. In this field we are about 20 years behind the times.  It only dawned on us how necessary this was when many of the private companies, particularly in Northern Ireland, provided this service.  CIE should have been more far seeing.  They, too, would have had the money at that stage to purchase refrigerated containers and tractors.  They should have been providing this service from the west to Europe and Britain.</P>
    <P>We have two sea ferry crossings to Europe where the main markets are but that is an expensive way to export from the west.  Because our county is so isolated it is an added cost on our overheads. We are receiving no benefit whatever. Indeed, were it not for our proximity to Northern Ireland which gives us the advantage of being able to get to Larne more quickly to use the ferry, we would hardly be noticed.  It is sad that one can leave Waterford, travel to the north east, take a ferry crossing from Larne to Stranraer and drive to London more cheaply than if one leaves the north west and uses CIE services to a point of exit to go further afield.</P>
    <P>If these companies go ahead they <Col N="2951" /> should, even at this late stage, take a serious look at the possibility of providing a good roll-on roll-off service from this country to the various parts of Europe. Small private contractors go regularly to Greece from here.  They are giving a service. I am fearful that CIE could not compete with these contractors.  If that is the case there should be some advantage given to these private hauliers by way of a refund of VAT, for instance, to allow them to compete with the roll-on roll-off service from the north eastern part of Ireland and the many who come in from the Continent picking up loads for the return journey.  I suggest we do that because even at this stage we cannot compete with them.  We are 20 years behind, and the Minister as a member of the Government should consider a refund of VAT for these companies.</P>
    <P>After the budget last year there was a refund of VAT for coach tour operators. Unfortunately, that seemed to have been designed for CIE only because only coaches with a height of 3.5 metres were eligible for this.  That was absolute discrimination against the many coach tour operators who had to purchase expensive coaches.  The yardstick of cost should have been applied instead of the yardstick of height.  The smallest coach eligible had to be 10 metres in length by 3.5 metres. Anyone who wanted to avail of this had to purchase a coach which was that little bit more expensive and at the end of of the day it was no advantage to those operators.  If it was designed for CIE and CIE had an input into it then it was a shrewd move on their part but it was detrimental to these other people who wanted to improve the standard of their touring coaches but were not on a par with CIE.</P>
    <P>The north and west of County Donegal have been serviced by the Lough Swilly Railway Company.  I believe a substantial subsidy is being paid to this company by the Department.  I am worried because I have never been able to establish whether the Department or CIE have contingency plans to go into operation in the event of this private company withdrawing this <Col N="2952" /> service.  They are giving a road passenger service, a freight service and a school bus service.  Maybe the contingency plans are there, but if they are I would like to hear that from the Minister either tonight or at some stage in the next few weeks.  The fears of many people in the county would be allayed if that information could be made available.  That company are doing extremely well with this subsidy and with the payments from social welfare because of free travel.</P>
    <P>I ask that CIE, whether by their new bus service or their bus cum rail service, give consideration to the part of the country north of the line from Galway to Dublin.  It is generally accepted that while we get some CIE touring coaches in the county we do not get our fair share of them.  Part of the reason for this is the condition of the roads in the county.  CIE cannot be blamed for that, but the Minister here is responsible for CIE and will be responsible for the new companies and the holding company.  He should use his influence to try to impress on the Minister for the Environment that he should assist us by providing finance for the roads when we have not got the rail service the rest of the country enjoys.</P>
    <P>The taxpayers are contributing quite an amount of their income each year to service CIE.  It is not right that the people of my county should be asked to contribute towards this while we are obtaining absolutely nothing in return.  I do not think the Minister or any previous Minister could suggest that Donegal was getting its fair share from CIE or from the Department of Communications.  When CIE decide that the buses are not good enough for the other counties they send them up to Donegal.  The private bus owners in Donegal can provide a service to Dublin at less than £10 while CIE's charge is twice that.  It is sad to see CIE buses leaving Donegal and Letterkenny and coming to Dublin.  They cannot compete with these other people who are giving a service, not merely for the sake of doing so but to make a profit.  If they can do it at the price they charge why cannot CIE do it?  In speaking on a transport Bill I must compliment those people. <Col N="2953" /> Were it not for the service they have given over the years people in Donegal would have been much the worse off.  In our county we have little to thank CIE or the Department of Communications for with regard to transportation.</P>
    <P>I must compliment the management at Stranorlar who are responsible for the school bus service in the county.  They do an excellent job there.  They are the only management in this sector with whom we have direct contact and it would be remiss of me if I did not refer to them.  They are having serious difficulties at the moment. CIE may not know that a great deal of the time of CIE officials in Donegal is spent trying to prevail on the private school bus drivers to continue to give the service.  I can appreciate fully the difficulties of the many small bus owners who are providing this service, driving on rural roads which have not seen maintenance for the past 20 years.  That brings me back to the initial point I made, that if we are to obtain a reasonable service &mdash; and I cannot see CIE in the short term improving on this &mdash; then we should receive income in some other way to improve our roads and our infrastructure generally so that at least on a financial base we would be on a par with the rest of the country.</P>
    <P>We cannot term ourselves as being on a par with the rest of the country as far as free transport is concerned.  People from any other part of the Twenty-Six Counties have the advantage of free transport but we do not have this to the same extent.  The new companies will have to give serious consideration to opening discussions with the private bus companies from Donegal and ask them to consent to give the free transport service to those who qualify for it.  Because of cutbacks in the Department of Health and in the North-Western Health Board, many people in Donegal find it is costing them up to £150 per trip to find their way to Dublin, whereas those buses leaving the west and coming to Dublin should be able to provide the free transport service. Certainly there is a case for having discussions with the private transport people in Donegal.  I hope CIE will accept that <Col N="2954" /> they were giving that excellent service and that they should not try to do anything to hinder them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>CIE have come in for an amount of criticism, some of it fair and some of it unfair.  CIE in their present form have served the people reasonably well over the years.  Their biggest fault is that they did not move with the times and the workers were always made the scapegoat.  In many cases the management were appointed by political parties not because of their ability but because of their political affiliation.  They had no interest in changing CIE's structures where that was necessary.</P>
      <P>Having regard to their monopoly, CIE should have been able to operate in the markets available.  However, private enterprise outpaced them and outpriced them and, as a result, thousands of jobs were lost to CIE.  I worked in Enniscorthy with CIE and at that time 25 or 35 people worked in the goods station.  Today that station no longer operates and those jobs have been lost.  That is sad and it should not have happened.  Today the goods come to Carlow and private enterprise companies are collecting them and delivering them to the various towns in Wexford.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy De Rossa referred to Rosslare Harbour as a profit-making section of CIE.  It continues to operate efficiently. In 1984 the profits were £1.277 million and in 1985 they were £1.328 million. That shows the importance of developing Rosslare Harbour for the south-east and the country in general.  Over one million passengers came through Rosslare Harbour last year and facilities are being developed in that area.  Perhaps the development is not moving as fast as it should.  There was a lot of aggression recently because the Government had not applied to the EC for moneys which were alleged to be available.  All moneys coming from Europe have to go through the Department of Finance and have to be applied for by the Government.  It is not good enough for the Government to say that CIE did not look for it.  CIE will be happy to avail of the money.  It is up <Col N="2955" /> to the Government to recognise the value of Rosslare and to apply for the money to ensure there is continuing development in Rosslare.  Because the Minister has family connections with Wexford, he should ensure that the Department of Finance will apply for whatever moneys are available from Europe.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies have claimed that CIE should not be part and parcel of Rosslare Harbour.  CIE and their workers have a role to play in the development of the harbour.  They have excellent labour relations in that area and they have a strike-free record in Rosslare Harbour. They have excellent customer relations; the workers are committed to their work and many have family traditions in CIE going back many years.  It is important that we politicians recognise the important role that CIE have played there over the years and we should ensure that they are part and parcel of whatever further developments take place.</P>
    <P>The McKinsey report did not champion the railways, but they are a very important system expecially for the south-eastern region.  There is a tendency to run down railway lines.  The Dublin-Rosslare line should be upgraded along with the Wexford-Rosslare Harbour-Waterford line.  The equipment being used on those lines should be upgraded to cater for the thousands of tourists coming through Rosslare.  CIE are waiting for the Government to give the go-ahead to put new rail cars on the Dublin-Rosslare route and this would increase the quality of service.  There has been major investment on the Dublin-Cork line and the facilities there are top class.  I do not object to that but it is important that the link to the south-east should be given the same facilities as this is a major tourist area and all politicians have put a major emphasis on tourism.  We should have up-to-date equipment to cater for the million passengers coming through Rosslare every year.  We should encourage them to travel by rail and bus and use CIE facilities.</P>
    <P>Dublin city is choked with cars.  The DART service is a worthwhile service. <Col N="2956" /> Some rural Deputies criticise it from time to time because of the huge amount of money spent on it.  It is essential to encourage more people to use the feeder service and the DART and the bus services in Dublin.  Recently I took a taxi from here to the Mater Hospital for an appointment and it cost me £4.10p.  I returned on a bus which cost 45p.  Obviously the bus service is value for money. I wonder how the taxi service in Dublin can attract business having regard to the high prices they charge.  The Dublin city bus service should be continually improved so as to encourage people to leave as many cars as possible outside the city centre.</P>
    <P>In relation to school transport, the thing that amazes me about CIE is their inflexible attitude to change.  Their catchment areas for the school buses were worked out many years ago but they refuse to change where changes should take place, for instance, where there was a pick-up point for children which is now unused and where perhaps a mile up the road a number of children are attending school and a more convenient pick-up point for them would be more appropriate. The school transport system should be reviewed and perhaps it could be handed over to private enterprise.  In the rural areas a lot of this work is done privately.  Perhaps this area, with little cost to CIE and little effect on employment, could be hived off to private enterprise and they could operate the system as they saw fit in each rural area.  The Minister should look again at rail and bus services because avoiding competition will cause friction.  Therefore, the company should consist of one body or board.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the general support for the Bill given by the House.  Members acknowledged the achievements of CIE since they were set up and their very good financial performance in recent years. There is a recognition that CIE are tackling their onerous responsibilities as the national transport undertaking in a workmanlike way.  That is not to say that Deputies believe that there is no scope for further improvement.  The need to adapt CIE and to equip the board to meet the challenges of the future is recognised by all.</P>
      <P>What has particularly impressed me is the more general praise about the change in the image of CIE which has been projected by the board staff and their efforts to try harder.  The debate has been most constructive and it was clear that a number of Deputies had done careful research and given full consideration to CIE affairs before presenting their views to the House.</P>
      <P>I should like to summarise the major conclusions I have drawn from the debate.  There is general support for the Bill and its value is recognised in strengthening and improving the CIE organisation. There is generous recognition of the improvements in CIE, including contributions to those achievements by the chairman, the board and the workforce. There is a will to see CIE succeed and improve their position in the transport market.  This is attended by admonitions about the need to improve marketing and a greater need for the board to become customer-orientated with a view to increasing passenger support for train and bus services.  There were demands for CIE to utilise the resources and skills available in the interests of utilising the board's assets in a pragmatic and profitable way.  There was a recognition that CIE industrial relations had improved considerably and a general wish to improve further transparency in CIE finances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2958" /> The major bone of contention was that adopted by Deputy Wilson and his party that there should be two bodies instead of three.  Deputy De Rossa said that a case had not been made for splitting CIE into three companies.  He said that changes could have been achieved by internal reorganisation.  That is not so.  It should be remembered that CIE's losses or deficit increased from £2.5 million in the late sixties to £109.2 million in 1982. The situation had previously caused such alarm that the then Government, under the leadership of Mr. Lynch, decided to call in consultants to give an explanation for the alarming increase.  Bear in mind that the increase from 1969 to 1982 represented seven times the rate of inflation. However, if it had merely gone up by the rate of inflation from 1969 to 1982 the loss in 1982 would have been £12.5 million.  It turned out to be £109.2 million so the Government were right to call in consultants. There is tittle-tattle about a Member of the House who is alleged to be involved in mis-spending about £500 but nothing was done in relation to CIE where there was such an incredible increase in their deficit.  That episode has done more to damage the concept of State enterprise than all the detractors of State enterprise in this century.</P>
    <P>The McKinsey report was issued in 1980 and recommended that CIE should be scrapped and three new companies created.  Road freight and sundry services were to be ended forthwith.  The Government rejected that approach on major grounds on which I will now elaborate. There was another part to the recommendation which was that there should be a transport development unit created in the then Department of Transport &mdash; now Communications &mdash; involving the setting up of an enormous addition to bureaucracy which would have cost more and which would have had little effect.  It was wrong of Deputy De Rossa to say that the Bill is a copy of the McKinsey report with a few changes.  There are very profound changes in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy Wilson, in opposing the setting up of three companies and saying that there should not be competition of any <Col N="2959" /> sort between the railways and the bus company, said that what I had said in the Seanad was wrong, that he had never as Minister promoted the idea of three companies.  If he wants to see the files I will show them to him.  In a memorandum dated 10 September 1982 and circulated to other Government Departments, whose observations were received in my Department before I became Minister, he proposed to accept the McKinsey report in full.</P>

      <P>Deputy Wilson sought the approval of the Government.  I will refresh his memory because I know Deputy Wilson is a very honest man and that he just cannot remember.  He said in this memorandum that the Minister for Transport would seek authority from the Government to prepare a plan for the creation of a separate Dublin bus company by 1 January 1984 at the latest.  He also sought the creation of a separate national railway company and a separate national bus company by 1 January 1985 at the latest.  He wanted termination of the road freight and sundries activities at present carried on by CIE by 1 January 1985 at the latest.  Later on in the memo he states and I quote:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It could be argued that one Board <Col N="2960" /> could operate the railway and the provincial bus services.  However the Minister would not favour such a course because this would, in effect, preserve intact a major portion of the CIE structure along with the self sustaining momentum by reason of which, as already argued, CIE as constituted is not susceptible to external or even internal control.  He believes that the correct approach is to have entirely separate operations with the competition between the road and rail services being regulated by the Transport Development Unit.

      <P>I want to explain to Deputy De Rossa the difference in what I am proposing.  I am not having any increase in bureaucracy in my Department. The losses in CIE have been arrested.  If the trend of 1969 to 1982 had continued the losses for 1986 would be in excess of £170 million.  That is on the normal subvention.  The deficit this year would be of the order of £104 million or better.  No jobs have been lost and there have been no redundancies or major cuts in services.  That is what has been achieved. What I am proposing to do now is to build on those achievements and to give a new environment and a new hope for all those who work in CIE and for all those who need CIE for their transport needs.</P>
      <P>I am very proud of what has been achieved in CIE, not just for myself but for everybody in CIE.  I believe that the chairman down to the most humble and junior worker in CIE deserve to share fully in what has been achieved.  Many Members have said that CIE have received a lot of flak in their time, some of it justified, some of it unjustified.  When there is real achievement we should be ready to say so and encourage even greater achievement.  I congratulate the chairman, the board and management, and the workforce of CIE and thank them for what has been achieved.  I encourage them to keep it up.  I would remind them that if the course which was followed between 1969 and 1982 had been continued there would be no CIE today because the Exchequer could not afford £170 million this year, going up by a multiple of inflation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy De Rossa is wrong in saying that this Bill prepares for privatisation. There is a specific section in the Bill which prevents the alienation of any shares out of State control.  The reason for the company format as presented in the Bill is that I have always believed as someone who was born and reared within the shadows of the walls of the CIE works in Inchicore that their enormous property assets and human skills have been grossly under-used.  They could be exploited to <Col N="2962" /> great advantage in the interests of the company, the workforce and the people.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, as in the case of statutory corporations, CIE can only do what the statute under which they were set up says they can do.  They are rigidly confined to what the statute says they can do.  The statute is inflexible.  CIE will be in a position to seize new opportunities as they arise by changing the memorandum and articles of association.  We had the same argument, debate and discussion in the case of the Postal and Telecommunications Services Bill.  Why not corporations instead of companies? Because workers fear that companies can be liquidated.  That is an understandable fear.  We have tried to provide all sorts of safeguards against that in the Bill.  If liquidated, all those employed on vesting day go back to the board of the main company with full continuity of service. All services will have to be continued by the board as if they were never interrupted but the company format will allow CIE and each of their subsidiary companies to look at opportunities to exploit their property and human assets to the advantage of the company and the country.</P>
    <P>Many of our State companies, notably Aer Lingus, have been brilliantly successful in developing what they call ancillary activities in order to generate profits from those activities to offset the inevitable losses in the transportation side. Aer Lingus did it by exploiting and utilising the enormous skills they had within the organisation.  We want CIE to replicate that performance.  The company format facilitates that kind of performance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The provisions in the Bill would, strictly speaking, allow a creditor to seek liquidation.  To do otherwise, as was discussed at great length in the Seanad, would be to pervert bankruptcy law and company law.  What we have built into this legislation is that should the like ever arise, and it is most <Col N="2963" /> unlikely that it ever will, the services of the company and the employees of the company on vesting day will go back to the board without interruption.  That is where we are heading for and that is why it is so important for this Bill to build on what has been achieved in the last four years by CIE.  An enormous amount has been achieved.  The financial results are the clearest indication of what has been achieved.</P>
      <P>Deputy Gene Fitzgerald derided the announcement of profit by a Government who had no other good news to announce.  It was not announced by the Government at all but announced by the Chairman of CIE.  What we have done is to bring the presentation of accounts into line with how accounts of transport companies are presented in almost every other country in the EC.  When the State ask CIE to provide a service they say they are going to pay so much for that service just like every other customer and just like the State pays in the Social Welfare Vote for the free travel of old age pensioners etc. and in the Defence Vote for dependants of the War of Independence etc.  That is received as a receipt.  If CIE can out-perform that target they will have made a genuine profit just as British Rail, if they beat their target, will have made a genuine profit.  CIE made a profit of £7 million in 1985, in other words they beat their target by £7 million after at least meeting their targets in 1983 and 1984. We should contrast that with what occurred in the previous 13 years, deficits escalating and multiplying into oblivion.</P>
      <P>There is no room for complacency although a great deal has been achieved. A great deal more remains to be achieved. Yes, we have guaranteed the future of the road freight operation that was scheduled for closure in 1982.  That section of the company has been turned around and is making a profit.  We transferred the hotel division out of CIE ownership and now they are almost at a break-even stage because they were put under better management structure in the State sector.</P>

      <P>It may be but the move was sensible.  That operation had been losing millions and now, while it is still in the State sector, it is doing well.  Hopefully, next year it will move into profit. The canals, which are no longer a means of transportation, have been moved from CIE to the Office of Public Works.  CIE have responsibility for the Dublin city bus services, the provincial buses, the railways, road freight, and international tours.  I want the company to build on their achievements and go on to meet the targets set by the Government for 1989 as they have met the targets set by the Government back in 1983.  If the company can do that the provincial bus service will be making a profit of about £4 million, the Dublin city service deficit will be one-quarter of what it was in 1982 &mdash; it is already down to half of that figure. If the company can achieve the targets we have set them the railway deficit will be contained and the escalation halted.</P>
      <P>However, I am thinking in more ambitious terms than that.  It is my belief that the Dublin city service is capable of breaking even and at a reasonable fare level.  I take the point made by Deputy De Rossa that fare levels are high, particularly for those who live in the outer suburbs.  Deputy Browne made the point that to take a bus from the Mater Hospital to the Dáil for 45p was very cheap when one compared that charge with the taxi rate of more than £4. However, we must consider the example given by Deputy De Rossa of the unemployed husband and wife with two children living in Finglas wanting to travel to the centre of the city.  It will cost that family £5 to make the journey to and from their home.  That is a lot of money for such a family to have to pay.  His criticism was valid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have indicated on several occasions that while meeting the targets I set CIE must achieve at least a stabilisation of bus fares and, if possible, a reduction in the years ahead.  With the introduction of one person buses after years of protracted <Col N="2965" /> negotiations there is a possibility of reduced bus fares in Dublin.  I have been told by the chairman, and board of CIE, that when the one person operation is complete within a couple of years CIE will be able to offer major reductions in fares especially to constant users. Another target I set for CIE was to reduce Dublin bus fares while at the same time reduce the deficits.  I accept that my targets are ambitious but given the right environment, good management and leadership they can achieve them.</P>
    <P>I take Deputy De Rossa's point that for too long CIE were messed up by interference by politicians in their day to day operations.  That has occurred.  I am not referring to Ministers or the Department only and I suspect that they did not interfere as much as TDs.  Members of the House have been under pressure in regard to different services.  If the company propose to remove a service or alter a route political pressure is brought to bear on the company not to alter the position.  The company were not allowed do what they wanted.  The result was that management were not controlling the company and that was a significant factor in the deterioration of the finances of the company.  That deterioration was scandalous and inexplicable during those 13 years, even allowing for the fact that in that period we experienced a big increase in fuel prices and car ownership. The factors I have mentioned combined might have resulted in an increase of three or four times the rate of inflation but hardly seven times the rate of inflation.</P>
    <P>We never seriously addressed how the State relates to its companies.  Many of the problems in the State sector arose because the relationship between the State and the companies was never properly thought out or defined.  For instance, appointments to State boards all too frequently were considered as a type of substitute honours system under which party worthies were appointed.  They were worthy people in their own right but they were not always suited to the board to which they were appointed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>It has changed substantially. I am not saying that there is perfection now or that any one party in Government was any more guilty than another but over the 13 years those appointments were a factor.  I am not making a party political point about this but it is a trap that successive Governments fell into.  I can understand the pressures they were under.  Secondly, we did not equip our Departments with the necessary accounting skills to vet the finances and accounts of the State companies. When I was appointed Minister for Transport on 14 December 1982 I was astonished to find that there was not one accountant in the Department.  We now have a financial unit in the Department. Thirdly, no serious financial objectives were set and the mandates were unclear, if they were mandates at all.  Meetings between Ministers and the boards of directors were rare.  There were no regular reports on the finance as against the budget; certainly there were no quarterly or half-yearly reports or even reports on losses.  Many changes have taken place in the last four years.  We now get four-weekly financial reports against budgets submitted at the beginning of the year and if things are going wrong we can detect them early on.  While it is important that the Department should have those figures it is equally important that the companies should have them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was astonished to find in 1983 that CIE had not these figures themselves.  Is it any wonder that things went wrong? There was not a budget broken down, subhead by subhead, Department by Department, accounting period by accounting period, so that things could be checked against it.  I asked about this before I went to the Government to ask for a five year budget and found that there was no such management information available, that it would take some weeks to assemble it.  That major change has given, at least, controls over the finances to the board and the Department if things are going astray and mainly <Col N="2967" /> because of that principal change, things are less likely to go astray.  We now have a proper financial unit which can vet these figures, read them and understand them, which has diminished the likelihood of things going wrong as they did 30 years before.</P>
    <P>I wish to thank the Deputies for their contributions and particularly to thank Deputy Wilson, although I disagree with him concerning the two companies.  His was a wide ranging contribution to the debate.  It was typically constructive, as always, and the points I have not been able to answer here I shall answer direct to him and to the other Deputies concerned. When we pass this Bill we shall be doing a great job for CIE, for those who work there, for those who need CIE for their transport needs and for our country.</P>

      <P>Deputy Griffin has been given permission to raise on the Adjournment of the House his deep concern at the unhelpful attitude of the ACC and the Associated Banks in the <Col N="2968" /> matter of applications from deserving and necessitous farmers who are seeking Euro loan facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanGriffin" hpid="Mr. Griffin Mr. Griffin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Griffin</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I should like to thank you for giving me permission to raise this issue this evening on the Adjournment.  I have agreed to divide the small amount of time left to me with Deputies Seán Byrne and Seán McCarthy, who have indicated their interest in this issue.  I would also like it clearly understood that my contribution and remarks cannot and must not be interpreted as any criticism of the Government or of any of their Ministers.  Here present we have the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Deputy Hegarty, a farmer himself who is very conversant with the problems of the farming community.  He has done his best at every available opportunity, both at departmental and Government level, to alleviate the plight of the farming community. I should like to congratulate the Government on introducing the exchange rate guarantee scheme for those who are seeking Euro loan facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since being given permission to raise this matter on the Adjournment, Members of all parties have come to me, offered their support and help and given me every encouragement in raising this important issue.  I congratulate the Government on introducing what I deem to be a very bold and imaginative concept of an exchange rate guarantee scheme which includes over £200 million being lent to the farming community at a most attractive rate of interest of 5½ per cent. Unfortunately, the great expectations which greeted this scheme have not materialised for many farmers in South Tipperary for whom I speak and for farmers throughout the country.  They were disappointed and disillusioned at the approach of the ACC and the Associated Banks when they inquired about the availability of the scheme.  There was a certain amount of reluctance and hesitancy on the part of these lending institutions initially to give any information at all about the loan.  Very grudgingly, <Col N="2969" /> they gave out application forms and the farmers thought, on completion of those forms, that they would be entitled to this facility.  They were dismayed at being refused.</P>
    <P>There is no need for me to go into the background of the farming community, the despair and despondency which struck them, particularly after the second consecutive bad summer.  In 1985, owing to the very adverse climatic conditions there was deep and real concern among the farming community who looked forward then to 1986 and hoped for a good summer and a good harvest to enable them to clear off their debts and pay off the lending institutions.  When the 1986 summer was bad the farmers were near to despair.  They grasped this fine scheme for some ray of hope in continuing in agriculture.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to call in the ACC and the top executives of the four Associated Banks and request them to have a more sympathetic, more sensitive and more humane approach to the plight of the farming community, particularly the small farmers in my area and the dairy farmers with a milk output of less than 25,000 gallons.  The behaviour of these institutions to date is totally against the spirit of this magnificent scheme.  From my own experience from the number of farmers who have approached me and who, I am sure, have approached all other Deputies from rural constituencies, I know that the farmers wish the Minister to have another look at the scheme and to ask the institutions not to be so rigid in their declaring of applicants as ineligible.</P>
    <P>I know that there is a question of creditworthiness, which the institutions must have regard to, but I would ask them to be flexible.  A farmer may not have been creditworthy at a 17½ per cent or at up to a 22 per cent interest rate, but at 5½ per cent interest rate surely virtually every farmer would be creditworthy for the amount of loan required.  I have a file of names of big and small farmers, dairy farmers, cereal growers and pig producers, who have asked that the Minister be requested to make representation on their behalf to the ACC.  I know he <Col N="2970" /> cannot enter into every case individually &mdash; though some Ministers have done so and successfully &mdash; but the bulk of the applicants who were refused under the present system of interpretation of the scheme find no hope in it.  I hope that as a result of all our representations those farmers who were refused will have their cases re-examined with a view to granting them the money they so badly need.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanByrne" hpid="Mr. S. Byrne Mr. S. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Griffin has kindly allowed me to share the time with him, since I had made a similar request to the Chair.  The Euro-loan scheme is a fraud and a cod.  The Minister stated in reply to a parliamentary question that the terms and conditions of the scheme had been drawn up so as to ensure that the funds would be allocated on low interest to those most in need, in order to maintain their contribution to general agricultural output.  That is blarney.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are at least 50,000 small and medium farmers in serious financial trouble.  This scheme has so many restrictions it is an insult to suggest it will help farmers.  Not too long ago we in this House gave permission to the Government to help out a certain banking group when they could not run their own business. About £200 million of taxpayers' money was poured out to them to sort out their financial problems.  They and their colleagues in the ACC are now putting families out of their homes and forcing them to sell their houses, their land and their livestock.  Letters are being sent out to people in my constituency which would not be sent to criminals.  If this Government have not the courage to deal with the lending institutions &mdash; the AIB, Bank of Ireland or the ACC &mdash; the incoming Government will act on behalf of the nation.  These institutions are worse than the landlords who put people out of their homes.  Letters have been written by these faceless people with no thought or knowledge of the hardship these families are experiencing through EC prices dropping, input costs increasing and the worst weather conditions since records began.  Yet we read in the newspapers that they are being kind to the farming <Col N="2971" /> community.  They are acting in the same way towards small shopkeepers.  It is about time all this bunkum stopped. These are the people who set this country mad some years ago and set the price of land on fire, but now they are looking for their pound of flesh.</P>
    <P>This scheme is doing nothing for the average farmer.  There are farmers in my constituency who are frightened out of their minds by letters from bank managers. These are people who always meant to pay their way and fought for the freedom of this country.  They have almost been driven into mental homes. They sold some of their livestock and some of their land but when they applied for the Euro-loan they were refused and told that if they had come in last year they would have qualified.  Yet the Minister tells us it is a good scheme and that so many people are applying every week. What type of people are applying?  What type of people are qualifying?  The Minister should take a hard look at the job the banks are doing and the people they are setting up to suit themselves.  They are closing a lot of doors and the average man who is without muscle is not getting anywhere.</P>
    <P>It is a national scandal that family farms are being sold out by the lending institutions while the Government are sitting idly by and doing nothing.  How long can this continue in view of the way prices are going?  Will it be like 100 years ago when families were thrown out and emigrated?  Will we need more boats to get the people out of the country?  The situation is terrible, yet the Government say this is a lovely scheme.  It is useless to the average farmer.  I am not talking about the man who lived highly and bought land at a wild price but about the small and medium farmer.  He has not a chance in hell while he is paying interest rates of 18 per cent and 20 per cent. His colleagues in Belgium and Holland growing tulips have money freely available at 5 per cent.  Here we have had to listen to blarney about the great help that <Col N="2972" /> would be given to farmers after Hurricane Charlie and two years of bad weather. What did the farmers get?  A miserable £200 million.  We gave over £200 million to the AIB for the irresponsible conduct of their business and they have the cheek to put a man and his family out on the road.  They are threatening to do so every day of the week.  If such people had not sold off their livestock last year to pay their debts they would qualify under the new scheme.</P>
    <P>The Minister says they may look into the matter in the light of the experience of the operation of the scheme.  How long more must we wait?  These people cannot live on a breadline with the bank manager breathing down their neck.  I appeal to the Minister for God's sake to do something now.  I could go on for an hour but I want to allow my colleague to say a few words. The sum of £200 million which has been granted represents only 13 per cent of the indebtedness of farmers to the ACC and the banks.  It is only a sick joke.  People owe all this money not through their own fault but because of world prices, EC prices, quotas and many other factors such as bad weather.  Maybe if they came from Japan and got an IDA grant they would have an easier time.</P>
    <P>These are our people and they have a right to raise their families here.  Some of their fathers fought for our freedom; but for them I would not be here this evening. When the Fianna Fáil Government come into power the lending institutions will have to wake up and cop on.  This is our country.  It does not belong to the vultures who are trying to destroy the fabric of rural Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMcCarthy" hpid="Dr. McCarthy Dr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Griffin for allowing me the opportunity to speak. The terms of this Euro-loan should be renegotiated.  There is no doubt the amount of money allocated is quite insufficient. It is almost impossible to find someone who qualifies under this scheme.  I have known only one person who has received sanction for a loan.  The scheme is a charade and a sham and something should be done to give proper <Col N="2973" /> compensation to farmers.  They have endured two terribly difficult years of bad weather.  Their income has dropped by about 24 per cent and I do not know of any other section of the community which would tolerate that type of loss.  If any other section were subjected to such a loss there would be a public outcry and the country would be brought to its knees.  Farmers are basically tolerant people and they have accepted what has happened but they need help.  There is an obligation on the Minister and the Government to provide that help.</P>
      <P>We are reaching the stage when the family farm is becoming non-existent. More and more farmers are having to sell their land to pay the vultures who are running our banking institutes.  I would like to be able to say that the banks and the ACC are treating farmers properly but this is not the case.  When farmers had good times the banks did very well out of them, but when farmers are doing badly there is an obligation on the banks to help them out.  Instead, those banking institutes are treating the farmers like criminals.  They send them letters no decent, honest person would send to another.  Bank managers are questioning and investigating farmers as if they had committed major crimes.  That is scandalous. I know from experience as a medical doctor that more farmers are getting more depressed and a greater number of them will have to be committed in some cases and go voluntarily in others to psychiatric institutions.  I hope the Minister will bear these comments in mind and give the ACC and the bank management a good lecture.  Tell them they are dealing with decent people who should be treated decently.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputies for their contribution.  The exchange rate guarantee scheme for farmers and private peat producers has been introduced by the Government to give meaningful aid to those producers who are in severe financial difficulty as a result of the very difficult weather conditions both last year and in the current year. <Col N="2974" /> These loans are funded in EMS currencies borrowed by the four Associated Banks and the ACC for on-lending to farmers.  I want to stress straightaway that the money involved is not derived from the EC and the Government's participation is that of guaranteeing the exchange loss that might arise in the event of any re-alignment of EMS currencies.</P>

      <P>The loans are being made available through the Associated Banks and the ACC at an exceptionally low interest rate of around 5½ per cent for working capital purposes and for restructuring of existing debt.  I must make it quite clear that the involvement of the national Exchequer relates only to any potential exchange risk loss.  It does not relate to any losses incurred by the lending institutions arising out of any repayment problems they might have with any individual farmer under the scheme.  It is a specific requirement that responsibility for assessing the general creditworthiness of applicants and for any credit risk involved is entirely a matter for the lending institutions.</P>

      <P>The total fund provided under the scheme is £200 million.  While this is a very considerable sum, the numbers of farmers who can benefit is necessarily limited.  The scheme is not intended to provide low interest loans to every farmer who would like to get access to cheap money.  The specific priority of the scheme is to help those farmers who have experienced severe financial difficulties as a result of the recent weather problems. The provision of low interest loans <Col N="2975" /> at these very favourable rates of interest does, inevitably, generate a demand far in excess of available funds.

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;of applicants and are, therefore, in the best position to decide on the relative hardships experienced in individual cases, I can well understand the feeling of disappointment of producers who would like to have enjoyed the very substantial benefits that are available under the scheme but are not included.  The fact of the matter is, however, that the available funds must be concentrated on those who have experienced the most severe financial <Col N="2976" /> hardships.  Furthermore, the lending institutions have been instructed to endeavour to ensure that the requirements of smaller farmers are adequately catered for so far as the available funds allow.</P>
      <P>I would like to draw the attention of Deputies to the terms and conditions of the scheme which cover working capital approvals and existing borrowings of the working capital requirements to fund borrowings in 1986-87.  Borrowings specifically for land purchase or nonagricultural borrowings of farmers are excluded from the scheme.</P>
      <P>In his announcement of the scheme, the Taoiseach has pointed out that of the total available for new loans to the farming community, a minimum of £65 million is to be reserved for new working capital requirements of the categories of farmers covered by the scheme initiated on 1 June, that is, dairy farmers with quotas of less than 25,000 gallons, pig producers, winter beef producers and cereal growers, but also of other categories of farmers who are in severe financial difficulties.</P>
      <P>The consequences of the conditions on eligibility under the scheme is that loans both for working capital and restructuring purposes must be allocated by the lending institutions on a priority basis to those farmers who are in severe financial difficulties because of weather conditions. Farmers not in serious financial difficulty due to recent weather conditions may also be eligible for working capital loans under the scheme provide they are in the category of farmers covered in the scheme initiated on 1 June, that is, dairy farmers, pig producers, winter beef producers and cereal growers. However, benefits to this category of farmers can only arise in the event of the allocation of working capital to an individual lending institution not being fully utilised by farmers who are in severe financial difficulties due to the recent weather conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have endeavoured to provide as much flexibility as possible in the operation of the scheme.  There is a monitoring committee involving the farming <Col N="2977" /> organisations monitoring this scheme.  In the past, these schemes have been criticised on the grounds that they involve too much red tape.  However, if we are to have flexibility we cannot, at the same time, expect the scheme to cover everyone who would like access to substantial loans at interest rates of around 5 per cent-6 per cent.  We have also designed a scheme to get the benefits into farmers' bank accounts as quickly as possible.  As I said earlier, the scheme is not designed to meet the wishes of everybody who wants low interest money and it would be foolish to pretend otherwise.  We have endeavoured to ensure that the most needy cases are covered&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 16 and 24 together.  There is a variety of factors which must be taken into account by a court in deciding on the appropriate sentence in a particular case.  Since these factors will vary from case to case it is inevitable that there will be differences in sentences even in cases which, on the face of it, seem similar.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless I accept that there is a public perception that there is disparity in sentencing practice.  In so far as this may be so, I take the view that it is the Judiciary itself which is the appropriate body to assess it.  I do not think that legislation can provide an answer to criticisms of inconsistency in the imposition of penalties.</P>
      <P>There is formal machinery for consultation among Justices of the District Court (where the majority of criminal charges are dealt with).  Section 36 of the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Act, 1961, provides for the convening by the President of the District Court of meetings of Justices to discuss matters relating to the discharge of the business of that Court including &ldquo;such matters as the avoidance of undue divergences in the exercise of their jurisdiction, and the general levels of fines and other penalties.&rdquo;  While there is no similar statutory provision for the higher courts there is nothing to prevent the Presidents of these courts from convening meetings for the same purpose.</P>

      <P>The position is that, arising from a re-organisation of the Garda district stucture in Cork east division in June 1985 the district headquarters was moved from Blarney to the new Garda premises at Gurranabraher.  This change involved the transfer of the district headquarters staff only, and did not affect the operational <Col N="2811" /> strength at Blarney.  In fact, the operational strength at Blarney has been increased by two members since then.

      <P>The inner city draft review of the Dublin development plan produced by Dublin Corporation states that the crime rate per head of population in the inner city is &ldquo;probably of the order of five times the county borough average&rdquo;.  However, it goes on to make a number of comments designed to put that figure in perspective and in particular to bring out that it does not mean that people living in that area are responsible for all the crimes.  Incidentally, the gardaí calculate the crime rate per head in the inner city to be approximately three times the rate for the whole of the Dublin metropolitan area.  Even within the inner city there are wide variations in crime rates between various districts.</P>
      <P>In common with connurbations in virtually all developed countries, the incidence of crime in Dublin tends to be higher where opportunity for crime is greatest in the business area and in the region of transport termini and depots.</P>

      <P>I have not been provided with any additional evidence regarding the circumstances surrounding the death of Patrick Nugent since 4 March last.  Various persons have claimed to have knowledge of, or possession of, what they regarded as evidence which would shed new light on the case.  However, on investigation, none of this evidence proved to be of any value.</P>
      <P>It has also come to my notice, over the past few months, that certain persons close to the family claim to have evidence to prove that a witness was subjected to threats and that false testimony was given in certain instances.  I have urged the persons concerned to bring to the notice of the gardaí any new information that they may have so as to ensure, in so far as is possible, that every relevant fact about the case is brought out into the open.  Unfortunately, my pleas in this respect have evoked no response.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware too that a recent pamphlet, which is stated to be issued by the Nugent Campaign for Justice Committee and what is referred to as the National Legal Justice Action Group, make a number of allegations in relation to this case.  This pamphlet is, in places, scurrilous both in tone and content as well as being, I believe, libellous of certain persons, myself included.  I have, nevertheless, referred it to the Garda authorities with a view to investigation of whether the <Col N="2814" /> people responsible for it have any evidence to support any of the claims which it makes.</P>
    <P>Finally, in view of what has already been put forward as new evidence, perhaps it is necessary to make it quite clear that when I refer to new evidence I mean, of course, evidence which is relevant and which is substantial enough both to make possible and to justify some further action, whether by way of Garda investigation or otherwise.</P>

It is contained in the Garda Síochána (Compensation) Acts, 1941 and 1945.  There is no such scheme in respect of accidential injuries.</P>

      <P>I opened my remarks on Dublin at the Dublin Chamber of Commerce dinner by saying that we have got within the canals and within the two rivers, the Tolka and the Dodder, a lot of space available which could be used productively to house people, to house enterprises and to house facilities that would bring people back to the city.  I said that I regretted the attitudes that existed 20 years ago, and which I thought some Government Ministers at that time shared, and were vocal about, that the inner city is a bad place for people to live, and that it was full of smoke and dirt.  I expressed my satisfaction that this attitude had gone and had been reversed and that we all recognise now that we have got to use the inner city, and have got to make it a place where people can live in much larger numbers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I pointed out that it was the policy <Col N="2816" /> of this Government that local authority housing for the foreseeable future be concentrated on the inner city area, and that so indeed should, as far as possible, be commercial development, although not industrial development.  Though I recognised that there was room perhaps in some areas for further industrialisation, most had to be outside the immediate inner city area.  I expressed my agreement with the desirability of establishing a convention centre to make Dublin a really vital area, and I said I thought that the Custom House dock area provided a nucleus for this.  I hoped that the very generous incentives we had provided can attract a really worthwhile development there.  It should, if possible, include a convention centre and a hotel.  It should have private housing, not just public housing.  And it should have other facilities.</P>
    <P>I pointed out that there were indeed some buildings there which are very solidly constructed and which could be put to some good use, one of them having some architectural and historical interest: a major warehouse there which was very unusual, unique in fact, in its construction and I thought that we could establish there &mdash; though this was something yet to be decided by Government &mdash; certain museums that would attract people to the area.  We wanted it to be an area which would have people there day and night. We must, therefore, have facilities that would bring people there at night.  It should not comprise empty office blocks at night, making it an area where people would be afraid to go because nobody was around the place.</P>
    <P>With regard to the quays, which the President of Dublin Chamber of Commerce had, I said, rightly referred to as &ldquo;tatty&rdquo;: these could be an attraction and in the 21st century would be so.  This would require much more architectural ingenuity and skill and imagination, and probably more money for building than in the past, because much of the architecture of the last 20 years in Dublin, has been less than distinguished and even some distinguished buildings were either of the wrong size or in the wrong place.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2817" /> I went on to emphasise that the quays really were the focus of the city and that it would be wonderful if we could revitalise them so that they could form a real heart to the city, but a heart with warmth and with something to offer that would be really attractive and not just a &ldquo;Lego&rdquo; building, of the kind that we have seen so many of around our city.  That meant of course, a higher level of spending on such buildings than we have been used to in the past.  A lot of the buildings we have are poor in architectural quality because the architects had been told to build them cheaply, and we had now, in many ways, a pretty cheap city, which was tragic beside the heritage left to us by the 18th and early 19th century.  When side by side, the contrast was appalling and we had a lot to do to put that right.  It had to be done together by Government, corporation, authorities like the New Temporary Streets Commission, and the private sector in all its aspects.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2818" /> I indicated that I believed that we could do this and that I believed we must to it. I trust that Deputies will find much to agree with in my remarks on this subject on this occasion of which I have given an accurate and complete account.</P>

      <P>A number of causes of death are regarded as smoking-related.  These include coronary heart disease; diseases of other blood vessels (including stroke); bronchitis and emphysema; cancer of the lung, bronchus and trachea; cancers of the mouth, larynx, oesophagus, pancreas, bladder and kidney and peptic ulcer.  The following table sets out the numbers of deaths attributable to each of these causes for the years 1980 to 1985 inclusive.  While tobacco smoking is involved as a cause in many of these conditions, other factors such as environmental conditions and old age are also involved.</P>

      <P>In the absence of more specific details, it is not possible to state precisely how the social welfare payments of the family in questions will be affected by the equality provisions.</P>
      <P>As the wife's weekly income is in excess of £50, however, she will no longer qualify as an adult dependant and as a result, the husband will lose the increase in payment in respect of his wife and half of the increase in payment in respect of the child dependant.  In the case of a married man with one qualified child dependant in receipt of the maximum urban rate of long term unemployment assistance, the weekly payment would be £41.05 instead of £71.85.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mrs. Hussey) Gemma Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mrs. Hussey)</NameTxt>
      <P>From 17 November 1986 men and women claiming benefit, assistance or pension under the Social Welfare Acts will be treated equally.  Up to now a married man claiming a social welfare payment automatically got an increase of benefit for his wife and children living with him irrespective of whether they were dependants of his but a married woman could only get an increase of benefit for her husband and children in very restricted circumstances.</P>
      <P>Since 17 November 1986 the definition of dependancy has been changed to make it the same for men and women thus removing the discrimination which has heretofore existed against married women.  A spouse will be regarded as dependant of the other spouse only where he or she is being wholly or mainly maintained by that person and spouses entitled to social welfare payment in their own right or with earnings in excess of £50 a week will not be regarded as dependants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The person concerned was in receipt of disability benefit at the personal rate of £41.10 plus an increase of £26.60 in respect of an adult dependant up to 15 <Col N="2829" /> November 1986.  The claimant's wife is in receipt of an invalidity pension and consequently from 17 November 1986 he is entitled to £41.10 weekly, the maximum personal rate.  A temporary payment of £10 a week will issue to the claimant in addition to the personal rate to compensate him for the loss of the adult dependant increase.  This payment will continue to issue for the duration of his claim or for 52 weeks whichever is the lesser.</P>

This is the rate to which he is entitled having regard to the assessment of his means consisting of the weekly letting value of a holding and capital.  The transfer of the holding has not been accepted for old age pension purposes as the transferee is in full time employment.  The disposal of a large part of the capital has not been accepted for old age purposes, as satisfactory evidence of its disposal has not been received.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mrs. Hussey) Gemma Hussey">

      <P>The person concerned was in receipt of unemployment assistance at the weekly rate of £92.35 up to 17 May 1986 when he ceased to sign the unemployed register.  This was the appropriate maximum rate payable in his case as a long term unemployed person.  To qualify for payment of unemployment assistance at the long term rate a claimant must normally have been unemployed for a continuous period of 390 days.  Where there is a break between two unemployment assistance claims the long term rate continues where that break is less than 20 consecutive weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The person concerned again claimed unemployment assistance from 6 October 1986.  As more than 20 weeks had elapsed since the termination of his <Col N="2831" /> earlier claim he was not entitled to payment at the long term rate.  Accordingly, the claim was allowed at the appropriate maximum short term rate, payable in his case, of £89.90 weekly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mrs. Hussey) Gemma Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mrs. Hussey)</NameTxt>
      <P>Following reinvestigation, the unemployment assistance claim of the person concerned was disallowed on the grounds that his means, derived from the profit from his holding, exceeded the statutory limit.  He appealed against the disallowance and, on 13 November 1986, an appeals officer also disallowed his claim.</P>
      <P>Regulations provide that, if an appeals officer is of the opinion that a case is of such a nature that it can be decided without an oral hearing, he may dispense with the hearing and decide the case summarily. The appeals officer was of the opinion that this case was of such a nature and, therefore, he decided it summarily.</P>
      <P>The decision of the appeals officer is final in the absence of new facts or fresh evidence.  However, if the person concerned feels that there were facts or evidence which were not available to the appeals officer he should send them to the Department and they will be submitted to the appeals officer to enable him to re-examine the case.</P>

I gcás na gceantar a luann an Teachta, tá mé sásta gur féidir freastal ar an éileamh ar scolaíocht trí Ghaeilge i scoileanna lán-Ghaeilge áitiúla  atá i bhfeidhm cheana féin, atá réasúnta gar do cheantair na n-iarratas agus a bhfuil dóthain cóiríochta iontu chuige.</P>
      <P>Dá dheasca sin, níl sé i gceist agam na hiarratais seo a cheadú i láthair na huaire.</P>
