      <P>asked the Minister for Education if he will provide details of capital grant allocations for recreation facilities for 1986.</P>

      <P>A total sum of £1.2 million is available in 1986 to meet existing commitments and for allocation to new projects under my Department's capital grant scheme.  A large number of <Col N="2" /> grant approvals in 1985 have involved the carry over of heavy commitments to 1986 and because of this it will be possible to assist only a small number of new projects this year.</P>
      <P>The amount available for allocation to new projects in 1986 cannot be determined precisely at this stage as it depends on the level of expenditure on existing commitments in the present year.  The best estimate at present is that a sum of about £300,000 will be available for allocation and expenditure on new projects. Further money may become available later, depending on the trend of expenditure on existing commitments.</P>
      <P>The following grants have been allocated in 1986 to date:</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister give some indication as to the difference between the allocations for last year under this heading as against the £300,000 mentioned for this year?</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>A total commitment of £1.962 million was allocated in 1985 in respect of 113 new projects, of which £906,000 was paid in 1985.  A sum of £1.313 million has been provided towards the construction of recreational facilities in 1986.  That includes a sum of £0.113 million in respect of five projects to be assisted under the west Cork development package.  Of this, £1.2 million is in respect of projects under the national plan.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Why was there such a heavy carry over from last year?  Was it due to the fact that the organisations were not ready to take up the funds available or were there other reasons?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>It was that fact, as well as the very large number of applications <Col N="4" /> received in the Department.  Work was under way on many of these projects and they were at different stages of construction.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. L. Fitzgerald Mr. L. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education if he will ensure that a teacher due to be placed on the panel from a school (details supplied) in Dublin 5 will be retained on the staff of that school as both the structure of the classes and the extremely disadvantaged nature of the area warrant the services of an additional teacher for the coming school year and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The enrolment averages for the retention of the existing staffing level in this school have not been secured for the three quarter periods ended 31 March 1986 and if they are not secured in the current quarter ended 30 June, a post must be suppressed on that date under the rules.</P>
      <P>The teacher concerned may, however, continue to teach in the school until he is offered and accepts a vacancy in another school under the panel rule.</P>
      <P>It would not be open to me to waive the requirements of the panel rule in a particular case.  However, since the school management have represented special difficulties in the matter of class organisation next September, I have arranged for the inspector to visit the school early in September and I will have the situation reviewed as sympathetically as possible when his report is available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. L. Fitzgerald Mr. L. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that he would have an inspector visit the school in September.  Would he accept <Col N="5" /> that to defer decisions in cases like this, as has happened in previous years, is not in the interests of good school organisation? Would the Minister comment on that point?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is aware of the panel rule and the regulations governing staff levels in schools.  While the school have confirmed that the retention average will not be reached in the relevant quarter, the teacher concerned may, however, continue to teach there until he is offered a suitable vacancy under the panel regulation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. L. Fitzgerald Mr. L. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister had an opportunity to study the difficulties obtaining at the school in terms of the structure of the classes, class sizes and allocation of teachers?  Has he had an opportunity to study the incidence of disadvantage that pertains in the school serving this parish?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Documentation has been received in the Department from the school principal making a case for the retention of the teacher in question but the Department inspector, on his visit in September, will have a more comprehensive report for perusal and determination by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. L. Fitzgerald Mr. L. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The case has been made by the school that they do not have a junior infants teacher for the intake for the 1986-87 school year.  If that is the case, will the Minister accept that a decision like this needs to be made in advance of the summer holidays and not post-summer holidays so that good school organisation can continue to obtain at this school?  Will the Minister accept that in general the ruling that decisions will be deferred into the summer holidays or post-summer holidays cannot be in the best educational interests of schools and school managements?  Is the Minister aware of the duties of a principal, as the functional professional manager of a school, in allocating teachers to the different classes and ensuring that the <Col N="6" /> school gets off the ground efficiently and smoothly from the first day of intake?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is no doubt aware, as a former teacher, that there are other factors to be taken into consideration. The Deputy is aware of the details of the panel rules and of the numbers regarding retention figures and so on. This school has had a steady fall in numbers from a principal and 17 assistants in 1979 to a principal and 11 assistants at present.  Added to that, the class groupings are quite uneven and organisation of classes is difficult.  The inspector has been asked to report specifically on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. L. Fitzgerald Mr. L. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the difficulties that have been outlined to his Department by this school, will the Minister ask the inspector to visit the school, not subsequent to the summer holidays but prior to the summer holidays, so that the inspector, in consultation with the principal, can get down to the job of efficiently reorganising the teaching resources at this school?  Will the Department fully take into account the incidence of disadvantage, because there is a commitment given by the Minister's predecessor to give special consideration to areas that are disadvantaged?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not peculiar to this school.  No application for special consideration was received prior to January of this year when documentation was received from the school principal and, as I said, the Department are committed to treating the matter sympathetically, depending on resources and on the report of the inspector when he carries out his visit in September.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. L. Fitzgerald Mr. L. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I have a commitment that this will be before the summer holidays?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>They are bound there by the panel rules.  The teacher can continue to teach until offered a suitable vacancy <Col N="7" /> and the inspector will visit the school for a special report in September.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education if he is aware that some second level schools are insisting on financial contributions of as much as £50 from parents, with an implication that failure to pay will mean automatic expulsion; the measures the Government intend to take to end this form of pressure; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to state that it is a fundamental principle of the free post-primary eduction scheme that no charge be made in respect of:</P>
      <P>1. Instruction in any subject listed in the general school programme,</P>
      <P>2.  Recreational or study facilities of which all the pupils are expected to avail themselves as part of the school programme,</P>
      <P>3. Any other activity in which all pupils are required to take part.</P>
      <P>Voluntary contributions by parents towards the elimination of old building debts, or charges for optional extras over and above those provided in the general school programme would be permissible under the free education scheme provided it were made absolutely clear to parents that there was no question of compulsion to pay and that, in making a contribution, they would be so doing of their own volition.</P>
      <P>Any complaints received concerning the undue levying of charges on parents of pupils in secondary schools are investigated by my Department.  I am not aware of any dissatisfaction in this connection in respect of pupils attending vocational, community and comprehensive schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>May I take it from the Minister's reply that he is aware of dissatisfaction by parents of pupils attending some secondary schools?  He <Col N="8" /> must have received complaints, certainly in the last week, about a particular school in Glasnevin.  Has the Minister investigated those complaints?  What steps has he taken in relation to the circular issued by that school which made no reference at all to the fact that contributions were voluntary and implied that if a parent did not pay the £50 requested it would be assumed they were placing their child in some other school?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the complaint to which the Deputy refers.  The Department are investigating this matter with a view to further clarification by the principal involved relating to the exact nature of what the Deputy referred to in the letter to the parents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>It is fine for the Minister to say he is looking for clarification from the principal as to what was meant by what was in the circular.  But the parents who contacted me were very clear about what was meant.  The circular said quite clearly that the classes may have to be reduced as a result of the new ruling.  It did not say where that ruling had been made.  It said that if parents wished their daughter to continue her education with them they should complete the attached form and return it with their annual subscription of £50.  There is no reference at all to the fact that it is a voluntary subscription.  It goes on to say that if the form and subscription were not received by Wednesday, 4 June it would be taken that the parents were transferring their daughter elsewhere.  That is a clear indication that the parents were expected to pay that £50 and, if they did not, they could do what they liked with their child.  Will the Minister undertake to see that that school and, indeed, all schools that may be tempted to issue similar circulars, will be instructed that they are not entitled to insist on such subscriptions and that any requests for subscriptions must clearly indicate that they are voluntary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>While the question does not refer to a specific school, I understand <Col N="9" /> what the Deputy is speaking about.  The regulations for the free post-primary education scheme are crystal clear.  The Department will be in immediate contact with the school concerned for clarification with regard to this matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a further aspect of it.  Will the Minister undertake to ensure that, when they are issuing circulars of this kind, all secondary schools in the scheme will, make it clear that subscriptions of any kind being requested are voluntary in nature?  Will the Minister also indicate whether or not he intends to increase the grants to schools so that they do not have to look for these subscriptions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The regulations are clear. No complaints are received from vocational, comprehensive and community schools.  Any complaints that are received are investigated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. L. Fitzgerald Mr. L. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education the reason some candidates for the 1986 oral Irish examinations have had their examinations taped; whether this taping is justified on educational and <Col N="11" /> ethical grounds; whether students who have agreed to be so taped will receive special treatment when the oral examinations are marked and the basis on which this treatment will be granted; whether this situation will be extended to other oral examinations; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy would appear to be misinformed, as no candidates at the 1986 leaving certificate oral Irish tests had their responses taped.</P>
      <P>As regards other oral examinations, it is intended to use tape recording in the oral tests in modern continental languages which are being introduced as part of the leaving certificate examination for the first time this year.  This taping is being done in the interest of ensuring uniformity in the marking of those tests. The question of according special treatment to any candidate does not arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. L. Fitzgerald Mr. L. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State has already stated that taping will be done in relation to certain oral tests. Could he inform the House if the applicants for these tests have been fully informed of the intention to proceed with taping and if so far there have been any objections to that procedure?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter has been taken up with the union concerned.  I am quite sure that school principals have informed the students of the regulations, specifically with regard to modern continental languages.  No taping has occurred with regard to the oral Irish examinations for this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. L. Fitzgerald Mr. L. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is not necessary in relation to oral Irish, could the Minister inform the House why the Department deem it appropriate or necessary, in the interests of uniformity, in relation to the other oral tests?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason is that the Department have at their disposal a great number of competent inspectors with regard to oral Irish and the present <Col N="12" /> system of monitoring on behalf of students has proved to be reasonably adequate.  With regard to modern continental languages, we do not have the same number of inspectors who could carry out competent testing and monitoring in this area.  Taping has produced a more uniform method of marking tests in that regard.</P>

      <P>The sport and leisure complex at present under construction at Donaghmede, County Dublin, which is expected to be completed this year, is on a site adjacent to Grange Community College.</P>
      <P>As the complex is receiving substantial financial assistance from the recreation and financial section of the Department of Labour and from the county council, it is considered that it should serve both school and community needs.  The committee for the complex have indicated that they are prepared to discuss its usage by the school.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to put it to the Minister that there is a very obvious problem of logistics here.  I would ask the Department to reconsider this matter. The case has been put to his Department by the school authorities on a number of occasions.  Would the Minister agree that if a community are to fully utilise a sports complex &mdash; and I accept that there has been a great deal of State investment in it &mdash; a number of second level classes which would hope to utilise a facility of this kind on a daily basis simply cannot work out a satisfactory sporting and physical education programme, given the very obvious constraints?</P>

      <P>I am aware that Grange Community School opened in 1982 with a capacity for 1,000 pupils and that the current number is about 679.  The facilities to be provided at the leisure centre include a large sports hall, squash courts, swimming pool, lounge, meeting rooms and changing rooms.  The tender price of the project was over £1 million.  The recreation and financial section of the Department of Labour have provided £226,000.  I might add that the Department were anxious that the council and the committee would site the complex on the school site, but this has not proved successful.  The complex is only 100 yards away from the school and to consider providing a second complex in the school itself would be merely duplication of substantial financial resources.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. L. Fitzgerald Mr. L. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a serious problem here.  Is the Minister aware of the case made by the school authorities? Is he also aware of their concern that, despite the willingness of the community council to talk, which I detect from his answer, no realistic programme can be <Col N="16" /> worked out to ensure adequate PE facilities for the school?  Fundamentally, the case made is that a class or two here and there might be accommodated but, in general, the school cannot be accommodated in a satisfactory way with regard to PE facilities, given the enormous commitment that this centre will have to make to a very large and young population.</P>

In this instance, however, would the Minister again review the case and consider the following facts: in this area the centre will serve a whole plethora of organisations, all of which will be applying and will have legitimate entitlement to use the sporting, leisure and recreational facilities.

      <P>Does the Minister not consider that it would be appropriate for his Department to become directly involved in the provision of pre-school facilities, in view of the known benefits to the intellectual and social development of children of such facilities?</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">

      <P>The Deputy is aware that the responsibility of the Minister for Education is to provide for primary education. This is done through the national school system which permits enrolment at four years of age, a year earlier than in other European countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Paragraph 1.4 of Ages for Learning <Col N="18" /> recommended that the Department had no proposals to involve themselves in the provision of a formal school based pre-school service as such a service would be extremely expensive.  The Government have not accepted the need for such a service which would, in effect, be tantamount to lowering the school entry age.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that the Government have attempted to implement a proposal to raise the school entry age.  Would the Minister not accept that the provision of pre-school facilities for all children would be better than the present <i>ad hoc</i> system whereby only those areas which have the financial or other capacity to provide such a facility for their children effectively ensures that only the better off can avail of pre-school facilities?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a matter for discussion. The &ldquo;Ages for Learning&rdquo; recommends what I have already quoted.  I would point out that the Minister for Health under the Children's (Care and Protection) Bill, 1985, allows for the setting down of standards with regard to registration for day care and pre-school centres which are in operation throughout the country at present.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister deal with the point which I made that the effect of allowing the provision of pre-schooling to be handled by voluntary groups effectively means that those who are most in need of pre-schooling are those who do not get it because of lack of finance or whatever other reason?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a matter of opinion. The Department do not wish to become involved in pre-schooling because it would be tantamount to lowering the school entry age and would prove quite expensive.</P>

      <P>The infants school has never had a remedial teaching post assigned to it. There is, however, an application from the school for such a post and this is being considered in the context of the priority of need in schools generally and the availability of such posts in the current school year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has given an identical reply to that which I received in October last to the same question regarding the same school.  Nothing has changed since then.  Could I ask the Minister if his Department have been made aware that this school is in dire need of a remedial teacher?  There is a trained remedial teacher on the staff but, due to the teacher/pupil ratio, the teacher has not worked in that context.  I would also ask the Minister if he is aware that in this school there are at least eight to ten pupils in each class who urgently need remedial teaching and in each class there are a similar number of pupils who cannot even read in spite of the fact that they have been at school for a number of years?  In those circumstances, would the Minister accept that the services of a remedial teacher are very badly needed at this school?</P>

      <P>I accept that there is a need for remedial teachers.  There are approximately 300 applications before <Col N="20" /> the Department.  These have to be examined by the Department's inspectorate. Remedial teaching at primary level is a matter in the first instance for the child's class teacher.  The temporary ninth assistant was allowed exceptionally in this school for the 1983-84 school year.  I understand that teacher was assigned to remedial duties by the school authorities. A special remedial teacher was never appointed to the school, but an application is now before the Department.

My information is that there are 267 pupils for the year starting September 1986.  There are 69 new entrants, 143 senior infants and 55 first class pupils.  If the teaching staff remain at the same level they will be teaching classes of approximately 40 pupils which is next to impossible, particularly with new infants.

      <P>My information is that the distance is about 500 yards and that there are footpaths on both sides of the road for most of that journey.  I accept that this applies to thousands of other pupils who have to walk to and from school.  In the context of the Navan by-pass being completed I will arrange to have the transport service and the pick up point re-examined from that point of view.</P>

It is CIE bureacracy that is responsible for 300 children being asked to use a very narrow footpath on a very dangerous road.  That is not very satisfactory and I should like to appeal to the Minister to ask CIE to reconsider their decision.  The company was asked to <Col N="23" /> change the arrangements before but they refused.  For the sake of the children will the Minister tell the company to change the transport arrangement?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a matter for the board of management of each post primary school to formulate its own policy on intake of pupils in the light of the accommodation available in the school.  I do not consider that the failure of any applicants for admission to Collinstown Park Community School to secure admission means that that school is not fulfilling the task for which it was planned.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that the pupils from St. Bernadette's School, Quarryvale, will not have access to Collinstown Park Community School this September and as a result will have to find a school outside the area?  Is the Minister aware that most of the pupils in that area of high unemployment do not have the £5 per week required to transport them to a school outside the area? The Minister indicated in the course of a reply to me that school transport is not available to students in that position.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The question refers to other matters.  There has been a large growth in the number of pupils in Neilstown, Rowlagh and Quarryvale areas and that could not have been anticipated by the Department or the planning section of Dublin County Council.  Had they been aware of this in advance Collinstown Park Community School would not have been built for more than 1,000 pupils.  In an area where numbers grow <Col N="25" /> so rapidly it is not the policy of the Department to provide permanent accommodation for all the pupils.  I note that most of the 515 pupils in Collinstown Park are from the north Clondalkin area and previously attended the primary schools in Neilstown, Rowlagh and Quarryvale.  It is normal procedure that some pupils are anxious to attend a secondary school outside their area.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that there is no other school in the area for these pupils?  The Minister has admitted that the Department did not take into account the rate of growth in the catchment area with the result that pupils from St. Bernadette's, Quarryvale, have been rejected by Collinstown Park Community School?  Those pupils do not have any place to go to.  This is an impoverished area and there are lots of single and deserted mothers who cannot afford the time or the money to sent their children outside the area.  Has the Minister any plans to deal with that problem?  Surely the Department must have some responsibility over the board of management of Collinstown Park Community School.</P>

While a decision in regard to the precise division of the proceeds has not yet been taken, I can assure the Deputy that I will be endeavouring to ensure that the needs of sport are fully taken into <Col N="28" /> consideration.  I join with the Deputy in recognising the benefit that can be got from an institute of sport.  I had occasion recently to visit Thomond College, where physical education teachers are trained, and I was delighted to see the forward thinking among the staff and the directors. They recognise that the facilities they have could be used off-season to help develop young athletes and for coaching.  The college has appointed a special teacher to promote the facilities of the college for use by people in the area.  That is a step forward and I hope other institutes and sporting organisations will avail of those facilities.</P>

I would not like to think that whatever facilities will be provided from the proceeds of the National Lottery will be used solely for the purposes of one small section of our community.  I sincerely hope that all of the facilities will be made available to all of the people irrespective of where they come from, or their financial standing.  I recognise the tremendous advantage to the country of our having a proper sport and physical recreation policy.  The benefits to be gained by having such a policy will be savings in terms of health bills, prison places and crime and vandalism.

I repeat that those who were selected were selected on the basis of their interest in and commitment <Col N="31" /> to sport and their professional backgrounds. I would hate to think that, in examining the facilities required, any of us would put local interests before the overall good.  I am quite happy that those serving on the committee are people with a background that any country would be proud to have serving on a committee. The fact that they are from one part of the country or the other should not make the slightest difference.  The question of where or how this sports centre or other facilities will be located will be a matter to be discussed later on.  It is not for this committee to decide on that.  They are there to decide on what facilities we should have.  The question of location will be taken into account when we are considering the timing and allocation of funds for these facilities.</P>
      <P>I would like it to go on the record of this House that I am satisfied that the members who have served on this committee, irrespective of where they come from have done so for the best interests of the country and not to project any local interest.

      <P>I am of course concerned about any matter affecting access to third level education by our young people. However, the factors affecting participation in third level education are many and varied.  They include social and attitudinal elements, questions of individual ability, opportunities for employment in an area as well as financial considerations. Consequently, comparisons of participation rates on a county basis are not necessarily significant when taken on their own.  Certainly, proximity to a third level institution is a factor affecting participation but even there the correlation is not consistent as Dublin is below the national average while my own county of Mayo is among the highest.</P>
      <P>Our third level institutions are well dispersed throughout the country.  Further regional technical colleges are planned for Thurles, Castlebar, Tallaght, Dún Laoghaire and Blanchardstown. The higher level of maintenance grants, which were further improved this year, payable under the Higher Education and the European Social Fund grants schemes to students who must live away from home, helps to defray the additional costs involved for students from rural areas.</P>

      <P>I accept, Deputy, that distance from a third level institution is a factor but, when you consider that Dublin has a very wide variety of third level institutions, it is below the national average. The national participation rate in 1980 was 20 per cent.  Carlow, for instance, had a rate of 29 per cent which was the highest in the country and Dublin had an average of 17 per cent.

      <P>The many views and comments contained in the large number of submissions received and made at meetings in regard to the Green Paper <i>Partners in Education</i> are at present under detailed consideration.  When this consideration has been completed, in the near future, I will decide on the next steps to be taken.

      <P>The Minister referred to Question No. 19, which is part and parcel of the total package known as the Green Paper, whatever kind of package educational interests deem that to be.  Has the Minister taken into account the very serious views expressed by the City of Dublin VEC in relation to the proposals put forward by certain vested interests within the colleges, certainly within the Dublin Institute of Technology? Is the Minister aware that the proposals and views in relation to a totally independent DIT put forward by some interested groups have not been sufficiently thought through as to the future status, terms of reference and the type and quality of education in these colleges? I put it to the Minister that the City of Dublin VEC are extremely concerned at what they regard as misrepresentation of the facts?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to go into details in regard to this, but the Deputy will be aware that on several occasions the Minister has expressed openness on all views with regard to the Green Paper. These matters are being considered in detail and I am quite sure some of the views expressed by the Deputy have been referred to in submissions to the Minister.</P>

      <P>Have the Department even now considered the possibility, probability or feasibility of greater freedom of action for these colleges without total independence, or have the Department come down in favour of any specific proposals or conclusions?  My information is, and I am sure Deputy Mac Giolla agrees with me, that it is not <Col N="36" /> understood by the City of Dublin VEC that their last visit to the Department was to be the ultimate part of the process of discussion and consultation in relation to the DIT.  During the course of that discussion my information is that very important aspects in regard to future needs in third level education in the Dublin region and, indeed nationally, in terms of developments in Britain and elsewhere, were considered still to be open ended.</P>

      <P>The purpose of a Green Paper is to invite discussion with regard to proposals.  This Green Paper was published last November.  Submissions were invited before 28 February last.  Ninety submissions have been received to date and others are still coming in.  Detailed discussions with the major interested groups on their submissions commenced towards the end of March and representatives of 29 organisations have been interviewed.  These meetings were completed recently.  The next step is to commence preparations and memoranda in draft for the Government &mdash; heads of Bills which will provide for the establishment of the DIT and each RTC as an independent self-governing institution.</P>

      <P>I would remind the Minister that a commitment was given to the City of Dublin VEC that a further submission from them in relation to the DIT would be very fully considered.  The future development of DIT, as outlined, as put by the City of Dublin VEC, was referred to in terms of &ldquo;half way house&rdquo; and it was put to the VEC that a fuller response was required.  In view of that it appeared quite clear to the VEC that this fuller response would be considered fully before any proposals would be put to the Cabinet.</P>

Participants should, therefore, be working in an approved child care setting from which base they would be released to attend classes on two days each week during the academic year.  Participants should be in their normal employment on the other three days each week.  Accordingly, the question of funding for these students should not arise.</P>

Is he aware that there can be delays of between six and 12 months in the case of many pupils, from the date of referral from the classroom to the date of assessment?  Will he not agree that that in itself can cause considerable damage to a pupil already at acute disadvantage because of some disability?

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take together Deputy De Rossa's and Deputy Ahern's questions about this dispute.  The origin of the dispute lies in a claim by the unions involved for a £15 per week pay increase under the 25th pay round, a shorter working week without loss of earnings, and an additional two days' annual leave.  At that time pay guidelines generally had not emerged and the corporation were reluctant to become a trend setter for public service pay.  The unions rejected the corporation's approach and on 30 November 1985 the claims were submitted to the Labour Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="44" /> Conciliation conferences took place on 17 January and 6 February 1986.  At that stage a Government offer on public sector pay had emerged and at the February conciliation conference the corporation made an offer in line with the public sector offer.  The unions again rejected this offer and, as no further progress was possible, the claim was referred to the Labour Court.  A court hearing took place on 13 February 1986 and the court issued a recommendation on the claim on 21 March 1986.</P>
    <P>The court upheld the corporation's offer.  Following ballots of their members, unions rejected the Labour Court recommendation and served formal notice of strike action to commence yesterday.  While the dispute is primarily one between the corporation and the unions representing general operatives, one union has extended its picketing to Dublin County Council.</P>
    <P>In view of the fact that the Labour Court have already issued a recommendation in this case, which the unions concerned have rejected, I see no point in asking the court to get involved at this stage.

      <P>I am sure the Minister is aware that the reason the unions are looking for a rise of £15 per week rather than a percentage rise, which is being promoted as the norm in the public service, is that the majority of these people are low paid manual employees and a percentage increase would be worth practically nothing to them.  In view of the inconvenience and health hazard which will arise very shortly &mdash; the corporation handle between 3,000 to 4,000 tonnes of rubbish per week &mdash; would the Minister not consider it necessary for him to step in to bring the sides together to find an amicable arrangement? It is clear in all these disputes that an arrangement has to be found at the end of the day.</P>

      <P>The Deputy's question and <Col N="45" /> his supplementary, and the question put down by Deputy Ahern, referred to my position as Minister for Labour and the role of the Labour Court.  I have had time to look at this matter in some detail and, as I said in my reply, the Labour Court have been involved and they have made a recommendation.  In view of what has happened to date and the stage at which this dispute is, the request for me to ask the Labour Court to intervene at this stage is not constructive.</P>

      <P>It is two months since the Labour Court made a recommendation. As Deputy De Rossa said, and as the Minister knows, the majority of people on strike can ill afford it because they have a take home pay of only about £100.  A flat increase of 7 per cent less levies and PRSI would mean about £4.50 to them, compared with the 7 per cent which was offered to public servants who are on far higher salaries.  The Minister has considerable powers under the Labour Court Act and in less important disputes he has intervened very quickly. In the interests of these people who cannot afford to go on strike, and who do not wish to strike but feel they are justified in making this claim, I ask the Minister to intervene at an early date.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the seriousness with which Deputy Ahern and Deputy De Rossa have brought their responsibility to bear on this matter. There are professional negotiators on the union side, in the Department of Labour and in the Labour Court, and I do not believe it is helpful if we give the impression that we are available to intervene in any dispute, from whatever side of the House.  The Labour Court provide a process of conciliation and make recommendations. That process has been invoked and a recommendation has emerged.  I regret that strike action was voted upon by all the people involved, particularly having regard to the fact that they are low paid employees.  Let me as Minister for Labour reiterate that my responsibility is to ensure that the machinery of industrial relations is functioning, is <Col N="46" /> available and has been discharged.  That machinery is still available.  The Labour Court are still there and the institutions and the parties to the dispute can still return to the negotiating table to talk. That is the way this matter might be resolved now.</P>

      <P>I would refer the Deputies to my reply to their Private Notice Questions on 13 May 1986 which raised the same issues. I have already made it clear to the union concerned in this dispute &mdash; the Union of Profesional and Technical Civil Servants &mdash; that I am prepared to continue negotiations with them with a view to securing an agreement on the same broad lines as that for the teachers, and with a view to exploring the union's contention that there were special features in individual arbitration findings which would merit special treatment.

      <P>Since we put down these questions this morning &mdash; the Minister may be able to confirm it &mdash; there has been an escalation of the dispute by both sides.  I understand the Minister said the <Col N="47" /> Army would go into the dairies to undertake the testing of milk so that butter could go into intervention.  The union have said if that is so, from 5 o'clock this evening not alone will they intensify the dispute &mdash; some weeks ago they gave notice that they would withdraw the beef classification officers &mdash; but they will also withdraw the inspectors in the two sheep slaughtering areas &mdash; Anglo-Irish in Ballymun and El-Al in Ballyhaunis.

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>There are nine categories, members of the UPTCS, involved. The Minister saw fit to pay to three categories the full conciliation and arbitration award.  Would he now pay the six remaining categories their full award?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>As Minister for the Public Service the operation of the agricultural services is not my responsibility.  I am, however, aware that today the Department of Agriculture have taken certain steps and, as indicated by Deputy Ahern, certain courses of action may be taken as a consequence of which there is a further probability of escalation in this unfortunate and, in my view, unnecessary dispute.  I have been and remain available to negotiate with representatives of the UPTCS.  I want to reiterate formally and solemnly in this House that I believe that we can do serious business together.  I know that I have the felexibility within the framework of the overall Government decision to do that business.</P>
      <P>We have offered to pay in full three of the nine awards.  That payment has not yet been made because the unions in question have not accepted our offer to pay in full three of the nine awards.  I make that technical correction to what Deputy Ahern otherwise correctly put on the record of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to say, particularly to Deputy <Col N="48" /> Noonan who has responsibility for Agriculture on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party, that the damage, existing and potential, to the Irish economy is way in excess of the scale of the justice and legitimacy of the claim on which the members involved are taking industrial action at the moment.  Let me reiterate in full the statement of the position that I made in relation to this matter previously dated 23 May:</P>
    <P>The Minister</P>
    <P>&mdash; that is myself &mdash;</P>
    <P>was quite prepared to accept that the position of each side should be recognised by the other i.e. any settlement should be without prejudice to the rights of UPTCS to pursue their claim for full payment and equally without prejudice to the Government's position that payment of full retrospection or a commitment to such payment was not possible.</P>
    <P>Secondly, I indicated that I could offer UPTCS <i>ex gratia</i> payments on the same general basis as other groups had got. Thirdly, I also indicated that I was prepared to explore further the union's contention that there were features in the individual findings which would merit special treatment.  Indeed, as far back as January last various offers on the individual findings had been made, including an offer to implement in full the finding in the case of the beef classification officers because of the special features of that finding.</P>
    <P>Finally, UPTCS, however, indicated that they could not agree to anything less than virtually full restrospection for all groups and the meeting, which was held on 22 May, ended on the basis that they would report back to their executive committee.</P>
    <P>I understand the legitimate concern of every Deputy in this House and in particular the spokesperson for the Opposition. I want to reiterate that the basis of a settlement is available to the individuals involved, that I am prepared and willing to negotiate that settlement and, having regard to the potential and possibly real <Col N="49" /> damage to our agricultural economy, I invite them to come back in and talk to me.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>We on this side of the House acknowledge the difficulties regarding the agricultural sector, but right throughout the teachers' dispute the argument was that the Government supported conciliation and arbitration but that the money involved was just too large.  In this case the money involved is not too large, and the Minister is making renegotiations impossible by adding in the condition that it is a settlement in line with the <i>ex gratia</i> payment arrangement which was used to half solve the teachers' dispute.  If the Minister wishes to have meaningful negotiations and to stop this very dangerous dispute &mdash; which nobody wishes to see happen &mdash; in just under an hour from now, he must remove the conditions and meet UPTCS without these conditions.  I give the Minister an opportunity to remove that precondition in the House now.  That would be very helpful.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that Deputy Ahern is expressing the concern of his party in a responsible manner.  I reiterate that I am not laying down preconditions to any discussions with this union.  I am simply stating the factual basis on which we are prepared to negotiate and talk to the unions.  We have not exhausted the room for manoeuvre that we possess. That is not a precondition; that is a statement of where we are.  I do not want to convey a false position to either the Deputies in this House or to the representatives of the workers involved.  That is not a precondition in my language.  That is an honest statement of where we are, and I want the public at large and the media to understand that there are no preconditions on our side other than the statement of the position I have already reiterated here today.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>As I understand it, the money involved in this case is £3 million or thereabouts on the six claims.  The unions have stated that what they wish to <Col N="50" /> have is full payment in line with the three categories of their colleagues who have been offered the full award in conciliation and arbitration.  They have stated that they will talk about that payment on the basis of paying it between now and 1991. They have stated also that the arbitrator offered them the award from 1 May and that they would be prepared to delay the implementation day to June, July, August or September.  It seems in this case &mdash; I have not all the facts or the advisers that the Minister has &mdash; that these people &mdash; who have no past history of industrial action to this extent &mdash; had no intention of going into the area of sheep slaughterhouses until the Army were threatened on them some hours ago.  The Minister has very little time and very little flexibility with 55 minutes to go before the escalation around the country of this dispute.  He said in his statement in this House today that any arrangements he can enter into and the flexibility he has received from the Cabinet are based on agreement in line with the teachers' dispute on <i>ex gratia</i> payments. He knows that that is unacceptable. He must say categorically that he will negotiate without preconditions, or the dispute goes ahead in 55 minutes.</P>

      <P>While I recognise the necessity of this amendment, in view of the fact that the Bill is only now coming before the House on Committee Stage it indicates a lack of urgency on the part of the Government in relation to dealing with poverty.  While many fine speeches are made by members of the Government about looking after the worst off in society, it is clear that the long time it has taken for the Bill to reach even this Stage indicates a lack of understanding of the reality of poverty.  I do not want the amendment to pass without making the point that, if the Government had been serious about this issue, the Bill would have been before this House in January 1982 and would have been passed by January 1983 instead of almost four years later.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMcCarthy" hpid="Dr. McCarthy Dr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact that the Minister has had to insert this amendment is a grave indictment of the Government's programme &mdash; or lack of it &mdash; in relation to the alleviation of poverty.  Since the Bill was completed in Seanad Éireann on 18 July 1985 one would have thought that there was adequate time to have it introduced in this House long before now.  Fine Gael and Labour in their Joint Programme for Government indicated that the social problems relating to poverty would be one of their prime concerns and that they intended to have a very detailed and specific programme to alleviate poverty.  However, it is three and a half years since the Government took office and we are only now reaching the final Stages of the Bill in this House. It shows the Government's lack of concern in this area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with the two previous speakers.  The Bill was initiated in the Seanad in March 1985 and it was envisaged that the new agency would be in operation before the end of that year.  However, it was not possible to introduce the Bill in this House until February 1986, when there was a protracted and detailed discussion on Second Stage. Various speakers contributed and, as I said in my reply, many contributions were <Col N="144" /> devoted to social welfare provisions which were not relevant to the Bill.  Prior to March 1985 much discussion and thought went into the preparation of the Bill and the Government set up an interim board to advise them on the best provisions for the Bill.  Every care was taken to ensure that when the Bill was produced it would contain a consensus of views.  It is not easy to rush that kind of procedure, especially when one is consulting various groups, and the interim board had to examine the submissions made to them, including one from the Commission on Social Welfare.  The Bill was certainly not put together in haste and much consideration and care was given to its formulation.  We hope to conclude the Bill at 7 o'clock this evening and to ensure that it is enacted as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMcCarthy" hpid="Dr. McCarthy Dr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State has attempted to blame Members on this side of the House for the long delay in the Bill going through the House.  However, I should like to remind the Minister that the Bill was first introduced in this House on 25 February 1986.  There was a detailed debate on it, but the Minister's rather dismissive comments about people who spent a long time adverting to social welfare payments and how they affected people's lives are not very helpful.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State and his colleague, Minister Hussey, are in direct conflict in regard to this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In her address to this House in February the Minister stated quite clearly that, if we are to devise adequate policies to tackle poverty on an overall basis, we must address all aspects of Government activity to see where Government policies and programmes impact on poor people and how these policies and programmes might be revised more effectively to address the problem of poverty. She had earlier pointed out the fact that it is sometimes said that in Government, concerns and interests in social policy come second to economic policy.  She stated that it is, however, impossible to draw a clear distinction between what is economic policy and what is social policy. <Col N="145" /> She said the biggest problem facing this country is the level of unemployment, which is a major social and uneconomic problem.  Clearly the Minister had interpreted the problems to poverty as being effected by various causes, including inadequate social welfare payments.  The adoption by the Minister of State of a dismissive attitude is reprehensible and is in direct conflict with his Minister's thinking.</P>

      <P>I take issue with the Minister on that comment.  I assure the House as spokesman for the main Opposition party that at no stage did we attempt to prolong discussion just for the sake of continuing talking.  Our contributions to the discussion were made in a worthwhile fashion.  The fact that the Bill has taken from 25 February until today to reach finality is not because of any lack of goodwill on the part of the members of the main Opposition party.  We have fallen over backwards to accommodate the Government in relation to this Bill.  I <Col N="147" /> received a telephone call yesterday morning from the Government Whip and agreed to the completion of the Committee and Report Stages today having discussed the matter with him.  That alone should reassure the Minister that there has not been any lack of goodwill on my behalf or that of my party.  We certainly did not prolong the debate simply for the sake of doing so.</P>

      <P>Section 4 (1) (a) would then state:</P>
      <P>(1)  The Agency shall have the following general functions&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  advising and making recommendations to the Government on all aspects of economic and social planning in relation to poverty in the State;</P>
      <P>I put down this amendment because I consider that poverty is not simply a matter of social welfare payments or schemes, nor should it be the sole responsibility of the Minister for Social Welfare.  There is no doubt that without our social welfare system the poverty in our society would be far greater.  In many cases, however, the social welfare payments received by people leave them very much in the poverty trap.  The poverty trap often prevents people from getting out of the category of social welfare recipients.</P>

    <P>I have proposed that the agency should <Col N="148" /> report to the Government rather than the Minister because it is the responsibility of the Government to deal with the question of poverty rather than the responsibility of any single Minister.  Poverty is emphasised and in many cases created in areas of life other than social welfare. There are the areas of education, law, housing, the environment in which people live and which are the responsibility of Ministers other than the Minister for Social Welfare.  In the area of health, as has been shown by many surveys, the poorer one is the worse one's health is likely to be, and the worse also is the health service one is likely to get.  All of these areas are important to people in poverty.</P>
    <P>This agency should be reporting directly to the Government, if for no other reason than to indicate that it is a much wider problem.  If the agency report simply to the Minister for Social Welfare, I have no doubt that a lot of the work done by the agency will be filtered by the Department, and in many cases other Departments may not accept the responsibility to act on recommendations made by the agency.  Other Ministers in Government might also see it as purely a social welfare problem.  That is basically the reason I am pressing that the agency should report directly to the Government rather than to the Minister for Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>Before I finish let me say that I regard this method of dealing with poverty as largely window dressing.  I do not see how this agency, under this Government or under a Fianna Fáil Government, can tackle the problems of poverty, because poverty is not simply a state into which people choose to go.  There is little doubt that a very high percentage of poverty at the moment is the result of unemployment. Unemployment does not occur simply out of the blue.  It arises from the pursuit of particular social and economic policies by Governments, and by the Governments which we have had in this State for the past 60 years who have pursued a particular approach in relation to our economy and the development of our resources.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="149" /> I do not see an agency like this doing other than researching the causes of poverty, producing reports and making recommendations and, perhaps, in some circumstances, providing an opportunity for some of the poor themselves to actually get involved in trying to tackle their own problems.  Fundamentally poverty can only be tackled by the Government implementing wide-ranging economic policies which, as far as I am concerned, would have to be socialist policies.  Clearly the private enterprise policies which have been pursued and continue to be pursued and promoted have failed and continue to fail.  It has been seen for generations that that kind of approach has always left the poor in our society. There is no likelihood that this agency will overcome that problem.</P>
    <P>Another section of the Bill seeks to have plans produced and laid before the Minister every three years.  There is another section which states that this agency will be never ending.  That is, in fact, the case.  Unless we change the whole social structure of this society of ours, this agency will continue in existence and will always have to deal with poverty because poverty is endemic to the kind of economic system we have. While I am arguing these amendments which will hopefully make this Bill a bit more effective, the agency certainly will not cure poverty in our society.</P>

      <P>One of the functions of the agency is to advise and make recommendations to the Minister on all aspects of economic and social planning in relation to poverty in the State.  I would like to know what degree of autonomy or independence from governmental policy the agency will have.  Will they be free of advice or interference?  For example, if they analyse critical problems within the implementation of the Social Welfare Act which are, in their opinion, causative factors in the development of poverty, and recommend changes to the Minister, will such changes be implemented?  Will they have the same degree of independence as the Economic and Social Research Institute who report honestly <Col N="150" /> to the Government and the public on various matters without appearing to have to kow-tow to the Government policy of the day?  Will they be able to submit reports that are contrary to Government policy irrespective of what Government are in office at the time, or will they be contained in such a way by the Minister that reports which are contentious and controversial will not be allowed?  I would like to know that at this stage.  Perhaps the Minister of State would inform us.</P>

      <P>I want to assure Deputies that there will not be any form of censorship or filtering of proposals or recommendations from the agency.  They will be quite free to make proposals and suggestions and recommendations and offer criticism and so on.  They will not be hemmed in in any way.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy De Rossa that poverty is not just a matter for the Minister for Social Welfare or for the Department of Social Welfare.  Other areas are also involved.  As the Deputy said, housing, health, education, agriculture and even forestry and fisheries can be involved in some way or other.</P>
      <P>It is necessary that the agency report to the Minister who would be responsible to the Government.  It has been intended from the outset, as set out in the Programme for Government, that the agency would be the responsibility of the Minister for Social Welfare.  They will be dealing directly with that Minister in all aspects of their activities &mdash; financing, strategic planning, personnel matters and reporting.  It is appropriate that they should also make their recommendations to the same Minister.  There will be a poverty unit in the Department which will have a co-ordinating function, both within the Department and with other Departments in matters relating to poverty.  These matters will include all aspects of social and economic planning relating to poverty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I refer Deputies to section 4 (1) (a) which states that the agency shall advise and make recommendations to the Minister on all aspects of economic and social <Col N="151" /> planning in relation to poverty in the State.  I also refer them to section 4 (2) (e) which says that the agency shall have the function of establishing and maintaining contact with such Departments of State, statutory and other bodies and voluntary agencies as seem appropriate to the agency to enable them to perform their other functions.</P>
    <P>It is quite clear from that that the suggestion in Deputy De Rossa's amendment is already well covered in the existing provisions.  There evidently is a fear that recommendations made to the Minister rather than to the Government could be lost sight of, but I see very little danger of this happening.  The agency will have the right, under section 4 (2) (g), to publish any reports they consider appropriate. In any event, recommendations sent to the Minister would be likely to be referred to the Department of Social Welfare as the co-ordinating Department, in the first instance, for the normal interdepartmental consultation process.  For these reasons, for consistency the agency should deal with the Department directly in this as in the rest of their activities.  This procedure will in no way detract from the status of their recommendations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMcCarthy" hpid="Dr. McCarthy Dr. McCarthy">

      <P>I thank the Minister of State for his reply.  It is at least heartening that he believes the agency will have independence in making reports which may not be in accord with the thinking of the Minister or the Government of the time. I ask the Minister to ensure that this is so and that the reports of the agency will take real cognisance of the causation and effects of poverty and the various interrelated factors.  I ask the Minister to ensure that these reports will be compiled without any political voice.  It is imperative &mdash; and I say this advisedly &mdash; that the members of the agency should be chosen with the utmost diligence, that they should not be chosen because of the knowledge of the Minister or some of her colleagues as to their allegiance to any political grouping.  This is a word of warning. If the agency were to be comprised <Col N="152" /> mainly or totally of members who formed a collection of political cronies, there is no way in which reports critical of Government policy would be produced. The agency would be constrained from so doing by their political beliefs and because of their allegiances and alliances to their masters in Government.  I hope this will be borne in mind.</P>
      <P>I take one example from this year's budget.  If one had an independent, nonpolitically aligned agency, the percentage increases granted in social welfare payments would be recommended to be granted to child dependants.  For the first time to my knowledge, those percentage increases did not apply to child dependants, which was unusual and unique. This implied that the child dependants were not deserving of such increases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us be quite clear and explicit on this.  When the Minister spoke on this matter in the House she did not attempt in any way to differentiate between the various causative factors which can produce poverty.  She stated that one could not disassociate Government economic policies from financial situations which might cause poverty to a number of people.  She did not omit to mention that one of the great social problems facing the country is unemployment. That, too, has caused a considerable degree of poverty.  I am adverting to the omission with regard to percentage increases for child dependants.  I hope a politically unbiased agency will report to the Minister that this cannot be allowed, being something which will increase poverty and that the agency will ask the Minister to grant due increases as heretofore.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section (4) (1) (c) states that the agency shall examine the nature, causes and extent of poverty in the State and for that purpose the promotion, commission and interpretation of research.  I trust the agency will analyse poverty critically and have a clear view of what poverty means. Do they consider that poverty should be <Col N="153" /> defined in absolute terms, for example, as insufficient resources to provide some basic minimum need, such as, might be assessed by a nutritional survey.  Alternatively, would they assess poverty in relative terms as the EC tend to do?  In relative terms, it can be defined as a lack of resources sufficient to provide normal living standards.  In that case one compares one section of the Community as against the normal living standards of the others.  In that way a definition is reached. One might say the poverty line is defined where someone has an income of 50 per cent less than the average net income in each country.  This must be analysed.  We must recognise the fact that we have so many social welfare recipients.  Tragically the figure has increased because there are so many people unemployed.  That is an indictment of the Government's policies and only they can solve that.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, a survey was carried out at EC level between 1976 and 1980 on the extent of poverty in various member states of the Community.  It showed that 23.1 per cent of households in Ireland lived below the poverty line. This was the highest of any EC country. It was followed by Italy with 21.8 per cent and France and Luxembourg with 14 per cent.  In the light of this and having regard to section 4 (1) (c) there should be a careful analysis as to why poverty is at a lower level in other EC countries and why it is so high in Ireland.  What are we doing wrong?  These matters need very careful evaluation.  If economic conditions in other countries are assessed and analysed critically I have no doubt that the agency will be able, to a large extent, to recognise what is wrong.</P>

      <P>The more I think about this Bill the more unreal it is.  The Minister indicated that the agency will have direct contact with other Departments. That is precisely what it will be, contact.  There is no indication in the Bill that the agency will have any power whatsoever to instruct or direct any Department to initiate or to stop any course of action.  Likewise, there is no indication in the Bill that the Minister for Social Welfare will have power to direct a Minister or a Department to initiate or to desist from any particular line of action.  Poverty is the responsibility of the Government.  In practice, that would mean the Department of the Taoiseach. It would make sense if a Minister of State with direct responsibility for this agency was appointed, as was done in a previous administration.  The Taoiseach's Department would obviously have direct access to all Departments and would have far more clout in relation to what other Departments are doing or are proposing to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To take an example, in preparing the Government's document, <i>Building on Reality</i>, responsibility was not given to the Minister for Social Welfare, the Minister for Education or to any other Minister because it was a major statement of Government policy in relation to how they saw the economy and the social services being developed or undeveloped depending on the point of view.  If we take this question of poverty as being a major problem of crisis proportions, the Government should take responsibility for the agency.  It is on that basis that I am pressing this amendment.  In <i>Building on Reality</i>&mdash; and I do not intend to debate that document &mdash; there is a direct conflict between what the Minister and the Government are saying in relation to their intentions with regard to this agency to overcome poverty and the direction in which <i>Building on Reality</i> is pushing the whole social services area, education and so on.  That is why the more I contemplate this Bill the more I despair of this agency <Col N="155" /> doing anything other than giving the impression that poverty is being dealt with.  That may sound a little pessimistic and I am not normally a pessimistic person.</P>
    <P>If the Government were prepared to say they accept this as their responsibility and, in demonstrating that, will ensure that the Government, through the Department of the Taoiseach, will take a direct role in ensuring that whatever recommendations come from that agency will receive priority with all Departments then that would be fine.  There is nothing in the Bill to indicate that that will be the case.  That is the reason I am pressing this amendment.  It seems there is a need not only for the general public to understand the causes and the extent of poverty &mdash; and one of the general functions of the agency is to create that awareness &mdash; but also a need to create that awareness among the members of the Government. There is no doubt in my mind that, if we take the statements of the Minister for Finance in particular and apply them to the poor in our society, it is clear that the priority which the poor have under the present administration is very low indeed.  The Bill is an attempt &mdash; I am not suggesting that those who brought it forward are guilty of bad faith &mdash; to deal with the problem but I do not accept that in its present structure it is an indication that the Government are accepting the enormity of the poverty problem in our society.</P>

The members of that committee were very committed people who were involved in many areas dealing with poverty.  I have always held the view that combating poverty will involve changes in economic and social policies.  The agency will be free to put recommendations to the Minister.</P>

      <P>I do not propose to prolong the debate on this amendment but I must take up the point made by the Minister, that the agency will not have power to direct Departments.  I recognise that it would be nonsensical for an agency established by the Government to have the power to direct Ministers or the Government to take certain action.  I have referred to that point to highlight the fact that, while the agency have the power to contact other Departments under section 4 (2) (e), it does not have power to do anything else.  The Minister for Social Welfare will not have the power to insist on certain action being taken.  I was not arguing that the agency should have the power to direct Departments but if the agency were reporting directly to the Taoiseach, or a Minister in his Department it is possible that the recommendations would be taken up by the various Ministers.</P>

      <P>I will not get involved in an argument as to which Taoiseach might be better.  My argument is that the Department of the Taoiseach would clearly have a much greater influence on the other Ministers than would the <Col N="157" /> Department of Social Welfare or the Minister.  Recommendations from the Department of the Taoiseach would have far greater clout than recommendations from the Combat Poverty Agency or the Minister for Social Welfare.  This is an important point.  It would be an earnest of the Government's intention with regard to the agency if the Minister accepted the amendment.  I do not think acceptance of the amendment will result in major disruption in any Departments. It will mean the establishment of the poverty unit within the Department of the Taoiseach rather than within the Department of Social Welfare.  That may mean a transfer of staff from the Department of Social Welfare to the Department of the Taoiseach, but not much more.  I hope the mechanism involved is being put together and for that reason it is reasonable to ask the Minister to accept our amendment which would indicate a greater commitment by the Government to the elimination of poverty.</P>

Sufficient provision is being made in the Bill for the necessary contacts to be made with the other relevant Departments.  One could make the argument being put forward by Deputy De Rossa in respect of any activity in the State, that it should be centralised in the Taoiseach of the day, <i>uno duce una voce.</i> I am sure that is not what Deputy De Rossa is looking for but it is, in effect, what would happen.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 4, subsection (1), between lines 15 and 16, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(b) the promotion of the effective participation of, and consultation with disadvantaged people at all levels in the life of the State;&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Most people who are involved with the disadvantaged or those who are known as the poor say a very basic problem is that they are excluded from active participation in the social and political life going on around them.  In setting up an agency to deal with the question of poverty one of their primary functions should be the promotion of effective participation by and consultation with these people.  The tendency has been for people like ourselves in this House to make decisions on the basis of what we think is best for everyone outside.  We take an average view and assume that the problems as we understand them are the problems which directly affect people on the ground.  It is for that reason I would like to see this function included.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other functions under section 4 (1) include making recommendations to the Minister on all aspects of economic and social planning; initiation of measures aimed at overcoming poverty; examination of the nature, causes and extent of poverty; greater public understanding etc.  Nowhere in those four general functions does it say that the poor should be consulted or involved.  I am not just talking about consulted by or involved with the agency, but involved generally in the life of the community and society and consulted generally about what is happening in relation to their own lives, education and a whole range of other things.  This is an important amendment because it goes to the root of the problem. It actually obliges the agency to take into account the views and the feelings of the poor in deciding what their recommendations may be, or the actions they propose to initiate.  In the previous combat poverty effort between 1976 and 1980 various projects were established, very many of which did not involve the poor <Col N="159" /> directly.  In a number of these projects the poor and the disadvantaged were directly involved.  It is significant that the number of projects which have survived the extinction of the previous poverty agency are those which involved the disadvantaged. Those are the general points I want to make on that function.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very conscious of the alienation of many poor people, notably the young, from the processes of public life and the rest of society.  For this reason, I have considerable sympathy with the amendment and with what Deputy De Rossa has stated in support of it.  However, an amendment on these lines would need careful consideration before it could be considered for incorporation in the Bill.  I regret to say, the amendment proposed in its present form cannot be accepted.  There is, first of all, the problem of identifying and defining disadvantaged people and their representatives. They would have to be defined carefully if there were to be a legal obligation to consult them on various matters. I am afraid the description in the amendment is not sufficient.  The phrase &ldquo;at all levels in the life of the State&rdquo; also entails difficulty.  I cannot see how it can be ensured that any particular group will participate at all levels of the State's activities.</P>
      <P>There is also the matter of consultation. Large numbers of decisions must be made daily on all sorts of matters and the administrative process would be rendered impossible by the necessity to consult with one particular group on each and every one of these.  I suggest to the proposers of the amendment that this matter should be left, at least for the first year or two, to the agency whose functions are broad enough to enable them to consider increasing the participation of the poor in the life of the country as part of measures proposed to combat poverty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Indeed, I imagine this is a question which will exercise the agency from the start.  The agency have a specific function to foster community development as a <Col N="160" /> means of overcoming poverty and for this purpose, to act as a centre for counselling and training in community development. The interim board of the combat poverty organisation saw community development as a means of involving disadvantaged people in decision-making in matters affecting them.  It is to be expected that the agency will have regard to this objective in an active way.  This may not go as far as the proposers of the amendment want, but it would not be practical for the reasons stated to accept the amendment as it stands.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The points made by the Minister of State arise from a misreading of the amendment.  The amendment gives additional functions to the agency, one of which will be the promotion of the effective participation of and consultation with disadvantaged people at all levels in the life of the State. The amendment is not placing an obligation on every agency, Department and organisation within the State to consult with disadvantaged people.  It is giving a function to the poverty agency to promote that concept and idea.  Presumably, in their other functions of research and community development and so on they would implement that function.  If we accept this amendment or a form of it which would be broadly the same and would meet the Minister's drafting problems, at least the agency would be obliged to promote that idea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present they are not obliged to promote that idea.  They are obliged under their general functions to make recommendations to the Minister; to initiate measures to overcome poverty; to examine the nature, causes and extent of poverty; and to promote greater public understanding of poverty.  Under subsection (2) without prejudice to the generality of those four points they have functions of evaluating, advising and making recommendations to the Minister; the identification of possible new policies; the encouraging and giving of information to community development; and fostering and assisting in projects of <Col N="161" /> community development and activities to overcome poverty.  Nowhere in either the general functions or the sub-functions, if I might call them that, under subsection (2) is there an obligation on the agency to promote consultation with and the involvement of disadvantaged people in all of the layers of decision-making which directly affect their lives.  The amendment seeks the promotion of that concept. We do not like the idea that the Government's obligation to do it should be transferred to the agency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister spoke about binding the agency with a rigid form of legislation.  He said he wants the agency to be as free and, therefore, as effective as possible.  The point made by Deputy De Rossa is well taken by me and, I am sure, by the Minister.  Earlier, Deputy McCarthy asked why we have such a high level of poverty in Ireland. We all know that fundamental to the causes of poverty is the lack of control and power poor people have over their lives or over efforts to improve them. They have always been lacking in participation in the efforts to remove poverty. For too long we have had people here and throughout the western world talking about handouts, about giving some relief of poverty, rather than providing the means whereby those involved in poverty would be helped to help themselves.  This can be boiled down to the way in which communities have developed.  If poverty is to be tackled properly, people must be given power to find the means to ease the problems of the poor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have had other groups in the community who have found themselves powerless and we came up with some ideas.  For instance, we found it difficult to allow participation by women in power areas.  We have models in other areas on which we could base new methods in our efforts to fight poverty, and because of this I suggest that Deputy De Rossa's amendment could help.  We must realise that it is asking too much to suggest that one Minister could undertake the removal of poverty.  That would be a herculean task.  This is a Government <Col N="162" /> commitment and should not be the responsibility of one Minister only, but, unless we acknowledge that participation by and consultation with those affected by poverty will be necessary, we will not ease the problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy De Rossa and Deputy Barnes that poor people should be involved in all aspects of community effort.  Deputies know how difficult it is to achieve this and how hard it would be to write it into legislation. That would not achieve it.  It is expected that the activities of the agency will encourage participation by poor people, bearing in mind that the agency will be responsible for further community development. The agency are being given plenty of scope to do what Deputy De Rossa's amendment would have them do but the difficulty is to get that into legislation. There is provision in the Bill which recognises the need to involve poor people in matters affecting them.</P>
      <P>The community action approach would allow poor people to have a say in community development and I suggest that the matter be left until the Act has been in operation for a year or two.  The agency will have among their functions the general ability to involve the poor because they will consist of people familiar with poor people and they will know and understand their difficulties.</P>

      <P>The Minister has said that in the four general functions set out and the others provided for in subsection (2) the agency will not be precluded from doing what I am proposing in my amendment.  That is so.  The concept of community development is so broad that I would hazard a guess that the 165 Deputies in this House would each have a different definition of it.  We should include involvement, participation and consultation as set out in our amendment as one of the functions of the agency.  It is clear the Minister has made up his mind and I regret that.  It is the view of many who work daily with disadvantaged people that such involvement, participation and consultation should be an important function of the agency if they are to have any credibility with the people for whom they are supposed to work.  For that reason, I intend to press the amendment.</P>
      <P>I do not know if Report Stage is being taken today.  In that event there will not be time to take up this matter.  I had hoped that the Minister might reconsider his position and come back to us with an amendment on those lines that would eliminate the drafting or wording problems he foresaw in my amendment.  This is an important amendment and it should be included in the Bill.  I urge the Minister to accept it.</P>

      <P>Subsection (3) states that the Minister may, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, by regulations amend subsection (2) of the section so as to modify or withdraw any function to which that subsection relates, <Col N="164" /> or to confer such additional functions on the agency as the Minister thinks proper. I do not know the purpose of the subsection. I can understand the Minister requiring the power to provide additional functions but I do not understand why he feels the need to take the power to withdraw any functions.  That seems a rather odd thing to do.  We are talking about the Combat Poverty Agency and the Government and the Minister have presumably thought fit to include the functions in the Bill.  I am not happy that the Minister for Social Welfare, in consultation with the Minister for Finance, can withdraw any provision that has been passed by the House.  It is also a matter of concern to me that the Minister apparently can do this without coming back to the House and getting agreement here.</P>
      <P>Subsection (5) states that the agency shall in the performance of their functions comply with such directions as may be given to them from time to time by the Minister.  That seems a strange kind of power to give to the Minister.  It may be a common feature in other Bills in relation to agencies set up by the Government but I do not know.  This agency will deal with a sensitive area and with a wide range of policy issues concerning virtually all Departments.  It appears to me that subsection (5) could be open to abuse. I am not suggesting that the Minister present in the House has any intention of abusing that power but it appears to me that, if the agency came forward with particularly difficult proposals at a time when they would not be popular with the direction of Government policy or with certain Ministers, the agency would be obliged to comply with the directions given by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no limit put on the kind of directions that can be given or in what regard the agency will be directed by the Minister.  The phrase used is, &ldquo;in the performance of its functions&rdquo;.  That covers a very wide area.  Could the agency be directed to stop projects or not to employ certain individuals in community projects?  Could the agency be directed to withdraw recommendations made to a <Col N="165" /> Department or could they be directed to withdraw statements they made to the media on some aspects of policy?  If one takes subsections (3) and (5) together, it appears that the Minister of the day will have wide-ranging power over the agency and I am not happy about that.  It is particularly worrying when one considers that the Minister, under this legislation, will not have to come back to the House and explain the directions given or to have any regulations he has made agreed by the House.</P>

      <P>Section 4 (1) (c) states:</P>
      <P>the examination of the nature, causes and extent of poverty in the State. . . .</P>
      <P>At present we have two sections in society who are affected by poverty to a large extent.  I am concerned that the formation of this agency is just a cosmetic and face-saving exercise and that their recommendations will not be implemented by the Government.  Two sections of our community are suffering at this time from severe deprivation, both economically and socially.  We do not need any research groups or agencies to identify them.  On the one hand we have the elderly.  In 1981 there were 369,000 old people in this country, representing 10.7 per cent of the population.  Many of these people are living on the breadline because of inadequate State finances, and the fact that, in particular over the last three years, they got inadequate increases in their old age pensions.  As a consequence they are deprived of even the basic necessities of life.  That is a lesson the Government should clearly understand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Social welfare increases for the old or the unemployed must not just match the annual inflation rate but most outstrip it so that old people have sufficient financial resources to provide essentials, and maybe even the odd luxury.  As I said, in 1981 the old comprised 10.7 per cent of our population and between 1971 and 1981 our elderly population increased by 12 per cent.  Of these, 4 per cent, or 36 per cent of the population were over 75 <Col N="166" /> years of age, and it is obvious that these numbers will increase over the next decade.  It has been projected that the number of those over 65 years of age will increase by another 10 per cent in the next ten years, putting a major social responsibility on the State.  These people have given a great deal to this country and we must ensure that they do not spend their final years existing in miserable conditions.  There is a serious responsibility on any Government to provide adequate social and financial provisions for these people.</P>
    <P>It must be remembered that a person's standard of living does not solely depend on how much money he has in his pocket although that provides the necessities of basic living, but housing conditions are very important.  There seem to be more elderly people living in rural areas rather than in urban areas.  That tendency is particularly marked in some of the western counties like Leitrim, Roscommon and Mayo.  Many of these older people live in old houses which are very inadequately equipped and do not even have basic comforts.  This is very important because of our climate.  The Government do not need research groups or agencies to define these problems.  The Government should have a mechanism to provide basic comforts in these old houses. Three or four years ago a group of medical practitioners in a rural practice carried out a medico-survey of the elderly patients in their practice.  They found that 70 per cent of these people lived in substandard, unsuitable houses and 5 per cent had no indoor toilets or running water. It is a terrible indictment of any Government that this state of affairs should exist today.  This is a problem which only a Government can deal with and they do not need advice from any agency.</P>
    <P>Another obvious area of poverty is the unemployed and the Minister adverted to this in her speech.  I was relieved that she had not disassociated unemployment from poverty but recognised that they might be interlinked.  At present there are about 240,000 officially unemployed <Col N="167" /> and 160,000 of them are on unemployment assistance or long term unemployment payments.  Let no one try to convince me that social welfare payments for the long term unemployed are adequate to maintain a family.</P>

      <P>That is so, but I am pointing out a large area where poverty is rampant and we do not need any research groups or agencies to identify it because it is patently obvious that many families are living almost in penury and they will continue to merely exist unless the Government provide adequate State resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While it is obvious that many of the unemployed are living in penury, they are treated with scorn by some of those who are better off.  Among a certain section of the community the impression is given that a person is better off unemployed than working and that many people in receipt of unemployment benefit do not want to work.  This is the type of comment which all politicians should refute.  Most of those 240,000 unemployed would give their very eyes for a job if they could get one, but they cannot.  They do not wish to remain within financial constraints because of inadequate unemployment payments. People who make such absolutely fallacious comments suggesting that unemployed people are as well off as if they were working have never been inside an unemployment exchange in their lives. They do not even know what a dole queue looks like.  The agency will not need a great many research groups and they will clearly give recommendations to the <Col N="168" /> Minister on the very obvious needs of the aged and the unemployed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy De Rossa referred to subsections (3), (4) and (5) of this section which enable the Minister to amend by regulation the functions of the agency and to give directions to the agency from time to time regarding the performance of their functions.  The power to alter the agency's functions by regulation extends only to the functions outlined in subsection (2), that is, the specific or subsidiary functions of the agency.  This power does not extend to the general or basic functions of the agency contained in section 4(1).  The regulations in question will require the consent of the Minister for Finance.  It may also be noted that under section 22 every regulation made under the Bill when enacted must be laid before each House of the Oireachtas, which has the power to annul the regulations by resolution. This ensures that the Oireachtas will have the opportunity to comment on any changes in the functions of the agency.  It is envisaged that, in practice, the regulatory power given in these subsections would be used only, if ever, to expand the functions of the agency rather than restrict those functions in any way.</P>
      <P>Subsection (5) provides that:</P>
      <P>The Agency shall in the performance of its functions comply with such directions as may from time be given to it by the Minister.</P>
      <P>The subsection was put in as a standard provision.  It appeared previously in the National Community Development Agency Act, 1982, and the National Social Services Board Act, 1984, both of which dealt with agencies similar to the Combat Poverty Agency, and was not seen as a threat to the effective functioning of these bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first point I make in relation to this is, whether we agree with it or not, the Minister and the Government of the day have the overriding responsibility in all matters of public policy.  The establishment of the new agency will not in itself solve the problem of poverty.  They will <Col N="169" /> have a central role in identifying the causes and extent of poverty in Ireland and initiating measures to overcome it, but without a commitment by the Government of the day to putting into effect in their economic and social policies the measures necessary to address the needs of the poor, the work of the agency will have little effect.</P>
    <P>We must assume that the Minister shares with the agency a concern to tackle the problem of poverty.  For the effective operation of the agency there must be a degree of harmony between the agency and the Government, although not necessarily total agreement.  It might be thought that the Minister and the agency could in some instance be at loggerheads. This is unlikely where the parties involved are concerned sincerely to work in harness for a common aim but, if it arose, it would have to be dealt with by either or both sides and might conceivably result in resignations or removal of some situation without having to resort to the ultimate power which the Minister would have under the Bill to remove members of the agency from office.</P>
    <P>It could be argued that, in recent times, too little rather than too much ministerial control has led to failure in several areas of the public sector.  It is to be hoped that the need to exercise the powers given in section 4 (5) would rarely arise, if ever. However, the Government have considered in the present case that the Minister needs power to intervene.  Whether that power will ever be exercised will depend largely on the experience of the agency's operation.  The power to issue directions under section 4 (5) is, therefore, in no way a radical measure and is not likely to be used in the event of any fundamental difference of opinion between the Minister and the agency, should that arise.  The power to direct is limited very specifically to directions as to the performance of the agency's functions.  It has been drafted clearly to exclude any power to prevent the exercise of any of the functions laid down in the Bill including the important freedom to publish their reports.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me apologise to the Minister of State.  I misread.  I realise that section 22 refers to the making of regulations, and I have an amendment down seeking to make that a positive procedure rather than a negative one which is common in these Bills.</P>
      <P>Even with the provision that a regulation will be brought before the House, as section 22 stands the Minister is incorrect to say that the House will have an opportunity to comment on the regulations made.  I do not want to go into a debate on regulations but, while in theory that is the case, the reality and practice are that these regulations are never debated unless the Government choose to have them debated.  The Minister, I am sure, will realise that this is so.  That is why I have an amendment down seeking the making of positive rather than negative regulations.</P>
      <P>My point still stands that in the past in any Bills I have dealt with the Minister makes regulations to add on the detail, so to speak, of functions of a body or to extend the powers of a body.  In this subsection (3) the Minister is taking power to withdraw any function under subsection (2).  That is an extraordinary power.  If a function under subsection (2) is important enough to be included in the Bill, then surely it should not be open to what is in practice the arbitrary power of the Minister to withdraw that function. In practice as things stand, a regulation made by the Minister withdrawing a function will not be debated in this House. That is why I am drawing attention to that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other point in relation to subsection (5) is that again the Minister has indicated that it is not unusual to have that kind of power given to a Minister in relation to agencies under his control.  It is interesting to note that the subsection does not require the Minister for Social Welfare to consult the Minister for Finance although other subsections oblige him to do so.  I shall give an example of the kind of thing about which I am worried, a minor issue but one which could be extended.  I refer to the recent <Col N="171" /> experience of the Arts Council which produced their annual report and were instructed or directed &mdash; presumably under the same power which the Minister has in this Bill &mdash; to withdraw the report because the Department of the Taoiseach were not happy with its cover as it seemed to be critical of the Government's attitude to the arts.  That is a relatively minor issue, the country will not fall apart as a result of the report being withdrawn because of the cover but it indicates the kind of thinking which can grip a Minister or a Department when they are likely to be criticised by an agency under their control.  That is why I am concerned in relation to this agency because I hope they will be dealing with problems relating to the most disadvantaged people in society and they will, of necessity, have to be critical of Government policies and Ministers if they are to do their job correctly. That is inevitable and to give the Minister a blanket power to oblige the agency to comply with any directions given in relation to the performance of their functions is too wide a power to give.  That is why subsections (3) and (5) of section 4 confer far too much power on the Minister in relation to the agency and I am not happy about them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMcCarthy" hpid="Dr. McCarthy Dr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has said there is nothing sinister in regard to the subsections referred to.  If there is nothing to worry about, why was it felt necessary to insert them?  I am worried although the Minister attempted to reassure us earlier that the insertion of the subsection did not give cause for concern.  However, this section will ruin the independence of the agency because it is implicit that the Minister may issue such directions as he wishes to ensure that the functions undertaken by the agency will comply with his directions.  I worry that the subsection is a surreptitious attempt to muzzle the agency and that they will not be in a position to bring reports or recommendations to the Minister towards which he would not be favourably disposed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a very clear attempt to ensure <Col N="172" /> that the agency have no real independence and that they are purely a mouthpiece of the Minister's Department. Another problem which often arises in relation to agencies or organisations under departmental or ministerial control is that very often such agencies or organisations have a departmental ministerial nominee on them.  The purpose of selecting a departmental nominee is to ensure that the Minister from within can steer the thinking and attitudes of the agency concerned.  If the Minister's man is in the agency if anything contentious or politically offensive to the Minister's way of thinking arises, he can tell the other members that the Minister would not approve of such thinking and they would probably not pursue such a policy.  It is just as well to express these thoughts and to warn the Minister and anyone else concerned that there are inherent dangers in introducing these constraints on the independent working of the agency. I hope that subsection (5) has not been inserted to ensure that the agency is merely an instrument of the Minister's Department, guided by him through one of his nominees.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>I fail to understand the argument put forward by Deputy McCarthy who supported this subsection in the House when the national community development agency legislation was going through the House.  It is a standard provision and is always included in this type of legislation.  There is nothing new or sinister about it.  When the Deputy's party were in power it was also included in legislation.  The power given to the Minister in subsection (5) cannot be used to override or withdraw any of the functions of the agency.  However, the Minister might want the agency to look at a particular area or problem and he should have the necessary power to direct the agency to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This section should be seen as enabling the Minister to increase the work of the agency if an unforeseen or unexpected problem arises.  The Minister should have the necessary power.  It would be wrong to imagine that any Minister would see <Col N="173" /> this power as a means of preventing the agency from carrying out their functions. What would be the purpose in setting up the agency if the Minister were to use a section of this Bill to prevent the agency from functioning?  The case is being made on those grounds.  The Minister has the overall responsibility and this is a standard provision in legislation of this kind. It should be left there.</P>

      <P>5.  In page 5, between lines 45 and 46, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(4)  The Minister shall cause copies of all plans submitted to him under subsection (2) to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am proposing this new subsection because all the sections regarding the strategic plans envisage that they will be presented to the Minister.  The only point at which the Oireachtas will be brought into the picture will be when the Minister carries out a review of the operations of the agency.  The Oireachtas should have an important role in considering the strategic plans being proposed by the agency. I am not suggesting that the Dáil should have the power of veto on those plans, certainly not at present, although it is something that should be considered. Members of this House, through their experience in their constituencies, would have a contribution to make in relation to proposed plans.  Since this House is <Col N="174" /> the body establishing this agency, it is important that the long term, three year strategic plans should come before it.</P>
    <P>A number of other aspects of section 5 have a bearing on the proposal about plans.  Section 5(1) requires the agency to submit a programme to the Minister for his approval, which he will give having consulted with the Minister for Finance. Again the Oireachtas is excluded from the process.  This relates back to the argument I made at the beginning of this debate today.  Here we have the Minister for Social Welfare and the Minister for Finance dealing with plans to combat poverty, whereas it is my argument that the Government as a whole should deal with these plans.  That point can be dealt with on the section but it has a bearing on this amendment, which seeks to have the plans laid before each House of the Oireachtas.  If the plans are not to be presented to the Government for approval and are to be approved by the Minister for Social Welfare of the day in consultation with the Minister for Finance, then I feel very strongly that a wider view should be taken of the plans. Members of this House should have an opportunity to look at the proposals and make their views known.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment concerns the strategic plans which the agency will be required to submit every three years under section 5.  These plans will ensure that the agency operate a coherent programme which incorporates the different objectives which the agency have set for themselves.  It will also provide the yardstick for testing its results.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The notion of strategic planning as far as agencies of this kind are concerned is a relatively recent one.  There are obvious advantages in this approach, both for the agency and for the parent Department in planning the agency's activities over a number of years ahead.  The plans will be a very useful management tool and, from the point of view of the Minister for Social Welfare, will enable planning of resources for the agency's activities.  Essentially, however, the plans represent an <Col N="175" /> administrative device for the better management of the agency's activities.  There will obviously be a great deal of discussion between the agency and the Department in relation to the plans and the objectives to be set.</P>
    <P>I do not think it necessary or appropriate that the Oireachtas be involved at that stage or that the plans be laid before the House, as this amendment proposes. The Minister for Social Welfare is given the task under the legislation of overseeing and monitoring the work of the new agency.  As the Minister is statutorily responsible, the question of approving the agency's plans should be a matter for the Minister on behalf of the Government.</P>
    <P>I also refer to the provisions in section 5(3) which deal with the reviews of the agency's functions etc. to be carried out from time to time by the Minister for Social Welfare.  Such reviews are to be carried out in particular by reference to the strategic plans of the agency and subsection (3) requires that a report of any such review should be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.  This ensures that the Oireachtas will be kept fully informed of the agency's activities and I do not consider that the additional requirement to submit the agency's plans to the Oireachtas is really necessary.</P>
    <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 5, as amended, stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of points I wish to raise, one of which I have already mentioned.  The Minister will be giving approval to plans, having consulted with the Minister for Finance.  It is notable in this whole Bill that, where the Minister has to consult anybody in Government, it is always the Minister for Finance.  I do not know whether this is because the Government consider the Minister for Finance of the day has some crystal ball relating to the causes and effects of and solutions to the problems of poverty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="176" /> I do not believe that the present Minister for Finance has any understanding of that area.  It strengthens the case that I was making earlier on section 4 when I argued that it is the Government who should be responsible for the agency.  The whole thrust of the Bill is towards the Minister doing certain things, having the power to make regulations and to withdraw particular functions under subsection (2) and to direct the agency.  He does not even have to consult with the Minister for Finance when directing the agency.  This increases my concern that this agency will be very clearly locked into the social welfare area.  Under section 5 of this Bill there is no obligation on the Minister to consult with the Government when the agency present their strategic plans to him for approval. That is a weakness in the Bill.  Section 5(3) provides that &ldquo;The Minister shall from time to time review the purposes, functions and activities of the Agency under this Act&rdquo; and, after consultation again with the Minister for Finance&mdash; the all-seeing eye, that &ldquo;a report of such a review shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That subsection does not oblige the Minister to come back to us after three years of operation of the agency, or after any particular time, but just from time to time.  Conceivably, the Minister might not come back to us for 21 years to review the operations of the agency.  It is probably unlikely that he would get away with it for that long, but there is no obligation on him to come back to us within a reasonable time to lay before us a review of the operations of the agency, its successes, its failures, any functions he has withdrawn from the agency, how many additional functions he has given to the agency, how many directions he has given the agency and what kind of directions.</P>
    <P>It would be interesting to know whether or not the Minister is obliged to tell the House and the public when he does give a direction to the agency in regard to any matter.  Those two subsections, (1) and (3)(a), indicate the weakness of the Bill.  The Minister is consulting all of the time, where he is <Col N="177" /> obliged to consult at all, with the Minister for Finance.  In terms of Government policy, regardless of what Government would be in power, the Minister for Finance is not the best person to go to when one is looking for agreement or particular powers or particular sanctions for projects which automatically would require the expenditure of funds.  The inclination would be not to give sanction for the proposals.  I am not saying that the sanctions will not be given; but the inclination would be not to give them.  If, for instance, the targets in the document <i>Building on Reality</i> were to be breached in order to allow the agency to operate, would the present Minister for Finance be prepared to breach those targets?  I do not believe he would.  This highlights the weaknesses of the Bill.  We are talking about consulting with the Minister for Finance, not with the Government, not with the Oireachtas.  There is no time limit within which the Minister must come back to this House with a review of the operation of the agency.  I regard that as a severe weakness in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>This section obliges the agency to draw up a strategic plan every three years, the first within six months of its establishment.  This provision is necessary both to ensure that a coherent programme is devised against poverty and to provide a yardstick for testing its result.  The section also gives the Minister power to review the agency in all its aspects in the light of experience and a report of such a review is to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and, of course, the agency itself will be issuing reports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The plan will, naturally, incorporate an operating budget for its main activities, detailing proposed expenditure, projected staff resources and so on, and these are matters which have to be agreed on with the Department of Social Welfare and the Department of Finance. There is no point in pretending that it will always be easy to reach agreement.  The financial constraints which apply elsewhere will also affect the operations of this agency and it will probably be too <Col N="178" /> much to hope that the resources will be available to enable this agency to do all that in their view needs to be done.  The benefit to the plan will be however that it will enable the agency to plan for three years rather than for one year ahead as would be the case in the absence of a provision on the lines of that contained in this section.</P>
    <P>I should say, too, that subsection (1) of this section was amended by the Government on Report Stage during the passing of the Bill through Seanad Eireann.

      <P>I seek some clarification on section 5(2) regarding the Minister's amendment to extend the date up to 31 December 1989.  What are the reasons for this?  The time in the Bill is 31 December 1987.  The 31 December 1987 is quite a long way away.  The purpose of the Bill is to combat poverty and, in view of the fact that poverty is on the increase, if we extend the time what effect or strength will this section of the Bill have then?  I would ask the Minister to clarify that.</P>

      <P>Subsection (2) of section 5 obliges the agency to draw up a strategic plan in respect of each three year period. It is proposed to establish the agency this year.  But the initial plan is not due to be submitted until six months after the date of the first meeting and will not therefore be approved until early in 1987.  Therefore, the amendment is necessary to provide that the first plan will cover the <Col N="179" /> period of approximately three years up to the end of 1989.</P>

      <P>Section 5 (3)(a) provides that:</P>
      <P>The Minister shall from time to time review the purposes, functions and activities of the Agency under this Act, in particular by reference to the strategic plans, and shall cause (after consultation with the Minister for Finance) a report of such review to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>Obviously, a time limit is set on the preparation and submission of strategic plans by the agency.  There appears to be no such time limit set on the evaluation of reports of the agency by one or both Ministers.  Of course, they might not even accept these reports.  There could be a rather long time lag while the Minister or Ministers were reviewing such strategic plans before such plans were accepted. What functions would the agency have in the interim?  Would they hibernate, or take a protracted holiday?  I should like this matter clarified.</P>

      <P>That the board be small and limited in number is a welcome proposal.  I should remind Members that <Col N="180" /> this was specifically recommended by the previous combat poverty programme which provided for 25 members.  I support my colleagues who consider that representation on this board must come from all parts of the country rather than being Dublin based.  I hope that astute political people are not placed on this board, because that would not be of benefit to the agency in trying to achieve what they are meant to do.  It would be helpful to have a variety of different skills and talents available in the respective members.  That is very important.  A small board work better.  They are more successful in reaching a consensus of opinion, in making decisions and in negotiations with other bodies.  I also mention the lack of resources available to special interest groups such as the elderly and the handicapped.  Such groups are in danger of being marginalised.</P>
      <P>Better health care ensures that people live longer, but economic and social conditions and policy combine to make this an unhappy existence for many who are destined to live out their last days in penury.  The Bill provides for the appointment of people to sub-committees.  This means that voluntary bodies can be represented on the sub-committees or on the actual board.  This will allow specific work to be undertaken.  Such groups have programmes developed and measures drawn up specifically geared to their needs and using resources which are most appropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to draw attention to the importance of the work of this agency being linked into work already being undertaken by State bodies.  It is essential that existing bodies should link into the Combat Poverty Agency because this agency are looking at new ways of working with poor people.  This could take the form of practical co-operation on the ground and the use by the bodies of information discovered during research based on work by small poverty bodies.  There is an overlap between much of the work done by large funding agencies concerned with community development and the Combat Poverty Agency where there should be co-ordination at national and <Col N="181" /> local level in order that common problems will get uniform attention.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for a focus on demonstration projects.  There is no use in undertaking research unless it is taken note of and this work incorporated into larger projects.  The provision of demonstration projects on a pilot basis is a welcome introduction, since many problems encountered at local level are common to many areas.  This is partly because of the macro-economic and social conditions. Relative methods of intervention and distribution of resources and preventive measures designed to combat poverty can be thought up and tried out and used as a base for further antipoverty work on a wider scale.</P>
    <P>I support the introduction of the Bill. This measure which is now overdue represents a small advance in the Government's consideration of the serious situation of many in our population. The measures in the Bill will be effective first, if results fit into financial, social and economic policy; secondly, if the board have wide representation and autonomy; thirdly, if representatives of voluntary bodies can engage in specific work; fourthly, if the work of the agency is linked into work already being undertaken by State bodies and results of demonstrations used for larger projects. I am sorry I missed the Second Stage debate because I would have made a lengthier contribution.</P>

      <P>The Bill as it stands gives a free hand to the Minister to appoint whomever he chooses to this agency. It is unfortunate that we have not included in the Bill a section insisting on particular categories of people being included on the board.  My amendment referred to having one member of the agency elected by employees of the agency, which is important from the point <Col N="182" /> of view of having worker democracy in as many agencies of this kind as possible. People who are employees of the agency by and large, will be committed to the task of dealing with poverty and should have a direct say on the board.</P>
      <P>My amendment also proposed that not less than three members be drawn from groups or classes of persons afflicted or likely to be afflicted by poverty and that not more than three should be drawn from statutory or other bodies of voluntary agencies which work with groups or classes of persons afflicted or likely to be afflicted by poverty.  That three members should be drawn from groups or classes of persons afflicted or likely to be afflicted by poverty is the more important.  As I argued earlier, the board should be obliged to promote the involvement and participation of the disadvantaged in our society generally.  A good start to that would be involving in the agency people who would have, from life's experience, a direct input to make into what the board are doing or proposing to do.</P>
      <P>I regret very much that I missed moving the amendment in time.  I am sure the Minister is aware of what I am trying to do with this amendment.  I will not go through the whole argument again about the need to involve disadvantaged people in the structures of society and to come up with proposals as to how their position can be alleviated.  I contributed at length on Second Stage, some people would say too long.  I would partly agree with them on that, but it is necessary for us to be fully aware of the fact that poor people are not poor by choice.  In the vast majority of cases they are born into poverty. Poverty is not simply a lack of income, which has a great deal to do with it, but it also has to do with education, the culture of our society and a whole range of things.  People who are in that position will have something to say about what might be ways of alleviating the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said earlier in this debate I do not believe, and I think the Minister does not believe, that the agency will solve the problem of poverty.  They can help to get a number of useful projects off the ground and to put together statistics on <Col N="183" /> the exact nature and degree of poverty which exists.  Having disadvantaged people involved in the agency at board level would be an important way of ensuring that the agency are relevant to the problems which they are trying to deal with.  I regret very much not having been here to move my amendment but I ask the Minister to accept it in spirit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">

      <P>I would like to support what Deputy De Rossa has said.  Even though it has not got the full force of an amendment I would ask and hope that the Minister would take it as strongly as that.  Time is too limited to repeat all the arguments which have been put forward on Second Stage and again today, but we cannot repeat often enough the absolute importance of ensuring that the Combat Poverty Agency will be as effective as possible.  The Minister was quite truthful and modest here today when he said he knew that much more commitment and many more changes were needed other than the poverty agency to bring about the real removal of poverty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy De Rossa said, it is not just a matter of more equal distribution of income although that might be regarded as the foundation stone.  It is the whole lack of confidence, of control, of voice and of importance which people in disadvantaged areas feel and the kind of building programme which we have to bring them up to the same level as people who are more privileged.  There is no better way to reflect this than to have people who have gone through the experience of poverty on the agency.  I place particular importance on the fact that, of all the boards I know and memberships which need the inclusion of women, this is one of the most vital.  From research, we know that women and children are the real poverty stricken people.  I urge the Minister to ensure that a number of the people appointed to this board are women.  It is stated in the Bill&mdash;and I am sure the draftspeople will have an answer for it&mdash;that the agency shall submit such reports to the Minister as he may from time to time request.  If at <Col N="184" /> this level of State involvement we cannot include women I would stress that we should do it at the level of the Combat Poverty Agency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMcCarthy" hpid="Dr. McCarthy Dr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Barnes on her point about women.  I welcome the decision that the board should be limited in numbers.  There should not be a whole plethora of people, most of them doing nothing, as is the case on most big committees.  The smaller it is the more efficient it is likely to be.  I hope when these eight or ten appointments are being made the people will be chosen on merit and because of their knowledge of the problem of poverty in various areas. I hope the board will not be Dublin orientated, that it will represent the viewpoints of those with knowledge on the subject from all over the country.</P>
      <P>I very strongly support the request made by Deputy Barnes that there should be women on this board.  Even though I have great respect for men, women very often become involved in programmes, committees and organisations and have more of an indepth knowledge of the problems that appertain to society than men.  Many women have immense knowledge in areas such as poverty.  I strongly recommend that the Minister should listen to Deputy Barnes if he does not wish to listen to me.  We are on the same tune.  I know he would not do that in a fit but he may not have the choosing.  The Minister should ensure that the committee is not just another collection of political lackeys.  Far too often since the Coalition took office political lackeys or cronies were appointed to every little group or association.  This type of crony society does not mean that the work is being done properly.  It appears that the political cronies the Government are appointing are dull and stupid.  They do not appear to be able to think very well. It may be that they are chosen because they are slow and inadequate.  I hope the Minister will take cognisance of the suggestions I have put forward.</P>

      <P>I note that section 7 (5) states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="185" /> Any member of the Agency may, at any time, be removed from membership of the Agency by the Minister if, in the Minister's opinion, the member has become incapable through ill-health of performing his functions, or has committed stated misbehaviour, or his removal appears to the Minister to be necessary for the effective performance by the Agency of its functions.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister tell the House what &ldquo;necessary for the effective performance by the Agency of its functions&rdquo; means? How does the Minister see any person appointed by him, or by any other Minister, inhibiting the effective performance of the agency?  According to subsection (8) the Minister may by regulation amend subsection (1) by varying the maximum number of members of the agency.  The regulations made under the legislation will be laid before the House, and, if not annulled within 21 days, will automatically become law.  I have often argued that that is an undemocratic process. I have gone back through the records and have yet to find an occasion when such regulations were debated in the House.  The only reference I found was in relation to a debate which took place in 1981 or 1982.  In that case the Government of the day brought the debate forward.</P>
    <P>It is clear that, unless the Government want to debate such a negative process for making regulations, no debate can take place in the House.  I have tabled an amendment to section 22 calling for the making of positive orders but I do not think we will have time to reach it.  Will the Minister consider bringing all regulations before the House and accept that they should not be put into force until they have been passed by the House? It is important that the Minister should agree to such a procedure because he has power to take functions away from the agency.  He may, if he wishes, increase or decrease the membership of the agency and he has many other powers. Regulations made under the legislation should be open to debate by the House <Col N="186" /> and should not become part of the law unless agreed by the House.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="187" /> I should like to make a number of points in the short time at my disposal. A considerable amount of thought went into the question of the size and composition of the new agency and I would like to say a few words about this.  To go back to the experience of the First Programme to Combat Poverty the national committee which ran that programme had 25 members, representing a very wide range of relevant skills, disciplines, experience and perspective.  As the final report on that programme stated, however, the extent to which the different disciplines and perspectives were fused in the service of the programme was open to question. The following quotation from the final report, in reference to the size and composition of the national committee, is relevant here:</P>
    <P>A Committee of twenty-five members with proven &ldquo;track records&rdquo; and a variety of disciplines may not necessarily be the best ingredients for a committee charged with piloting innovative projects.  Such people usually come with strong and differing views on what is to be done and how it is to be done.  When the area of concern is seen to be related to their professional, voluntary, or political interest, this can give rise to additional complexities.  If, however, such a committee's status, structure, and role are clearly understood and accepted by members, then it can be expected that the diversity of expertise and disciplines will be a creative force in the management of a programme.  A committee requires different types of management and leadership depending on its status as either &ldquo;advisory&rdquo; or &ldquo;executive&rdquo;. The fact that such a strong membership acquired executive functions placed heavy constraints on the committee as a body, and despite the best efforts of the chairperson, and the different structures created, various subcommittees and an executive, the committee never became integrated as an effective working body.  In this context it did not have a clearly defined goal, <Col N="188" /> nor did it develop a clear time dimension with planned stages for the pilot schemes.  While the creation of the executive group did ensure a more business-like approach to the management of the programme, it also resulted in the isolation of other members.</P>
    <P>In the light of the experience of the last programme and in line with the views expressed by the interim board of the Combat Poverty Organisation, one of the specific tasks of which was to advise on the structure of a new agency, the basic approach on this occasion has been to keep the membership of the agency to a more manageable size&mdash;between eight and ten members as provided in section 7 (1) of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The membership of the agency should of course reflect the different broad functions which the agency are to carry out, research, policy and action, and, as the interim board proposed, it will be necessary to have on the board of the agency people who are experienced in each of these areas.  The community development aspect will be of particular importance in this regard.</P>
    <P>One point which the board made and which is of particular relevance here was that the members of the agency should be chosen for their commitment and expertise rather than as representatives of particular organisations.  There are, of course, a wide variety of organisations, statutory and voluntary organisations, who are involved in tackling the problems of poverty in one way or another.  Apart from Government Departments which have direct responsibility of one kind or another in this area and the health boards and local authorities, one might mention the trade union movement and its concern for working people and, in particular in the present context, the problems of low paid workers and unemployed people.  There was also a large number of voluntary organisations operating on a national basis which have a direct involvement with the problem of poverty in its everyday manifestations.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to refer to the large number of local community groups <Col N="189" /> who have come together to tackle their own problems and to do so in an effective and lasting way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate your decision on this occasion.  The reason for this motion is the serious concern on the part of members of our party at the continued dismantling of the health services.  The level of service has been reduced over the past three and a half years and we are particularly concerned about the situation as it exists in 1986.  The health boards will have a combined deficit of approximately £35 million in the current year.  The Eastern Health Board have an estimated deficit of £8.95 million; the North Eastern Health Board, £1.5 million; the North Western Health Board, £3.2 million; the Western Health Board, £4 million; the Mid-Western Health Board, £3 million; the Southern Health Board, £5.5 million; the South Eastern Health Board £6.2 million and the Midland Health Board, £2.5 million.</P>
      <P>When I asked him on 19 February last year the real decrease to the health boards the Minister admitted that the decrease was as high as 6.6 per cent in the Western Health Board and 6.7 per cent in the North Western Health Board between 1982 and 1985.  All the other health boards suffered a decrease.  The Southern and Eastern Health Boards were something less but that is accounted for by the fact that they had rapidly expanding populations.  Their allocations were marginally higher in those years.  It is a matter of serious concern that we are now almost half way through 1986 and some of the health boards have not yet made their final decision as to how they will manage their 1986 budget.  This must be unacceptable.  It is a direct result of the Government's policy in enforcing these cutbacks on the health boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The acute hospitals in particular will suffer.  For example, in Letterkenny they are closing down medical, surgical, gynaecological and ear, nose and throat wards for two months in the summer. The Limerick regional are closing wards. The cutbacks are not confined to health board hospitals.  St. Vincent's Hospital, a voluntary hospital, are a good example of what is happening.  They closed 100 beds during 1985.  This year the Minister decided that Sir. Patrick Dun's Hospital <Col N="191" /> should close.  This was announced here on 13 January.  The staff, the governing body, the Eastern Health Board, and everybody else interested believed that the hospital was not due to close until 1988 but the Minister and the Government decided that it should close.  In fairness to the Minister, the Government decided that it should close in 1986.</P>
    <P>Nobody has said what is going to happen to the patients who formerly attended or who were in the catchment area of Sir Patrick Dun's.  There were 4,500 patients admitted and over 12,000 attending as outpatients.  Because St. Vincent's is the closest hospital to them, many of these will find they are obliged to attend St. Vincent's for their hospital services.  The point I want to come to about St. Vincent's Hospital is that their outturn for 1985 was £21.683 million.  The allocation they are receiving for 1986 is £21.340 million.  Therefore, they are receiving a decreased allocation taking no account of inflation or the increased number of patients they will have to treat.</P>
    <P>Tralee Hospital, a new hospital, where not all the beds had come into operation are also closing some of the beds during the summer.  There is a particular problem in Ennis where male and female patients share the same ward.  This, as I am sure the Minister will agree, is undesirable. We had a motion on Beaumont earlier this year.  Therefore, I will not say very much about it.  Again, it is an indication of the thinking of the Government that a major and very necessary hospital on the north side of this city has been left idle for the past two years. Rather than open it as a major general teaching hospital, as it should be, the Government intend to open one unit as a psychiatric hospital for the north side of the city.  It is very difficult to understand why the hospital could not be opened as a major general teaching hospital, as was originally intended and as we have asked the Minister to do on many occasions.</P>
    <P>The Minister has deducted from the majority of hospitals their overruns for 1984 and 1985, leading to further serious <Col N="192" /> difficulty for the hospitals, all of whom have had their allocations reduced.  In the past four or five years all the health care agencies, health boards, voluntary hospitals and other agencies, have made major efforts to curtail expenditure in so far as possible.  They have reduced their staffs and have reallocated them so that the highest level of care would be provided. In 1985 and 1986 the position has become critical because hospitals are obliged not to have replacements for holidays or sick and special leave.  This means that doctors, nurses and other staff will have to carry extra loads.</P>
    <P>Inevitably, that reduces the level of care, and in 1986 we have had a similar pattern as in the past three years, indeed since the Government came to office. The level of services is being reduced to a totally unacceptable state, when patients' lives must be at risk.  We have longer waiting lists for outpatients, for tests, for X-rays and admissions.  There is earlier discharge from hospital.  Because of ward closures over periods there is a backlog of patients awaiting treatment, and a consultant surgeon told me he is unable to overtake the backlog because his specialist unit was closed for two months last summer.  Now the hospital is unable to deal with the backlog because of the extreme pressure on staff.</P>
    <P>In the long stay hospitals there have been staff reductions because of the no replacement regulations, and in the hospital at Clonakilty one nurse is looking after 98 patients.  The Minister will agree with me that this is intolerable.  It would be unacceptable to all of us.  The psychiatric hospitals find it impossible to cope because of the closure of wards.  It happened in the midland region in regard to St. Vincent's psychiatric hospital and St. Loman's in Mullingar.  They will be closing for two months in the summer and patients never before discharged will be let go during the summer months. Earlier in the year the Government decided overnight to close eight hospitals including Castlerea and Carlow.  So much for their talk about planning.  It is typical of the way the Government have acted since they came to office.  They make <Col N="193" /> decisions off the top of their heads at Cabinet meetings, but when Fianna Fáil tell them they were wrong they deny it, and during the following three months everybody in the health services do their best to help the Government.</P>
    <P>The Minister should read the document <i>Planning for the Future</i> for the psychiatric services because it spells out how the services should be proceeded with in the next ten to 15 years.</P>
    <P>The nurses are feeling the effects and it is significant that the INO have found it necessary to march to this House tomorrow at 3.15 p.m., not for anything for themselves&mdash;it has nothing to do with wage or salary increases&mdash;but to highlight the effects of the cutbacks on patients.  In the North West Health Board region 55 posts will be left vacant during ward closures this summer.  Public health nurses have been asked to reduce their mileage by 10 per cent.  So much for the nursing services which have given so much to community care.  The number of public health nurses in training this year is 15 in the eastern region, ten in each of three other regions and four health boards have no training this year.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to meet the nurses tomorrow to discuss their grievances with them.  We all owe a debt of gratitude to Irish nurses at home and abroad because of their dedication to the care of the most vulnerable people in society.</P>
    <P>During the past three years the number of posts left unfilled in the health services was 624 up to the end of 1985.  That does not take into account the serious cutbacks in 1986.  The dental services have suffered severely, and the <i>ad hoc</i> dental service is non-existent.  What, for instance, does the Minister intend to do for a widow on a non-contributory pension who cannot provide badly needed dental service for herself and who has no access to a public service?  There are 11,000 children in the Western Health Board area on a waiting list of from 12 months to 18 months.  I appreciate that the Minister is trying to fill the orthodontic posts but what is he doing about providing a service, especially an optician <Col N="194" /> service for the elderly who are unable to read or to see television and who cannot provide a service for themselves?</P>
    <P>Hospital transport has been curtailed and many people are unable to travel to clinics because they have not got the facilities.  Voluntary organisations are in competition now for reduced funds through Government policy.  They are on the same allocation as in 1984 and in 1985 because there has been no increase in the last number of years.  That is not a sign of the Government recognising the tremendous work they do.</P>
    <P>In regard to the mentally handicapped organisations, it is wrong for the Government to say they have increased the allocation. The allocation in 1985 was £11.67 million and this year it is £11.25 million, a reduction of £500,000 approximately, therefore, the community services cannot be developed to the extent hoped for and more and more children will have to go back into residential care.  What advice will the Minister give to parents who have a severely handicapped child in need of care but where that care is not available?</P>
    <P>I should like to compliment the health boards and the voluntary health agencies with their management and staff for their excellent work in very difficult times.  I wish to point out to the Minister that the morale of the staff is very low as a result of the cutbacks and of the fact that the has never admitted to them that there are serious difficulties.  I ask him to take account of the low morale among the staff and to do something about it before further damage is done.  The reduced allocations take no account of the needs of particular areas.  As one consultant said to me, when he inquired about the matter in the Department he was told it would be even-handed.  The cutbacks have not taken any account of the needs of the areas in question.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil are conscious of the cost of health care.  We believe there is and always will be a need for efficiency.  We know that money will not be available for everything we would like to do.  However, there is a duty and responsibility on the Government to provide an adequate level of service, but that is not being <Col N="195" /> done.  It is a disgrace that half way through 1986 chaos exists in the health services.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with Deputy O'Hanlon in supporting this motion.  Our objective is to try to bring home to the Minister the real concern of doctors, nurses and the patients about what is happening to our health services.  We accept that hospital services cost a lot of money and that the Minister is entitled to look for efficiency and value for money. However, we also believe it is the duty and responsibility of the Minister to ensure that, where he is imposing cutbacks, the repercussions of the decisions taken do not fall on people who cannot take care of themselves.  Incidentally, the Midland Health Board have been faced with a cutback of £2.5 million.</P>
      <P>The Minister may say that we complain all the time, but we are responding to the real concern that exists in the community. At the start of this year the Government introduced expenditure Estimates based on an inflation rate of 4½ per cent.  We know that the inflation rate will probably work out at 3 per cent; in fact, some Government Ministers say it will be 2½ per cent.  Many Government Departments may not need the money as badly as do the Department of Health and they should not be allowed to spend that extra money.  As I pointed out, the Estimates were based on an inflation rate of 4¼ per cent and if 1½ per cent were taken off the Estimates of those Government Departments it would supply the cash that is so badly needed in the hospital services and in other areas.</P>

Now the Minister is trying to convince the people of Longford that the commitment of the Government and of the Minister in the constituency has been honoured.  If the Minister wants efficiency let him sit down and do the sums.  Let him consider the cost involved in sending a person with the most minor of injuries from an outpost in County Longford some 40 or 50 miles to Mullingar in order to get attention.  If that is efficiency, may the Lord help the health services.  The Minister gave a commitment that was accepted in good faith by me and was delivered to the people of Longford but now he has reneged on it. Worse still, we hear now what will happen during the summer.  We hear of wards that will be closed in Mullingar Regional Hospital which the Minister said will cater for the hospital needs of Longford.  We hear that nothing but emergency cases will be accepted.  We have no casualty or emergency service in Longford, and Mullingar hospital will not accept any cases other than emergency cases during the three months of summer.</P>

      <P>Another aspect of crazy Government policy of which the Minister might take note is this: in the sister Departments he was given one Department in the game of musical chairs and the Minister, Deputy Hussey, was handed the second prize &mdash; a policy is now being pursued which is cutting out the prescribed relatives allowance by the new time.  The Minister will, I am sure, agree that the repercussions of that decision will save money for the Department but will mean that more old people will find themselves in institutional care, the opposite policy to the one the Minister is pursuing.  That is the kind of crazy policy we are seeing.  One hand does not know what the other hand is doing, and it is nonsense to talk about saving money and efficiency when we look at these decisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have all seen the hardships these cutbacks are imposing.  In Mullingar Hospital there are patients in corridors and nurses have to step around them. One may have to cross four beds to get to a patient.  If that is what our hospital services have come to, then the Minister <Col N="200" /> has failed to look after our people, especially the less well-off.  These people are suffering most because the transport services have been withdrawn and they are losing their medical cards.  It is all right for people with money; they can look after themselves.  The tale of woe in the Midlands Health Board area is very bad and I hope the Minister will tell us what he is going to do about the service, because he broke his promise to the people of Longford&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Conaghan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to put on the record the genuine hardship which is being experienced by many people due to the severe cutbacks in the health service.  We can argue for and against this decision and we can bandy figures about, but the proof of the pudding is in the eating, and as far as the North-Western Health Board are concerned, there is no pudding to be eaten. I do not relish the coming of Christmas for the people who must be served by that board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister and the Department are very concerned about removing the services to the community, and I fully support that.  The North-Western Health Board provide the most comprehensive health services in the country.  What has been the response from the Department and the Minister each year?  We have had to cut back on the development of those <Col N="201" /> services.  This year we will have a £3.2 million shortfall and it will be virtually impossible to implement all the services which we provide.</P>
    <P>I would like to put the position in perspective. Since 1980 health boards have been experiencing cutbacks which resulted from a shortfall of Department funding of 20 per cent.  During the 1980-86 period the North-Western Health Board received special additional allocations for a small number of approved developments, namely, the extension of Letterkenny Hospital, the orthopaedic unit at Sligo General Hospital, the community nursing units in County Donegal and the unit for the mentally handicapped at Stranorlar.  The cost of these services in 1986 amounted to £6.4 million.  The total value in 1986 terms of the 1980 level of resources, together with the adjustments made since then by the Department for the approved services, is £7.97 million, 20 per cent greater than our 1986 allocation.  It could be said that we had 20 per cent more resources for the services in 1980 than is provided this year.  This is a clear indication of the cuts that have been made during that period.</P>
    <P>Despite these cuts, a number of significant changes have been made by internal transfers between services budgets.  This allowed for the setting up of a number of new services.  The massive cut of £3.2 million in the allocation to the board this year has made it virtually impossible to maintain and contain the services which have been built up over the past six years. The cutbacks have to be spread over the following: hospitals £2.2 million, a cut of 6 per cent; community care £7 million, a cut of 3 per cent; and central management £2 million, a cut of 10 per cent. To deal with the cutbacks in the north-western region it was necessary to spread these cuts across the three areas I mentioned.</P>
    <P>I believe that when the Department were envisaging the cutbacks to the eight health boards they seemed to be orientated towards Dublin.  Dublin is as far as they can see.  There is no way the region I represent could absorb the cuts the Minister imposed.  The emphasis was put <Col N="202" /> on cutbacks in acute hospitals.  It is only in this city that the health board stay within the limits imposed because they have a number of acute hospitals.  In a region like mine where there are only two acute hospitals &mdash; one in Sligo and one in Letterkenny &mdash; it was virtually impossible to deal with these cutbacks and the brunt of that decision must be borne by the community welfare section of the health board.  This will impose hardship on the underprivileged who depend on these services.</P>
    <P>I put this point to the Minister during an Adjournment Debate and we had a successful meeting with him.  I appeal to him tonight to look seriously at the difficulties we are experiencing in the north-western region which is mostly a rural area.  People live long distances from the services.  About 5 per cent of the population live outside towns.  The average income per family is the lowest in the country and we have the highest population over 65 years of age.  These are the people who avail most of the hospital services and the services of the health board.</P>
    <P>The withdrawal of the transport services to clinics is imposing untold hardship on these people.  There has been a cutback of £400,000 on that service. How can the Minister expect the sick, the invalids, to make their way to this city for hospital treatment?  He must remember that these people come from an area where there is no transport system.  They must travel to Letterkenny or Lifford, distances of 60 or 70 miles, to get a transport service.  Then they are expected to pay £10 to get to Dublin and perhaps pay £20 for taxis to the hospital.  They are then expected to find their own way back.</P>
    <P>We are talking about imposing on the poorest of our population fees of upwards of £100 in order to maintain their life and to have their illnesses attended to.  I ask the Minister to review the situation and to give back to the health boards the money needed to provide the necessary services within the region which I represent and which is under-financed. Unfortunately the worst aspect of it is that the people who are most dependent <Col N="203" /> on it are being disallowed their just entitlement. In other words, the attitude of the Department would seem to be &ldquo;If you can pay, you will survive; but, if you cannot pay, God help you.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann notes that the Government has provided in 1986 a total current estimated financial provision of £1,274 million for the health services which is £29 million more than 1985, £118 million more than 1984 and £183 million more than 1983 despite the constraints on public expenditure during these years, further notes that the level of resources provided is sufficient to ensure the delivery of essential health services to the community and commends the Minister for Health for his radical reform of these services as stated in the comprehensive &lsquo;Progress Report on the Health Services 1983-1986&rsquo; which has recently been circulated to all Deputies.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>As Deputies know, there is available this year for the health services on current account a total of £1,274 million.  That is £29 million more than last year, £118 million more than in 1984 and £183 million more than in 1983, and much more than was provided when the Fianna Fáil Party were in office.  That money has been provided despite the constraints on public expenditure.  We are keeping our GNP allocation constant, generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies may want to consider what has been happening.  We have published as a departmental document the <i>Progress Report of the Health Services 1983-86</i> which I think is a reasonable rebuttal of the spurious allegations being made by the Fianna Fáil Party.  The only reason this motion is down is that they wish to <Col N="204" /> try to capitalise on the protest demonstration, one of those ritualistic demonstrations, being organised by the Irish Nurses Organisation tomorrow.  I find it a little puzzling that they should have the demonstration at all, because the INO now have more members than ever in the history of the organisation, yet they are talking about reductions in the number of nurses.  There has been no reduction in the number of nurses employed in the health services.  The reverse is true.  I see Deputy O'Connell at the back smirking and I will give him the figures.  In 1981 when he was a member of the Labour Party&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;into 1986.  I will give further figures.  It is of relevance that in the period 1977-81, when Deputy O'Connell was very voluble about the health services, the number of nurses employed increased by 14 per cent. Between 1981 and 1984 the number of nurses employed increased by over 7 per cent.  There has been constant growth. Admittedly, we are on a plateau now and I ask the Deputies, where do we end in terms of the employment of nursing staff. In recent years the number of nursing <Col N="205" /> posts has been maintained and even increased in some areas against the background of a small reduction in other staff areas, notably administration, some paramedical areas and temporary staff.</P>
      <P>Deputy Rory O'Hanlon and Deputy Albert Reynolds waxed eloquent about nurses in hospitals being put under enormous pressure.  Let me point out that nurses since that period have received very substantial pay increases.  In the period since 1980 &mdash; mark the year &mdash; nurses' salaries have increased by over 160 per cent.  I will not impose embarrassment on this House by asking Deputies what the increase in the cost of living was since that period.  They can spend the night working it out for themselves and they will be even more surprised.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The total remuneration of nurses in 1985, last year, at £360 million accounts for approximately 46 per cent of total pay cost to the health services. Inclusive of overtime and premium payments, the average payment per nurse was over £13,000 a year.  The nurses should come into Dáil Éireann tomorrow to congratulate me on these figures which I have issued in a public statement today&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Unfortunately, I will be unable to meet them because, as Deputies know, I have been persistently seeking meetings of EC Health Ministers to discuss major issues such as AIDS, cancer, smoking regulations and so on and tomorrow I must travel out of the country to meet my fellow-Ministers for Health and prepare for that meeting. Unfortunately, therefore, I will not be able to meet the nurses, but a principal officer of my Department will meet them and will distribute to them copies of the press release which I have issued giving the real facts about the nursing situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me make a final point in that regard.  It is remarkable that travelling <Col N="206" /> expenses of members of health boards &mdash; and they whine and whine all round the clock &mdash; and the staff of health boards increased from £8.5 million in 1982 to £11.5 million in 1985.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>That includes public health nurses who have been referred to, and that is an increase in expenses of 35 per cent in three years.  Whom are we trying to cod in terms of availability of money?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to refer to the general provision of the health services. There has always been difficulty on the part of most Deputies in assessing the precise resources available to the health services.  There are times when I have had to work it out very carefully for myself.  The Government have provided a total of £1,095.3 million for the non-capital health services in the current year. That compares with £1,013.8 million grant provision made available at budget time last year and it will support an expenditure level amounting to £1,274 million, taking into account the income derived by the health agencies from sources such as basic charges and so on.</P>
      <P>Of the funds available, £799 million will be spent on payroll costs, £410 million this year on non-pay costs including cash allowances, and £65 million on cash allowances.  The payroll budget will support the employment of around 62,500 nurses.  I have an admission to make to this House.  I had thought that the figure was lower until we did the recent census and discovered that the real figure of employment in the health agencies throughout the country is now at 62,500. There has been virtually no reduction at all in terms of employment.  We have managed to keep it up and generally to provide an excellent health service.  The range of services is exceptional.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I come to the point raised by Deputy Reynolds.  Unquestionably I gave him an <Col N="207" /> assurance in this House, which was accepted by his party's director of elections in his constituency and chairman of the health board, that we would initiate a casualty service in Longford town.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The chief executive officer of the health board borke his neck trying to get it established.  The programme manager of the health board also worked very hard to try to establish it.  I did my utmost in that regard and the senior officers of the Department of Health, month after month, gave every possible assistance and encouragement in regard to this matter.  Why was it not brought in?  Because we got no co-operation from the general practitioners in Longford town&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">

      <P>I want to deal with the second point raised by Deputy Reynolds, St. Loman's Hospital.  He made the allegation that patients would be pushed out of St. Loman's into the community and that there would not be adequate services available for them.  That is not correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should bear with me for a minute.  As a result of the closure of Longford Hospital we saved £320,000 and that money was transferred to psychiatric community care for the Midland Health Board to provide services in relation to St. Loman's, Portlaoise, and other services in the area.  The health board have the money and I have been assured by them that the community care services which they are providing and developing in the midlands area will be adequate to meet the purpose.  As Deputy O'Hanlon knows, we are making alternative arrangements in respect of the Meath area which will lessen the pressure on St. Loman's and that is well in train in relation to the North Eastern Health Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="209" /> It is easy to come into this House and to table a motion with selective data in relation to the health services, because there is not a hospital consultant or GP who could not make a valid case for more resources in terms of the development of his or her speciality, area of responsibility or the services provided.  We are providing a community health service which is outstanding by any standards at national or international level.  We have an excellent general practitioner service which is now providing free medical care for 37 per cent of the people.  There has been no reduction in relation to medical cards although I make no apology for applying fundamental equity in allocating medical cards to students on the basis of their family income.  I stand over the decision we took in that regard over three years ago.  The service is very good and costs about £100 million per year.  There is a refund of drugs scheme, a home nursing service, domiciliary welfare and family planning services and dental, opthalmic and aural services&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I wish to assure the House that we have an exceptionally good general health service which is being expanded and developed regularly.  For example, we recently provided substantial additional resources to enable cardiac surgery to be carried out in Cork.  That unit alone is costing £680,000 per year to pay for consultants, specialised and other staff.  The capital resources for that unit alone was well over £600,000.</P>
      <P>Last week, I sanctioned the appointment of a paediatric consultant in Wexford Hospital, six additional nurses and two senior house officers which, this year, will cost about £180,000.</P>
      <P>In the midlands I was able to do something which no other Minister for Health had succeeded in doing by rationalising and bringing to finality the delivery of health services there.  I thank Deputy Reynolds for his co-operation in that regard.  If there is overcrowding in Mullingar Hospital at present, the reason is that we are putting in £17 million worth of capital works there.  The hospital is being reconstructed in very substantial measure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Hanlon referred to Ennis Hospital.  I am surprised <Col N="211" /> that he chose to refer to this hospital because he knows the reason why male and female patients are currently in a particular ward area.  It is that, for the first time in decades, we are bringing in effective fire regulations at that hospital, as well as rewiring, refurbishing and redoing the theatre, which was substandard. There has to be a substantial degree of overcrowding in the hospital for a few months to enable that work to be done. That is the kind of thing which people fasten on to, saying that Ennis Hospital is going down the tubes.  It is not.  Local Fianna Fáil hacks, with due respect to that party, are prepared to exploit the position.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">

      <P>There are many areas where we can develop and in some areas we could have gone much further. I refer, for example, to the bringing into operation of the CAT scanner in Galway. It is a shame that it is not in use.  It is ridiculous that we have not been able to open Swinford centre for the mentally handicapped.  If we had the co-operation of the Western Health Board instead of spurious, appalling political point scoring, more concerned about keeping the name of the Minister for Health of the day off a foundation stone instead of going ahead and commissioning a new unit in Swinford and bringing in a new CAT scanner in Galway, we would be delivering the health services.</P>

      <P>I am profoundly concerned and I am sure I will yet open the centre in Swinford.  I would be entirely dishonest if I did not say that our budget <Col N="212" /> for 1986 is very tight.  There is no spare fat in it, unlike many a budget in the health services over the years.  A number of cost reduction studies have been carried out by my Department in recent years.  We are very concerned about conserving energy.  I have had an increase this year in my Estimate of about 3 per cent, which is in line with inflation.  The money is there and I do not accept for one moment statements made by health boards to the effect, for example, that they are short of estimated needs by £7 million in 1986.  If one looks at the accounts coming in at the end of the year, one will see that they may be short £1 million or £750,000 out of a budget of £120 million.  This kind of hype is frequently indulged in by members of health boards.</P>

      <P>I have demonstrated that there are substantial resources available for the health services in the current year.  There is no question of any measure being taken which would put lives at risk or result in the withholding from the community of vital services.  I would not act as Minister for Health if I thought that could be the situation.  I am determined to ensure that our health services remain in good shape, as they are at present.  We have taken many very difficult policy decisions in many areas to bring about much needed improvements.  That has been possible within the resources available to me.</P>
      <P>I have not rushed into any decisions or carried out any cosmetic operations like Deputy Haughey, issuing toothbrushes and promises all over the place.  I have issued unambiguous policy decisions after seeking, and for the most part accepting, the objective professional, medical, administrative advice of the senior staff of the Department of Health. Their competence and dedication I am quite prepared to defend in any forum and I do not even have to go before the so-called Committee on Public Expenditure to do that.  My record and that of the Department of Health are for all to read and to reflect upon in the published documents available.  I think I am the first Minister for Health since 1954 to publish what he is doing and make it available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am accordingly recommending to the House that this motion be rejected for what it is, a purely opportunistic motion designed to impress the nurses of Ireland tomorrow when they come to Dublin and are entertained to tea by the Opposition. Quite frankly, apart from offering them some tea, they are not in a position to offer them any other words of wisdom. Our record in this regard as a Government stands.  While the Deputies on the other side have gone down to 25p in the £ in income tax, by outbidding the PDs, I at least will be able to say that the resources for the health services were <Col N="215" /> provided by this Government without any spurious electioneering or synthetic motions before the House.</P>

      <P>I never cease to smile when I hear Ministers get up to speak. This Minister is perpetually in cloud cuckooland.  He has the audacity to come in here tonight and tell us that the health services are normal and that he has provided adequate finance for them.  He fails to see why this motion appears on the Order Paper and why we should engage in this exercise of calling for more funds to finance the health boards and hospitals operations.</P>
      <P>The Minister says he has provided more than he did last year.  But an indication of how bad things are can be gleaned from the health board allocations.  There are cutbacks of £3.2 million in the North Western Health Board and there is over £4 million deficit in the Western Health Board.  Is the Minister listening or is he engaged in something else?  Does he not want to listen to the truth?  In the Eastern Health Board things are so bad that proposals were put forward for consultant and prescription charges for GMS patients and an end to free hospitalisation. These are proposals which were put to the Eastern Health Board.  There is a cutback of £3 million in the Mid-Western Health Board, and yet the Minister says things are normal.  In the Southern Health Board the Minister is trying to effect savings of £2.9 million and wants a £1 prescription charge and an increase in the limit for drug refunds from £28 to £33 because things are so bad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has the audacity to come in here and say that everything is all right in the voluntary hospitals.  St. James' Hospital in Dublin is down by £1 million for the year.  The Mater Hospital is down £1 million.  The National Maternity Hospital is down by £750,000.  The Rotunda Hospital is down £600,000.  St. Vincent's is down £2 million for this year, with 40 beds to be closed.  The Adelaide Hospital is down £500,000.  The James Connolly Memorial Hospital in Blanchardstown is down £1.5 million and have <Col N="216" /> had to close 60 beds.  In Baggot Street Hospital a quarter of its beds are closed and two wards have been closed in the Meath Hospital in Dublin.  That is apart from hospitals in Cork, Waterford and Galway.  I defy the Minister to contradict me and say those figures are wrong &mdash; and I will give him a minute to do that. His silence is enough.</P>

      <P>How does the Minister look upon cutbacks?  How does he know what it is like trying to get a patient into a hospital?  What does he know about the mentally handicapped people and trying to get occupational therapy for them? The Minister has the audacity to read out from his book and say things are perfect. I have been trying for four years to get a mentally handicapped adult anywhere but the house he has been in for four years with nothing being done for him.  I have been trying since this Minister came into power and I am told by the workshop in Ballyfermot that there is an 18 months waiting list and there are no staff.  I was on to the National Rehabilitation Board. They have no staff to even go to see this person.  They said that they were sorry they could not take him and I would have to see what could be done.  I am going from one place to another and nothing can be done.  The Minister does not appreciate that.  He sits in that office looking at figures and he deludes himself into believing that things are normal, and he will go on like that until he goes out of office.  Dr. Johnson said that when a man knows he is to be hanged in a fortnight's time it concentrates his mind wonderfully.  This is exactly what will <Col N="217" /> happen to the Minister, Deputy Barry Desmond.</P>
      <P>The Minister says that he gave £29 million more for health services last year. He is right.  But that represents a 2.2 per cent increase.  It was given in February when the inflation rate was 3.9 per cent, so in fact the overall deficit is £19.6 million. That is how much short the health services are this year.  The Minister cannot come in here and, under the guise of facts and figures, state otherwise.  The health boards are £19.6 million short. That is the situation and the Minister cannot deny it.  But he is so arrogant and so conceited that he firmly believes this farrago of nonsense that he regurgitates <i>ad nauseam</i> about the health services and about the money he is providing.  He is like the man with the sledgehammer.  He feels that by hammering hard in any direction he can produce the desired result.</P>
      <P>Health services are not like any other economic department.  Cuts on the lines directed by the Minister cannot be brought about without producing the domino effect.  What we do need is an orderly, rational approach to pruning, not the indiscriminate cutbacks that have been dictated by the Minister.  Cutbacks on the lines suggested by the Minister cannot be introduced.  They can only be phased in over a period of ten years. It will not work otherwise.  There would be trouble in every single section of the health services.  The Minister cannot expect to withdraw money from one area. He cannot operate like that.  It does not work like that.  Health boards cannot operate under a single annual budget.  It is not in the interest of the patients to have such cutbacks.  It must be done in an orderly fashion over a number of years.  This is what the Minister fails to comprehend.  I am afraid his B.Comm, or whatever he has, has not been of use to him in the operation of the economics of the health services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I see is a Minister pursuing monetarist, right wing policies and being used by his partner in Government, the Fine Gael Party.  Fine Gael in Coalition <Col N="218" /> have a habit of appointing Labour Ministers to Health.  Traditionally doctors tend to vote Fine Gael.  But by putting Labour Ministers in the Department of Health Fine Gael can hold up their hands, Pontius Pilate fashion, and say they are not responsible, that it was a Labour Minister who brought about all these cutbacks. I see the Labour Minister being used by his Fine Gael partners, and he is so tied up with Labour affairs that he fails to see what is happening.  This is what is happening: the Labour Party and the Labour Minister are being used by their partners in Government and they can say it was not their fault.  I am astonished that Labour have not seen what is happening.</P>
    <P>I am wondering why the Minister, who was so adamant about not being moved from that Department and who threatened to resign if the Taoiseach moved him, cannot exert that same strength in winning more money for the health service. He should have told his colleagues and his adversaries at the Cabinet table that he would not accept cutbacks in his Department, that this could not be done, that he was prepared to stand by his principles and resign, if necessary, rather than be asked to implement such cutbacks. These are affecting the Leas-Cheann Comhairle's area as badly as those of any other Member.  What he has failed to recognise is that we have an increasing population.  The old and the young are on the increase and these are the people who need the health services most.  This has not been taken into consideration in providing funds for the health services.  There are ever greater demands on these services, by virtue of our ageing population.</P>
    <P>No account was taken of the newer diagnostic methods, more modern operations and procedures which people are demanding.  These new, sophisticated methods are being used in our services and being demanded by the public, but no provision has been made for them. They are using up the funds provided for psychiatric and geriatric services.  This is what is happening and is causing today's problems.  I ask the Minister if he would initiate a debate on this whole subject as <Col N="219" /> to whether the public were prepared to pay for these new methods which are now available and expected by them.  I would have thought that he would have initiated such a debate because it is necessary.</P>
    <P>The Minister lost a glorious opportunity to initiate a crusade in regard to our health services, to win public support and bring about proper and more efficient health services, on an orderly, rational basis, perhaps of cutbacks over a number of years, with an input from the public, from the medical profession and others, who are actively involved in these services. Had this been done, we might have seen a proper approach, not the elephant in the china shop approach of the Minister.</P>
    <P>He should have gone back to the Cabinet table and admitted that he was wrong.  He should have said that the cutbacks proposed in the budget for the health services are unrealistic and cannot be implemented without untold harm to the public in general, to the patients, especially in the area of psychiatry and geriatrics.  He should be courageous enough to do this.  He should demand at the Cabinet table a supplementary budget to bring the health services at least up to the level of last year.  He has an obligation to do this and anybody of principle would.</P>
    <P>The people who are badly hit by these cutbacks are those whom the Labour Party, his party, purport to represent and it astonishes me that a Minister from that party would allow them to take effect. For some obscure reason he seems to take a perverse pleasure in bringing about these cutbacks.  It amazes me when he tries to prove that what he is doing is right, that he is providing sufficient finance, that the services are better and that there is no diminution of them.  This is what he has the audacity to do.</P>
    <P>We cannot treat health services like any other economic Department.  They are unique.  One can judge a country by the quality of its health service.  We spend some £1.274 billion on our health services. There are areas of waste and there <Col N="220" /> is need for a rationalisation of these services; I do not deny that.  However, it must be done over a long period.  That area does not lend itself to cutbacks which take effect immediately.  You are dealing with human beings who are ill and you can cause serious misery.</P>
    <P>The Government brought in these cutbacks in the psychiatric hospitals, for example, at St. Dympna's Hospital, Castlerea.  That caused much concern to many patients.  You cannot act like this. Anyone approaching the subject of rationalisation of the health services must do so in a humane way.  The Minister has been most inhumane in his approach; he has done much harm.  A great many people will remember him as the Minister who dismantled the services and did almost irreversible harm to them.  It will take a long time to bring those services back to normal, to restore the confidence of those working in the services and this is terribly important.  Insecurity has been introduced among these people.</P>
    <P>The Minister said the general medical services are normal.  However, the pressure being put on doctors in the general medical services is unbelievable.  The Minister would not have the courage to explain to the public about the cutbacks; he puts the onus on the doctors in the service, saying that unless they stop visiting patients they will be severely disciplined. Letters have gone out to doctors &mdash; this is a form of intimidation &mdash; telling them that their visits to patients or having their patients visit them are above normal and cannot be tolerated.  How can the Minister say whether a patient needs more or less visits?  How can he dictate this?  With doctors having ever more geriatric patients, the demands on their services are greater.  This has not been taken into consideration under the bureaucratic system which operates with the full connivance of the Minister.  He should have the courage to tell the patients that they cannot visit the doctor.  In this way, the public will know the real facts.  If this were done, we might see a totally different approach to the health services.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Dukes) Alan Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Dukes)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann takes note of the White Paper entitled &ldquo;Treatment of persons in custody in Garda stations&rdquo;: proposals for regulations to be made by the Minister for Justice.</P>
      <P>The White Paper which the motion asks the Dáil to take note of contain proposals for regulations to be made by me about the treatment of persons in custody in Garda stations.  Section 7 of the Criminal Justice Act of 1984 requires me to lay these regulations in draft form before each House and provides that the regulations cannot be made until they have been approved by both Houses.  The House may wonder, therefore, why there should be a debate on the proposals when there will be, in any event, a further debate on the draft regulations themselves.</P>
      <P>The reason is that section 7 of the 1984 Act does not provide that the House may make amendments to the draft regulations. Without a motion of the kind we have here this evening, there would be no opportunity for the House to make its views known on the proposals and to have them taken into account before the draft regulations are made and laid before it for approval.  I therefore decided, with the agreement of the Opposition spokesman, to follow this particular procedure so that we would have the opportunity of having a substantive debate before the draft regulations come before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the proposals themselves, the most important are, perhaps, those dealing with the responsibilities of the member in charge, the provision of a custody record for each person in custody, the information to be given to arrested persons and the special provisions for persons under 17 years and the mentally handicapped.  The proposals also deal with a wide variety of other matters such as the circumstances in <Col N="222" /> which persons in custody can be questioned and the procedure to be followed in relation to visits, foreign nationals, searches, medical treatment and complaints.</P>
    <P>The key provision is that making a readily identifiable member of the Garda Síochána responsible for overseeing the application of the regulations.  This member, the member in charge, will normally be a sergeant and a written record must be maintained in each station containing the name and rank of the member in charge at any given time. Except where the number of persons in custody make it impracticable, the regulations will require the member in charge to visit persons in custody from time to time and make any necessary inquiries. The member in charge will also be responsible for contacting solicitors and other persons requested by the person in custody and, where the regulations allow a departure from the standard procedures as, for example, where a person is to be questioned at night, that member's authority will be required before questioning can take place.</P>
    <P>The custody record will provide a full account of the detention of the person to whom it relates.  The information to be recorded in it includes such matters as details of the arrest, interviews, searches conducted and any requests made by the person and the action taken.  The member in charge will be responsible for the accuracy and completeness of all entries in the record and this will be without prejudice to the responsibility of any other member for the accuracy and completeness of any entry which he or she has made.</P>
    <P>In line with the provisions of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984, arrested persons must be informed of their entitlement to consult a solicitor and to have one other person notified of their detention.  A person under 17 years of age will also be informed that a parent or guardian is being told of the detention.  These provisions will apply to all persons in custody and in this respect they go beyond what is required by the Act, which applies only to those detained under section 4 of the <Col N="223" /> Act or section 30 of the Offences Against the State Act.  The giving of that information and the time it takes place will be recorded in the custody record.  In addition, the regulations will provide for arrested persons to be informed of the offences for which they have been taken into custody.  There is also provision for reasonable access to solicitors.</P>
    <P>Special provision is made for young persons in custody.  This includes a prohibition on questioning in the absence of a parent or guardian except in certain limited circumstances.  Where, exceptionally, a young person is to be questioned in the absence of a parent or guardian, arrangements must be made for the attendance of some other responsible adult, not a garda, if this is practicable. These special provisions also apply to those over 17 years who may be mentally handicapped.</P>
    <P>In preparing these proposals regard was had to the various suggestions put forward by Members of this House during the debate on the Criminal Justice Bill, to the code of practice recently adopted in England and Wales and to the recommendations of the Ó Briain Committee. That committee was appointed to recommend safeguards for persons in custody and for members of the Garda Síochána and it reported in April 1978.  Following publication of its report the then Government indicated that it had decided to accept the recommendations subject to a number of exceptions and reservations. The relevant chapter of the Garda code dealing with the treatment of prisoners was subsequently revised to incorporate the recommendations that were accepted.  Some of the recommendations are of course outside the scope of the regulations now proposed.</P>
    <P>The Ó Briain recommendations that are relevant to the treatment of arrested persons are, with very few exceptions, being implemented in the proposed regulations, with minor modifications in some cases.  The regulations go further in several aspects and cover matters not dealt with in the Ó Briain report &mdash; for example, searches, medical treatment, special <Col N="224" /> provision for young persons and the mentally handicapped, and so on.</P>
    <P>There are two recommendations relevant to the regulations that are not being implemented.  The first is that, where the person in custody asks for a named solicitor, questioning should not commence until a reasonable time, between one and two hours in most cases, has elapsed for his attendance.  The second is that a solicitor should be entitled, as of right, to attend questioning as an observer.  In considering these recommendations the Government &mdash; as also the Government then in office &mdash; had to bear in mind the interests not only of arrested persons but also of the community at large in having crimes properly investigated.</P>
    <P>The fixing of any particular period before which questioning could not commence, such as was suggested in the report, would give rise to obvious practical difficulties.  It could bring into question admissions volunteered by the suspect while waiting for the solicitor to arrive.  And it would prohibit questioning even where that was urgently necessary to avoid, say, a risk of injury to persons, serious damage to property, destruction of evidence or escape of accomplices. The then Government agreed that a reasonable time for the attendance of a solicitor should be allowed before the person in custody was asked to give a written statement and the regulations propose to continue the practice which has existed since then.</P>
    <P>With regard to the recommendation that a solicitor should be entitled to attend the questioning a person in custody as an observer, the Government is not disposed to accept this proposal.  It must be borne in mind that when a solicitor arrives at a station, a suspect will have the opportunity to consult with the solicitor privately and to receive appropriate advice.  In the context of the report of solicitor's subsequent presence as an observer during the interview must only be intended to provide a guarantee against oppressive questioning or false allegations against the gardaí conducting the interview.  In the Government's view this objective is adequately secured by <Col N="225" /> the safeguards proposed to be provided in the regulations, particularly the responsibility placed on the member in charge, by periodic visits to the person in custody and otherwise, to ensure that the regulations are being complied with.  Of course the only definitive and objective answer to providing such a guarantee is the introduction of electronic recording of questioning of suspects to which I will refer later.  In all this it is necessary to strike a balance between the public interest in the fair treatment of suspected persons and the public interest in the detection of crime, particularly serious crime, and bringing to justice those who commit it.  We have to take into account also the fact that, as compared with other countries, the period for which the Garda will be able to detain persons suspected of non-subversive crime is comparatively short &mdash; a maximum of 12 hours during which questioning may take place.</P>
    <P>The Ó Briain Committee also recommended that a person arrested and brought to a station should have a custodial guardian assigned to him or her by the station sergeant or senior garda present; in section 30 cases, the custodial guardian was to be assigned by a chief superintendent and to be at least of inspector rank.  The proposals do not give effect to this recommendation in so far as it appears to have been the committee's intention to have an individual custodial guardian assigned to each person in custody.  Such an arrangement would be impracticable.  Under the proposals, which give effect to section 7 of the Criminal Justice Act, the member in charge of the station will be generally responsible for the welfare of all persons in custody in that station.  No special provision is being made in this respect for section 30 cases.</P>
    <P>I do not think the House will want me to go into the details of the proposals at this stage.  Most of them are, of their nature, self-explanatory, but there is one reference that appears to have caused some difficulty and that is the reference in regulation 16 to, &ldquo;persons other than <Col N="226" /> arrested persons&rdquo;.  This has been interpreted as meaning persons who have come voluntarily to a station and are not under arrest.  However, it is clear from the text of the regulation itself that the persons referred to in it are persons who are in custody so that it could not apply in the type of case mentioned.  The confusion may have arisen because the heading to the regulation does not contain a reference to the persons in question being in custody.</P>
    <P>At all events, the persons covered by this regulation are mainly those who are in custody in a Garda station after being remanded in custody by a court or peace commissioner.  They would be persons in custody awaiting transfer from the courts to prison or persons in transit from prison to the courts.  Many of the provisions relating to arrested persons would not be appropriate to those persons, for example, the provisions about questioning. Regulation 16 makes the necessary modifications. Of course, the subsequent regulations, Nos. 17 to 24, apply to all persons in custody, whether they have just been arrested or not.</P>
    <P>Another point I should make clear is that the proposals do not affect the Judges' Rules in any way.  The new regulations will supplement the rules, not replace them.  At one time consideration was being given to incorporating the rules, in an up to date form, in the regulations but this was decided against because, for one thing, the regulations can be made to apply only to persons in custody in Garda stations whereas the rules apply also to persons suspected of crime who either are not in custody or are in custody elsewhere than in a Garda station.</P>
    <P>The proposed regulations are part of a series of measures undertaken by the Government in fulfilment of their programme on taking office.  They are designed to strengthen the powers of the Garda Síochána in investigating serious crime while, at the same time, providing adequate safeguards for persons in custody as well as for the gardaí, who are frequently the object of false accusations of ill-treatment by persons who hope that <Col N="227" /> by making them they will have their confessions declared inadmissible.  These measures are the Criminal Justice Act, the Garda Síochána (Complaints) Bill and the proposed regulations we are now considering.</P>
    <P>The new complaints machinery and the regulations must be in operation before the detention and certain other provisions of the Criminal Justice Act can be brought into force.  When that has been done &mdash; and I hope the complaints Bill can be passed and the regulations made before the summer recess &mdash; we shall have in place a statutory framework that can I think be claimed to achieve a proper balance between the interests of accused persons and the interests of the community &mdash; on whose behalf the gardaí act &mdash; in investigating crime and bringing those who commit it to trial.</P>
    <P>There is one more safeguard which is also provided for in the Criminal Justice Act and which is still to come.  That is the provision of electronic recording of the questioning of persons in custody.  The committee which my predecessor, Deputy Noonan, appointed to consider the matter propose &mdash; with my approval &mdash; to conduct field trials in this area once the detention provisions of the Criminal Justice Act are in operation.  I hope these trials will provide within a reasonably short time sufficient information to enable a satisfactory system to be adopted generally.  In the meantime the committee are profiting from the experience of other countries which have already adopted recording systems or are carrying out pilot studies.  I believe that recording of questioning is the most effective means of protecting the gardaí from false allegations of oppressive treatment and I look forward to the time when it is in general use.</P>
    <P>As I said at the beginning, I am moving this motion so as to be able to ascertain the views of Deputies on the proposals in the White Paper before coming back to them with draft regulations for approval. I want to assure the House that when the regulations are being finally drafted I shall give very careful consideration to <Col N="228" /> any suggestions that Members may make in the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to welcome the motion and assure the Minister that our comments on it will be constructive. Almost three years ago when the then Minister for Justice introduced the Criminal Justice Bill, 1983, I proposed that the new Garda powers of arrest and detention on suspicion should be accompanied by two balancing measures, an independent commission for investigating complaints against the Garda Síochána &mdash; I gave it the title, the Garda Síochána Complaints Commission &mdash; and a set of safeguards for the treatment of persons in custody in Garda stations.</P>
      <P>Those measures were included in an extensive series of amendments which I put forward on behalf of Fianna Fáil on the Committee Stage of the Bill.  We outlined in considerable detail the type of safeguards we considered necessary to go along with the new powers being created. We proposed that, if a person was being detained in a Garda station between midnight and 8 a.m., no questioning for the purpose of investigating an offence should take place during that period unless the member in charge certified in writing that he had reasonable grounds for doing so.</P>
      <P>I outlined the protections I felt should be included in the Bill.  I proposed that, where a person was arrested and brought to a Garda station, the member in charge of the station should enter in the record of the station without delay details of the arrest.  I outlined what should be entered into that record or, as the Minister described it, the custody record.  We proposed that questioning should not exceed four hours, that there should be a break and visits to detainees.  We also raised the question of electronic recording of the questioning of the person detained.  In another amendment we dealt with the establishment of a Garda Síochána complaints commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Report Stage we went further and produced suggestions in regard to regulations. However, the Minister refused to consider our suggestions as part of the <Col N="229" /> Bill or in parallel with its passage through the Dáil.  I thought it should have been possible to include the measures in the Bill or in a document to be put through the House at the same time.  At that time the Government adopted an unusual procedure by producing a supplementary memorandum to go with the Bill.  In that the Government gave an undertaking to establish a complaints procedure involving an assessment by an independent person or tribunal.  It was stated then that it had not been decided whether legislation would be necessary to establish such a procedure or whether it could be introduced on an administrative basis.</P>
    <P>I pointed out at that time that the new complaints system had been incorporated in the Police and Criminal Evidence Act, 1983, in Britain.  It was my view that the measure should have been included in the Bill or taken in parallel.  The implementation of the new powers for the Garda Síochána depended on the introduction of the safeguards for persons in custody and the new Garda Síochána complaints procedure.  It is interesting to note what happened in relation to this. People often say that the Seanad has no relevance.  Last Saturday was the first Saturday in 12 years that the Seanad sat.</P>

      <P>In any event, the Seanad on that occasion did not agree with the Minister and felt that something more definite should be done about this aspect, and that there should be a very definite <Col N="230" /> commitment to the inclusion of these in the Criminal Justice Act and that the powers should not be given until these were enacted.  This tended to come back to the situation suggested to the then Minister, the result of which was the Seanad made an amendment which reads as follows:</P>
      <P>(2) An order shall not be made under subsection (1) in respect of any of the following sections namely, sections 4 to 6, 8 to 10, 15, 16, 18 and 19 until provisions relating to the investigation and adjudication of complaints by the public against members of the Garda Síochána not above the rank of chief superintendent have been enacted by the Oireachtas and have come into operation and until regulations under section 7 have been made.</P>
      <P>The Minister accepted the amendment which came back to this House from the Seanad.  The Minister put it before the House which does not happen very often. At that stage I proposed an amendment to the Seanad amendment as follows:</P>
      <P>. . . have been enacted by the Oireachtas for the investigation and adjudication of complaints from the public against members of the Garda Síochána by or under the direction of an independent complaints commission and until regulations under section 7 have been approved by the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>The Minister accepted that he had to include these before he went ahead with the new powers.  On Report Stage in the Dáil we proposed an amendment.  There was agreement at the end on the following amendment:</P>
      <P>. . . of complaints from the public against members of the Garda Síochána not above the rank of chief superintendent and the adjudication by a body other than the Garda Síochána of such complaints have been enacted by the Oireachtas and have come into operation and until regulations under section 7 have been made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The procedure at that time was very interesting.  It led finally to the Criminal <Col N="231" /> Justice Bill.  Section 2 contains that amendment.  Those sections of the Criminal Justice Act have been lying in abeyance since that time.  The other sections of the Act which were very valuable, helpful and useful went into operation in the interim period.</P>
    <P>As a consequence of this approach by the Government, the new Garda powers in the Criminal Justice Act, 1984, have remained in cold storage for two years. The power of arrest and detention on suspicion to enable the Garda to question a suspect initially for six hours and on extension for a further six hours has not yet been given to the Garda.  If, as the Minister suggested, the new powers would greatly assist the Garda in their work, they should have been made available without delay.  The measures we put forward in 1983, with amendments where considered necessary, would have made this possible two years ago.  I accept fully that the Minister, his Department officials and the Attorney General might have had suggestions and amendments to make but that could have been done at that time.  This would have brought into operation the powers the House gave under the Act.</P>
    <P>It is noteworthy that the Minister's proposals are to be cited as the Criminal Justice Act, 1984 (Treatment of Persons in Custody in Garda Stations) Regulations 1986.  This presumably means that safeguards are to be applied only in association with arrests under the Criminal Justice Act, 1984, or the Offences Against the State Act, 1939.  The Minister said they apply specifically to those areas with the limited exceptions which the Minister mentioned, particularly the aspects which apply to under 17 year olds and the mentally handicapped.  These are very welcome steps and measures which have resulted from very thorough and comprehensive debate in the House.  Naturally, we welcome them.</P>
    <P>The method of discussing the Minister's proposals by way of a motion is a most unsatisfactory procedure for dealing with such an important series of safeguards. The Government should have <Col N="232" /> placed a more comprehensive measure before the House so that it could be amended, as necessary.  I appreciate the position the Minister is now in as a result of the amendment which eventually went into the Act.  The Government should also have broadened the range and scope of the regulations to cater for persons generally who are being questioned in Garda stations and to safeguard members of the Garda Síochána.  The present proposals relate only to persons who are in custody in Garda stations.  They do not necessarily apply to persons who are helping the Garda with their inquiries.  I appreciate that the extent to which they would apply in helping the Garda with their inquiries would very because some of the circumstances would be different. There is a need to apply the major part of these measures to people who are helping the Garda with their inquiries.</P>
    <P>It will be remembered in the Kerry babies case the Hayes family had not been arrested.  They were simply helping the Garda with their inquiries.  In future, the safeguards which are intended to protect citizens and gardaí alike should apply to all cases where persons are questioned in Garda stations.  The report of the committee chaired by Mr. Justice Barra Ó Briain in 1978 set out the principal measures which should be adopted in this area. Looking back on that report, as we did at the time of the debate on the Criminal Justice Bill in 1983 and into 1984, it seems to have been an excellent report with very valuable suggestions.  While the Minister may have found that some of them were not practicable, he would have to admit that the bulk of the proposals were very relevant and useful.  I am glad they are now being brought into operation.</P>
    <P>On page 15 of that report the committee recommended that the practice of taking people to a Garda station to be questioned to help the Garda with their inquiries should be discontinued.  From a practical point of view I can recognise that the Garda and the Minister might see difficulties in that, in that very often people will go very obligingly and freely to help the Garda with their inquiries. That being the case, it is all the more <Col N="233" /> important that they too should have the protection of the measures which the Minister is introducing and which are required to bring into operation the powers in the Criminal Justice Act.  The Ó Briain study followed serious allegations concerning the interrogation of suspects in the mid seventies under the then Coalition Government.</P>
    <P>The report, as I have said, was a very comprehensive one.  It dealt with most of the elements mentioned in the Minister's proposals at this stage, including a complaints tribunal which will be dealt with separately by the Minister.  The Committee Stage of that Bill is coming up in the House in the near future.</P>
    <P>Since the time of the Ó Briain report the need for such safeguards has been reemphasised by the death of Peter Matthews in Shercock Garda station, the Kerry babies case, with which everyone is familiar, and the Rory Buckley Pro-Life Amendment questioning.  That was a very interesting case and I would advise the Minister to read the affidavit submitted in that case.  I regard that person as a very reliable witness and he was questioned under the Offences Against the State Act.  I would refer at this point to the Minister's speech in which he said:</P>
    <P>We have to take into account also the fact that, as compared with other countries, the period for which the Garda will be able to detain persons suspected of non-subversive crime is comparably short &mdash; a maximum of 12 hours during which questioning may take place.</P>
    <P>That Act has been used in cases which clearly were not of the subversive type. The Rory Buckley case is a classical example of the use of the Act.  I do not disagree generally with the Minister in what he said in that respect but he must be aware that it has been used in other circumstances in which the crime is not of the subversive type.  That case involved malicious damage to a £15 photocopying machine and the person spent 24 hours in custody and was questioned for most of that time, with rest periods.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="234" /> That case fairly strikingly brought forth the circumstances in which questioning takes place.  Another was Amanda McShane in Crumlin Garda station.  All charges were dropped when it transpired that when she was being questioned in the station by detectives in relation to a post office robbery a solicitor discovered a document written in the first person purporting to implicate Miss McShane in the crime, but the document was unsigned and she had not made any admissions to the Garda.  There is the case of Michael Ward who confessed to committing 26 burglaries, nine of which were committed while he was in Mountjoy Prison.  There is another case in which a person was being questioned in Malahide Garda station. He received substantial damages in a court action later.</P>
    <P>These were different kinds of cases and indicated that circumstances can arise in which both members of the public and the Garda would benefit from the protection of the measures the Minister is suggesting. The presentation of these proposals, although two years after they were raised on the Criminal Justice Bill, represent a step forward.  We welcome the setting out of clear and explicit regulations which will be open to inspection by the Garda and the public at large. These proposals take into account many of the suggestions I made during the passage of the Criminal Justice Bill and measures already taken by the Garda but which had not been made so explicitly known to the public.  The Minister dealt with some of these in his speech, but setting these out in a clear, explicit way in a document to which citizens generally can refer and be aware of is important.</P>
    <P>The inclusion of these measures in statutory regulations will be an important protection for members of the public and the Garda.  I will not go into cases in which the Garda have expressed concern but I have been approached by gardaí who in relation to their colleagues would have welcomed the protection of some measures like those to which the Minister referred.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding this, I must point to a <Col N="235" /> number of defects, omissions and weaknesses in the Minister's proposals.  The safeguards should apply to all citizens being questioned in Garda stations, even if at the time they are not in custody. Persons who are helping the Garda with their inquiries must be safeguarded and the rules which apply to them must be explicit and clear.  Those who co-operate voluntarily with the Garda must know that they are free to leave if they so desire.  They must also know what their legal status is while they are in a station and if and when their status as persons assisting the Garda changes to one of being in custody.</P>
    <P>It is noteworthy that no provision for the video or other forms of electronic recording of interviews has been made in the Minister's proposals.  An indirect reference to a possible future introduction of electronic means is made in section 12 (10), which deals with interviews generally, but the Minister has not set out his proposals in this regard.  In his speech he referred to this as follows:</P>
    <P>But there is one more safeguard which is also provided for in the Criminal Justice Act and which is still to come.  That is the provision of electronic recording of the questioning of persons in custody.  The committee which my predecessor appointed to consider the matter propose &mdash; with my approval &mdash; to conduct field trials in this area once the detention provisions of the Criminal Justice Act are in operation.</P>
    <P>I understand that these field trials have been going on for some time.  They were done in Scotland and England before the Minister's arrival in the Department of Justice.  We understood that what the Minister now refers to as &ldquo;field trials&rdquo; were pilot studies which would yield information to the Minister which he could use.  With the Minister's approval, the committee will conduct field trials once the detention provisions of the Criminal Justice Act are in operation. Obviously, the Minister thinks it would not be possible to get much information <Col N="236" /> on that in advance of making these new measures available.</P>
    <P>Questioning under the Offences Against the State Act is being carried out from time to time.  Whenever we ask for figures we are told there are not many charges in court.  The questioning has decreased in recent times but it should have been possible to have carried out these field trials so that we would now have more definite information.  The Minister said today:</P>
    <P>In the meantime the committee are profiting from the experience of our countries which have already adopted recording systems or are carrying out pilot studies.  I believe that recording of questioning is the most effective means of protecting the Garda from false allegations of oppressive treatment and I look forward to the time when it is in general use.</P>
    <P>I should have thought it would have been possible to set up some field trials long before now in order to get information. It could have been done to consider the extent to which video recording might be used.  An argument made is that if an electronic tape recording is made a person might not be too happy about giving information but obviously that would not apply if a video recording was in operation.  I had hoped that the Minister would have made some progress with regard to pilot studies and trials in connection with this matter and I am disappointed that progress has not been made. It appears the committee are only planning to conduct field trials when the detention provisions of the Criminal Justice Act are in operation.  That is putting it a long way down the road.  Even if the legislation dealing with the complaints procedure is passed by the House before the summer recess, the provisions will have to be in operation before the Criminal Justice Act can be implemented in full.  I ask the Minister to consider the matter in an effort to have some progress made.  In my innocence I understood pilot studies were proceeding.  In fact, I think we were told in this House that such studies were about to start.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="237" /> The Minister has accepted the need to limit the duration of continuous questioning to a maximum of four hours.  That was the period I proposed by way of amendment to the Criminal Justice Bill. However, I also suggested a break of one hour before the next questioning period began.  The Minister allows only for a reasonable interval between periods of questioning.  That is highly subjective.  A minimum interval should be included, as was also suggested in the Ó Briain report, between consecutive periods of questioning. There should be a clear indication of the interval necessary after four hours of questioning.  To most normal citizens &mdash; I am not talking about hardened criminals &mdash; the circumstances under which questioning would take place would be somewhat frightening and disturbing.</P>
    <P>One of the dangers in psychological pressure that can be applied during periods of serious and intensive questioning is that of disorientation.  The loss of any sense of time is a disorienting factor and this is used in some jurisdictions to wear down the person being interrogated. To guard against such an abuse we propose that the person being questioned should be permitted to retain his or her watch and if this is not done it should be possible for them to see a clock.</P>
    <P>We also propose that the person questioned should be provided with writing materials if requested so that they could keep necessary notes during the course of the interview.  As I said at the time by way of amendment, they should be entitled to make and to retain notes in writing to assist with recall and memory should the matter be brought subsequently to court.  This would help to avoid subsequent disagreement and conflict regarding matters discussed during questioning. It would protect both the members of the Garda and the person being questioned and would ensure better quality evidence in the interests of securing the conviction of the guilty.  It is well known that dishonest allegations are often concocted by accused persons long after the questioning in a Garda station. The keeping of notes would help to prevent this and a jury would be in a better <Col N="238" /> position to place greater reliance on confessions made in Garda stations.  At the time the Minister said he would look into the matter and he said it might be done. If I remember correctly, he said he would speak to the Commissioner about it. However, more than that is required. It should be a standard procedure on request.  I know it is done in some cases and the Minister might consider including such a provision.</P>
    <P>The Minister has made no provision for those arrested on suspicion under the Criminal Justice Act and who cannot afford to engage a solicitor.  The Act made provision for solicitors and there was much debate and discussion about the matter at the time.  If a person is in a Garda station for questioning one's advice would be that he should contact his solicitor or get the solicitor to ring the station on his behalf so that the superintendent or gardaí in the station would know the solicitor had an interest in the matter.  That could be helpful to the person detained but if he has not the resources to get a solicitor that provision will be of little use to him.  The free legal aid scheme applies only from the time a person is charged.  The Ó Briain Committee recommended that a feasibility study be undertaken, in conjunction with the Law Society, of a scheme involving a panel of duty solicitors who would be available when a person in custody required the advice of a solicitor.  The Minister should say if this study has been undertaken and he should indicate his views on the matter.</P>
    <P>The section on inquiries seems to cover adequately the points raised in the debate on the Criminal Justice Act.  There is a requirement to notify the district headquarters, or in the Dublin metropolitan area a designated station, that a person had been held in custody at a certain Garda station.  This meets the fear that there could be difficulty in locating the whereabouts of the detained person. However, this does not apply to persons who are voluntarily helping the gardaí with their inquiries.  Their position needs to be clarified.  I appreciate that in most circumstances they are less likely to be <Col N="239" /> moved from one station to another and, therefore, the extent to which it would apply to them would be limited.  Nevertheless, this matter should be given some consideration.  There are examples of cases where people were moved from one station and their relations could not contact them.  This led to considerable difficulties when the cases came to court and a great deal of legal argument ensued.  If the Minister allows this provision it will be most useful.  The Ó Briain Committee suggested that a central agency be instituted in every Garda district for recording the whereabouts of every person taken into custody.  They went on to make that a firm recommendation. I recognise that in a very practical way the Minister has met that requirement in his proposals.</P>
    <P>Basically, the Minister's proposals are welcome.  I would like to refer briefly to the Select Committee on Crime, Lawlessness and Vandalism which produced a report entitled &ldquo;Safeguards for Persons Being Questioned in Garda Stations and for Members of the Garda Síochána,&rdquo; When the all-party committee considered the safeguards for persons in custody they had to consider also persons in the Garda stations who were not in custody.  That is why they broadened the title to &ldquo;Persons being Questioned in Garda Stations and for Members of the Garda Síochána&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The recommendations of that committee followed the Kerry babies case. The committee in their report on the tribunal of inquiry into the Kerry babies case found that there was no assault on or physical abuse of any member of the Hayes family or Bridie Fuller by any member of the Garda &mdash; chapter 37, summary No. 28.  The committee further noted that the tribunal found that Joanna Hayes, Kathleen Hayes, Ned Hayes, Mike Hayes and Bridie Fuller were, from the strict legal point of view, voluntarily in Tralee Garda station on 1 May 1984 and were not under arrest.  &ldquo;From the practical point of view, however, they all believed they were in custody and not free to leave the station until they should have satisfied the Garda as to their role <Col N="240" /> in the birth and death of the Caherciveen baby, and this belief added to pressure on them to confess to involvement with that baby&rdquo;&mdash; chapter 28, summary No. 30.</P>
    <P>In the body of the report itself the tribunal stated that none of them appreciated their rights or their status as persons in the Garda station &mdash; chapter 32, freedom, page 138.  The committee wished it to be clearly understood that they were not making any observations on the findings of the tribunal.  However, the committee considered that the findings of the tribunal&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am not absolutely clear, but I think there may be High Court actions pending by members of the Garda arising out of disciplinary measures taken following the report of the Kerry babies case.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no need to do that; it was only a passing reference.  The committee recommended that the following safeguards should be provided for persons who were taken into custody under the provisions of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984.  They recommended that a member of the Garda Síochána not involved in the investigation, called a custodial guardian, should be assigned to each person taken into Garda custody. The committee spelled out the responsibilities of the custodial guardian &mdash; advising persons of their rights, ensuring they <Col N="241" /> understand such rights, the general wellbeing of such persons, including medical attention if necessary, ensuring persons are treated humanely and are provided with adequate food if in the Garda station for a long period of time, ensuring that efforts are made to contact the person's solicitor, family or friend, ensuring that adequate records are kept, in particular, any complaints made and action taken, and certifying that the person has been treated properly in accordance with the regulations.  The committee also recommended that electronic recording of interviews should be introduced as quickly as possible on a trial basis.  Those recommendations were made on 22 January 1986.</P>
      <P>The committee also considered that each person, provided there is no risk involved, should be allowed to retain his or her watch, and suitable accommodation needed to be provided for the questioning of persons, which should not last for longer than four hours followed by one hour's break.  The committee recognised that there may be practical difficulties for those members of the Garda Síochána who are appointed as custodial guardians &mdash; for example, where the custodial guardian holds a lower rank than the investigating officer.  While recognising such difficulties, the committee were of the view that the safeguards being recommended are essential.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is general agreement with the nature of the proposals in the Minister's White Paper.  As regards the length of questioning and the need for one hour's break after the first four hours of questioning, in a detailed study on confessions and police interrogation, of suspects, carried out in 1983 by Barry Mitchell, lecturer in law, Coventry Polytechnic &mdash; the <i>Criminal Law Review 1983,</i> page 596 &mdash; he discovered that nearly 86 per cent of defendants were questioned by the police for less than two hours in total.  The normal requirement for questioning was fairly low.  Those accused of non-sexual violence were, for the most part, interrogated only briefly.  Nearly 89 per cent were questioned for less than an hour. There is a great deal of detail in that <Col N="242" /> study on the kinds of questioning and the nature of crime and it is clear that in most instances, especially those to which the Criminal Justice Act would apply, a period of four hours should be more than adequate and, therefore, one hour's break after that is reasonable.</P>
    <P>We support the introduction of the proposed &ldquo;Safeguards for Persons in Custody in Garda Stations and for Members of the Garda Síochána.&rdquo;  It is important that these measures come into being as soon as possible.  I trust that the Minister will give further consideration to the points I have raised in the course of this short debate.  I have not gone in detail over all the positive points raised in the White Paper.  The Minister has already spelled them out, as I anticipated. Those points have been discussed in this House already.  The inclusion of the mentally handicapped was covered in those discussions and I am very glad to see the Minister has covered this point.</P>
    <P>As a community we are faced with unprecedented outbreaks of violent crime, burglary and damage to personal and community property.  The use of guns and weapons in theft and robbery, the vandalism done to schools, community centres, shops and public property and the extensive invasion of homes and of personal security, have created a new sense of fear and frustration in the community. We have a duty to provide the Garda with the manpower and the means to restore law and order.</P>
    <P>The new powers of the Criminal Justice Act are part of the effort to combat crime.  They should be implemented by the Government without further delay. We on this side of the House will co-operate with the Minister in a constructive way in examining and discussing both this motion here tonight and the complaints procedure so that the way can be cleared to introduce the measures which are included in the Act but have not yet been able to come into force.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Minister's speech, I think I have covered most of the points that came to my notice.  The Minister has pointed out that some of these measures and recommendations had been included <Col N="243" /> previously in the Garda code dealing with the treatment of prisoners and were incorporated and accepted there.  We have not access to the Garda code and that is very extraordinary.  I can have the London police code and I cannot have the one that applies here.  I do not come under the category of subversive, but as an Opposition spokesman I think it is sad if not deplorable&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The Minister might take that on board when considering these things.  We were very impressed by the way in which the London Metropolitan Police made these things available to us when we went to see them and the openness with which they treated us as public representatives in that respect.</P>

      <P>I am referring to neighbourhood watch and such things.  The Minister has mentioned a number of things not being implemented and I can see the practical reasons he has given for some of these &mdash; for instance, the solicitor not being in as an observer all the time, and I must agree with him from a practical point of view.  He is making a genuine effort here to meet the requirements in the matters raised in the course of the time in the House.  I would like to congratulate his officials for keeping very good <Col N="244" /> notes.  I am sorry that they are not over here to give us a hand and keep notes because then probably I could refresh his memory on a few other items that were discussed, but we have not got that kind of time.</P>
      <P>All in all, the provisions are very welcome and the sooner they can be put into practice the better.  There is a great deal to be said for having them there as clearcut as possible, explicit regulations about which everybody knows and can refer to and which are of a practical nature designed to be helpful to the Garda in the conduct of their difficult work in this regard and also to the members of the public who find themselves in custody in Garda stations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanMcGahon" hpid="Mr. McGahon Mr. McGahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>Shortly after coming into this House almost four years ago I acquired the tag &ldquo;hang them and flog them&rdquo; because of my extreme right wing support of the Garda Síochána, and of law and order, and from my stated support for capital punishment for crimes of murder of all types, subversive and any others, and flogging for crimes of violence perpetrated on elderly people by youths. I suppose the phrase &ldquo;game keeper turned poacher&rdquo; is not particularly relevant in my case, but I must confess to having changed my mind to some extent. That change was brought about by an experience I had in Drogheda court two months ago when, at the age of 49, never having stood in a court in my life, I was brought in on a trumped up, concocted charge by three young Garda personnel. I was acquitted, but I wonder if I would have been acquitted had I not had the status of TD.  When I first consulted a lawyer on receiving a summons that lawyer, an eminent lawyer, told me that had I not been a TD he would be advising me to plead guilty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That experience made me question the whole spectrum of law and order in this country.  I am still an advocate of law and order, a rather extreme one.  I still believe in capital punishment for crimes of murder and in flogging for crimes of violence, but I am not the blind advocate that I once was for the Garda Síochána. <Col N="245" /> Had this debate taken place in the early months of this year I would have done what I have done blindly on many an occasion in this Chamber.  I would have come in here and voted blindly in support of the Garda Síochána.  I can no longer do so as a result of personal experience, and all our views are conditioned by personal experience.  The late Justice Eileen Kennedy had to be mugged on the streets of Dublin before she accepted the enormity of crimes of mugging and the terror that mugging brings to elderly people, particularly to elderly ladies, and she admitted so in court and her attitude to muggers hardened.  I had to be brought to court in Drogheda on a trumped up, concocted charge to realise the plight that many people must face when confronted by some members of the Garda Síochána. I am still an advocate and supporter of the Garda Síochána and believe that the vast majority of them are decent and upstanding, but there are rotten apples in that barrel as there are in every barrel, in every spectrum of life.</P>
    <P>Because of that I am going to ask the Minister to accept the recommendations in the Ó Briain report that anybody who is charged with a serious crime should be entitled as a right to have a solicitor present when questioned.  It is not enough merely to give a person the right to contact a solicitor and to take appropriate advice from him.  In the context of the report the solicitor's subsequent presence as an observer during the interview must be intended only to provide a guarantee against aggressive questioning or false allegations against the gardaí conducting the interview.  What about false allegations against the accused?  Does anybody here believe that that does not happen? I must confess that for the greater part of my life I did not believe it happened. I believed that it did not happen because it should not happen, therefore it did not happen; but my views have changed.  I do not believe that false allegations against accused are not sometimes arrived by the Garda Síochána.  It is imperative that a person has the right to a solicitor being present when he is being interrogated.  I do not advocate that the solicitor should <Col N="246" /> have the right to intervene but he should be there as a silent witness to what is asked of the accused and what is said.</P>
    <P>The recent adverse publicity regarding the Garda such as the Kerry babies case referred to by Deputy Woods and the terrible tragedy which occurred in Shercock has cast doubt on the Garda Síochána in the view of many fair minded people.  The ghost of Peter Matthews has yet to be exorcised in Shercock and the unsatisfactory non-conclusion of that appalling event cast a reflection not only on the Garda Síochána but on the process of law and justice.  The events at Shercock should never have taken place and I hope the Minister for Justice will not close the book in that regard.  Many more questions need to be asked before the truth is ascertained regarding that tragic event which left a widow and very young children.</P>
    <P>My contribution may be perceived as sour grapes, but I do not see it that way. Over the last few months I have had a battle to try to be responsible in my attitude to this debate.  I reiterate what I said.  I still believe in the concept of law and order and I support the Garda Síochána. However, following personal experience, I am not happy that people should be subjected to hours of interrogation in a police barracks without having a witness present.  I ask the Minister to accept the recommendation in the Ó Briain report that a solicitor should be present during questioning.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make a brief contribution to the debate.  I welcome the publication of the new regulations governing the treatment of persons in custody.  The regulations announced by the Minister are extremely important but, perhaps of greater significance is the fact that they bring us one step further towards the full realisation and implementation of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1983 the House gave long and serious consideration to the need for strengthening legislation which would enable the Garda to deal in a more effective way with the changing pattern of <Col N="247" /> crime and the general deterioration in law and order which, regrettably, were increasingly obvious at that time.  It is a reflection on the House that, three years later, we have not provided the Garda with this much needed legislation.  It makes a mockery of the lip service paid in this House to the need to support the Garda in their increasingly difficult task of law enforcement and protection of citizens.</P>
    <P>Our failure to legislate fully in this area has led to an increasing level of cynicism on the part of the public as they look to this House in desperation for legislative support and protection which they have been seeking for a considerable length of time.  This would involve support for the Garda in their difficult task of law enforcement and also for the citizens.  I do not want to move from the terms of the Bill but everybody in the House will recognise that, over the past five or six years the level of crime and violence has led to great fear and insecurity on the part of many citizens who perhaps have to reside alone, particularly in isolated areas.</P>
    <P>However, having listened to the Minister's speech and read the regulations announced by him, I am happy and satisfied that they go a very long way towards meeting the dual requirements of protecting the citizens' rights and making adequate provision for the Garda.  They are broadly in line with the views expressed by our spokesman on Justice, Deputy Woods, on Second and Committee Stages of the Criminal Justice Act. Members will recall the very objective and constructive debate which took place here over a long period of time and which reflected the concern of every Member of the House in relation to reforming the law in this important area.  My only regret in regard to the eventual outcome of that objective and constructive debate is that, three years later, we are still debating the additional provisions required to allow the full implementation of the Criminal Justice Act.</P>
    <P>The passage of time has not elicited any new thoughts in this essential area of citizen protection which, indirectly, also <Col N="248" /> provides a degree of protection for the Garda in what must be one of the most sensitive and vulnerable areas of Garda duty.  The general area of arrest, questioning and interrogation calls for the highest degree of professionalism on the part of the Garda.  It has always been, to some degree, a grey area where the citizens and indeed the Garda have been exposed and vulnerable.  In the normal cycle of human behaviour, it is inevitable that mistakes are made on both sides and there are many examples of this.  Honest and credible examples were given by Deputy McGahon who expressed himself with sincerity and conviction.</P>
    <P>It must be said, however, that the number of such incidents has been significantly small in terms of the overall performance of the Garda and within the context of the number of citizens who have been taken in for questioning.  It is in the nature of things that those sad and tragic areas receive considerable publicity, as they are entitled to do.  In the normal run of Garda duty, the day-to-day events, the success of the Force rarely receives the same level of publicity.  We should be careful not to take serious incidents out of context and create an impression that there is something seriously wrong within the overall performance of the Garda Síochána.  I know Deputy McGahon did not intend that and gave personal examples of his own experiences.</P>
    <P>The Criminal Justice Act, 1984, gives substantial new powers to the gardaí in relation to the detention of citizens in custody for periods of up to 12 hours on arrest on suspicion.  While members of the Garda Síochána might not agree with me, I believe this provision strengthens considerably the operations of the Garda Síochána and provides them with additional power in the increasingly difficult area of arrest following suspicion.</P>
    <P>The House will agree that the provisions published in these new regulations and insisted upon by us during the debate on the Criminal Justice Bill are essential in the context of the full implementation of all the provisions of that Act.  Members of the Garda Síochána in their role as <Col N="249" /> professional police officers will accept these new regulations in the spirit in which they are introduced, not for the purpose of restricting of casting doubt on the integrity of the Garda Síochána but rather for the purpose of legislating for the fullest possible protection for the citizen in the very sensitive area of detention and questioning.  This House has a duty to the citizen and to those who are arrested under the provisions of the Criminal Justice Act to provide the maximum level and degree of protection for a person in that situation.  I reiterate that the eventual outcome of the long debate on the Criminal Justice Bill will be the putting on our Statute Book of important legislation which will be of immense benefit to the Garda Síochána and will also provide the level of protection which the citizen is entitled to expect from legislators.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the need for balance and I would be the first to give credit to him in this regard.  I am satisfied from the provisions he has announced in these new regulations that a sense of balance will be brought into this very important area.</P>
    <P>The new regulations deal with the human behaviour of the gardaí and the citizen, but the entire document and the Criminal Justice Act itself are silent in the area of the structural environment in which these provisions are to be implemented. I am thinking in particular of the inadequate structural facilities in many Garda stations, especially the cells in which citizens are detained, which are often forbidding and not conductive to coherent thinking in the giving of evidence. We talk about the human aspect of the regulations before us, but we also give some thought to the structural aspect and the kind of conditions prevailing following the detention within our Garda stations of persons arrested for questioning. Such an environment is not helpful to the performance of the gardaí.  In many of the larger stations they find themselves competing for the limited facilities available.  I understand from my contacts with members of the Garda Síochána in this city and other urban areas that the level of structural facilities leaves much <Col N="250" /> to be desired.  If this is the case in relation to Garda performance, it must also have a bearing on the psychological attitude of the person taken into custody for questioning. Although it is not perhaps directly relevant to the regulations which have been published by the Minister, it is an area to which he should give some serious thought in the long term.</P>
    <P>We have no desire to hold up these important regulations and I would ask the Minister to bring the Garda Síochána (Complaints) Bill to an early conclusion, thereby allowing for the full implementation of the Criminal Justice Act.  I was very pleased to hear the Minister say tonight in the House that it is his intention to bring that Bill to a conclusion during this Dáil term.  I do not want to be seen as making a political point, but even the Minister will agree that a three-year waiting period in relation to such important legislation is excessive.  That is not to cast any reflection on the present holder of the office who has been there only a couple of months.</P>
    <P>I am not in favour of hurried legislation. Reasonable delays between the various Stages of Bills allow for mature public debate, often resulting in improved legislation, but I do not think anybody would say that a timelag of three years is necessary to bring out the best in the public and among Members of this House in relation to these measures.  A time span of three years is excessive.  It will be seen as progress if the Minister's ambition is achieved within the present Dáil term.  People who are aware of what is happening on our streets, especially the gardaí who have to act on behalf of the citizens, feel they should have the maximum level of support from this House.</P>
    <P>The move away from community policing in the true meaning of that term will lead to gardaí having to take risks in terms of arrests on suspicion.  The more Garda management isolate gardaí from the community, the more difficult it will be for our gardaí to be fully effective in terms of detection.  The old style of community policing was more effective and provided a greater opportunity for individual police officers to become <Col N="251" /> acquainted with the local community and the movements of people within that community.  Modern scientific methods have taken us away to some extent from that type of policing, but in our built up areas there should be a return as far as possible to that kind of local involvement between police officers and the community in general.</P>
    <P>I believe that we could get the maximum possible return from the community in an environment where the people who administer the law are known to the community and <i>vice versa.</i> Has the Minister any strong views in relation to a change of emphasis in this area?  This area is deserving of the Minister's consideration in the near future.  In my own county, prison duty and the cut in Garda overtime has resulted in small rural stations being denuded of manpower and neglected.  The Minister is shaking his head in disagreement.  I certainly do not want to have any conflict across the floor of the House tonight with the Minister. It is a fact.  My constituency borders the Minister's own and it would not be difficult for him to establish the facts that I bring to his notice tonight.  If the Minister were to speak to any member of the community, particularly in County Laois, he would have to agree that that prison is creating an unnecessary demand on Garda manpower which leads to a reduction in Garda strength.</P>

      <P>There is a strong tradition in that town over a long number of years, and all who have been associated with that prison &mdash; prison officers, prison governors and the Garda Síochána &mdash; have performed in a very professional <Col N="252" /> manner.  I know the Minister is not serious in that suggestion.</P>
      <P>I spoke to the Minister in the House last week about the importance of the new training college in that town.  I do not want to get away from the terms of tonight's debate but I would urge the Minister to make the maximum possible use of that very modern building.  I appreciate very much the Minister's decision to depart from the decision of his predecessor in relation to converting that building into a female prison.  As I indicated on many occasions in this House, it is not a suitable building for the detention of offenders.  I would like to put on record my gratitude to the Minister for changing the Government's thinking in that regard.</P>
      <P>I also urged in the House the necessity for the legislation which we are discussing tonight.  I would make the point that in terms of long term economic and social planning we have, to some extent, got our priorities wrong.  If more emphasis had been placed on economic and social development resulting in job creation, there would not be the need to channel vast sums of public money into the areas of law and order and citizen protection.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an area on which we could have a useful exchange of views.</P>
      <P>Following the final enactment of the Criminal Justice Act, the public should be made aware of their rights and entitlements under the Act.  I am satisfied from the Minister's speech tonight &mdash; although it was not obvious in the regulations themselves &mdash; that serious thought has been given to creating an awareness on the part of the public of their entitlements under these new provisions, because it is inevitable that the Garda, because of their training, will be fully familiar with all aspects of the legislation and will use that knowledge to their fullest advantage in the detection of crime.</P>
      <P>I support Deputy Woods's view that legal aid should be available to those who are helping the Garda in their inquiries. That point was also made by Deputy McGahon.  Given the provisions in the legislation relating to the period of time for which people can be detained for questioning, one would expect that the Minister would make some provision for legal aid who find themselves in that situation. The Ó Briain Report, in making that recommendation, recognised the difficulties accompanying long periods of detention.  Perhaps the Minister would let us have the benefit of his thinking in relation to it and give us reasons as to why it cannot be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was impressed with the regulations announced by the Minister, particularly those in relation to the member-in-charge being the person who, in the final analysis, would be responsible for everything that happens in that station from the moment a person is taken into custody until he is eventually released.  That is a worthwhile safeguard which the public will be quite happy with.  The custody record is also a valuable document.  Perhaps the Minister would tells us who will be responsible for the full inventory of <Col N="254" /> records in the custody record.  Will there be anybody who can confirm or deny that everything which took place in the station during the period has been fully documented and recorded?  I may have missed some point in relation to it but perhaps the Minister will clarify it.</P>
    <P>The entitlement to consult with a solicitor or one other person, as recommended in the Ó Briain report, also provides a degree of protection for the person in custody.  I am particularly impressed by the Minister's recognition of the need to provide special protection for people under the age of 17 because it is tragic that these young people should ever have to be taken into custody.  But since it is in the nature of our society that that will happen, it is extremely important to protect the interests of these young people in such a vulnerable position.  The Minister also referred to the fact that special reference would be made in the custody record to how these young people would be treated when in Garda custody.</P>
    <P>The human aspect of the Minister's wish, and indeed the wish of this House, in relation to the connection between the young offender of 17 years and his parents has been recognised in the regulations. I am pleased that the Minister made provision for the parents to be immediately consulted and, if that was not possible, that some other responsible person, not a garda, would be assigned the task of looking after the interests of that young offender in the short term which he was in the Garda station.</P>
    <P>I could not envisage a situation where any member of the Garda Síochána would in any way illtreat or be unfair to a young offender coming into a Garda station who was under the age of 17 years. I am quite happy that 99 per cent of gardaí would treat these young offenders with the kind of respect that the Minister and Members of this House would be anxious to see.  Nonetheless, in formulating legislation it is important that we build into it the safeguards which are needed for the protection of these young offenders.</P>
    <P>The regulations also make provision <Col N="255" /> for a reasonable period of time to enable the person in custody to get the advice of his solicitor.  While the Minister did not make provision for the time span that we would have hoped for, I presume that he will indicate to us that he is satisfied with the amount of time which has been provided as being sufficient to enable somebody in custody to get the legal advice and protection which would be required in such a situation.</P>
    <P>On balance the public feel that the Garda should be given the maximum amount of legislative support in relation to the difficult task which they perform. We in this House have the difficult task, as has the Minister, of trying to strike some reasonable balance.  We want to see the Garda with all the power that they need to deal with the vandals and criminals who are undermining our society.  I am happy that in our endeavours to give that kind of strength and additional power to the Garda this House is also sensitive to the position of the person who is arrested and has to be detained for questioning.  I thank and compliment the Minister for bringing in these regulations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamSkelly" hpid="Mr. Skelly Mr. Skelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The last time that I spoke in this House I also had the good fortune to follow Deputy Hyland.  On that occasion it was late in the evening when he started his contribution and it was the following morning when he finished it.  It was interesting to see the running battle which took place then between himself and the Chair because he was wandering all over the country in his contribution. He was speaking on anything but the Bill, but finished up by complaining very strongly that the debate was curtailed and limited, that it was a disgrace that this House was not given more time for it.  He had taken most of an hour and a half during a very limited debate on not talking about what was before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He mentioned on the present occasion that he was interested in balance, whereas on the last occasion he never mentioned that word.  It would seem that his constituency is made up entirely of <Col N="256" /> members of the Garda Síochána who are all being harrassed.  As I said on the previous occasion and repeat now, perhaps things are a little different in his part of the country from the position in the city. We have all been striving for balance, even since the Criminal Justice Bill was first introduced into the House.</P>
    <P>It is amazing to hear Deputy Hyland still accuse the Government side of keeping the House waiting for three years for this measure to come through.  It was not the fault of the Department of Justice, certainly, that the criminal law was not revised over the last decade or so.  As I understand it, most of the work had been done in the Department but it was awaiting a Minister courageous enough to pick up the pieces, put them together and put that law into effect.  Whatever we might say about the different aspects of the legislation and the supporting legislation, part of which is provided here, we would certainly have to say that it was this Government which had made this attempt.  Some of us think that part of the legislation was a little rushed, but that has been a little made up for by this part being produced in the form of a White Paper which gives an opportunity to members of the public and members of the House to make suggestions to the Minister in relation to the regulations.  I should be very interested to hear what suggestions and how many he has received from outside the House.</P>
    <P>I quaked when Deputy Woods, standing up to make his contribution, said that he would make a constructive contribution from his side of the House.  I thought of the destructive element in his constructive contribution made last week in connection with another Bill and hoped that he would not follow the same lines.  In his defence, in relation to the Criminal Justice Act and all the debates concerning criminal law which have taken place in the last couple of years, he has been very constructive.  By his detailed research he has made an enormous contribution to the legislation which has gone through the House.  As usual, he has not now left a great deal to be said and I am not going to repeat many things which he <Col N="257" /> has covered.  The Minister showed that he had cast his eye over the previous debates and suggestions that had been made in relation to the regulations, and also complaints in that regard.</P>
    <P>It was back on 7 November 1984 that the Dáil placed a legal restraint on the Minister for Justice, preventing him from bringing into force certain controversial sections of the Criminal Justice Bill until after the Oireachtas had approved a system for investigating complaints against the Garda, as well as regulations for the treatment of people in custody. An order that was made then preventing the Minister from bringing into operations sections 4 to 6, inclusive, 8 to 10, inclusive, 15 and 16, 18 and 19 until the complaints procedure and regulations had been agreed by the Dáil and Seanad was an important concession in the whole package.  The former Minister used to repeat often enough that it was a package and many thought that we would not see all the elements of that package coming together.  This is the final element and I am glad that it has come together.</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods has given the historical aspect of how this came about and there is no need to repeat that.  Nevertheless, I should like to get on to the record some of the reasons and atmosphere prevailing at the time as to why we needed these regulations at all.  I shall illustrate this by an example or two.  In relation to the balance sought then, there was a very hotly contested argument at that time and some of us have been more damaged than others by taking up certain stances. Deputy Woods can get away with talking about the aspects on both sides, alleged abuses on the Garda Síochána side and also on the citizens' die, whereas I have been very unfortunate.  I have not been able to raise the subject of alleged Garda abuse, but all the time I sought a balance. All the institutions in the State should be strong enough to suffer examination, even in the form of a constructive criticism. It is becoming clear now, after a few years of debate on this subject, that we are coming to the end of the objective of formulating a package of measures <Col N="258" /> which would suit both the citizen and the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>We are moving into the domain of the Garda force itself with the objective of up-dating it and bringing it into the eighties which will be for the ultimate benefit of all the members of that force, to all the citizens and to the nation as a whole.  That was the objective of those people who contributed, and it certainly was my objective.  I am a little aggrieved at the kind of pressures which I have been put under because I have dared to ask questions.  People seem to forget that the purpose of Members of the Dáil is to ask questions on behalf of the citizen.</P>
    <P>I quote from <i>New Hibernia</i> of December 1984 an article written by barrister, Adrian Hardiman:</P>
    <P>It seems that those loudly concerned about crime feel it disloyal, or dangerous, to contemplate the possibility that garda powers have been, or may be, abused while civil libertarians view every garda power, actual or proposed, as nothing but a further opportunity for abuse.  Yet the two problems may be opposite sides of the same coin to an extent so far little suspected.</P>
    <P>A garda magazine has described reaction in the force to recently highlighted apparent abuses as &ldquo;shameful and embarrassment&rdquo;.  The consequences for morale have been disastrous. The Shercock case plainly shows not only that gross abuses can occur but that investigators of abuses are likely to be met, within the force, by a wall of silence, or worse, which makes it almost impossible to discover what happened and to prosecute those responsible to conviction.</P>
    <P>When a citizen dies of injuries received in garda custody it is a public scandal if the man or men responsible cannot be found.  In the context of the Criminal Justice Bill, it is plain that the gardaí have sought and got powers of detention and interrogation, in relation to ordinary citizens, which they are unwilling or unable to duplicate in relation to their own members.</P>
    <P>A power to hold a citizen in a garda <Col N="259" /> station away from all outside scrutiny, can only be justified if the detained person's safety and welfare is guaranteed. It is often said that abuses are the work of &ldquo;a few &mdash; a very few &mdash; bad apples&rdquo;.  I believe this is true.  But bad apples may rot a barrel, and this process is evident in the way in which gardaí who would not themselves assault a suspect will not, or cannot, denounce or detect those who do.  A crime committed in the name of the law is worse than any other because it undermines the law itself.</P>
    <P>Abuses of this kind have been a source of concern for at least eight years.  Knowledge of them was not confined to gardaí.  Other organs of the State must share responsibility, notably the prosecutional machinery and elements of the judiciary.  By too readily excusing minor errors and departures from proper practice, and extending too generous a measure of credulity to garda evidence, they have created a climate in which small numbers of gardaí felt they could &ldquo;get away with it&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Equally the legal system itself has not helped: by leaving garda powers and responsibilities in relation to arrest and detention vague, and by leaving uncertain as to what would be accepted by the courts in any particular case, even the most conscientious garda must often be perplexed as to his precise rights and obligations.</P>
    <P>That was the objective of everybody who contributed to the debate on the Bill. That is what we are hoping to achieve.  I might mention to Deputy Hyland and Deputy Woods that, although the Ó Briain report has been around for the last ten years or more, it was not taken up by successive Ministers for Justice in the same way that the criminal law was not taken on board.  When in Opposition those same Ministers complained vigorously that the Government were not doing anything about it.  For term after term the sitting Minister promised that it would be brought forward soon.  The <Col N="260" /> former Minister grasped the nettle.  I hope Deputy Woods's words in his earlier contribution will not ring true.  He said we were going to let loose sections in the Criminal Justice Act which had been reserved until the complaints Bill and this measure were in place and that that is not what will happen.  It will take more than just the balance that we have written down in law to prevent it from happening. It will take a concerted effort on behalf of the Garda also.  They should recognise that this has been to everybody's benefit. Maybe it is the first time &mdash; and it is too long &mdash; that we ever discussed in depth these sort of measures.  The objective is to take the pressure off them and to take the suspicion of abuse of the private citizen and to put the pressure on the criminal.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see that the Minister has taken on board much of the Ó Briain report and even added to it in that all persons in custody come under the regulations. Young persons will also be catered for.  I would like to know, after they have been put before the Dáil and the Seanad, if the Minister has power to make alterations in the regulations.  Does he have to come back into the House to do that?</P>
    <P>I am a little disappointed with the two points which the Minister mentioned in his speech, the named solicitor and the question of reasonable time.  We had much argument during the course of the Bill that a reasonable time should be allowed for a named solicitor to be brought to the station.  That is being rejected for the same reasons the former Minister gave, that it might be impractical in case property was being destroyed or some person was being injured.  We know there are certain phrases which leave a lot of room for non-action such as &ldquo;reasonable times&rdquo;, &ldquo;making a reasonable attempt&rdquo; and &ldquo;provided there are not too many people in custody and the member in charge is able to deal with it&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Many examples were given.  It is easy to think of examples such as, that the member in charge is busy, or he made a phone call and the number was engaged, or he could not get through.  If a person <Col N="261" /> does not want to have a solicitor present, or to have the other person named in the regulations notified, it is very easy to avoid doing that.  It is a pity that we have not tightened up the regulations to give that extra bit of reassurance to somebody in the terrifying, isolated position of being in custody.</P>
    <P>In the course of his contribution Deputy Woods referred to a very important point relating to people detained under section 3 but who will not be under arrest.  It appears that those people are not covered by the regulations, and that is a bad feature.  If the type of crime a person is suspected of attracts a sentence of five years in prison, that person can be detained for questioning.  Let us take the example of a person driving in a borrowed car accompanied by his wife and friend who is stopped by a garda.  If that person gets involved in an altercation with the garda and is not able to give the number of the car he is driving, that person may be taken in because the offence of stealing a car attracts a long sentence. If the garda does not like the look of that person he can take him in just for pig-iron, as happened in the past, and keep him in custody.</P>
    <P>I accept that we need the goodwill of the Garda to ensure that that does not happen.  As other Members have said, the public relations in the Garda leaves a lot to be desired.  The difficulties can only be overcome by members operating with extra goodwill towards citizens. They should treat citizens courteously at all times and not give vent to their temper, pig-headedness or spite.  They should not take advantage of the considerable powers they have under the Criminal Justice Act and the regulations that will be introduced when the Bill dealing with complaints is passed.  A citizen puts his freedom and his trust in gardaí. Most citizens who go to Garda stations to help with inquiries do not know their rights.  I accept that according to the regulations they must be informed of their rights; but, apart from being terrified, most people are anxious to co-operate with gardaí.  It is wrong that there is the possibility that innocent people would be <Col N="262" /> taken advantage of.  The worst type of abuse is the abuse of innocent people.</P>
    <P>I accept what has been said about electronic recording: that field tests are taking place and that it is the Minister's intention to introduce that system as soon as possible.  I am sure the Minister is aware that the Garda Representative Association want videos used to record interrogations and their reasons for that were outlined in an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> on 17 April 1985.  The general secretary of that association, Mr. Jack Marrinan, addressing the annual conference, said the Minister had two reasons in mind when he contemplated the introduction of a system of recording by mechanical means the interrogation of suspects.  One was to protect gardaí against false accusations of going outside the limits of their authority when seeking and securing statements of admission.  According to him the obvious second reason was to ensure that gardaí did not exceed their authority when interrogating suspects. He said that gardaí had begun to depend more and more on statements of admission, statements that were properly and scrupulously taken in accordance with the Judges' Rules.  He said that as statements of admission came to be relied on more and more by the prosecution they also came under attack by the defence. The most effective way to contest the admissibility of a statement of admission was to allege impropriety on the part of the garda who took it, he said.</P>
    <P>Mr. Marrinan referred to the defence tactic to allege that inducements or threats were used to secure a statement of admission and said:</P>
    <P>While the interrogation of suspects had always been a very important aspect of crime investigation, it would become an even greater factor as soon as the provision of section 3 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984, giving them the right to detain for questioning, came into effect.</P>
    <P>The full video and sound recording of questioning would be a protection against this.</P>
    <P>Mr. Marrinan regretted the fact that <Col N="263" /> those systems were not in operation at the time of the Shercock case because it would have satisfied the public and saved the force from a lot of embarrassment. It is desirable to have them because a solicitor cannot be present during the interrogation.  Many people say sound recording would not be sufficient.  A suspect should also have access to the time.  I do not agree that a person should be disorientated in a bare room and left not knowing whether it is night or day outside or whether he has been in custody for one hour, five hours or ten hours. The tendency is not towards inhuman treatment &mdash; they are other words for torture &mdash; but towards humane treatment. I am not suggesting that hardened criminals should be given an easy ride or allowed get away with anything.</P>
    <P>What we are talking about here is the detection of crime, the public interest, possible ill-treatment and accusations against gardaí.  In that respect it is heartening that a member in charge will be responsible for a person in custody.  It cannot be said that we are now trying to hide anything.  It remains to be seen if what is proposed will be a perfect answer. I accept it will be difficult to get perfection but at least we have a basis on which to improve in the future.  I hope we will not be afraid to carry out those improvements. I will always appeal to the Garda not to feel paranoia because Members of the House or the public dare to criticise or point out certain matters to them. Gardaí should be on the side of the citizen and citizens should be on the side of the Garda.  Gardaí often put themselves on the side of the establishment creating a &ldquo;them&rdquo; and &ldquo;us&rdquo; situation.  If they looked critically at their own position they might find that they are being used by the establishment.</P>
    <P>I accept that there are all types of complicated and psychological reasons that can go into the make-up of a member of a police force and that such a person can be conditioned over a number of years into thinking in a certain way.  However, we have a force that is big enough for a country of our size and a promotion <Col N="264" /> procedure that can take care of all that. We also have a wide variety of work and specialisation within the force which can cater for all those things.  Should the concentration not be on management? Although we will not see the effect of the new recruitment methods for some years to come, it is my belief that they will help.</P>
    <P>What is proposed is an advance in that we have incorporated the Judges's Rules. The powers of the Garda have been strengthened immeasurably by the Criminal Justice Act.  It is, therefore, absolutely essential to have protection of persons in custody and the gardaí.  This will become evident over the coming years.  It is absolutely critical that we have a monitoring situation and it will no longer be necessary for either the gardaí or the public, if we have a proper complaints Bill <i>in situ</i> also, to be suspicious, or have anything to hide, or be worried in case they will get a raw deal.  If we have everything up front and are trying to achieve justice, we could take on board the odd indiscretion of a garda.  We realise everybody is human and mistakes are made on both sides.  Gardaí have been abused, individually and collectively. They have also suffered assaults as have members of the public.</P>
    <P>Throughout these debates and discussions we are talking about the innocent citizen.  The innocent citizen in that respect is both the garda and the person who has not committed a crime.  We are not talking about the criminal, but we are saying that a person is innocent until proven guilty and must be given every facility.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend to finish within the next five minutes so that the Minister has 15 minutes to finish up.  I will conclude by making some quick remarks about the regulations which are coming in.  They give effect to many measures which will follow on.  The Garda should not be so <Col N="265" /> sensitive to examination.  They have come around to accepting that.  They are also calling out for an examination.</P>
      <P>I would like to refer to the adversarial and inquisitorial system.  Mr. Marrinan said in relation to interrogation that many of the problems that have been encountered by the force and in accusations have been caused by the system we operate. The different secretariats in the Garda, both the AGSI and the Garda Síochána Representative Body, are calling for an examination of the system and whether we should have an adversarial system or an inquisitorial system.  Some of the tragedies which have been mentioned &mdash; and no one wants to open old sores &mdash; could have been avoided had we an inquisitorial system whereby when the evidence was collected it went to a magistrate who decided whether there was a case to answer or not.  The system that is in place gives rise often to the faults which occur.  They can be avoided if we are brave enough to examine that. All big organisations and institutions in the State should be subject to constant recurring examination.</P>
      <P>Deputy Woods covered quite a few of the things I was interested in.  He spoke frequently about the balance.  I have mentioned that seldom has there been a call for a balance; usually we get people on one side or the other.  It is important that these regulations have been written down and are clear and unambiguous. Garda public relations could do much for themselves.  They will have a big responsibility when these things are put into place.  No one is trying to put them at a disadvantage.  As Deputy Hyland pointed out, if there is a disadvantage for the gardaí we would be very anxious to put that right.  I would like to know from the Minister why persons helping the gardaí with their inquiries cannot be catered for in these regulations.  They should have protection especially if we want people to come forward with information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope Deputy Woods' forecast does not work out to be true when, as he said, the powers of the Criminal Justice Act are let loose.  I hope that will not be the <Col N="266" /> case.  We have to wait and see what will be the result of these regulations when they are put into place.  The citizen can feel reassured that at least we are trying to protect him up front and in writing.  I would also like to see a reasonable interval between the periods of questioning. We find from research in Britain that the amount of time a person spends under questioning is very small, maybe an hour or an hour and a half at the most.  In Scotland, it is an average of about ten minutes.</P>
    <P>I hope the situation will be monitored. The responsible Minister, in the short time since he has taken over this portfolio, is not allowing the grass to grow under his feet.  The Minister has some major legislation which he is working on. I hope he will succeed in the coming year in revamping and reviewing the system and that this will be the most major review of criminal law and other legislation to come from the Department of Justice in a long time.  I wish the measure well and hope we can look back after a year and say it has all been worthwhile, that it is operating fairly and both the Garda and the citizens are happy with it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Dukes) Alan Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Dukes)</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to thank the Deputies who have contributed to this discussion this evening. I was very anxious, as I said at the beginning and some weeks ago, to find a means under which we could have a discussion on the substance of the draft regulations in the House before the draft regulations come before the House.  The debate we have had this evening has been very useful in that connection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I gather from the contributions which have been made that, on the whole, the House welcomes these draft regulations and supports generally the objectives we are setting out to achieve and the method by which we set out to achieve those objectives.  Of course, we are not in the business of second guessing the Criminal Justice Act.  A number of things which have happened since the passage of the Act, the publication of these proposals and the publication of the Garda Síochána (Complaints) Bill have served to put <Col N="267" /> the Act in a slightly different context from that in which some of us saw it during the course of its gestation and passage through the House as a Bill.</P>
    <P>These regulations provide for the treatment of persons in custody in Garda stations. That is made very clear in section 7 of the Criminal Justice Act.  They do not apply, and cannot apply, to persons who are not in custody in Garda stations. However, it is my intention to ask the Garda Commissioner &mdash; I am sure he will agree readily with it, as will the rest of the force &mdash; to apply the same principles when dealing with persons who are not in custody.  I take the point made by all Deputies who were concerned that it will be made very clear to people whether they are in custody or not.  Indeed, that is a point the Garda themselves will take into account fully.  Section 7 (1) of the Act provides:</P>
    <P>The Minister shall make regulations providing for the treatment of persons in custody in Garda stations.</P>
    <P>We do not extend these provisions any further than that, nor am I proposing that we should stop the practice of inviting people to Garda stations to make statements, for a number of reasons.</P>
    <P>It is not difficult to think of situations in which initially there might be enough suspicion to justify an arrest but where further questioning would show that there were not sufficient grounds on which to arrest.  That is a situation we should bear in mind, and I do not think Members of the House would wish to see people being needlessly arrested.  In the heat of argument, people can also overlook the point that there may frequently be circumstances when people would prefer to go to a Garda station to help the Garda with their inquiries, to use the time worn phrase.  A very simple example will bear this out.  A garda might wish to talk to a person in connection with a problem.  The person might understand that that was the case and he would prefer to go to a Garda station rather than to have the garda go to his place of work.</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods referred to three <Col N="268" /> specific cases and Deputy McGahon spoke of another.  I do not intend to discuss any specific cases &mdash; that is not our function here &mdash; but I will say that some of the concern expressed by Deputies will be covered by the provisions in the Garda Complaints Bill.  Some of the concern expressed here this evening &mdash; I understand the reasons for this concern &mdash; can more properly be discussed when that Bill comes before the House.  Our concern tonight is to ensure that the conditions in which people in custody will be treated will be in all respects those the House would wish to see.  That is why we have gone to the trouble of providing in the Act that the regulations would be made, and we are now discussing them in draft.</P>
    <P>Electronic recording of interviews were referred to.  Under the provisions of the Act it is not possible now to carry out these pilot studies.  That cannot begin until the detention provisions of the Act are in force and this cannot be until we have these treatment regulations and the Garda Complaints Bill.  I wish to reassure Deputy Woods that it is not a matter of spinning out or delaying these pilot studies.  The committee are making the necessary preparations so that when the detention provisions come into force we will be ready to get working on this matter.  If he has any further doubts I would redirect his attention to our debate on section 27 of the Act where he will find the basis for what I am saying.</P>
    <P>One or two Deputies referred to disorientation in Garda stations, particularly disorientation that can be caused when people do not know what time it is.  I am tempted to remark, and I apologise to the House for it, that I am slightly disoriented myself because the clocks in the House do not accord by the one I go by, the 8 a.m. time signal on RTE.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no reason why we should make a particular provision in relation to persons in custody keeping their watches, nor is there a reason why <Col N="269" /> we should try to make specific provision in these regulations that would deal with all possible cases.  That is a matter it would be proper to leave for the circumstances in which people in custody are being questioned.  I would go further and say that it would not be possible for the regulations to contain detailed provisions of general application because that probably would be <i>ultra vires</i> in the sense that it would restrict existing statutory powers of search.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Reasonable interval&rdquo; between periods of questioning has been looked at by me very closely.  It has been suggested that we should provide for a specific interval. I do not think that is required, given the overall provision we are making about questioning itself, the manner in which it is to be undertaken and the time that may be spent in questioning.  I would prefer to leave a degree of flexibility rather than to tie things down in a way that might not turn out to be of any advantage to persons in custody.</P>
      <P>Deputies have reminded me of research being carried out elsewhere. Such research would point in the direction of flexibility in the way we have allowed it in the draft regulations.  On that point, I should like to reply to a specific question by Deputy Skelly.  He wanted to know if the Minister has power to alter these regulations.  Yes, but it is a power granted by the Act in section 7 (5), which provides that a draft of every regulation proposed to be made under this section shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.  Inevitably, that means that any amendment of these regulations would have to come before the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Video recording was also referred to. I do not rule out video recording though I am not convinced now that it is necessary. I cannot follow the suggestion of Deputy Woods that, while people might be a little reticent about tape recordings of an interview because of possible identification, they might be less reticent about video recordings.  I cannot follow the logic of that, and I do not think it arises in the way Deputy Woods thought. The only people who would have access <Col N="270" /> to such recordings would be the Garda or the person who has been interviewed, and there is provision in the regulations for the person in custody and his legal representative to have access to such material for a certain time.</P>

      <P>What about the presence of a solicitor during the questioning?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I dealt with that in my opening remarks.  I said that the solicitor's subsequent presence as an observer during the interview must only &mdash; in the context of the report &mdash; be intended to provide a guarantee against oppressive questioning or false allegations against gardaí conducting the interview.  I went on to say that this objective is adequately secured by the safeguards proposed to be provided in the regulations, particularly the reasponsibility placed on the member in charge.  I said that the only definitive and objective answer to providing such a guarantee is the introduction of electronic recording of the questioning of a suspect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy did not hear my opening remarks in which I specifically pointed to the fact that in that regard I do not go along with the Ó Briain report for reasons which I set out.  The suggestion of Deputy McGahon is not one that would either be necessary or desirable in the conduct of interviews.  The word &ldquo;interrogation&rdquo; is the word I prefer not to use &mdash; it has other connotations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are some other points, but I will confine myself to the point made on accommodation.  The House will remember &mdash; I know Deputy Hyland does because I have spoken here on a number of occasions about improvements we are making in Garda facilities.  In these regulations we will designate a number of Garda stations in which interviewing of this kind would take place.  We have a priority programme for the provision of facilities in Garda stations and those <Col N="271" /> improvements in facilities would ensure proper interviewing rooms.  Deputy Hyland will have been in one of these ancillary facilities in the new divisional Garda headquarters in Galway.  It is part of my concern to make sure that <Col N="272" /> improved facilities will be of an adequate standard.</P>

      <P>I am of course concerned at the under-representation of certain socio-economic groups in third level education.  Having said that, I would have to point out that increasing participation by these groups in higher education is a complex problem.

    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that the applicant concerned arrived 13 minutes late for her test appointment.  The driver testing system must be operated on the basis of a strict adherence both by applicants and driver testers to test appointment times; otherwise, the system would break down. Driver testers are given a schedule of tests to conduct at specified times and it <Col N="55" /> is essential that this schedule be maintained.</P>
    <P>Test applicants are given due warning on the notice issued to them of their test appointment that if they do not present themselves at the time appointed for their test, the test will not be conducted and the fee paid will be forfeited.  It is not unreasonable to expect that applicants will make due allowance for possible traffic delays en route to test centres so that they will arrive for their test appointment on time.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances, a further test appointment for the person concerned cannot be arranged until she forwards a fresh application and the appropriate fee to my Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. J. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is difficult to provide a reasonably firm estimate of the extra cost to the Exchequer in respect of the element in payments for insurance against expenses of illness which is attributable to the increased cost of cover for treatment at the locations mentioned.  This is because it is not known how many taxpayers will avail of the increased cover and what their marginal tax rates are.  However, it may be useful to give an indication of the rough orders of magnitude involved.  On the assumption that some 20,000 subscribers were to move from existing VHI schemes to the new schemes D and E, then a broad estimate of the additional cost of the tax relief would be £3 million in a full year.</P>

      <P>Entitlement to unemployment assistance is dependent on a claimant being the holder of a qualification certificate and to obtain a qualification certificate a person must satisfy certain conditions including an assessment of means.</P>
      <P>The person concerned claimed unemployment assistance from 17 October 1985 after he had drawn his maximum entitlement of 390 days unemployment benefit.  Following investigation his unemployment assistance claim was disallowed on the grounds that, by failing to furnish full particulars of his means, he failed to show that his means did not exceed the statutory limit.  If he is dissatisfied with the decision it is open to him to appeal and have his case determined by an appeals officer.  A form for this purpose may be obtained at his local employment office.</P>
      <P>The person concerned ceased to sign the unemployed register after 5 April 1985.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed unemployment assistance from 11 February 1985 to 14 May 1985 and again from 1 July 1985 to 3 September 1985.  He was paid unemployment assistance on those claims on the basis of a qualification certificate showing weekly means of £14, derived from the value of board and lodgings in his parents home.</P>
      <P>The value to him of board and lodgings in his parent's home was calculated by reference to the earnings of his father. The assessment was, however, subject to the limitation that the amount of means so assessed would not exceed 12½ per cent of his father's net income.  His father's net income at the time of the assessment was £120 a week.  From this was deducted £5 for rent leaving a balance of £115.  The amount of weekly means assessed against the claimant was 12½ per cent of £115 which is £14.37 rounded down to £14. The person concerned has not been in touch with his local office since 3 September 1985.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed injury benefit from 17 February 1986 in respect of an accident at work on 4 January 1985.  Under the rules that govern the injury benefit scheme, payment of injury benefit can only be made for periods of incapacity within 26 weeks from the date of the accident.  Her incapacity is outside this period, therefore she is not entitled to payment of injury benefit.</P>
      <P>If she suffers disablement by way of loss of any physical or mental facility as a result of the occupational accident, she may be entitled to disablement benefit. A claim form in this regard has been sent to her for completion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Payment of disability benefit was authorised from 20 February 1986, fourth <Col N="85" /> day of incapacity, at the weekly rate of £34.70, the maximum rate for a married woman.  Pay-related benefit was authorised from 10 March 1986, 19th day of incapacity, at the weekly rate of £33.28.</P>
    <P>It has now been established that the person concerned is also in receipt of deserted wives' benefit for herself and her two children at the weekly rate of £72.30.  Under the regulations governing payment of disability benefit, she is entitled only to £19.75 per week while in receipt of deserted wives' benefit.  The person concerned has therefore been overpaid £186.87 disability benefit.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed disability benefit from 20 February 1986. There was a delay in issuing payment in respect of his dependants until the claim form was received.  A claim for recoupment of supplementary welfare allowance advanced to him by the Eastern Health Board was then received.  This amount is being recovered by weekly deductions from his claim to disability benefit.</P>
      <P>The current weekly rate of benefit for the person concerned is £93.70 less deductions of £10.42.  Payment is issued on receipt of weekly medical certificates and all benefit payable to 20 May 1986, the date of the latest medical certificate received, has been issued to the person concerned.</P>

      <P>A claimant who has drawn the maximum entitlement of unemployment benefit cannot requalify for benefit until she has a further 13 weeks of employment which is insurable at a contribution class which provides cover against unemployment. Weeks of insurable employment after 156 days of benefit have been drawn are counted for this purpose.</P>
      <P>The person concerned, who is a married woman, had drawn her maximum entitlement of 312 days benefit on 7 January 1986.  According to the Department's records she had no insurable employment since drawing 156 days of benefit and, therefore, she did not requalify for payment of benefit from 8 January 1986.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In accordance with the equality provisions implemented with effect from 15 May 1986 under the Social Welfare Act, 1986, the maximum duration of unemployment benefit payable to married women was increased from 312 to 390 days.  Under transitional arrangements a claimant who had drawn 312 days benefit <Col N="88" /> in the three-month period from 14 February 1986 to 14 May 1986 and continued to prove unemployment is entitled to payment of benefit from 15 May 1986 to the date on which she would normally have completed 390 days on her claim. However, as the person concerned had drawn her 312 days entitlement prior to 14 February 1986 the transitional arrangements do not apply in her case. She is continuing to sign the unemployed register for credited contribution purposes.</P>

      <P>Entitlement to unemployment benefit is subject to the condition that a person must have had at least 26 contributions paid since date of entry into insurable employment.</P>
      <P>The person concerned claimed unemployment benefit from 25 February 1986 and according to the records of the Department at that time she had not the necessary 26 contributions paid.  Inquiries were made from her previous employers to establish if she had sufficient contributions paid to entitle her to payment of unemployment benefit.  These inquiries were only recently completed and it has been established that she had 44 contributions paid in respect of her previous employments.</P>
      <P>Her claim to unemployment benefit has been allowed, accordingly, at the weekly maximum appropriate rate payable in her case of £39.50.  All arrears due, less the amount of unemployment assistance paid to her pending the outcome of her claim to benefit, will be paid this week.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mrs. Hussey) Gemma Hussey">

      <P>The person concerned was in receipt of unemployment benefit up to 5 May 1986 when she had drawn her maximum entitlement of 312 days benefit.  The weekly rate payable in her case was £32.75 which is the special reduced rate payable after 156 days to a claimant who had not 280 contributions paid in respect of insurable employment in the seven years prior to the claim.</P>
      <P>In order to requalify for payment of benefit from 6 May 1986, she would be required to have a further 13 contributions paid in respect of insurable employment. Contributions paid after drawing 156 days benefit on a claim is counted for this purpose.  The person concerned had not the necessary contributions to requalify for payment of benefit.</P>
      <P>However, she does qualify for payment of benefit from 15 May 1986 in accordance with transitional arrangements made in conjunction with the implementation of the equality provisions from 15 May 1986 under the Social Welfare Act, 1986, which increased the maximum duration of unemployment benefit payable to married women from 312 to 390 days. Under the transitional arrangements, a claimant who had drawn 312 days benefit in the three month period from 14 February 1986 to 14 May 1986, and continued to prove unemployment, is entitled to payment of benefit from 15 May 1986 to the date on which she would normally have completed 390 days on her claim.</P>
      <P>Consequently, the person concerned, provided she continues to prove unemployment, qualifies for payment of unemployment benefit from 15 May to 4 August 1986 when she will have completed 390 days on her claim.  Payment due from 15 May 1986 was made to her last week.  Further weekly payments of £32.75 will continue to be made as they become due.</P>

      <P>Self-employment as a taxi driver would not automatically debar a person from qualifying for unemployment assistance. Any income accruing from such employment is, however, assessed as means for the purpose of a claim to unemployment assistance.  Self-employment as a taxi driver occurs when the applicant owns the taxi plate or is the leasee of a taxi-plate.  Fraudulent claiming of unemployment assistance would arise where the claimant did not inform the Department of his self-employment as a taxi driver or of his employment as a driver by a taxi owner.  Allegations were made some months ago to the Department's local office in Limerick and to the special investigation unit of possible fraudulent claiming of unemployment assistance by persons engaged as taxi drivers in the Limerick area.  However, following inquiries in the matter, there was no evidence to substantiate these reports and no specific information was made available to the Department as to the claimants involved.  If the Deputy has any such information he should forward it to the Department.</P>

      <P>While there is no specific scheme of allowances for unmarried fathers, persons in this situation who take on responsibility for their children can receive financial support by way of increased payments in respect of child dependants under other social welfare schemes such as unemployment benefit or assistance where the conditions of entitlement under the schemes are fulfilled.  For persons who do not qualify under any of these schemes, assistance can be provided under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme to any person who is in need.  Unmarried fathers who take on responsibility for their children may also qualify for payment under the child benefit scheme.</P>
      <P>The whole area of financial support for single parent families will be reviewed in the light of the recommendations of the Commission on Social Welfare.</P>

      <P>The man concerned claimed <Col N="93" /> disability benefit from 1 May 1986. Payment has been issued from 5 May 1986, the fourth day of incapacity, at the weekly rate of £39.50 the maximum personal rate payable, to 16 May 1986, the date of the latest medical certificate received.</P>
      <P>The social welfare legislation provides that increases of social welfare payments are payable only for adult dependants who must either be (i) a spouse who is living with or being wholly maintained by the claimant or (ii) a person having care of one or more of the claimants children. In this case, the man concerned is not entitled to an increase for his wife as she is not living with, or being wholly or mainly maintained, by him.  On the information presented to the Department in connection with the claim, neither was he entitled, on the criterion mentioned in the previous paragraph to an adult dependant increase for the woman he is living with.</P>
      <P>Information which has separately come into the possession of the Department suggests that the women concerned may now have care of one of the children of her partner's previous marriage.  His entitlement to an adult dependant increase for her is accordingly being reinvestigated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The woman concerned claimed unemployment assistance from 9 October 1985 and following investigation her claim was disallowed on the grounds that her means, derived from the benefit of the earnings of the person with whom she is co-habiting, exceeded the statutory limit. She appealed against the disallowance and an appeals officer on 6 February 1986 assessed her with means of £37.65 which again exceeded the maximum rate of unemployment assistance payable.  She again claimed unemployment assistance on 19 February 1986 and following reinvestigation her means were assessed at £41.90 weekly derived from the benefit of the earnings of the person with whom she is co-habiting and once again her claim was disallowed on the ground that her means exceeded the maximum rate payable in her case.  The person also <Col N="94" /> claimed disability benefit from 20 February 1986 to 22 April 1986.  Payment was not authorised as one of the conditions for payment of that benefit is that at least 26 contributions be paid at the appropriate rate since entry into insurable employment and she did not satisfy this contribution condition.  If her means are insufficient to meet her needs while here partner is in receipt of disability benefit, it is open to her to claim supplementary welfare allowance from the health board by contacting the local community welfare officer.</P>
    <P>The assessment of means for unemployment assistance is a statutory requirement to be found in section 146 (i) (e) of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1981, which provides that means for unemployment assistance purposes must take account of the yearly value of any benefit or privilege enjoyed by the claimant. This legislation covers many situations including where a person derives benefit from the earnings or income of a spouse or partner or head of household in which the claimant lives.  The criteria used to determine the value of any benefit or privilege are designed to ensure that each case is decided fairly having regard to the standard of living of the household. In this context it is important to recognise that the unemployment assistance scheme is designed to cater only for people who are in financial need.  The amount payable in any case is directly related to the applicant's financial circumstances.</P>

The person concerned claimed unemployment <Col N="104" /> benefit during the period 12 November 1985 to 21 January 1986 and her claim was disallowed on the grounds that she was not available for employment.</P>
      <P>She appealed against the disallowance and at an appeal hearing on 10 April 1986 the person concerned attended and was given an opportunity to present her case. The appeals officer also decided she was not available for employment and she was notified of this decision on 15 April 1986.  She ceased to sign the unemployed register after 21 January 1986 when she claimed maternity allowance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Deasy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 150 and 151 together.  The most recent review of the boundaries of the disadvantaged areas, carried out by professional officers of my Department, was the most extensive and comprehensive examination carried out in this country.  It involved surveying 10,000 townlands in some 600 district electoral divisions, covering approximately four million acres of land, and took into account the appropriate data available from all sources in respect of each of the areas surveyed.  Detailed consideration was given to all aspects relevant to the reclassification of land from the mountain sheep grazing category to the more severely handicapped category, both in County Wicklow and elsewhere in the country.</P>
      <P>The criteria used in the survey for designating areas as disadvantaged are laid down in Council Directive 85/350/EEC concerning the Community list of less favoured farming areas within the meaning of Council Directive 75/268/EEC (Ireland) as follows:</P>
      <P>(a) the presence of infertile land, as referred to in Article 3(4)(a) of Directive 75/268/EEC, is defined as percentage of ploughed area less than 7.8 per cent and a stocking rate of less than one adult bovine livestock unit per forage hectare:</P>
      <P>(b) the concept of economic results of farming appreciably below average, as referred to in Article 3(4)(b) of Directive 75/268/EEC, is defined in terms of family farm income per male farm worker not exceeding 80 per cent of the national average;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(c) low population density, as <Col N="113" /> referred to in Article 3(4)(c) of Directive 75/268/EEC, is defined as not more than 27 inhabitants per square kilometre (national and Community averages being 49 and 163 inhabitants per square kilometre respectively), with a minimum percentage of the total working population engaged in agriculture of 30 per cent.</P>
    <P>All the criteria must be proved simultaneously before an area can be classified as disadvantaged.</P>

      <P>The matter of rationalising food research activities has been the subject of discussions between the managements of AFT and the IIRS and a preliminary outline of arrangements designed to achieve it has been drawn up by them.  These preliminary proposals will require further consideration by both organisations and by the Department concerned.  The question of the location of a new food research centre does not, therefore, arise at this stage.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Registrar of Titles that the application, the details of which were supplied by the Deputy, is one of a block of 40 applications for first registration which was lodged in the Land Registry on 5 July 1984 and are at present under consideration.  Applications for first registration are complex from a legal point of view and in individual cases usually take over two years to complete at present.  The position of this application is particularly complicated.  It is part of a <Col N="115" /> large block of applications and, in addition, as I have already informed the Deputy by letter, it is not possible for the Registry to identify the property to which the question refers without more specific information.  In the circumstances I am not in a position to indicate when and if the application will be finalised.</P>
      <P>There has been no undue delay in dealing with the case and indeed it is being treated with all possible urgency in so far as the Land Registry is concerned.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Registrar of Titles that this is an application for first registration which was lodged in the Land Registry on 18 December 1985.  There is a long delay in dealing with such applications in the Registry partly because of the usually complex legal issues involved and partly because of pressure of work generally. The application is at present under consideration but it is not possible to say at this stage if or when registration will be effected.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will, of course, appreciate that it would not be possible to give favourable treatment to any particular application except at the expense of other applications.  I am informed, however, that the Land Registry gives priority to applications in respect of which it is brought to its attention that there are special grounds for urgency, such as bridging finance for example.  That, in fact, is the position in regard to this application.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that at present there is a total of 147 neighbourhood watch schemes in operation in the Dublin metropolitan area, involving some 46,000 households.  The areas where the schemes are operating are listed as follows.  I understand that there is considerable enthusiasm for the schemes among the community and that a substantial increase in the number of households involved in schemes is expected in the coming months.</P>
      <P>The schemes are being evaluated in order to establish as far as possible their effects on the crime rate and on relations between the community and the Garda Síochána.  The preliminary indications are that the schemes are playing a valuable role in these areas.</P>

      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 168 and 169 together.  There are three primary schools at Marlborough Street, Dublin 1, on sites which adjoin my Department's offices at the same address. The school buildings, being on State property, are maintained by the Office of Public Works.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The all-Irish school is housed in a permanent building which was recently the subject of substantial improvement works which included the provision of additional facilities.  The site of this school, including its hard-surfaced play area, is well defined and enclosed for most of its perimeter by railings.  My Department is at present considering, in consultation with the Office of Public <Col N="137" /> Works, a proposal to develop additional play-space for the schools in the Marlborough Street complex on space which has become available consequent on the demolition of derelict buildings.  The development would not necessarily be for the exclusive use of the all-Irish school.</P>
    <P>With regard to the other two schools on the Marlborough Street complex, namely the Boys' Central Model School and the Infants'/Girls' Central Model School, and the matter of their security, my Department has had under consideration, again in consultation with the Office of Public Works, the provision of additional perimeter security works.  The works in question are intended to benefit the entire Marlborough Street complex. This complex already has a twenty-four hours per day security presence and is regularly patrolled, and accordingly it is not proposed to provide a caretaker specifically for the schools.</P>
    <P>The Boys' School and the Infants'/ Girls' School are at present accommodated in prefabricated classrooms and my Department is considering a feasibility study for the replacement of this prefab accommodation by a permanent building. A number of options is being examined and costed, including that of restoring the school's former permanent building which was extensively damaged by fire some years ago.  No definitive plan has as yet been decided upon, but my Department hopes at an early date to complete its study and to decide on a positive course of action.</P>

      <P>In secondary schools in which the number of recognised pupils is not less than 500 a guidance teacher may be appointed to a post outside the quota on certain conditions. In the case of a secondary school of less than 500 recognised pupils credit for incremental salary purposes is allowed for guidance work in the time table where a qualified guidance teacher is employed within the quota.  Provision for guidance services in vocational, community and comprehensive schools is made in the teaching allocations issued annually by my Department to the managerial authorities of these schools.</P>
      <P>A syllabus committee on guidance, established in 1984, have been engaged in reviewing the current guidance programmes and activities in post-primary schools and in drawing up guidelines for schools and teachers.  As provided for in the national plan additional remedial and guidance teachers were allocated in 1985-86 to schools catering for disadvantaged pupils and it is proposed to make a further such allocation in 1986-87.</P>
      <P>There are 814 post-primary schools at present.  There are currently 577 guidance teachers in the post-primary sector; 137 of those are serving in the vocational sector.</P>

      <P>An application for a new building for the school identified by the Deputy was recently received in my Department.  The application is being considered in the context of the commitment to seek a more <Col N="141" /> effective and cost-efficient use of available resources as set out in paragraph 5.12 of the <i>Programme for Action in Education 1984-1987</i> which states:</P>
      <P>Each building project in course of planning, and all future proposed projects, will be examined in the context of Post-Primary School resources generally in the catchment area to determine the practicability of integration or, alternatively, co-ordination of facilities.</P>
