    <Title>Supplementary Estimates, 1986. - Vote 30: Environment.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Boland) Minister for the Environment (Mr. Boland)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a Supplementary sum not exceeding £13,777,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1986, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for the Environment, including grants in lieu of rates on agricultural land and other grants to Local Authorities, grants and other expenses in connection with housing, and miscellaneous schemes, subsidies and grants including certain grants-in-aid.</P>
      <P>This supplementary estimate is necessitated by: (i) a greater demand for the £5,000 grant for local authority tenants than had been anticipated; (ii) Government decisions during the year relating to the Housing Finance Agency and flood relief measures; (iii) adjustment of the grant in lieu of rates on agricultural land consequent on the results of land assessments carried out up to the end September 1986; (iv) the enactment of the Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission Act, 1986, and (v) costs in connection with the oil pollution threats to the south west coast.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Supplementary Estimate involves a redeployment of the Environment Public Capital Programme allocation to the extent of £12,662,000 and a nett increase in current expenditure of <Col N="1659" /> £1,115,000.  I want to make it clear to the House, therefore, that this Estimate represents a nett increase in public expenditure of only £1,115,000.</P>
    <P>In my reply to the debate on Second Stage of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, 1985, on 4 November last I dealt in some detail with the transformation of the housing situation that has been brought about as a result of the effectiveness of the Government's housing policies.  Not only have these policies radically increased the numbers of persons housed by local authorities but also they are now significantly reducing the cost of the programme to the taxpayer.  In 1982 some 7,900 applicants were housed from the local authority housing list which at the time stood at just 30,000 applicants.  Last year 11,800 applicants were housed, an increase of 50 per cent on the 1982 figures.  This year it is likely that a similarly high figure of the order of some 11,000 applicants will be housed by local authorities.  The waiting lists which stood at 30,000 when the Government took office have been reduced to 22,000 or, I suspect when the official figures are published at the end of the year, somewhat fewer.  In addition, a large proportion of those on the waiting lists have been offered and have declined accommodation as they wish to obtain accommodation in a particular location.  This radical improvement can be attributed in the main to two policy measures, the £5,000 grants for tenants surrendering their houses and providing for themselves in the private sector and the availability through the Housing Finance Agency and local authorities of suitable loans which have enabled thousands of families of modest means to provide their own houses rather than rely on public housing.</P>
    <P>The significantly reduced pressure on local authority housing has enabled us to redeploy some resources from the local authority house building programme and into these two schemes.  The objective of the local authority housing programme is to provide accommodation for persons unable to obtain suitable accommodation from their own resources.  This objective <Col N="1660" /> can be achieved either by the provision of a new local authority dwelling or by the release for reletting on an existing one.  The £5,000 &ldquo;surrender grant&rdquo; scheme is about six times as effective in housing applicants as direct investment in the building of new local authority housing.  Of course, the scope of the £5,000 grant is essentially limited and a need will remain for a direct local housing building programme.  However, by balancing a surrender grants scheme with a substantial house building programme the Government have shown clearly that record levels of applicants can be provided with housing and waiting lists significantly reduced or virtually eliminated in certain areas.</P>
    <P>This year the demand for this grant has continued to exceed expectations.  Since the inception of the scheme two years ago nearly 8,500 applications have been received and about 6,000 houses have become available to local authorities for reletting.  As part of the redeployment of resources referred to, the Supplementary Estimate makes provision for an additional £5 million to meet grants maturing for payment in the current year. This year total grant payments will number 3,350.</P>
    <P>Another element of the redeployment is the provision of a grant of £6,912 million to the Housing Finance Agency under a new subhead D.7.  Arising out of the Government's review of the operations of the HFA earlier this year and the subsequent restructuring of their financial arrangements it was decided that a special capital injection should be made to the agency.</P>
    <P>The restructuring of the agency's financial arrangements arose principally from the need of the agency, due to changed conditions in the financial market place, to rely on costly short term borrowing to fund its operations.  The changes made in the agency's scheme were also designed to deal with a bad debts problem.  The payment of the grant will place the agency on a firm financial footing and allow them to continue in their present role of providing funds to <Col N="1661" /> housing authorities to make house purchase loans available to persons of modest means.  As part of the restructuring, the agency's borrowing arrangements have been broadened to allow them to raise long term funds on a conventional basis and an interest swap arrangement will apply to assist the agency in matching the cost of such funds with the return they can obtain from income-related repayments by borrowers.</P>
    <P>Since they were established in 1981 the Housing Finance Agency have advanced over 15,300 loans valued at over £300 million.  They now play a critically important role in the provision of mortgage finance for people on modest incomes. Three repayment options are now offered &mdash; a convention annuity system, an income related repayment option similar to the HFA scheme and a new convertible repayment option offering income-related repayments for the first five years and then reverting to an annuity system for the balance of the life of the loan.  These changes followed close on the £5,000 increase in the maximum loan limits which I announced under the SDA loan scheme from 5 June 1986 and the increase to £10,000 in the income limit under the scheme.  There is now a range of publicly funded house purchase loan schemes offering loans of up to £25,000 or £27,000 and a range of repayment options.</P>
    <P>Yesterday, I informed housing authorities of a 1 per cent increase in the interest rate on annuity and convertible loans for house purchase and improvement. While I regret that some adjustment in the rate was unavoidable having regard to current trends in interest rates, generally, I am happy that the Government have been able to keep the increase down to 1 per cent.  This will leave the interest rate on SDA type loans at 10.75 per cent which includes a change of 0.25 per cent in respect of mortgage protection insurance.  I have no doubt the House will contrast this rate with building society rates which are now running at 12.5 per cent.  As the interest rate on all SDA type loans is fixed for the life of the <Col N="1662" /> loan, yesterday's increase will not affect existing loans.</P>
    <P>As the House is aware the severe damage caused by last August's storms met with an immediate and effective Government response.  Among the measures taken was the allocation of an additional £1 million to the task force on special housing aid for the elderly to rehabilitate houses affected by the flooding. At about the same time the remit of the task force was extended to enable them to help where the houses of needy and disabled persons were in need of essential repair.  This £1 million is provided for by way of an increase in the grant-in-aid under subhead D.5.</P>
    <P>The various local authorities in the areas affected by the flooding were given the immediate go ahead by the task force to carry out on a recoupment basis necessary structural repairs and basic decoration. Dublin Corporation and Wicklow County Council were the two local authorities most affected but others such as Dublin, Cork, Kerry, Meath and Kilkenny County Councils are also involved, even though to a much lesser extent.</P>
    <P>Another of the measures taken to alleviate flood damage was the announcement of a grant of £100,000 to Tipperary North Riding and Limerick County Councils for emergency repair works to the Mulcaire river.  I understand that the two county councils are proceeding with the necessary scheme of repair works under the Local Authorities (Works) Act, 1949.  It involves remedial works on breached and weakened embankments as well as removing trees, brushwood and shoal formations at various locations along the Mulcaire and its tributaries. The £1,000 is included in subhead W, item 19.</P>
    <P>The level of the 1986 grant in lieu of rates on land was determined on the basis that local authority revenue from the farm tax during the year would amount to some £6 million.</P>
    <P>Following the publication of classification lists of assessed holdings in each local authority area, authorities have now virtually completed the process of levying <Col N="1663" /> this tax in respect of 1986.  However, having regard to the results of farm assessments to date and after due allowance for marginal relief and other factors, it is estimated that the total farm tax liability this year will be approximately £5 million.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, the Supplementary Estimate includes an increase of £1 million in the agricultural rate grant in respect of this shortfall.  The revised provision in subhead N will be £120.5 million.</P>
    <P>The Supplementary Estimate includes a sum of £100,000 to meet costs falling on my Department in respect of environmental protection measures mounted to deal with oil pollution from the <i>Kowloon Bridge</i> and the risk of pollution from the damaged tanker <i>Capo Emma</i>.  My Department's Vote normally includes a contingency sum for emergencies of this type, while there are established procedures for the immediate release of any additional funds that may be required in an emergency.  My responsibility in relation to incidents such as the <i>Kowloon Bridge</i> and the <i>Capo Emma</i> is to deal with pollution arising and to protect, as far as possible, important marine life and amenity areas and to arrange for clean up of contaminated areas.</P>
    <P>Arrangements to deal with oil pollution incidents were last reviewed by the Government in 1984.  It was then decided to augment contingency measures, which essentially relied on local and regional responses to pollution, by establishing the operations group which would exercise overall central direction and control of operations to deal with major spillages threatening or affecting the shores.  The group is under the direction of a senior inspector from my Department, and includes representatives from the Departments of Communications, Tourism, Fisheries and Forestry, Defence, the Naval Service and local and harbour authorities.</P>
    <P>The <i>Kowloon Bridge</i> and <i>Capo Emma</i> incidents presented the first occasion on which it was necessary to call in the group.  Members of the group were placed on standby on 18 November when <Col N="1664" /> first reports were received that the <i>Kowloon Bridge</i> and <i>Capo Emma</i> were in difficulties.  The group was directed to intervene on 23 November in view of the increased pollution threat posed by the <i>Kowloon Bridge</i> following its abandonment. By 7.30 a.m. on 24 November, control centres were set up in Skibbereen and Bantry, the latter to deal with any pollution risk posed by the <i>Capo Emma.</i> Priority areas in this vicinity of the Stags Rock, including Lough Hyne, were identified and special arrangements made to protect some of these, using booms.  It was necessary to concentrate on protection and shore clean-up measures as the fuel oil on the vessel does not respond to dispersants.</P>
    <P>In accordance with a direction issued by the Minister for Communications the owners of the <i>Capo Emma</i> are proceeding with arrangements for the removal of oil from the vessel.  I understand that this operation is due to begin today if local weather conditions are favourable.</P>
    <P>Protective measures, involving the use of booms and the provision of vessels for spraying dispersants, were taken at Bantry Bay in anticipation of the transfer of the crude oil cargo to another tanker. The first phase of this operation involving the offloading of 36,000 tonnes of oil was completed successfully.  The operation will be completed as soon as weather permits.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that arrangements to deal with pollution, in so far as they came within the remit of my Department, have been found generally adequate.  The need to respond to two incidents simultaneously presented special challenges. I want to place on the record of the House my appreciation of the commitment shown by the staff of my Department, the local authority and indeed the whole operations group in dealing with these two major problems to date.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that the operations group and all concerned have learned by these experiences.  My Department will be reviewing their contingency arrangements to deal with oil spillages and will put to good effect the experience gained <Col N="1665" /> so as to improve arrangements in whatever respects may be necessary.</P>
    <P>I expect that the additional provisions sought will be sufficient to meet payments arising in the current year.  I will seek additional funds next year should this prove necessary.  I will be seeking full compensation for any costs to public funds arising from these incidents.</P>
    <P>The provision of £20,000 in subhead Y is to enable the Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission to be established.  I intend to make an establishment order presently, to appoint the members of the commission and to bring it into operation before the end of the year.  The commission will have special powers during its three year life to improve the area designated as the metropolitan central area.  This area comprises O'Connell Street, Westmoreland Street, D'Olier Street, College Green and Grafton Street together with short lengths of the side streets off those streets and was chosen because of its special importance not only for Dubliners but for visitors to our country. A concentrated effort to improve environmental conditions and raise the standards of civic amenity in the very heart of the city will bring many benefits to the business community and the ordinary citizens of Dublin and will make our capital city a place to be proud of once more.  This special investment of time, expertise and money will, with the cooperation of all who have Dublin's best interests at heart, bring new life to Dublin's centre.</P>
    <P>I commend the Supplementary Estimate to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The figure of £13,777,000 is an extraordinary overrun and, taken in conjunction with other Estimates, means that there will be a total of nearly £100 million overrun on the Estimates published by the Government for 1986.  This is proof that the public finances are totally out of control.  At the end of this year we will have the largest current budget deficit in our history in money and percentage terms and this from a Government who were elected because of their commitment to and <Col N="1666" /> promise of financial rectitude, especially in tackling the current budget deficit. They lectured the people on what they would do in relation to public finances, not just at the time of the 1982 general election but again on the publication of that dismal grey book <i>Building on Reality</i> when they promised to reduce the current budget deficit to 5 per cent.</P>
      <P>It is interesting to note that commentators have got into the habit recently of saying that the Government's finances are off target to the sum of £180 million. We should remember that the sum of £180 million comes on top of what they estimated, making the total current budget deficit for the year nearly £1,500 million or 8.8 per cent, the largest in the history of the State.  The Estimate before us ignores the fact that the Government have been accepting and approving grant applications for reconstruction at the rate of about 1,200 per week.  In reply to a question last Wednesday, the Minister said that at present there were 124,000 applications on hand&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not interrupt the Minister.  As a result of the grants approved to date a figure of £248 million would be needed but the Government have approved a sum of £24 million for 1986.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The role of housing and the construction industry has been down graded by the Government.  The popular perception of previous Coalition Governments is that they never favoured the construction industry and, on the performance to date of this Government, they seem intent on reinforcing this view and setting new records for the dubious reputation of not favouring the construction industry.  Since they took office in 1982, there has been an unparalleled decline in building activity and a concomitant decline in the numbers employed in the industry.  Over that period, approximately 50,000 people engaged in the building trade have lost <Col N="1667" /> their jobs, making it by far the worst hit of our various economic sectors.</P>
    <P>A recent survey carried out by the Department of the Environment concedes that 7,000 building workers lost their jobs in 1985 compared with the overall rise of 2,000 in unemployment. This suggests that there has been a considerable decline in the building construction labour force as workers previously engaged in the industry have sought employment opportunities in other sectors or, regrettably, gone abroad.  The decline is not limited to building workers, long established construction companies and professional firms have been faced with the prospect of closure, liquidation or seeking work outside the country.  The effect of this appalling decline in building activity has been to utterly decimate a workforce which had, in the previous 25 years, developed considerable skills in a whole range of advanced and modern construction techniques.  For example, the abilities which the industry so impressively demonstrated to foreign industrialists in the various major industrial projects of the seventies have been permanently lost.  These skills, managerial, professional and trade related, from the project manager to the bricklayer, will take another generation to build up again.</P>
    <P>Even if we assume that the Coalition's record in respect of the construction industry is not based on pure malice &mdash; and there are many who dispute this view &mdash; the most dispassionate observer must accept that during the Government's term they have demonstrated an incredible ineptitude in their handling of the construction industry.</P>

      <P>Under subhead D.4. of the Supplementary Estimate an extra £5 million is required for housing purposes. What can be questioned is the value of the grant and the policy of grants as distinct from taxation. What is the logic on the one hand, for example, of increasing VAT, which was done in 1985 and which was a typical example of the Government's lack of vision, and giving grants on the other?  The damage that VAT increase inflicted on the house building sector was particularly evident to us on this side of the House and to most experienced observers.  Nevertheless, the Government persisted with their policy in spite of the hardship they inflicted. However, I can assure the House that on re-election to Government, which will be shortly, Fianna Fáil will give the necessary injection of confidence and resources to the construction industry to get it off its knees.  There was a politician in this House during the time of the Coalition Government of the late fifties who became famous for one comment that was referred to regularly, that was, that when that Government left office there was not a bob for a bag of cement.  Unfortunately, the same situation exists today.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The position with regard to the £5,000 grant is directly related to the fact that tenants want to leave their homes, first, because for a three year period there was no house purchase scheme available to them because the Government would not introduce such a scheme.  The purchase scheme was directly connected with the differential rents scheme.  The attractiveness of local authority housing has now to be called into question in relation to the differential rents scheme.</P>
      <P>A further regrettable example of the dishonesty of the Government was the decision they took last August to renege on the commitment of successive Governments since 1973 with regard to the operation of the differential rents scheme.  They reneged on a commitment given in 1973 to the National Association of Tenants Organisations that that association would have negotiating rights in the assessment of differential rents.  The Government, because they were incapable of taking a decision, handed back to the county managers, the assessment of differential rents and consequent increases in differential rents.  This dishonesty with regard to local authority rents was dressed up in the title of &ldquo;devolution of powers to local authorities&rdquo;.  It is no such thing and the only reason for it is that the Minister does not like to make unpopular decisions.  The Minister has handed the power to city and county managers so that they could act as his hatchet men and on his behalf to increase the rents on local authority tenants and because he was incapable and afraid to negotiate a fair rent review with NATO despite there having been a commitment since 1973 to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1972, there was a regrettable rent strike.  In 1973, the Coalition of which, a Cheann Comhairle, you were a member, <Col N="1670" /> took the enlightened view and gave negotating rights to the National Association of Tenants Organisations so that a fair and equitable national rent would be charged for local authority houses and that the situation would not arise where a family on one side of a county border were paying one rent while on the other side a similar family for the same type of accommodation were paying £10 more a week.  Therefore, a national scheme was devised which worked very efficiently through successive Governments, Coalition and Fianna Fáil.  Successive Ministers for the Environment operated that scheme.  The present Minister for the Environment when he was spokesman on the environment for the Fine Gael Party prior to the general election of June 1981 gave a commitment to the National Association of Tenants Organisations on behalf of himself and on behalf of his party that in Government Fine Gael would continue to operate the national rent review with the National Association of Tenants Organisations having negotiating rights.  That system continued to operate right up until August of this year when the Minister and the Government who did not have the courage to negotiate a fair rent review with NATO ran away from the question and handed it over to the county managers.  We now have chaos because local authorities around the country are charging different rents.  This is exactly the recipe which brought us trouble up to 1972.</P>
    <P>I want to make a commitment in this House today that on re-election to Government Fianna Fáil will return to a nationally negotiated rent structure because that is the fair, reasonable and rational way to advance.</P>

      <P>The Government have made a song and dance about the injection of confidence which the reconstruction grants have brought to the construction industry.  It has done no such thing.  In the Estimates for the public services, 1986 the Government include a figure of £24 million for grants for <Col N="1671" /> improvements to houses.  I welcome the fact that applications have come in to the Department in large numbers.  Since the commencement of the scheme, 124,000 applications have been received.  If a Government are going to initiate a scheme of that order it is incumbent on them to provide sufficient funds to operate it.  On their own figures, the average grant for the number of applications approved to date &mdash; more than 90,000 &mdash; is £2,000.  It is fair to assume that the balance of the applications will stand at the same figure.  At Question Time the Minister questioned my arithmetic ability.  If I multiply 124 by 2 I get 248. The Minister may get a different figure. There are 124,000 applications.  Using their own figures the average value of each grant is £2,000.  Therefore, £248 million is what is needed but there is only £24 million allocated in the Estimate.  I want the Minister to assure the House and the people who have applied for grants that he will provide at least £200 million in the 1987 Estimates to meet those grants.  Anyone who submitted a grant application prior to mid-November would expect to receive a cheque before Christmas 1987.  The Department estimate that the time scale involved is somewhere between six and nine months, that is, from receipt of the application to the final inspection.  We have used the outside figure of nine months which means that all these applications will be due for payment in 1987.</P>

      <P>In relation to the Housing Finance Agency, £6.9 million is provided in the Estimate.  Prior to Christmas 1981 a debate was guillotined by the Government.  It was on a Bill to introduce the Housing Finance Agency.  We were assured at that time that it would be a cure-all for financing local authority housing and why Fianna Fáil had not thought of it and why it had not been introduced before, the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and others could not understand. The Tánaiste was very involved in it and Deputy Barry was Minister at the time.  That particular charade is costing the taxpayer £6.9 million.</P>
      <P>The Minister makes great play about the financing of local authorities.  In the Estimate there is provision for a £1 million grant to local authorities in lieu of rates on agricultural land.  Again and again the Minister told us that local authorities have done incredibly well under this administration but since 1981 there has been a real shortfall in local authority finances of about £110 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has included a sum of £100,000 for oil pollution control and pollution control generally.  He informed us of the success the co-ordination committee had in the operations of the <i>Kowloon Bridge</i> and the <i>Capo Emma</i>.  I hope the operation in Bantry will be successful and that the transfer of the remaining oil from the <i>Capo Emma</i> to the other Italian tanker will be concluded today.  I understand that 40,000 tonnes of oil remain and it is my fervent wish that we shall see the back of the <i>Capo Emma</i> out of Bantry Bay as fast as her power can take her and <Col N="1674" /> as soon as that transfer of oil is completed. We have had enough pollution of our beaches and do not need that hulk down there.</P>
    <P>The Minister was very complimentary on the co-ordination exercise carried out in regard to the <i>Kowloon Bridge</i>.  I understand from colleagues in the area that there was a delay of a couple of days in trying to negotiate exactly who was in charge and who was doing what.  The point came up at Question Time recently as to which Department were responsible &mdash; Communications, Environment, Fisheries or which.  Be that as it may, I fervently hope that the fuel oil will be taken from the now sunken ship.  According to radio reports this morning, the salvage team have equipment to take oil out of ships from under the sea.  I hope that this will happen as soon as possible.  It is something that all Governments would desire in order to protect our beaches, our marine life, our seabirds and our tourist amenities generally from the threat of pollution.  I trust that the operaction will be successful and I would ask the Minister to keep a very special eye, on behalf of the people, on the operation of the co-ordination group, to make sure that no money is spared and that eventually the <i>Kowloon Bridge</i> owners will pay for the operation of having the oil taken away safely.  It is essential that our people, our marine and bird life and our beaches are protected from all such disasters.</P>
    <P>When one mentions pollution, in the Irish context it is difficult not to mention the threat to our seas and the Irish Sea in particular which is now described as the most nuclear radioactive sea in the world because we have Sellafield so near our shores and this network of aging nuclear plants along the west coast of Britain.  I am glad that the Government eventually joined in the Fianna Fáil call, which they rejected twice earlier this year, for the British Government to close Sellafield.  This menace, which is not just a civilian but a military menace being used for military purposes in the production of fuels&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has included in this Estimate a figure for the Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission.  He makes the point that this commission will have special powers and will do special things in relation to the centre of our capital.  The way forward in relation to the Dublin region should be an integrated programme for the development of Dublin, rather than a series of commissions of the type he has proposed.  The Dublin region has one third of the population.  There are at the moment Dún Laoghaire Borough Council, Dublin County Council and Dublin Corporation.  We have, as joint authorities, applied to the Department of Finance to be allowed to make application to the EC for a 75 per cent funding grant which is available for the carrying out of a study to develop an integrated programme for Dublin.  Whatever funds are available, whether national, local authority or EC, the idea is that they would be spent in a planned way to fit <Col N="1676" /> into an integrated programme so that one would not be throwing money at a particular problem and a particular part of the city and county.  So far, the Departments of Finance and the Environment have not let us make the application to the EC for this integrated programme. The Minister, instead, has put forward this commission.  The way forward is an integrated programme and I would ask the Minister and his Government to allow direct application to the EC for these funds.  This project would cost around £300,000 and up to 75 per cent of that would be paid by EC funding.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L.T. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to contribute on this Supplementary Estimate. I agree with the previous speaker in relation to the hope that the work at present going on off the south coast in connection with the <i>Kowloon Bridge</i> and the <i>Capo Emma</i> will be a success.  Unfortunately, certain damage has been done to our coastline and I hope that the money provided here will go some way towards undoing that damage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have coastlines with vast potential which are a tremendous tourist attraction. It would be very unfortunate if, as a result of a combination of errors and a possible cavalier attitude on the part of tanker owners, damage would be done. It reinforces the need for regulations and a tightening up on information in relation to these tankers drifting into various harbours &mdash; particularly where it appears that all is not well &mdash; and then drifting out again.  It must be made clear at international level that if these foreign tankers are to come into our ports certain regulations must be stringently ahdered to.  I hope, as a result of what has happened down there, that there will be a review of the operation of these tankers.  The damage which can be caused by any spillage or accident is detrimental and costly to the marine life in these areas.  I hope when matters have been resolved and the operations, as is hoped, are a success, that there will be a claim for compensation against those who have been responsible.  It is not acceptable that <Col N="1677" /> tanker owners can suddenly drift into foreign ports and cause such trouble.</P>
    <P>I wish to deal with other matters raised in the Supplementary Estimate, particularly the success of the £5,000 grant scheme.  Many houses have become available because people are availing of this scheme.  This means that people who were living in overcrowded conditions or who are paying exorbitant rents can be housed by the local authority much more quickly than heretofore.  It is heartening to note the very big reductions in the local authority housing lists.  The housing lists of Dublin Corporation, Dublin County Council and Dún Laoghaire Corporation were lengthy a few years ago, but the numbers have been reduced substantially. This has been one of the results of the introduction of this scheme.  While it is important to continue building local authority houses, it is only possible to build houses at a certain rate and at a certain cost, and it is important that people living in overcrowded conditions and paying exorbitant rents for flats or houses, some of them very damp, should be housed much more quickly by the local authority.</P>
    <P>This scheme has also helped people who up to now found it very difficult to get the deposit to buy a house.  We all know of the very high costs involved in buying a house, particularly getting the deposit, the legal costs and buying furniture. All these costs have tended to lead people to believe they would not be able to purchase their own houses.  This £5,000 grant, plus the other grants for first time buyers, have enabled people to take this first step and to purchase their own houses.  This underlines the need for us to look again at the system of house purchase.  I believe there are many people who, if given half a chance, want to own their own homes and are willing to make the effort to make the repayments but they need a little extra help, an extra incentive, to get over this first big hurdle. There are many people who have purchased their houses and who are making their repayments because they were given this help.  We should take another look at the early years of repayment of <Col N="1678" /> a mortgage to see if the time could be extended or if the repayments could be reduced because most people who come to me tell me how hard they are finding it to get the deposit, to pay the various costs involved and to buy furniture.  If further incentives could be provided, I am sure many of the people on the borderline would buy their houses rather than put their names on the local authority housing list.</P>
    <P>The previous Deputy spoke about local authority rents.  Local authority rents are subject to waiver schemes and an examination of each case by the local authorities. I was surprised the Deputy did not go so far as to say that Fianna Fáil would abolish local authority rents altogether, given the commitments and promises they have been making in recent months.</P>
    <P>I want to deal now with the money allocated to meet flood damage caused last August.  I am glad the Minister found it possible to assist the people in the worst hit areas.  The freak storm caused extensive damage.  This underlines the need for reviewing our emergency procedures and I hope this money will go some way towards compensating people who suffered loss at that time.  That freak storm unfortunately claimed a few lives.  It is good to see extra money has been made available to assist those people whose buildings suffered structural damage.</P>
    <P>I want to discuss now the money provided for the Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission.  While it is regrettable that this money did not come to hand before now, it is good that the money is now being made available and I hope that commission will be in operation in the new year.  I also hope they will issue a report after six, eight, or ten months, or even one year in operation so that we can see what improvements have been made. The area from Grafton Street to Parnell Square has to be developed in conjunction with the local authority to make it more attractive and to woo businesses back into the city centre.  There has been a tendency to develop the suburban areas but it is very important that we rekindle the long tradition of making our city <Col N="1679" /> centre more attractive and attracting more visitors.  Other capital cities have areas of note which attract tourists, and such an area should be developed in Dublin.  The money allocated under this Supplementary Estimate is a testimony that this Government are concerned about all these areas.</P>

      <P>I am dealing with Supplementary Estimates.  We are told that the Government still have a commitment to this document, presented by the Minister for Finance.  I want to refer to the part on Supplementary Estimates. The Minister for Finance indicated that the Supplementary Estimates would have to be restricted to enable Government finances to be properly managed and regulated.  This is what he had to say to ensure that we would not go through this facade we are going through this morning. He said that a possibility would be that where expenditure in the course of a year exceeds the projected revenue by more than the margin agreed at budget <Col N="1680" /> time by the Dáil &mdash; which is certainly the case here &mdash; the Government, unless otherwise authorised by the Dáil, would be obliged to adjust their spending programme downwards or their revenue upwards in order to restore the projected balance.  Far from adjusting their spending programme downwards or their revenue upwards, the Government are ensuring in these Supplementary Estimates that the actual overspill on Government spending&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>When the Government introduce Supplementary Estimates of this order at this time of the year I am concerned for the role of this House, <Col N="1681" /> for parliamentary procedures and particularly for reasonable management of the public finances which is being thrown out the door.  In relation to this Supplementary Estimate, I will illustrate how this concept is being totally and utterly repudiated. This Estimate provides for a sum just short of £14 million.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnJRyan" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle John J. Ryan">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly, under five headings.  It deals with housing grants, rates in lieu of agricultural land and so on.  In relation to housing grants, what is particularly significant is that there is no reference in this Estimate or in the Government's projections for expenditure this year to the huge cost of house construction grants which they are going to toss into next year's budget.  Because it has not been provided for this year, a figure of not less than £240 million will have to be provided next year to cover commitments made by the Minister and the Government in respect of house improvement grants.  It is one thing to totally and utterly fail to meet the targets this year in the Department of the Environment, but to irresponsibily pass on a figure of that amount to next year's budget and next year's Government, guarantees that everything we all recognise as being of a very serious consequence will be even more seriously aggravated next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As one who will likely have a very serious responsibility in this area, I want to protest in the strongest possible way that this Government are not maintaining accounting procedures in the current year.  They are passing on to the next Government a bill, in this one area alone, of over £220 million.  They will then claim that Fianna Fáil could not balance the books in 1987.  This is the most reprehensible repudiation of responsibility I ever witnessed from any Government in 21 years in the Oireachtas.  It is coming from a Government who claimed they were going to plan a better way to manage the nation's finances.  This is the worst possible way to plan the nation's <Col N="1682" /> finances.  It is time we all admitted publicly to the people the extent of the problem. If there are to be cutbacks and a burden to be shared across the board, the action of this Government in passing on to their successor in Government a bill of the order of £240 million in this one area&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to deal with two or three matters, one of which my colleague, Deputy Burke, was referring to when I came in, that is, the giving of support from the European Regional Fund to local authorities for integrated programmes. Having had consultations with commissioners of the European Community recently and from the experience I had there, I realise the case being made by the Government, that we are not in a position to put forward an integrated programme for any year because all Ireland is designated as a regional fund qualification area, is false.  There are many areas in the European community that qualify for aid under the regional fund. Perhaps the most obvious example is the south of Italy.  Because it qualifies for aid from the regional fund in no way disqualifies it from having an additional integrated programme for the city of Naples.  That is the pattern throughout the Community.  The Government should immediately make proposals &mdash; they have made none at all &mdash; for integrated programmes wherever they are urgently needed.  There are so many of them that I cannot begin to outline them, whether in the Border regions, in Dublin city, in Cork city or even in north Tipperary.

      <P>I want to deal with something that is dear to your heart, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, and mine which is specifically referred to here, that is the Mulcaire River and the assistance being made available for cleaning-up operations on that river.  These cleaning-up operations for which a paltry sum has been provided would never have been necessary if the Government had not, in this area as in many others, in the name of a review of the arterial drainage programme, used that review to postpone the whole operation of the arterial drainage programme.  Three years ago they undertook a review when the Mulcaire River was ready to be drained under the arterial drainage programme.  That review was a very convenient excuse for doing nothing for three years.  The Leas-Cheann Comhairle and I know the consequences of their failure to do anything.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest to Deputy Cosgrave, who referred to commitments and promises, that he should get details of the Taoiseach's recent tours to find out what commitments and promises are all about.  He should not be blaming Fianna Fáil for them all.  I should like to bring to the notice of the House the storm damage that was caused in Mayo last night.  I should like to thank the Minister of State for his courtesy and kindness to me since his appointment and I appeal to him to pay attention to what happened in Mayo last night, the worst night experienced in that country.  Some of the money provided in the Supplementary Estimate should be devoted to dealing with the problems that have arisen following last night's storm. In north Mayo many towns have been affected.  An area near the town of Ballycastle has been cut off from the remainder of north Mayo due to a major landslide that is continuing.  People in that area must travel many miles to get to Ballina and other centres.  The town of Crossmolina was badly hit by severe flooding.  The town of Ballina, and its environs such as Creggs Road and the Sligo Road, were badly hit and a considerable amount of damage done.</P>
      <P>Mayo County Council should be given a special grant to enable them to deal with the problems.  The village of Rakestreet has been badly hit and in the townland of Comminch six families have been completely cut off.  One young lady from that townland who was to report for work this evening in Dublin is unable to leave the area.  Those families do not have any connection with any other part of the county.</P>
      <P>The many people who called me this morning seeking assistance told me that it was the worst night experienced in the county.  I understand that the fire brigade have been working through the night.  I am very concerned about the problems of the people in north Mayo and I urge the Minister to do everything possible to help those people.  It is important that money is given to the county council to help them repair the damage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept that the £5,000 house grant was a tremendous boost to those anxious <Col N="1687" /> to purchase their own homes but there is a long delay in the payment of these grants.  That delay in some cases is caused by the applicants.  Most of those who apply for a grant must obtain bridging finance from financial institutions but, because of the delay in the payment by the Department, they fall behind in their payments.  Many of them never recover financially.  The excess bridging means that those people are in difficulty from the start.  I appeal to the Minister to speed up the payments of those grants.  It appears that a difficulty arises because the Department check with local authorities about the rent paid by the applicants and the income declared.  That is causing considerable inconvenience to applicants.</P>
    <P>I had not intended contributing to this debate but I was glad of the opportunity to make an appeal to the Minister on behalf of the people of north Mayo.  I have never had so many telephone calls from that area appealing for help.  An emergency exists in north Mayo and the Minister should pay attention to it.  I appeal to the Department to contact Mayo Councy Council to arrange help. It is frightening to think that some families are cut off and cannot be reached even by emergency services such as the fire brigade or doctors.  I should like to thank the Chair for permitting me to raise this matter and I appeal to the Minister to transfer funds to deal with that emergency. I hope that when the next Estimate is debated in the House the Minister will be in a position to announce plans for the Department to commence work in Ballina.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJoeCosgrave" hpid="Mr. M. Cosgrave Mr. M. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>My contribution will be brief.  I should like to make a special point in regard to the threat to the environment by the shipping disaster on the south-west coast.  First, I welcome the Estimate as another boost to the building industry.  It will create more employment and will maintain the present employment level in that industry.  The £5,000 grant has made a big impact on Dublin Corporation and Dublin County Council <Col N="1688" /> housing lists, the best I have seen in my ten years as a member of both local authorities. The waiting list of Dublin County Council has been virtually eliminated.</P>
      <P>I welcome the redeployment of money to the Housing Finance Agency which enables families of modest means to provide their own houses rather than being a burden on local authority housing lists. More than 8,500 applicants have availed of this scheme in the past two years.  I congratulate the Minister and his officials for having brought in this excellent scheme which has given a great boost to the availability of local authority houses to needy persons.</P>
      <P>The Minister and his officials should be congratulated on their work during the recent shipping disaster off the Cork coast.  However, if such a disaster should occur in Dublin Bay are we ready to deal with it?  For instance, have the Dublin local authorities stocks of dispersants, booms and other equipment available to them?  Have we an oil pollution expert available to advise local authorities and the Department in the event of such a disaster?  If not, efforts should be made immediately to recruit such an expert. We have dangerous substances being brought in and out of Dublin port.  They are stored in the port.  Have we proper fire fighting equipment and expertise to combat any serious fire or spillage in the port area?  These substances are stored in the Dublin docks area.  I suggest that the Minister should approach the Dublin Port and Docks Board and the people who store such substances in tanks above ground in an effort to get the tanks put underground, or otherwise to put them in a safe place where they could be better protected.  I understand the EC have more than 600 sheets of information available describing methods for dealing with oil spills as well as the whereabouts of special equipment, dispersants and other chemicals. Ships and aircraft are available from the EC.  Are local authorities aware of this?  If not, I would ask the Minister to make them aware of it in the event of a spillage occurring.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. J. Doyle Mr. J. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the introduction of the £5,000 housing grant.  As the Minister said in his speech, it is of great assistance to taxpayers who previously have been on local authority housing lists.  They will now be enabled to buy their own houses.  There has been a high demand for this grant in the area I represent.</P>
      <P>My main reason for speaking this morning is to thank the Government for the measures they introduced to help the victims of the flood disaster during the night of 26-27 August.  It will be remembered by people throughout the country for a long time.  In Dublin south-east and in County Wicklow there were many victims. I will make a passing reference to the lack of emergency services available prior to the flooding.  Because of the accurate forecasts beforehand, the emergency services had time to take steps to deal with the subsequent floods and to take preventive measures in some areas.</P>
      <P>I had the sad experience of trying to get the emergency services to help to protect property against flooding, with little or no success.  After two or three days waiting, we had an announcement by the Government that £1 million would be available to flood victims.  One's own house has to be flooded before one appreciates what it feels like to see everything one had built up over the years destroyed overnight, in some cases in a matter of minutes.  I know people who closed their doors that night and have not returned yet.  They could not face up to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last Monday, Dublin City Council approved the expenditure of £270,000 to pay small builders who were employed by Dublin Corporation to refurbish houses damaged in the flood &mdash; replacing floor boards, plastering walls and so on.  I understand that is only a quarter of what the corporation intend to spend.  This money is available mainly to people who had no insurance.  They are in the greatest need, but it has come to my attention that many people were under-insured and I suggest that their cases should be looked at sympathetically.  If there is only small insurance cover, the necessary work <Col N="1690" /> cannot be carried out.  It seems unfair to them to see a near neighbour who had no insurance whatever avail of the Government's generosity, having their houses totally refurnished and redecorated. I compliment the Government on coming to the aid of the elderly and the disabled in that crisis.  Old people living alone suffered most in the floods.</P>
    <P>Much work still has to be done to salvage some of the property damaged by the floods some months ago.  I suggest the Minister should ask the local authorities to expedite the work so that it will be finished by Christmas.  All who suffered in the floods, including my own family, would like to see their houses put back into habitable condition before Christmas.  I appeal to the Minister to try to have the emergency services prepared for such floods in future.  It is important also that local authorities would have a section to deal with the maintenance of rivers.  They have such sections available for housing and roads and there should be river maintenance sections because if rivers were properly maintained we would not have had the awful problems we had on 26-27 August.</P>

      <P>Before I call on the Minister to conclude the debate, on an order of the House dated 29 April, Deputies have the right to intervene or ask questions of the Minister before he replies.

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened this morning to one of the most extraordinary speeches I have ever heard in my years in the House from an Opposition spokesman.  It was extraordinary because in every single area of his criticism the Deputy attacked what is acclaimed by the general public and impartial commentators as one of the most successful schemes introduced by the Department.  The Deputy attacked the £5,000 grant scheme and once again returned to what is now becoming a rather broken and pathetic record: he <Col N="1691" /> attacked in every part the most successful house improvement grants scheme ever introduced or operated by any Government in the history of this State.</P>
      <P>One of the things rarely spoken of is the fact that the Irish have a very high record of home ownership, representing 84 per cent, the highest in the world.  That is something of which we should be very proud.  There has been virtually a continuous policy of generous grants and tax aid to prospective house purchasers to enable them to fulfil their desire to own their own homes, the result being that we have the highest record of home ownership in the entire world.  In that context it is exactly right that Governments should, from time to time, introduce schemes to encourage people to maintain, refurbish or improve their own houses.  It is the single thing of value the Irish have, ownership of their own homes, and for that reason the Government introduced a home improvements grant scheme designed to stimulate employment among legitimate small builders throughout the country and to encourage home owners to improve their property in the interests of their family.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Its success is now well known.  As Deputy Burke said in his criticism, there are now over 125,000 applicants.  That seems to be a source of annoyance to the Deputy, so I will give him a few more figures to annoy him further.  Over 90,000 of these applicants have received grant approval.  The sum of £24 million, a sum of which the Deputy was so critical and which may be pocket money to him but is an extraordinarily substantial amount, was made available this year by the Government to fund grants drawn down by people who went about improving, extending or repairing their own homes to improve the fabric of the housing stock, to provide employment for the smaller contractors in the construction industry and to generate activity throughout the country.  One has only to talk to builders' merchants, legitimate builders, people employed in the building industry and home owners to find that they unanimously praise and acclaim the grants <Col N="1692" /> scheme.  The single fear they express is that the repeated and deliberate criticism voiced about this scheme by one who would proclaim himself an aspiring Minister for the Environment means that if this man got his hands on this scheme he would be vindictive enough to abolish it because it was someone else's idea.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. J. Doyle Mr. J. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>They abolished it before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not going to refer to that but, as the Deputy reminds the House, there was a modest house improvement grants scheme in operation under a previous Fianna Fáil Government. Not only did they abolish it but they made such a mess of the abolition that in the fortnight's prior notice they gave of the abolition they got the equivalent of five years applications.  In charity, the best I can say about the speech made by the Opposition spokesman is that his sole original thought was based upon something expressed by his father in this House 30 years ago.  Congratulations to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy also expressed a commitment to reintroduce the national differential rents scheme if his party were returned to Government.  I further congratulate the Deputy for reading out relatively well the biased and sectional speech written for him relating to the construction industry.  The simple fact of the matter is that the construction industry now receives over 70 per cent of total turnover from Exchequer sources.  I want to ask a question.  At what stage or at what percentage is it regarded as reasonable for the taxpayer to stop funding a particular industry?  We all know the difficulties of the construction industry, and none better than the Government, and we have endeavoured to respond to them by allocating capital resources in a way in which there was an effective return produced upon any capital investment while, at the same time, maintaining the highest level possible of activity in that industry during the recession.  Over 70 per cent of the total turnover of the construction industry is funded by the taxpayer. At what stage is it reasonable to <Col N="1693" /> say the taxpayer has done enough for an industry?  Is it at 75 per cent?  Is it at 80 per cent?  Or perhaps it should be 100 per cent.</P>
    <P>However, the Deputy did not entertain us this morning with the promise of his leader to put a further £200 million into the construction industry.  It could have been instructive for the House and the taxpayer to hear on what that £200 million is to be spent.  Is it to be on cost effective capital investment?  Is it to be spent on making work available?  Is it to be on the house improvements grant scheme which the Deputy has clearly signalled he would abolish if he had his way? Is it strange that on the one hand the Deputy's leader intends to invest £200 million in the construction industry while his spokesman for the Environment consistently criticises the spending of money on the house improvement grants scheme and indicates clearly his intention, if he gets his way, to abolish that scheme. Does that mean that the £200 million is to be in substitution for the abolition of the house improvement grants scheme? It would have been more interesting for the House and the taxpayer and, not least, the construction industry, had the Deputy explained to us this morning precisely where he is going to spend this £200 million after he abolishes the house improvement grants scheme and precisely from which group of taxpayers he intends to extract this money.</P>
    <P>The Deputy criticised the Government's record in public housing. The simple fact of the matter is that there are now fewer applicants for housing in the Twenty-six Counties than in one single borough of the City of London. There are something under 22,000 applicants nationwide here as opposed to something approaching 30,000 applicants in the single London Borough of Battersea. That has been achieved through a combination of the introduction of new, properly designed and publicly-funded schemes and the diversion of other resources; the £5,000 surrender grant scheme, of which the Deputy was so critical, the Housing Finance Agency, the financial viability of which the Deputy in <Col N="1694" /> his most recent and brief tenure in the Custom House endeavoured to undermine and which he tried to abolish.  There have been the increases in income and loan limits for the SDA scheme and the continued high output of public authority housing, all of which have resulted in approximately 11,000 dwellings being let in the last two years annually, in comparison with the stated and accepted target of 9,500 and all done by the Government in the interests of both the taxpayer and those in need of housing. What has been the response from the Opposition: the £5,000 surrender grant scheme &mdash; wrong; the Housing Finance Agency &mdash; wrong; the SDA loans scheme &mdash; wrong the increase of 1 per cent &mdash; wrong.  The Deputy's friends in the building societies recently increased loan interest rates by 3 per cent; apparently that was not wrong.</P>
    <P>This morning has been an ordeal &mdash; to listen to a litany of complaints and criticism about every single thing achieved by this Government in the interests of those who cannot house themselves and who wish to provide and improve their homes.  As recently as yesterday evening I announced improvements in the new house grants scheme.  This will mean that people who have a disabled member of their family &mdash; even if they owned a house previously &mdash; may obtain the first-time purchaser grant in addition to the new £2,250 grant I introduced recently if they provide a house specially modified for the disabled member of their family.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Deasy) Austin Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Deasy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £37,200,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in <Col N="1697" /> course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1986, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Agriculture, including certain services administered by that Office, and of the Irish Land Commission, and for payment of certain subsidies and sundry grants-in-aid.</P>
    <P>This Supplementary Estimate is for an additional gross sum of £52.26 million which is partly offset by savings on various subheads totalling £15.06 million. The net amount to be voted is therefore, £37.2 million.</P>
    <P>The main items where additional expenditure arises are market intervention, exchange rate guarantees and disadvantaged areas schemes.  The £14.071 million under subhead M.4 for market intervention and some £6.7 million under subhead F.2 for exchange rate guarantee are required to meet exchange losses which arose in those areas as a result of the autumn devaluation of the pound.</P>
    <P>The purchase of products into intervention is financed by this country in the first instance, the capital losses when the products are eventually sold being met by the EEC.  The finance for the purchases is raised by borrowings, the level of which in 1986 has averaged about £430 million. A high percentage of these borrowings is in foreign currencies.  The EC pays a standard interest rate to all Member States in respect of intervention capital expenditure.  This rate is currently 7 per cent which is appreciably below the rate at which money could be raised here. My Department in consultation with the Department of Finance have therefore, been borrowing abroad to finance intervention purchases.  While the money is obtained at more attractive rates there is, of course, an exchange risk and it is to meet the exchange losses this year that the extra £14 million is now required.  I should say that over the years since 1983 when my Department commenced borrowing abroad for intervention purchases we have gained appreciably on the interest element.  Despite the recent <Col N="1698" /> exchange loss we are still well ahead and the Exchequer has saved considerably on what would have been the position if the funds had been raised domestically.</P>
    <P>Under the exchange rate guarantee arrangements the State covers the exchange losses on foreign borrowings made by the financial institutions which are on-loaned to the farming sector.  For 1986 some £300 million in foreign borrowings has been covered under the guarantee arrangement.  The bulk of these borrowings was made available in 1986.  £50 million in Eurocurrencies was made available to the ACC at the beginning of the year.  In June two schemes were introduced covering short-term working capital requirements and new agricultural developments.  The maximum borrowings covered by these schemes was £135 million.  In October a further £100 million was made available giving a maximum of £200 million for loans to farmers and private peat producers in severe financial difficulty and £35 million for new agricultural developments. The additional sum of £6.675 million now sought under subhead F.2. is to cover the exchange losses which have arisen under the guarantee arrangement resulting from the devaluation of the pound.</P>
    <P>The additional provision of £11 million under subhead M.3 is to cover this year's payments under the special weather aid package which I negotiated with the EC. The full package is worth £15 million and the balance of this will be paid to farmers early next year.  The £15 million will, of course, be repaid to us by the EC in due course.  The extra money will be utilised to assist farmers in the more severely handicapped areas as it is generally accepted that these areas were particularly affected by the bad weather.  It must be also borne in mind that this year the headage rate on beef cows in the less severely handicapped areas has been more than doubled to £70 per livestock unit.  This is a national measure which is designed to increase the beef herd but we will be able to recoup 50 per cent of this expenditure in 1987.  By using the special EC weather aid, it has been possible to <Col N="1699" /> raise the basic rate per livestock unit in the more severely handicapped areas from £32 to £50 for the first eight livestock units.  The subsequent 22 livestock units have had the rate increased from £28 to £44.  The overall effect of this should be to raise average payments from £640 to £860 for some 68,000 herd owners.</P>
    <P>The original provision of £19 million under subhead C.2 is insufficient to finance essential activities in relation to bovine TB this year and it is, therefore, necessary to provide an additional £1.3 million to meet the cost of fees to veterinary practitioners.  The unpredictable nature of disease spread makes it difficult to foresee the amount of disease that may be uncovered over a given time span. The fact that the 1986 programme was a selective one concentrating on high risk herds added an extra element of uncertainty in predicting the volume of additional testing arising from reactor retests, contiguous herd tests and six-month check tests.  The results of the programme to date suggest that it has been effective in keeping the disease situation under control and that the additional £1.3 million required for fees to practitioners will prove very cost-effective.</P>
    <P>The depopulation fund provided for under subhead C.5 applies to both TB and brucellosis eradication and is used to provide additional compensation to herd owners who have had their herds depopulated in the interest of minimising disease spread.  We have made a major attempt during 1986 to achieve the final breakthrough against brucellosis.  Part of this strategy involved the depopulation of herds that did not offer a realistic prospect of going clear of disease in the foreseeable future.  I am pleased to say that this strategy has been successful and has been a major element in the reduction of the number of brucellosis-infected herds to the current level of 70 for the whole country.  Some of the depopulations involved large dairy herds and so were more costly than envisaged at the start of the programme.  Depopulations due to bovine TB were also more extensive than <Col N="1700" /> planned originally.  The overall result is that an additional £0.4 million is needed to meet commitments for depopulation and restocking grants in 1986.</P>
    <P>An additional £0.835 million is being provided under subhead B.13 in respect of significant reductions in ACOT's non-Exchequer income.  The bulk of the reduction relates to a shortfall in anticipated receipts from the European Social Fund arising from the impact of tighter eligibility criteria on ACOT training schemes.</P>
    <P>Under subhead G.2 a sum of £1.079 million is required to cover liabilities in relation to the demise of the Pigs and Bacon Commission Limited.  The company, run by the pigmeat industry, had taken over from the statutory Pigs and Bacon Commission in the spring of 1982 but they ceased trading at the end of 1984.  When the new company was formed they took over certain assets of the old commission.  The proceeds from disposal of these assets were to have been used to finally clear the deficit of the PBC but the company failed to do so.  In addition, my Department had provided a guarantee on limited borrowings by the private company which they were obliged to honour to clear the debt incurred by that company in trading.  While strenuous efforts have been made by my Department to recover the amounts owing from the pigmeat industry, these have so far proved unsuccessful.  I wish to stress, however, that efforts to recover these debts amounting to almost £1 million through suitable arrangements negotiated with the pigmeat industry will continue. Some £120,000 of the additional provision relates to redundancy and pension payments for former employees of the statutory Pigs and Bacon Commission.</P>
    <P>Expenditure this year under the interest subsidy scheme for farmers in severe financial difficulty, better know as the rescue package, is expected to be some £0.7 million more than provided for.  This extra provision appears under subhead F.4 and is to cover interest subsidies to farmers who were admitted to the scheme at a late stage by the financial <Col N="1701" /> institutions.  This could not have been foreseen at the time the original Estimates were drawn up.</P>
    <P>An additional grant-in-aid of £20,000 is being provided for Bord na gCapall under subhead I.1.  This is to cover aid of £10,000 provided by the board towards the cost of the European Junior Showjumping Championships held in Ennis this year and a death gratuity in respect of an employee of the board.</P>
    <P>The £3 million provided for under subhead M.7 is necessary to enable payment of that amount in variable premium on beef exports to the UK.  It is balanced by corresponding higher receipts from the UK Government under subhead N.27.</P>
    <P>The Supplementary Estimate also provides for a deficiency of over £13 million under subhead N for Appropriations-in-aid. This is a net sum which takes into account certain additional receipts under some headings.  The main deficiencies arise in receipts from the EC in respect of market intervention and farm modernisation measures, including western measures.  The drop in market intervention receipts is due to a significant cut made by the Commission early in the year in the rates of recoupment for interest charges and storage and handling costs. The reduction in the farm modernisation sector receipts arises from a number of factors including adjustments for excess recoupment in 1985 and sums due in 1986 being deferred into 1987.  The offsetting additional receipts include the £3 million already referred to in respect of UK variable premium on beef exports, £0.6 million in disease levies due to a higher volume of slaughterings than anticipated, £0.95 million in EC receipts towards expenditure on disadvantaged areas in 1985 and £0.57 million in respect of forfeited deposits and securities under EC intervention, export refund arrangements and so on.  For the latter, we had estimated receipts at £0.3 million. However, this is a very difficult item to estimate in that it is impossible to foresee the particular events or incidents that will arise justifying forfeiture of securities.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1702" /> I commend the Supplementary Estimate to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick West) Mr. Noonan (Limerick West)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> This year has been one of the worst years in agriculture. In addition to the weather conditions things have been further complicated by a Minister who has no commitment to agriculture development. In introducing this Supplementary Estimate the Minister should have availed of the opportunity to give some guidelines to the agricultural community and to point the way ahead.  The Government's abysmal failure is evidenced by their total lack of commitment to the agricultural industry.  This has been obvious over the last four years but hopefully the time is not too far distant when we can see an end to this abysmal Government.</P>
      <P>The Minister in his contribution referred to the Euroloan schemes.  We all know that the Euroloan scheme is totally inadequate to meet the needs of modern agriculture.  The Minister should be aware that what is required is long term borrowing and a fixed repayment rate over perhaps a ten year period.  We require long term planning and guidelines for the future.  Instead we have had a stop-go inconsistent approach to the provision of capital and an attitude from the Government which suggests that they will give farmers a sop here and there and that this will satisfy them.  The Government have no long term strategy with regard to the provision of capital and assistance with loan repayments.  This must be tackled in a way which will ensure that we have some confidence in the industry in the future.</P>
      <P>We welcome the contribution by the Government, late as it may be, in regard to the increase in the headage grants on beef cows in the less severely handicapped areas.  This should have been introduced long before now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred to the depopulation fund under subhead C5 where it applies to both TB and brucellosis eradication. I brought to the attention of the Department that all the technical advice available to the field workers and the veterinary profession recommended that <Col N="1703" /> certain herds in County Limerick, particularly should be totally depopulated.  This was not possible because of inadequate funding for this scheme.  In certain parts of County Limerick herds were not depopulated.  Reactors were removed but the result was that in subsequent tests there were further outbreaks of the disease and herds contiguous to the affected herd had a break out of the disease.  There was a snowball effect because the Minister and the Department were being penntwise and pound foolish.  That is the sort of disease eradication scheme that is being promoted by the Government.</P>
    <P>The Government in their programme <i>Building on Reality</i> indicated that certain sums were being allocated for disease eradication yet the following year the scheme had insufficient funding to carry out the programme outlined in <i>Building on Reality</i>.  That was our approach to disease eradication.  It is not good enough.</P>
    <P>The TB eradication scheme has been stepped down.  We know it is important that a full round of testing for the whole country should be carried out quickly. Even at this stage I hope the Minister will do something about that.  During the four years in which they have been in office the Government have constantly proved their unwillingness to put money into agriculture.  I am quite sure that the Minister would agree with my assessment, although he is unlikely to agree with me publicly.  The great majority of farmers would also agree with me as would many other people who are interested in the development of this country.</P>
    <P>I have referred to the bovine TB scheme for which the Minister is now asking an additional sum of £1.7 million. The sum required is not the largest in the Estimate but, more than anything else, it indicates the extent of the unwillingness of the Government to carry out their responsibilities with regard to agriculture. For a number of years we have been going backwards in regard to the eradication of bovine TB and its incidence is now higher than it was in the fifties.  What is the reason for this?  It is <Col N="1704" /> because the provision of moneys for the scheme has been insufficient?  Testing has not been sufficiently frequent, consistent or extensive and the consequences are that the remaining vestiges of the disease persist.  Unless immediate remedial action is taken, the situation may well worsen and that is the view of the veterinary profession and farmers who are suffering so much at present because of inadequate and insufficient testing.  This is very regrettable, not just for the farmers involved who make large contributions to the cost of the eradication scheme, in excess of £14 million this year, but also for the economy.  Apart from our soil and the people who live and work on the land, our greatest asset is the livestock herd.  However, over the last four years the Government have not been prepared to carry out their responsibilities in regard to improving the health of the national herd.</P>
    <P>The reasons for this are not too difficult to work out.  Some of those in Government look upon agriculture as a burden which must be borne rather than the main national industry needing development. Money for the bovine tuberculosis scheme has been cut back without regard to the serious consequences which will accrue as a result.  Since 1954, we have been endeavouring to rid ourselves of bovine TB.  The total cost of the scheme, in current money terms, amounts to something in the region of £1,000 million. I do not propose to comment on why the scheme could not have been completed long ago but, compared with the high levels of the disease which existed in the fifties, very good progress has been made.</P>
    <P>I wish to comment on the recently published report about the scheme by the Committee on Public Expenditure.  I must criticise the neglect by the Government of bovine TB over the last four years.  However, the report of the committee to which I referred give an inaccurate, bad and dangerous impression to anybody reading it who is not familiar with the progress made in relation to eradication over the last number of years.  I refer in particular to the statements in the report that the scheme is <Col N="1705" /> there purely as a blind to convince importing countries that we have a scheme and, secondly, that known reactors are not always taken up and slaughtered when they should be.  These are not the only faults in the report but I single them out for mention because it is imporant to do so.  I cannot deal fully with the report now but perhaps I will have an opportunity to do so in the near future. While it may have merit in regard to drawing attention to the need to clear up bovine TB, it is damaging because of its major inaccurate statements of which I have examples.</P>
    <P>To get rid of bovine TB once and for all, we need a Government who are determined to invest sufficient money to have the job carried out quickly and efficiently.  In the past year, I published a ten point plan for the eradication of bovine TB which, if followed, would give the desired results.  A full round of testing needs to be carried out very quickly with special attention paid to problems as they arise and to problem areas as they show up.  Earlier, I referred to a number of problem areas in my county and I am sure that the Minister and the Department know that these areas require attention. However, he has not been given the money to carry out the work and I reemphasise that every herd whould have one round of testing every year.  Known reactors should be removed to ensure that there will not be a further spread of the disease.  There should be adequate testing, research and funding and if these were put into operation the disease could be contained in manageable proportions within three years, probably down to 0.5 of 1 per cent.  This is important because our livestock is vital to the economy.  We have been shilly-shallying in regard to this disease over the last few years and it is time to make a breakthrough.</P>
    <P>I can assure this House, and through the House the farmers of the country, that Fianna Fáil on return to office will make sufficient funding available to the bovine tuberculosis eradication scheme. We will push forward with vigour and determination so that in a short period of <Col N="1706" /> years we will be able to declare the country free of bovine tuberculosis, as we have already been able to declare the country free of brucellosis.  Brucellosis was not as difficult a disease to eliminate.  There were a number of factors which helped greatly, such as the comparative lack of movement of female cattle as against the movement of male cattle, the use of vaccination and the great interest of individual farmers in seeing to it that the disease was cleared up very often because of the sad and costly evidence before their eyes of the damage caused by the disease.</P>
    <P>The farmers of this country fully realise that a rapid clearance of tuberculosis is equally important.  I believe they have an interest and determination, given sufficient direction, control and effort by the Government, to get the job done.  In recent days my colleague, Deputy J. Leonard, reported to me on a meeting he attended in Cavan where he represented this party.  This meeting was attended by 600 farmers who gave very definite evidence &mdash; incidentally a meeting which the farmers were expecting the Minister to attend &mdash; of their anxiety and interest in having the scheme brought quickly to a successful conclusion.</P>
    <P>I would now like to take up another item on the Supplementary Estimate under subhead M.4 where money is required for market intervention.  What we are mainly talking about is the storage costs of butter, skimmed milk powder and beef.  The intervention system is the means by which the Government, operating the rules of the European Communities, maintain the support price for milk and cattle.  This brings me on to the quantities of milk produced in the Community which will be supported without penalty.  In other words, I am talking about the milk super-levy and the dreaded milk quota.  What is uppermost not only in the minds of the milk farmers who are immediately concerned but farmers generally is the further threat to quotas.  Beef farmers, especially, are fearful as to the outcome of the discussions which are at present taking place in the Council of Ministers.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1707" /> With regard to milk, the Commission have proposed further cuts in the quota. For Ireland, this will be in addition to the 3 per cent which the Government accepted in April of this year.  We have seen the effects in recent months of the long delay which the Commission have imposed on payment for products taken into intervention which has resulted in severe cuts in the price of milk.  This party never denied there is a problem with regard to the surplus of milk in Europe. What I cannot understand is the readiness with which the Government and certain farming interests have accepted that Ireland must readily submit to the same quota cuts as every other milk producing country.  I cannot understand this attitude. I would be quite right to call it a defeatist attitude by comparison with the concessions &mdash; not that they were great concessions &mdash; which were hailed by the Government as a great triumph in 1984. Farmers cannot understand why the Minister is now accepting what he could not accept two years ago.  Is it not still true that Ireland depends on milk more than any other country?  Is it not still true that it is the basis of our whole agricultural economy?  Why should this country be penalised in the same way as other countries which have built up huge surpluses of milk over the years with the use of imported feeding stuffs and the very high use of fertilisers?</P>
    <P>The argument in our favour, which I am quite sure is well known to the Minister, is the one which I have spelled out. I can only refer briefly to it.  Of course, it is all right for a farmer who has a sizeable quota to take the attitude that if his quota can be preserved or reduced by a certain amount he will accept it provided the price is kept up.  That is all very well for those who have quotas but it can be a very shortsighted attitude.  Are we to go on forever agreeing to quota reductions as long as the price is kept up? What about the farmers who have no quotas at all or who have very inadequate quotas for the milk which could be produced? What about the co-ops which <Col N="1708" /> need milk if they are to continue in business? What about the development of the Irish food industry?  What about the employment potential in the co-operatives and in the processing industry?  Is all this going to be under attack and threat?  Are we going to have further redundancies and unemployment in that area?</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, we are not receiving answers to those questions from the Government.  We must not accept the present proposed cuts in the quota.  The case we made in 1984 remains as valid today as it was then.  Ireland has a greater interest than any other country in the EC in the development of a healthy milk market in the Community and on world markets.  In a matter of major national importance such as the maintenance of at least our present supply of milk, we should not allow ourselves to be dealt with as if we were a country producing unmanageable quantities of milk on the basis of an artificial type of farming.  The Minister should take account of that in the stance he is adopting in Brussels.</P>
    <P>There is a question which I would now like to put to the Minister.  At present the Council of Ministers are looking at milk quotas and a discussion is taking place about the support systems for beef.  One never knows how these discussions may go or what may be the situation in the beef market in either six months or a year from now.  The EC persists, not for the best reasons, in cutting back on money which should be made available for agricultural support.  I do not wish to see it but we could have beef quotas.  In relation to beef, if the Minister was to find himself in the position he maintains he is in in regard to milk what would he do in regard to beef quotas?  He might address himself to that question in his reply.  From his performance with regard to milk I must conclude that he would equally concede in regard to beef and accept quotas for Ireland.  If the Minister does not agree with me perhaps he would explain to the House &mdash; taking into account his present stand on milk &mdash; what he would do in regard to beef?  I would also like him to explain the relationship, as he sees it, <Col N="1709" /> between the stand which he is taking on milk and the possible stand which he would take on beef.</P>
    <P>There is provision in subhead M3 of the Estimates for a sum of £11 million for aids to farmers in disadvantaged areas. This money is welcome and it goes a little way to make up to farmers who have suffered severe losses due to the Government's negative policies, as well as other factors such as the weather over the past two years.</P>
    <P>Farmer confidence has never been at a lower ebb.  Much more would be needed than this increase in headage payments in the disadvantaged areas to put right the damage this Government have caused.</P>
    <P>If one single item is needed to prove the lack of farmer confidence, it is to be found in the huge saving of £9.5 million under subhead M1 &mdash; the subhead for farm modernisation.  This huge sum was saved because farmers are too much in debt already and too doubtful about the future to invest.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to elaborate further on this major lack of farmer confidence in a debate about a Supplementary Estimate. I am afraid the time available to me would not be sufficient for me to say what I feel about this Government's attitude to farming.  I hope to have a more suitable opportunity to speak further on this when the Dáil discusses the motion to adjourn the House in two weeks time, that is, if the Government do not crumble and fall before the adjournment.</P>
    <P>I should like to comment on some of the other items in this supplementary Estimate.  The first item on the list is the provision of money for ACOT.  There is need for adequate funding for both ACOT and An Foras Talúntais.  Here again the Government have chopped money giving scant regard to the need for development of the advisory and research services.  With the growing restrictions on agriculture, there is an increasing need for specialised advisory and research services. There are many areas in which improvements can be made that would be of benefit to farmers, through reductions in farming costs and through <Col N="1710" /> the better development of the processing and marketing of farm produce.</P>
    <P>This petty approach to education and research is the direct opposite to the approach of our European partners whose assistance in these areas continues to grow.  Organisations such as ACOT and AFT represent hope for the future but by his action in the Estimates the Minister seemingly does not hold them in high regard.</P>
    <P>ACOT have more than proved their worth.  Their restructured service has enabled them to cope with the major growth in education and training to impart the most expert advice to farmers. The major developments in recent years have shown just how valuable ACOT are in the structure of agriculture here. Following the introduction of milk quotas last year they undertook a major analysis of alternative pathways for farm development. A detailed advisory casebook is being prepared to assist advisers in guiding farmers.  The organisation are examining each enterprise to establish how they can provide the most effective service to farmes, bearing in mind market constraints.</P>
    <P>ACOT played a major role in dealing with farmers in financial difficulty.  A highly personalised service has been provided to more than 10,000 farmers in difficulty.  The progress of more than 6,000 farmers who received assistance under the rescue package was closely monitored.  In a major initiative with farming organisations ACOT helped to restore a further 2,000 farmers to viaiblity. These were farmers whose assets were under pressure but who were ineligible for the rescue package.  This vital aspect of ACOT's service is very much in demand.</P>
    <P>While major progress has been made the imposition of milk quotas continues to threaten the viability of many farmers. It is encouraging that ACOT have recorded a magnificent increase in the numbers taking part in their education and training courses.  Almost 88 per cent of all new entrants to farming will have gone through a comprehensive training course.  This contrasts with 33 per cent <Col N="1711" /> just five years ago and is encouraging for the future.  The course for the certificate in farming which is known as the green cert has attracted almost 3,000 participants, exceeding ACOT's own expectations. Equally important is the development of alternative farming.  I am anxious to mention the possibilities for improving the income of certain specialist farmers by State agencies such as, for example, Bord na gCapall for which we are also being asked to provide extra money.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Pigs and Bacon Commission under heading G.2, I have recently supported a motion in this House to reduce the veterinary fees charged for pigs slaughtered under the control of veterinary officers of the Department of Agriculture.  The pig industry has been going through a particularly rough time and much needs to be done if we are to guarantee the very important home market for bacon to Irish pig producers and pig processors.  Equally important is it that we be in a position to develop our export trade in bacon and pork.  Everyone must realise that if we do not look after the pig business in the future large quantities of our requirements of processed pigmeat could be supplied from sources outside the country, which would be regrettable.</P>
    <P>I have already brought to the attention of the House my disappointment at finding a firm in my own county of Limerick, who had developed good possibilities of trade in pigmeat products with the United States, being prevented from trading because we do not have a single factory here which complies with the standards required by the United States. The firm considered importing pigmeat from Denmark to fill their order; that would be a sad situation altogether.  From the reply given to my question of the Minister, I hope that the position will be put right very shortly.  We can ill afford to lose such a potentially lucrative market.</P>
    <P>There are many other areas to which I should like to refer, but this is a very limited debate to the extent that I can only make reference to the points raised <Col N="1712" /> in this Supplementary Estimate.  I support this Estimate and hope that my wishes for the industry will bear fruit and will be accepted by the Minister as matters which require to be attended to and which need development.  I hope that he will bring these matters to the attention of his Cabinet colleagues, for however long or short a period he is in that position.</P>
    <P>I hope, even at this late stage, that the Minister will give to the industry the direction which he has failed to give in the past.  That industry, above everything else, is now clamouring for leadership and guidance but it is my experience, going on the Government's record that that leadership and guidance will not be forthcoming until we have a change of Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>It gives me great pleasure to have the opportunity of speaking to this Supplementary Estimate for Agriculture.  I compliment the Minister in securing £261 million for his Department in this financial year.  I have been listening to Deputy Noonan for the last 40 minutes and to his assumption that his party will be in Government in the near future.  A farmer listening to him could not identify a single constructive proposal or suggestion in his long contribution. That is not very surprising, because we all know that the Minister has carried out his job with distinction and effectively and efficiently during his four years in office and at a time of major difficulty for that industry.  One cannot but be impressed at the manner in which he handled the price negotiations over the last number of years in Brussels and also the delicate negotiations with regard to milk quotas which took place in 1984. He is to be complimented on securing Ireland's position and not alone retaining the levels of quotas but securing an increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is appropriate that the Minister is moving this Estimate some days after a very historic and timely conference has taken place with regard to the future of agriculture.  We are facing major changes in agriculture over the next number of <Col N="1713" /> years.  Anyone can see, from the additional moneys being voted for the different intervention schemes, that there will be major pressures on us as a member of the EC to change the present system of purchase, not alone of milk but of beef.  Everybody accepts that the present situation whereby the EC purchase vast quantities of butter to be put into cold storage and sold off at very low prices cannot continue.  It is important that we be able to gear ourselves appropriately for whatever changes take place with regard to the purchase system of milk and beef.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer also to one of the major changes which took place in the last 12 months and which will have major advantages for many farmers, that is the Minister's decision to reclassify 3.4 million acres from disadvantaged to severely handicapped regions.  I welcome that positive, constructive decision.  It should be our aim to reclassify as much of the country as possible, thus ensuring that farmers can gain maximum benefit from membership of the EC.  This reclassification will ensure that many farmers who prior to this were deprived of the benefits of headage payments will be able to receive them from 1987 onwards.  On discussing this issue and the implications for my own county with some senior Department officials, I was amazed to find that the changes envisaged for this year and next year will increase the amount of headage payments from approximately £1.8 million in 1985 to £6 million in 1987.  Of course, there will be a substantial increase this year due, first, to an additional 90 farmers coming into the severely handicapped area and, secondly, the increase in the rate of headage payments in the west from £32 to £50 for the first eight livestock units and £28 to £44 for the next 22.  That will undoubtedly help to improve the income of many farmers in the west who have suffered adversely over two very bad summers, indeed two extremely bad years.</P>
    <P>The additional £15 million in income from headage payments should not be seen in the context of compensation for the last two years.  Rather it should be <Col N="1714" /> seen as trying to increase the rates of headage payments.  It should not be just for one year, our aim should be to pay this rate each year.  Our aim should be to pay the full headage grants because it is in the country's best interests that we pay out the maximum under the headage scheme.  I have no doubt that this would result in savings for the Government in other areas.</P>
    <P>Some farmers with uneconomic holdings and who are forced to work in industrial employment and are deemed to have an off-farm income and are prevented from applying for headage payments. This is an area the Minister should examine to see what can be done to bring more of these farmers into line for headage payments.  The important thing is to have as many farmers as possible in receipt of headage payments.  That is why I welcome the extension of the scheme in 1986 and the extension envisaged for 1987. That is of crucial importance but we should do all we can to bring into the scheme those farmers who are in receipt of an off-farm income.  I understand the cost in the first year would be in the region of £6 million but to bring those involved in sheep production into the scheme would cost substantially less, around £1 million.</P>
    <P>The Minister should look specifically at farmers involved in sheep production because the EC is still not self-sufficient in sheepmeat.  We should encourage our farmers to get involved in this industry and gain a higher proportion of the market because in three or four years time a quota system might be introduced, as has happened with milk and other products.  It is important that we increase production and get our share of the market while the going is good.  We should encourage sheep farmers to increase sheep numbers.  Paying headage grants to farmers with off-farm incomes, especially those involved in sheep production, would be one way to do this.</P>
    <P>The previous speaker referred to the bovine tuberculosis eradication scheme. I welcome the increase in expenditure under this heading but we all regret that it was not possible to carry out a complete <Col N="1715" /> round of testing this year.  I understand the Minister is carrying out an internal departmental study on the operation of the tuberculosis eradication scheme and I welcome that.  This is one area where we must examine the value the taxpayer is getting for his money.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to a report by a subcommittee of this House which was quite critical of the expenditure under the tuberculosis eradication scheme.  It is important to emphasise that it is not the farmers who gain financially from that scheme because the amount of that heading which goes into the farmers' pockets by way of compensation, is extremely small.  The whole area of compensation needs to be looked at and I appeal to the Minister to do so.  We will have to carry out a careful examination of expenditure on this programme and ensure that a greater proportion of the money will be spent carrying out tests and eliminating the disease at farm level.  In the past I have been critical of the amount spent administering schemes.  Here is a glaring example where the money spent on administration is much too high when compared with the amount spent on work carried out at farm level.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to carefully examine the situation in County Longford where there is an extremely high level of disease at present.  The only thing preventing the spread of that disease into my county is that river which caused a great deal of trouble on many occasions but which on this occasion is a blessing, and that is the Shannon.  Farmers in my county are extremely worried lest there be a major outbreak in Roscommon.  I ask the Minister to take whatever steps are necessary to ensure that the disease does not spread into County Roscommon.  I want to raise another topic, that is, the tattooing of cattle rather than tagging.  For quite some time I have held the view that this would contribute towards reducing the level of disease.  This, too, is an area the Minister should examine.  I appeal to him to make some funds available under the heading &ldquo;research&rdquo; to enable research to take place into tuberculosis, the outbreaks <Col N="1716" /> which take place and where they originate. The Agricultural Institute should be playing a much greater part in this area.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned Euroloans in Euro currencies.  At present the demand for this currency far exceeds the supply. I compliment the Minister for making the £200 million plus available at extremely low interest rates, but I appeal to him to examine what can be done to have this scheme extended because whether we like it or not for many years the majority of Irish farmers have been over borrowed. Many of them over borrowed because they were advised by the Department of Agriculture and their agencies to reclaim and drain land, build houses, increase stock numbers and so on, and this money was very often borrowed at 7 per cent or 8 per cent but within two or three years these farmers were paying interest rates of 18 per cent.  No farm enterprise can carry that level of bank interest.  I believe many of our lending institutions have squeezed the blood out of our farmers because of the criminal interest rates they are charging.  I appreciate that the banks have to borrow on the world market and that they have to pay the going rate, but I often question the rates of interest charged on what should be production, such as agriculture on the one hand and domestic or personal borrowing on the other.  I believe the banks could have played a much more important role in the agricultural sector.</P>
    <P>Many questions remain to be answered about the handling of these Euroloans by the lending agencies.  The lending agencies should spell out clearly what are the criteria for borrowing and granting those loans because many farmers cannot understand why they are not eligible. There seems to be great reluctance on the part of the lending institutions to restructure loans.  I find it very difficult to understand their attitude to many of the applications made.  The number of applications received for this Euroloan far exceeds the amount of money available but even allowing for that there is a slowness in releasing to farmers the money that is available.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1717" /> During the coming months much discussion and negotation will take place with regard to our milk quota system.  We all recognise that the present system may not continue.  I appeal to the Minister to ensure when taking part in those negotiations, that careful consideration is given to the smaller producers.  Every effort should be made to try to ensure that a producer of 30,000 gallons of milk or less will have an opportunity to make a living from Irish agriculture.  That producer should not be penalised and driven out of milk production or out of farming. He should have the opportunity, if he has loans, to repay them.  It is extremely important that all this be taken into account in those negotiations.  I ask the Minister to try to protect the income of that type of farmer in particular.</P>
    <P>Any change in the milk quota system will have implications for the beef farmer also.  The raw material, the calf, will be much more expensive and there will be smaller numbers available.  When one considers that on one hand and the interest rates on the other hand and also the banning of implants which will make it more difficult for farmers to have the type of carcase that will be up to grade, one realises the major problems there will be for the beef farmer.  The one way that action can be taken to alleviate some of those problems is by giving farmers low interest long term loans.  We must try to restructure the borrowings of farmers. They could make a contribution towards the cost of this money.  It would be unfair to ask the Exchequer to account for all of it.  I know that many farmers would agree to do that.  This would reduce the present interest rates of 15 per cent, 16 per cent and 17 per cent to single figures. That is of vital importance if agriculture is to survive in this country.</P>
    <P>There has been a major drop in farmers' incomes in the past two years.  That has been weather related.  There is no doubt that the weather has had a devastating effect on farm income in the past two years.  Output is down by an estimated 10 per cent and costs have soared.  One survey carried out recently suggested that the variable costs rose by <Col N="1718" /> 33 per cent as a result of the two extremely bad years and that 68 per cent of that was due to increased costs of feed. With regard to fixed costs there was a 20 per cent increase, again weather related, because of the increased borrowings of farmers and the high bank interest rates. As a result farm income was reduced by upwards of 50 per cent and many farmers found it extremely difficult to exist.  Low interest loans would make a major contribution to increasing farm incomes for many of those farmers.  In conclusion, I appeal again to the Minister to see what can be done to reduce bank interest rates and to get long term low interest rates for Irish farmers.  That is of vital importance for the future of the agricultural industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>The debate on the agricultural industry is being held against a background of the whole industry being at a cross roads.  There has been a crisis in the industry for a number of years. The pig industry, beef production and tillage farming have been for some time disaster enterprises as far as agricultural production is concerned.  I will deal with different aspects of the industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should look at the structural problems that have affected the agricultural industry for so long.  By and large we have small uneconomic holdings.  Unfortunately, the subsistent farming mentality has prevailed for far too long.  The opportunity that membership of the EC presented to us was not realised, people were not in a position to avail of it and to set the machinery of development and progress in motion in time.  Small-holdings by their very nature are simply unable to generate the resources that will allow the capital investment and intensification which will in time help them to gain the necessary viability.  The sort of farmyard enterprises we have in mind, pig and poultry production and, in some cases, the protected horticultural crop sector, offered the ideal way to intensify and in many cases to absorb the surplus labour capacity that existed on many farms.  Unfortunately, the capital requirement for the development of <Col N="1719" /> many of these enterprises is huge.  Small farmers cannot develop these enterprises unless they have finance from some other source.</P>
    <P>Given the policies pursued by the Coalition Government in the past four years it would appear that the sort of structural reform that is badly needed in Irish agriculture will only come about by the pressure of the dire economic circumstances at the time.  People at the lower end of the scale will be forced out of the industry.  If a sufficiently attractive retirement scheme for farmers had been introduced years ago the whole agricultural industry would be a different proposition today.</P>
    <P>It is inevitable in any of these debates that we consult <i>Building on Reality</i> to see what it forecast for agriculture.  It is stated in that document that &ldquo;Despite the national and international difficulties, the prospects for Irish agricultural trade remain promising.&rdquo;  Those who are struggling in the pig industry, those who rear weanlings, those who fatten cattle and those who grow barely must wonder what exactly that projection meant for their future.  In every industry consideration of the scale of the economy is very important. In the agricultural industry at present it is the vital ingredient for many farmers to survive.  If they have adequate input and purchasing power, adequate storage facilities and adequate cashflow and are in a position to fully utilise the equipment, to get the full benefit from investment in farm equipment and if they have freedom from the over dependence on single enterprise farming they will be the one sector that will survive.  Unfortunately, because of the farm structure there are not sufficient numbers under that heading.</P>
    <P>We joined the EC in the early seventies and it was all milk and honey for a few years.  Everybody benefited.  The sort of resources that were undreamed of previously were available for development and for the expansion of production. Unfortunately that was followed by what I can only describe as a period of insanity <Col N="1720" /> with regard to land prices in the mid-and late seventies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall try to get back on the rails soon.  In those years land prices went through the roof.  Farmers at auctions and sales were outbidding each other in grossly inflated prices.  At that time the phrase, &ldquo;they are making no land&rdquo;, was coined for the first time.  Prices paid for land in those years are an albatross around the necks of many farmers today. In the early eighties the storm clouds gathered.  Dairy and meat surpluses became an obsession with those who matter, the decision-makers in Brussels. The surpluses in the dairy area were a direct result of the factory-type farming practised on mainland Europe.  Substitute cereals grown outside the Community were used by those running such farms.  In the early eighties the super-levy became a fact of life and, unfortunately, the Coalition have allowed the full impact of it to be visited on Irish farmers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>The bad weather in recent years has been the only reason why there has not been a transfer of resources from the industry out of the country in the form of super-levy payments.  Meanwhile <Col N="1721" /> the factory type farming continues on the Continent.  One wonders about the principle of having concern for the underdeveloped areas of the EC.  We are at a disadvantage being on the periphery of Europe because of the cost of transport to markets on the Continent.  As a result our primary producers are suffering.  The Minister for Agriculture has failed dismally in his efforts to convince the bureaucrats in Brussels of the serious plight of the agricultural industry here. He has not succeeded in getting his message across.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>I will return to the Supplementary Estimate shortly.  We have not succeeded in getting the derogation to which we are entitled.  Our beef industry is in a serious state.  I not there is a provision in the Supplementary Estimate to cover the cost of putting produce into intervention.  The capital investment in beef production is considerable but, unfortunately, the return on it has not been what it should be.  Many farmers who invested heavily in modern facilities are in serious financial trouble mainly due to the high interest rates that have been with us for far too long.  Our spokesman, Deputy Noonan, referred to the importance of the beef industry for the future of our economy.  Our exports in that area are invaluable but farmers engaged in that enterprise have not received much assistance from the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to refer to the serious crisis in the pig industry.  Pig production by its nature is labour and capital intensive. The capital commitment demands that there should be a reasonable return on the investment.  Traditionally, that industry blows hot and cold.  For a period producers obtain reasonable margins, they suffer for a time and then they must cope with over-production.  Many people operate at a loss.  I accept there has been a major rationalisation at the primary production end of pig breeding and it is safe to say that our pig producers are <Col N="1722" /> among the best in Europe.  There is a greater concentration on management techniques but, unfortunately, the type of rationalisation needed at the slaughtering, processing and marketing stages has not materialised.  It is difficult to pinpoint why that has happened and unless it is rectified very soon we will not have a pig industry for very long.  Pig production has been identified as having great potential in the future but we must get the marketing and processing right.  I hope the Minister for Agriculture will give a commitment to that industry for the remainder of his time in office &mdash; all the indications are that the general election will be held early next year.  I hope rationalisation is accelerated and that the industry will have a brighter future in 1987.</P>
    <P>In recent years the media have focused on the volume of fruit and vegetable imports.  Grossly exaggerated statistics have been quoted from time to time on the possibility of import substitution this year.  Undoubtedly, there is potential for import substitution and for exports.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnJRyan" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle John J. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should confine his remarks to the Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>The industry needs a radical overhaul.  Our plan charters the road ahead for the industry.  It is unfortunate that this debate is so restricted because a lot could be said about the serious contraction and stagnation in the industry. One cannot deal with all aspects of agriculture in 15 minutes.  As far as agriculture is concerned, contraction and stagnation is the order of the day.  The implications of the super-levy and further restrictions on milk production will have a serious impact on output.  I have always subscribed to the view that in order to make progress in any industry we must concentrate on the area of research, advice and education.  Unfortunately, the Government have seen fit to make serious cutbacks in this respect and though this has had an immediate impact it will not be fully felt for another two years because young farmers who should have had an opportunity now to engage in <Col N="1723" /> education and research do not have the facilities to do so.  That will be reflected in management standards and general input in the industry.</P>
      <P>We had a publication recently on the number of part time farmers in the EC. All indications are that we will have a steady increase in those numbers.  Given the economic climate that prevails in Irish agriculture, I suggest that the movement towards part time farming will be accelerated. One must ask where are the suitable off-farm jobs to supplement incomes from part time farming.  This week we had a publication on the most recent studies on farm incomes.  Indications are that there are 100,000 family farms with incomes of less than £4,480 per annum. This shows the stupidity and the folly of those who have pontificated on farm fortunes over the years.  The most recent figures reflect the economic disability of farmers in recent years.</P>
      <P>The sort of forward planning for agriculture that should have been going on has not been a priority with the Coalition. They have not given it the attention that it deserves as an area in which national wealth can be created.  The pursuance of that attitude and policy can only have detrimental effects on the overall common good.  Expenditure on lime and fertiliser usage on Irish farms is very important.  The same applies to cattle breeding.  They are all very important and the State from time to time has assisted in this.  The return on expenditure on these items has given as good, if not better, returns as State expenditure in any other area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This brings me to the AI subsidy which was discontinued in recent years resulting in the fees going through the roof.  We have had a dramatic change in the breeding programmes on Irish farms and before long we will find that the continuing genetic improvements will be abandoned.  People on smaller farms have been finding themselves unable to pay the fees that are being demanded. The Government should have another look at this because the short term and <Col N="1724" /> long term implications are very serious. By its very nature, farming deserves long term planning with properly co-ordinated breeding programmes.  The decisions taken in regard to these matters today will be felt in three or four years in the value of our exports and the quality of our produce finding its way into the food chain to the butchers, to the meat factories and ultimately our exports.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. J. Leonard Mr. J. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister referred to the fact that allocations for intervention, disease eradication and the farm modernisation scheme were not being fully taken up.  This makes one realise the state agriculture is in at present.  He referred to additional money amounting to £14.7 million for market intervention and for fluctuations in exchange rates. When you look at that sum and relate it to prices prevailing before and immediately after the devaluation of the green £ you are surprised because the fact is that the primary producer, the person entitled to any additional money that is available, is not getting it.  Immediately after the green £ devaluation there was complete disruption of cattle sales in part of the country because additional cattle were offered.  There was disruption at many meat plants.  It is sad that after 13 years in the EC the supply still governs the price of cattle &mdash; it is not the quality or the demand that matter.  If a slaughtering or processing plant gets a few extra lorry loads of cattle it pulls down prices, and through that system prices go up and down.  At the end of a year when people want to take cattle off grass they have no option but to take them to the plants or to the marts.  Such farmers did not get the benefit they expected from the devaluation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before and after the devaluation there was a serious drop in the price of cows. The price of heifers not for intervention showed a considerable increase.  In June heifers made £2.08 per kilo, but in October they were making only £1.99.  It is very hard to understand fluctuations of that kind.  This is one of the most important parts of a farmer's production <Col N="1725" /> now that milk production is being reduced.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that there will be additional money under the disadvantaged areas scheme.  In Cavan-Monaghan we have a particular interest in this because only 24 per cent of Monaghan and 36 per cent of Cavan have been declared severely handicapped, thereby qualifying for additional money in cattle headage.  Aspiring politicians supporting the Government have been out in the past month pleading for the entire two counties to be declared severely handicapped areas.  The Taoiseach came down to the constituency and, in fairness to him, he kicked for touch, but he kicked far out.  I am sorry the Minister is not here now but he gave a fairly strong commitment in regard to that matter.  The area is entitled to be and needs to be included and the Minister should make the decision to do it so that we do not have this insecurity.  In the past month or so small farmers have come to me asking if they should hold on to stock &mdash; which they need to sell since they do not have the feed to keep them through the winter &mdash; for another few weeks to get this headage grant.  I ask the Minister to give them their money as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>The Minister said the reduction in the farm organisation sector receipts arise from a number of factors including adjustments for excess equipment in 1985 and sums due in 1986 being deferred to 1987.  With the withdrawal of the grants in 1983 this area has been of serious concern because farmers who had programmes drawn up by their ACOT advisers had not got approval.  About 4,600 farmers were denied aid.  Since then the Minister decided to pay those whose applications were with the farm development service office and about 2,000 were paid something like £2 million.  When the grant was reintroduced last year another 1,000 were able to qualify for it.  However, there are still 1,500 people who had their plans drawn up with the aid and the advice of an agricultural adviser and I believe that £1 million would be enough to pay them. There are many such people in my own constituency.  I met a man last Tuesday <Col N="1726" /> night who owes the bank £40,000 on a 52 acre farm and he is owed £10,000 under the farm modernisation scheme.  Many of these cases are tragic, some will be put out of farming entirely because they did not get the grant aid to which they would have been entitled.  Admittedly they had not got approval from the farm development office but it should be sufficient if ACOT have approved it.  The Minister should look at this area again and allow these people the grant aid which is theirs by right.</P>
    <P>The Minister also mentioned disease eradication.  How can the Government justify the withdrawal of £4.5 million from the allocation this year?  I attended a meeting last Tuesday night and there was strong condemnation of the fact that the Minister and the Department of Agriculture officials were not there to explain to the people why they are facing an increase in the incidence of TB when there should have been a substantial reduction as there is in other areas.  The areas covered were Cavan, Leitrim, Longford, Meath, Westmeath and Monaghan. Let the Minister compare the incidence of disease in 1986 as against that in 1981 in those counties.  In Cavan there was an increase of 133 per cent over that period, from 1.73 per cent to 4.03 per cent; in Leitrim, where they had the disease almost under control there was an increase of 528 per cent, that is from 0.043 per cent to 2.70 per cent; in Longford the increase was 86 per cent, that is from 3.04 per cent to 5.66 per cent &mdash; this may not be an up-to-date return because according to some reports it could be twice that figure; in Meath there is a 22 per cent increase from 2.60 per cent to 3.16 per cent; in Westmeath there is an increase of 86 per cent from 3.49 per cent to 6.49 per cent; in Monaghan, the only county with a reduction there was a reduction of 0.6 per cent from 2.30 per cent to 2.17 per cent.</P>
    <P>Apart from last year, there was as low a rate as 45 per cent in the testing of herds.  It is no wonder the people at that meeting are so annoyed and concerned. They feel there is not as much being done for them as should be, taking into account <Col N="1727" /> the importance of disease-free herds.  It is not an easy problem to handle, but we must realise it is something we have to do since, along with Italy, we are at the bottom of the league.  Our statistics, compared with those of other countries, are startling.  The cost of the scheme in 1985 under various headings was as follows: £14.7 million for administration, £11.2 million for veterinary fees, £7.7 million for reactor compensation; other expenses £3.6 million and in the depopulation fund and stock replacement £1.7 million.  It was paid for by way of levies, a contribution made by the people.  Why not use the money obtained by way of direct levies to pay the veterinary surgeons, leaving £2 million to spare for administration. It is ridiculous that almost £40 million provided from levies is used in this way.  What did the Government do? They took £4.5 million or approximately 12 per cent, off the total amount even though it may have been almost matched by levies.  It is a ridiculous situation.  I do not know how any Department can justify that type of withdrawal of funding from an area where it is so necessary.</P>
    <P>I put a question to the Minister here on 18 March which read:</P>
    <P>To ask the Minister for Agriculture if a herdowner who did not have a TB test within the previous 12 months, and who applies to his Department to have a complete test of his herd carried out will he be facilitated, and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    <P>The Minister's reply read:</P>
    <P>In the case of scheme testing any application from a herdowner to have a test carried out on his herd in advance of the period in which the Department plans to have that herd tested will be favourably considered only where such a test would be compatible with the Department's programme of testing for the area in question or where the <Col N="1728" /> herd is considered to be specifically at risk.  Any herdowner who applies to have a herd test carried out privately will be facilitated unless an official test is imminent.</P>
    <P>There was no word at all about the herdowner who may be seriously concerned about the value of his stock, about the danger of the incidence of TB in those counties I mentioned where there has been a substantial increase.  I believe such herdowners have a right to seek and be given a complete test of herd irrespective of whether it is compatible with the Department's programme of testing for the area.  They are entitled to it and should receive it.</P>
    <P>In most of the areas of cattle production and dairying where there are surpluses one might ask: what are the Department doing to devise some other system, what areas are they examining. Statistical information available in recent weeks shows that a total of 35,171 tonnes of potato chips were imported in 1985. That is the position in recent years even though the Minister of State present was involved in an examination of how imports could be reduced so that what we produced at home would substitute such imports.  We have heard nothing about it.  In fact, in 1985 there was an increase in imports of potatoes from 12,000 tonnes to 15,000 tonnes.</P>
    <P>On 12 March, 1985 I put a question down to the Taoiseach asking him the quantity of yoghurt exported and imported in 1984 when he replied as follows:</P>
    <P>The available information relates to (a) natural yogurt, kephir, curdled milk, whey, buttermilk and other fermented or acidified milk, and (b) prepared yogurt.  The following table gives the information for the period January to October 1984, the latest period for which such data is available.</P>

    <P>The table shows that we imported approximately 64,000 tonnes in that year valued at £144 million.  After all of that we are still importing 35,000 tonnes, this in the current year, two years after we were told of all the efforts being made. Those import levels have not been reduced to the extent we had expected. The same position obtains in many other areas.  For example, the latest statistical returns in respect of cattle herds shows there has been a substantial reduction over the past ten years of a couple of hundred thousand head of cattle.  The Minister should examine and ascertain new areas of production where he foresees a serious curtailment.</P>
    <P>The Minister must examine the milk cessation scheme as it pertains to the Connacht-Ulster region where there is a substantial number of applications, far in excess of the national average.  That is one area in which the Minister should ensure a continuance of milk production and co-operatives.</P>

      <P>I should like to thank all Members for their contributions.  It has been quite a constructive debate.  It is a pity we had not more time because I think there were a number of other Members interested in contributing.</P>
      <P>Deputy Kirk pinpointed the basic difficulty we encounter in this country with regard to agriculture, that is, farm size and quality of soil, particularly in the western half of the country.  At the best of times these prove to be inhibiting factors in the development of agriculture and where farm incomes are concerned. Then when we experience a year like 1985 and another similar one, as we have this year to date, it really aggravates an already very difficult situation.  We have encountered tremendous problems over the past two years.  People have had a difficult time, there is no doubt about that.  There is no point in trying to deny it and, as a result, farm incomes have suffered.  That is a fact of life.  However, we have tried as best we can to assist.  For example, last year we initiated a feed voucher scheme which was of considerable benefit to people.  Unfortunately, when we thought we had succeeded in overcoming the vagaries of the weather, that awful summer of 1985 was followed by probably the most severe spring of all time in early 1986 which caused further extensive difficulties.  All in all, we provided £22 million last year in aid by way of the feed and interest subsidy schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This year we have been fortunate in that we have obtained £15 million from the EC to help farmers in the seriously disadvantaged areas which will be of tremendous value.  Deputy J. Leonard requested that the money be paid out as quickly as possible.  We are endeavouring to do that.  The passing of this Supplementary Estimate will be of considerable help.  I am giving an approximate date but we hope to have about two-thirds of the money paid before Christmas and the remaining one-third early in the New Year.  That is as fast as we can do it.  Therefore, the House <Col N="1731" /> will see that we are doing it with considerable haste.  On average it will mean something in excess of approximately £300 extra per head &mdash; some people will get very little, depending on the number of their stock, and others considerably more.  It will be very beneficial.  I should say that the headage payments this year have increased enormously because of Exchequer assistance, particularly for beef cows in the moderately handicapped areas and because of the assistance we received from the EC in the seriously handicapped areas.  I think it is appreciated that money is going to farmers in these weeks and the balance immediately after Christmas.</P>
    <P>Deputy Noonan asked me about my strategy in the talks in Brussels.  I would be a very poor negotiater were I to divulge my strategy.  The Deputy can be assured that where milk quotas are concerned I will be fighting, as always, to ensure that the interests of our farmers are safeguarded, particularly small farmers. I would not be so dismissive of the importance of prices for milk in Brussels. It is devastating what the Commission can do irrespective of the opinions or views of Ministers.  They have these executive powers which are rather frightening at times.  The House should remember that this year we have had two green currency devaluations which have meant that the price of milk increased in this country by 8p a gallon but because of the delay in payments for products going into intervention, particularly dairy products, the price of milk has been reduced by 6p a gallon.  They have mechanisms by which they can reduce further the price of milk.  We must bear that in mind.  My primary concern is to maintain farm incomes.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the Euroloan. Some people contend it is inadequate.  I was asked by the farming organisations just over a year ago to provide £100 million by way of Euroloans.  To date I have provided £235 million.  I would love to give more &mdash; there is a need for more &mdash; but it is an awful lot of money and it is of considerable benefit when you are <Col N="1732" /> getting money at 5.5 per cent instead of 17 per cent.  I am not totally happy with the lending by the banks in this connection. Farmers should impress upon their banks if they are not getting the loan through the Euro scheme we are operating, that the banks have the facility to lend their money at Euro rates.  They can do it individually.  Farmers who have serious problems and are not getting funds through our Euroloan scheme should insist that the banks raise the money for them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Cooney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £1,752,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1986, for Primary Education, including National School Teachers' Superannuation, etc.</P>
      <P>I am seeking the approval of the House for two Supplementary Estimates, one for £1.752 million for the Vote for primary education and one for £3.142 million for the Vote for post-primary education. The additional sum of £1.752 million sought for Vote 32 for primary education will increase the net Estimate from £379.710 million to £381.462 million.  The additional sum of £3.142 million sought for Vote 33 for post-primary education will increase the net Estimate from £440.629 million to £443.771 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These two Supplementary Estimates will add £4.894 million to the total net <Col N="1733" /> voted provision in the five Votes for which I, as Minister for Education, am responsible.  Expenditure will not exceed the provision by that amount, however. There are offsetting savings in the other Education Votes and the overall variation from the original provision which is anticipated at this time is an excess of only £0.51 million variation of one half of one per cent.  Marginal savings which cannot be individually anticipated may reduce this figure further.</P>
    <P>Of the additional sum sought for primary education, £4.766 million is required for subhead E &mdash; Building, Equipment and Furnishing of National Schools.  This will increase the original provision of £28.23 million to £33 million. The additional funds are required to meet commitments which have to be met in the current year as many projects are ahead of schedule due to factors affecting the construction industry, for example, the exceptionally good weather in the autumn.</P>
    <P>A sum of £43,000 is required for subhead C4 &mdash; £29,000 for subsection (1) Equipment for Special Education, and £14,000 for subsection (4) Library grants, as the grants payable under both these schemes are greater than expected.  A sum of £56,000 is being provided for subhead C.6 &mdash; Aid towards the cost of school books.</P>
    <P>These additional amounts are being offset by saving amounting to £3,113,000 as follows: £2.218 million on subhead C.1 &mdash; Salaries etc. of Teachers; £0.100 million on subhead C.5 &mdash; Capitation Grants towards operating costs of national schools; £0.493 million on subhead D &mdash; Superannuation etc. of Teachers and £0.302 million in subhead F being a surplus of Appropriations-in-aid.</P>
    <P>An additional £520,000 is required on subhead F &mdash; Superannuation of Secondary Teachers as the number of teachers retiring voluntarily, and in respect of whom lump sums are payable, is greater than expected.  Appropriations-in-aid realised will be less than provided for by a net £17.317 million.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1734" /> Receipts from examination fees of students will fall short of the amount provided for by £1.741 million.  This arises because of the implementation of new arrangements whereby fees for the 1987 examinations will be payable in one moiety in 1987 instead of in two moieties, one in 1986 and one in 1987.</P>
    <P>Receipts from the European Social Fund will be less than expected by £15.795 million.  Part of this shortfall results from a lesser take-up than anticipated of places on ESF-aided courses. The major part of the shortfall, however, amounting to some £13.489 million, is due to a delay on the part of the ESF in the making of payments as a result of which moneys expected in 1986 will not be received until 1987.</P>
    <P>These additional amounts are being offset by savings amounting to £14.914 million as follows: £1.655 million in subhead A1 &mdash; Secondary Teachers' Incremental Salary Grant; £10.125 million in A2 &mdash; Annual Grants to Vocational Education Committees; £0.525 million in subhead C &mdash; Grants to Secondary School Authorities; £0.150 million in subhead D1 &mdash; Comprehensive and Community Schools Running Costs; £2 million in subhead G &mdash; Capital for Second-level Schools and for VEC Colleges; £0.024 million in subhead I &mdash; Examinations, and £0.219 million in subhead L &mdash; being a surplus of Appropriations-in-Aid.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I must apologise to the House because I would have to read figures as the Minister did in his speech. Figures are not like speeches &mdash; they have to be very precise.  In Vote 32 &mdash; Primary Education &mdash; under subhead C.1 there is a saving of £2.218 million in teachers' salaries.  I am not quite sure how that came about.  Will the Minister explain the increase in the post-primary section?  Was it because of the number of teachers retiring and, therefore, superannuation increasing?  I am sure the figures balance out somewhere, but how is there a saving of £2.2 million in teachers' salaries when the revised Estimate provided for an increase of only 3 per cent over 1985?  How does the number of £35 million allocated in the interim arrangement fit into that and where have savings been made at primary school teacher level?  Is account taken of the initial payment of the arbitration settlement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under subhead C.5 in Vote 32 there is a saving of £100,000 in capitation grants. This might seem small money but we know the general outcry that arose throughout the country about capitation grants and how difficult boards of management or primary schools are finding it, particularly in inner city or urban areas. Those boards of management have become fund-raising committees for the <Col N="1736" /> upkeep of the schools, for basic requirements such as heating and maintenance of the schools, general decor, the provision of necessary equipment and various other matters.  It is odd that there was a saving there.</P>
    <P>The main item in this Supplementary Estimate is the additional sum of practically £5 million for buildings, extensions, equipment and so on.  The Minister gave a grant scale on the first page of his speech in which he said that the additional funds were required to meet commitments which have to be met in the current year as many projects were ahead of schedule due to factors affecting the construction industry, for example, the exceptionally good weather in the autumn.  That might sound nice and lyrical but the Minister cannot expect us to believe it.  When I spoke on the Estimates last year I pointed out that the capital allowance for expenditure at primary level was not nearly enough.  At that time I queried how the Minister could propose to reduce by £6 million the 1985 figure of £34 million.  Obviously that shortfall has not been sustained because we now have an additional Estimate.  I have no doubt that there was an artificial hold up of sanctions for new school buildings, extensions, improvements and equipment. Due to other commitments the Minister was not in the House recently when both I and Deputy Fitzgerald, questioned the Minister of State, Deputy Enda Kenny, with regard to delays in various primary school sanctions.  The Minister of State said there were approximately 800 projects awaiting approval in the Department. It has probably never happened before that there have been so many delays in granting approvals.</P>
    <P>I put it to the Minister that the Department have been using various tactics in order to delay decisions.  We constantly read in the newspapers about intolerable difficulties being experienced by pupils and teachers who have to use unsuitable, old and unhygenic buildings.  When we asked the Minister of State those questions he was extremely frank about the conditions of some schools and said that in some cases they dated back to the late <Col N="1737" /> nineteenth century and were not at all suitable but that there had been a hold up in granting approvals.  It is quite amusing to consider some of the excuses made by the Department to delay an approval. In some instances the Department hold up the approval because the surveyor wishes to look again as he is not pleased with the first inspection and there is a delay of three months between the initial inspection and the next visit of the surveyor. The next time there will be a delay because of the planning permission.  In Tubberclare in Athlone for instance the people concerned were ready to go ahead with the project when the Department wanted to know if the planning permission was all right.  They were asked to go back to the planning authority to ask if the sanctioned approval of three years ago would stand up to scrutiny now.  Of course the planning authority rushed out a fresh permission.  These are just instances of the delaying tactics used by the Department.  In many of these instances the parochial contribution is already collected and the boards of management have given proof of that collection but still the delays go on.  I do not accept the Minister's grand talk about fine weather.  The school buildings are way behind for sanctions for new buildings and improvements.  That was anticipated by us last spring when we spoke on the Estimates.  Not alone has that been proved right but the amount now allocated will fall far short of what will be needed.</P>
    <P>There is nothing like an imminent general election for concentrating the mind. There is no doubt that the imminence of a general election has concentrated the Government's mind on the need for the allocation of funds particularly at primary school level.  Daily we hear anguished cries from boards of managements and we hear of strikes by students and teachers and of parents who are up in arms because of these delays in sanctioning improvement works.  That 800 projects are awaiting approval in the Department is an alarming statistic.  Deputy Kenny spoke about the unsuitable buildings in which children were being housed.  The <Col N="1738" /> sum being provided for capital works is smaller than that needed.  It is a pity that the huge delays went on all year and that now the excuse is being given that the money is needed because the work in the Department of Education at primary school level is ahead of schedule.  A four year old would not accept that excuse.  It conflicts with the real situation in primary schools.</P>
    <P>A sum of £29,000 is required for equipment for special education.  I welcome that and wish it could be more because as the Minister has said we can never have enough money for this type of education. I hope this small amount will go some way towards redressing the balance in favour of the disadvantaged.  A sum of £14,000 is being provided for library grants and £56,000 is being provided for aid towards the cost of school books. This is a small additional sum but it is indicative of the underlying social environment in which children are reared in that the moneys needed towards schools books is greater than ever.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will enlighten me as to the savings of £2.218 million under subhead C.1 &mdash; salaries of teachers and operating costs of national schools and £0.493 million on superannuation of teachers.  The saving on salaries is puzzling and we would like an answer on it.</P>
    <P>In relation to Vote 33 on post primary education on additional £500,000 is required under subhead F. The Minister mentioned in relation to that, that the number of teachers retiring voluntarily has been greater than expected.  The Minister also said that receipts from examination fees of students would fall short of the amount provided because of a different arrangement.  There is a one moiety payment instead of two.  This matter is raised in the Minister's Estimate.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister is aware of the intolerable burden placed on some parents by the level of examination fees. There is a greater call on the school authorities at post primary level to help the parents of pupils who cannot pay the fees for the intermediate and leaving certificates. These fees have gone up much <Col N="1739" /> more than the cost of living index and, because of the greater number of people out of work and on social welfare, they are unable to meet payments.  There is nothing that parents will not do to help their children's education and they will provide money for it ahead of everything else because they regard schooling as so important.  I do not take every story told to me at its face value but some parents have told me how much they are getting a week and they have asked how can they provide for a hefty fee for State examinations.  I know there is a waiver scheme but it is very narrow in its application. School principals in post primary schools have a small amount of leeway but, in schools run by the religious orders, the nuns or brothers pay examination fees out of their own resources for pupils who cannot afford to pay.  As well as being a burden on parents, additional anguish is caused to pupils who have to tell the teacher collecting the fees that he or she simply cannot afford to pay.  A hard look should be taken at the level of these fees and a broader waiver scheme invoked so that no child is barred from sitting an examination.  Perhaps the Minister will say that no child is barred from sitting an examination because of lack of fees but, nevertheless, the scheme should be examined.  A discretionary fund should be set up for this purpose.</P>
    <P>The sums we have been talking about are relatively small although interesting in their application but the main sum of money is devoted to post primary level. The Minister said that receipts from the European Social Fund will be less than expected, £15.795 million less.  Part of this shortfall results from a lesser than anticipated take up of places on ESF aided courses.  Is this lesser take up because of a lack of places within our third level VEC colleges to which all the ESF funds apply or was there not enough call on the funds for those places?  If there are not enough places in third level institutions, there should be an acceleration of the building programme in relation to RTCs, a matter that has been discussed many times.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1740" /> The Minister also said that the major part of the shortfall, amounting to some £13.489 million, is due to a delay on the part of the ESF in the making of payments as a result of which moneys expected in 1986 will not be received until 1987.  This is a very serious situation which camouflages a major bureaucratic bungle.  The Department of Education failed to collect over £13 million due to them in 1986 from the European Social Fund.  The Minister will probably say that the EC has been tardy in making payments but we have also been tardy in seeking them.  This was caused by the lack of back-up staff in VEC committees and third level institutes who handle ESF moneys.  Their present staff cannot deal with the huge increase of moneys and paperwork necessary to apply the funds. We have always been recognised as good Europeans, sometimes to our disadvantage, but the lack of collection of these moneys is certainly a cause for great concern.  It is even more startling to realise how this shortfall has been met because, if moneys are not paid, the amount must be made up elsewhere.  The Minister said this happened in various ways but I intended to deal with one, the £10.125 million in annual grants to vocational education committees.  I greatly regret that VECs have been singled out for this treatment.  I hope the Minister will be able to explain why we have not got the money from Europe and tell us also if other countries have also been left short of funding.  From my knowledge of the operation of the system of ESF funding, the staff operating the schemes in third level committees and colleges have been at their wits' end to cope with the flood of paperwork relating to this fund.  If the Department see that this is so the embargo on appointing clerical workers should be lifted.  We have not pressed our case for this money and the Department of Education have been left short.  That raises a major question.</P>
    <P>We are only now hearing the reason behind the long delay in informing VECs of their 1986 budgets and of the severe strictures placed on them after they had <Col N="1741" /> incurred their annual costs.  The Department of Education sent harsh letters to VECs informing them that their allocations for spending would have to be revised.  These letters arrived in June when half the working year had elapsed. It was very hard at that stage to produce revised budgets and, after a lot of haggling and many meetings, they received permission to raise the necessary money by way of an overdraft, which is very unsatisfactory.  There are various shortfall savings to which the Minister referred including secondary teachers' incremental salary grants amounting to £1.655 million.  The VEC colleges were further singled out with a saving of £2 million under subhead G.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the two questions which have arisen on the Estimate, and on which I am sure my colleague, Deputy Fitzgerald, will elaborate on further, are first of all the shortfall which was left in the original Estimate for capital works at primary level.  I do not accept the pretext which is being put forward that this is due to capital works in primary schools being ahead of schedule.  There is a huge need for capital works in this area and the need which has been articulated very strongly all over the country.  The second question is the non-receipt of over £13 million which is due to us from the European Social Fund for VEC colleges throughout the country.  This has had to be offset by a reduction of £10 million in the amount of grants available to VECs committees and by a shortfall in the second level system.  I look forward to hearing the Minister's reply.</P>

      <P>Normally, the spokesperson on this side of the House would welcome any additional funds which were made available for education as one would expect these additional funds would be intended to improve services and building programmes and to ensure the delivery of a much better educational service to the students.  If that were the case on this occasion, our attitude would be unambiguously one of welcome.  I have not had a great opportunity to look at the Minister's speech but, as I look at it, I am not so convinced.  I am doubtful and suspect as to the approach to educational provision on an annual basis.</P>
      <P>As my colleague correctly reminded the House, last year on the Estimates debate she pointed out that there was a shortfall of £6 million in the capital programme.  Her words have proved to be quite prophetic.  She recognised that the level of operations in 1985 could not be sustained during 1986.  The additional provisions contained in the Minister's statement today proves that conclusively to the House.  It was quite correct then to state that there was a very serious under-provision to meet the capital requirements in national schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel compelled to refer to the salient points with regard to this Estimate. During the course of Question Time a few weeks ago in this House, both my colleague and I put a number of questions to the Minister of State with regard to the conditions throughout the primary school building programme in the existing primary schools.  What emerged from that question and answer session was a picture of primary schools in certain parts of the country, if not in all, which could <Col N="1743" /> be described as Dickensian.  We were well back into the last century in terms of the type of building and its inappropriateness to meet the educational needs at primary level in the 20th century. As has been stated earlier, the physical conditions in many of these schools were such that if health inspectors were called in they would immediately condemn them as being most unsuitable. In some cases they had to be called in and they condemned them as unsuitable for young children, apart from their serious inadequacies in terms of meeting the conditions to provide a modern educational service today for primary school pupils.</P>
    <P>While the additional sum of £4.766 million provided must be given a guarded welcome, it will not in any significant way go along the road towards addressing the serious problems which could have been addressed by arranging for a reasonably adequate provision in line with 1985, with a marginal increase.  That should have been the bottom line for the capital programme this year but it was not.  In that respect I will have to be equally condemnatory of the overall under-provision.</P>
    <P>I must say I, too, am quite struck by the first paragraph of the Minister's statement on primary education and our spokesperson referred to it.  The Minister in that paragraph said that the additional funds are required to meet commitments which have to be met in the current year as many projects are ahead of schedule due to factors affecting the construction industry.  In Ireland we like to blame the weather for many things and sometimes the farmers do seem to have a certain justification for invoking the weather as one of the&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;enemies of the farming people but I find it difficult to accept that this additional provision can be explained in this way.  Both my senior colleague and I were very critical about <Col N="1744" /> the serious under-provision in the original Estimate.  While we both welcome any capital programme, this seems more like an opportunity to advance programmes at a particularly acute or appropriate time in our political term.</P>
      <P>While we welcome money and additional resources, I am sure most people involved in education, be they teachers, parents, students or people like ourselves who are interested in education, would have preferred that a management programme on the capital side would have been carried out in a more cohesive forward looking way rather than this kind of intimate and what could be regarded as opportunistic additional top-up. If that is not what it is that is fine but it comes across to me in that way.  I am very sceptical and can only give it a guarded welcome.</P>
      <P>While the statement seems to be very clear in some respects I am unable to respond to some of the subheads that have been introduced because I am not too sure where or how savings have been effected.  One that strikes me as odd is in subhead C.5 under the primary section. There was a saving of £.100 million on capitation grants towards operating costs of national schools.  My colleague referred to this and I understand she has had representations about it from every county.  I can only refer to this in a Dublin context.  I am baffled as to how there could be a saving in this area, given the extraordinary and sometimes very stressful burden that has been placed on boards of management to supplement, or in some cases to double, the capitation grant in order to provide a reasonable level of equipment for primary school students.  Almost all the schools on the north side of Dublin are in financial difficulty. I could say with a reasonable degree of authority that not one of them has wasted the resources that have been given to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps there is a simple explanation for the saving.  Maybe there was a specific provision given or a fall-off in the intake of pupils but, as I understand it, the provision under this subhead was totally inadequate.  I am sure the Minister will <Col N="1745" /> agree that schools in disadvantaged areas, while they certainly have the people, do not have the kind of resources necessary to undertake significant voluntary fund-raising in order to supplement limited funds.  They have been particularly badly hit by the capitation grants system over the past number of years.  We meet members of boards of management who do not know what to do about this.  They undertake voluntary fund-raising but find they are unable to make up a shortfall of, in some cases, £30,000.  They say they have exhausted every kind of resource possible but it does not work.  There is very little one can say except to question the provision in the capitation grants system.  The Minister may have some simple answer as to how there could be a saving in this area but it baffles me.</P>
    <P>As regards the post primary sector, I am very interested in the ESF funds.  The Minister referred to a fall-off in take-up of some of the these courses.  My colleague has already asked him to deal with that.  Where does the fault lie?  Does it lie with the Department or with the colleges?  The Minister stated:</P>
    <P>The major part of the shortfall, however, amounting to some £13.489 million, is due to a delay on the part of the ESF in the making of payments as the result of which moneys expected in 1986 will not be received until 1987.</P>
    <P>This is very serious.  It has already been referred to as bureaucratic bungling. There is bungling somewhere if this is the case.  My understanding of the system is that in the main a lot of the work is processed through the VECs.  This work was taken on by the VECs as a result of requests to them to process claims for ESF funds.  Is the Minister aware of the many reports from various committees regarding the difficulties they had in meeting the requirements here?  In the case of the City of Dublin VEC they have approximately 60 centres to deal with and about 38 of them are outside the city VEC.  What we are talking about is the processing of a system of payments which has to be set up for each student.  Daily <Col N="1746" /> records have to be kept, data from the different centres has to be processed, deductions and additions in respect of attendance have to be made and so on. Will the Minister agree that it was crazy for the Department to expect the VECs to take on this work when they were not prepared to accept that there was need for additional administrative staff?  That need has not been recognised.  It is sad to think that if additional staff had been appointed to process these claims, most of the £13.5 million which we are now short of could have been collected.  We could have recouped some of it and there would have been no net expense to the State.  The overall position would have been a gain for this year.  If that is not the position, why?  Where exactly has this very substantial shortfall taken place?</P>
    <P>I come now to the question of where the savings were effected.  Savings were effected with regard to annual grants to VECs.  During Question Time in the House recently it was pointed out that the VECs were very substantially unprovided for, even in relation to their necessary funding last year.  If that is what is being accounted for here, it is sad that has to come about.  As the Minister is well aware, the vocational education schools around Dublin &mdash; and I am sure in many parts of the country &mdash; are providing services, in the main, for the disadvantaged in our community.  In some cases, because of the underprovision, classes in areas particularly involving annual renewable equipment have to be stopped. They will very likely be stopped before the end of this school year.</P>
    <P>I have to ask the Minister to respond with regard to allocations for committees. The system is not satisfactory and is not working very well.  Perhaps there are reasons in the Minister's Department.  Perhaps there are fears there in relation to smoother processing of allocations.  I ask the Minister to look again at the manner in which responses emanate in reply to queries from committees to clarify their precise allocations. I look forward to hearing from him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Cooney)</NameTxt>
      <P>As best I can.  First, I should like to list the questions I have been asked relating to savings on primary teachers, subhead C.1; capitation grants, subhead C.5; the underestimation, so described, in the capital for primary education, a couple of questions in relation to the ESF and then the level of examination fees which was also raised by Deputy O'Rourke.</P>
      <P>The first point I should like to make is that the education budget is in excess of £1 billion, some 18 per cent of GNP.  That is an immence amount of money and we are now coming to the end of the year in which that immense amount of money has to be administered.  As Deputies will realise from my opening statement, when the end of the year comes there will be an excess, it looks at the moment, of just £0.5 million.  It is quite possible that further minor adjustments between now and the end of the year will substantially reduce that sum.  I should like to pay tribute to the efficiency of the administrators of my Department in managing a budget of £1,000 million in a difficult financial year, in a complex area of administration and at the end of the year coming out with an excess of less than £0.5 million, a variation of a half of 1 per cent.  That is good budgeting and good administration.  I should like to say that at the outset.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the specific questions, the savings on primary teachers' pay and capitation grants, subheads C.1 and C.5 are related and both are attributable to the fact that the numbers coming into the primary school system in 1986 were less than budgeted for.  That is the reason.  As the <Col N="1748" /> Deputy will know, the numbers of teachers are related to the numbers of pupils in the system.  The capitation grants are even more directly referable to the numbers in the system.  The numbers that entered were less than anticipated and, consequently, the demand for teachers &mdash; and, therefore, teachers' salaries and capitation grants &mdash; was reduced.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister those numbers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not the precise numbers here.  Deputy Fitzgerald regrets that there should be any saving under the heading of capitation grants having regard to the need for various minor works in schools and he mentioned in particular the disadvantaged areas in this city.  I sympathise with his point of view but we cannot use a saving on capitation grants for some other purpose.  The capitation grant is based specifically on the number of pupils.  What we have done, as the Deputies are aware, is to provide separate funds to the tune of £0.75 million to give special aids to schools in needy areas and to schools needing special help. That sum was paid this year.  There was an increase of some 50 per cent on the amount made available in 1985 which was £0.5 million.  The bulk of that money was payable in Dublin but some was also payable in Cork and Limerick and, I think, Waterford although I stand to be corrected on the last.  This was to ease the position in the type of school about which Deputy Fitzgerald spoke.</P>
      <P>I have to take issue with that Deputy in that he spoke in exaggerated terms about the conditions in our schools and gave the impression that the vast bulk of them are Dickensian and are educational slums.  That is not so.  In fact, a small minority of schools would have acute physical problems in relation to the standard of the buildings but it would be wrong to give an impression that the majority of our school buildings are in poor condition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That leads me on to the next point made by Deputy O'Rourke when she noted the increase provided for in the <Col N="1749" /> capital fund, from £28 million to £33 million.  She implied, or may even have said specifically &mdash; and Deputy Fitzgerald supported her on this &mdash; that the amount originally provided was inadequate.  She made the point when the Estimates were being presented that they were inadequate by the simple measure of comparing what is provided this year with what was provided last year.  What is provided for this year was adequate for the programme that was intended for this year.  That was not any reduction in normal building volume.  The previous year and the year before that there had been enhanced activity.  It was decided that for this year we would revert to the normal rate of building activity.  For reasons which are difficult to define, but there is not doubt that the weather is involved &mdash; Deputy O'Rourke is inclined to be a little sceptical&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Deputy must listen to reality.  I am sure there are about 800 projects around the country but that is an immense figure in terms of capital commitment.  Even to average £200,000 per project, which is probably low, would amount to £160 million.  We are getting into sums of an enormous magnitude and the demands on the Exchequer for sums of that kind have to be controlled and phased.  On this side of the House one says it is controlled phasing, but on the other side one says they are delaying tactics for vile political reasons.  You take your pick.  I am saying that because of the size of the sum being dealt with, the number of projects and the complexities of having the pipeline filled and emptied smoothly we have to approach this carefully. That is the explanation.  It is not a <Col N="1751" /> delaying tactic as such because we have the money.</P>

      <P>An immense amount of work is being done and there are significant and substantial improvements being made in the standards of our schools.  Deputies should remember that the year after next, for the first time in our history, the number of children entering the primary school system will be fewer than for the preceding year.  That puts a big question mark over future development plans of school buildings at all levels.  We are moving away from the present position where we can more or less expect to have threshold national schools.  It will be a big political problem in the future to convince parents that because there is an empty school one and a half miles away, they will have to send their children there and not expect a new school on their doorstep.</P>

I take the point Deputy O'Rourke made that the religious have paid fees, but lay head masters have paid fees for students out of their own pockets, too.  This is a distressing problem when it emerges but it is not a widespread problem.  Nevertheless, if the discretionary fund is too restrictive we can look at it to see if more discretion can be given.</P>
      <P>The last point raised was in relation to the European Social Fund.  Again I have to take issue with the Deputies opposite.

      <P>There was no delay in our application to the fund.  The delay was due to European machinations of a financial or administrative sort&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;I will leave them to explain.  We pressed as hard as we could to get the money, but this is a sensitive area for many reasons.  We had our application in in time and I have no doubt we will be paid as soon as possible, but in the meantime we have to wait until the money comes.  That is the first reason there has been a shortfall.  The delay was not on this side of the Continent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Because that relates to the European Community.  There are considerable budgetary difficulties within the Community.  If the Minister for Agriculture or the Minister for Finance were here he would be able to give Deputies a more detailed run down on that.</P>

      <P>I accept the Minister believes what he is saying, but I feel it could have been pressed much more vigorously.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;through Marlboro' Street or through your local Deputy.  That is not the way Europe works and I hope it never will.  Our application was in in time and the European budget is in some difficulties.  I do not want to say any more than that.</P>
      <P>The other area in which there was a shortfall was because the numbers taking up the places was less than anticipated. It was not lack of places.  The numbers coming forward for the middle level technician and the VTPT courses were down on what was anticipated.  That meant there was a net shortfall in the European Social Fund.  In budgeting for the European Social Fund you budget for a maximum because if there is a drop it will be both in the Exchequer liability and the contribution from Europe.  I think I have covered all the points raised by the Deputies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>That has not been a factor in delaying the claims, but that is getting into a very precise area in relation to <Col N="1754" /> the administration of the VECs which is outside this debate.  I am aware that committees complain they do not have enough staff or administrative back up, but may I conclude on an anecdote which is not typical but has a little warning?  A vocational educational committee not far from where Deputy O'Rourke and I live overspent what was in their budget for travelling and subsistence by about June or July.  They held a meeting in camera and decided to take money from their building funds to cover their travel and subsistence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  Of course, the meeting in camera was really secret but the local paper happily got the information and the committee's irresponsibility was exposed.  I mention that as an anecdote to show that everything is not our fault. We have to be very careful about this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
