      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he considers that the guidelines issued to Ministers and Ministers of State on taking office, regarding involvement in firms in which they or their families have a financial involvement are adequate; and if he will make the guidelines available to Deputies by lodging them in the Dáil Library.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, a Cheann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.  In relation to business interests of members of the Government and Ministers of State the following code has been applied by many administrations over a long number of years:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&mdash;No Minister or Minister of State should engage in any activities that could reasonably be regarded as interfering, or being incompatible, with the full and proper discharge of the duties of office,</P>
      <P>&mdash;Ministers or Ministers of State should not hold company directorships carrying remuneration; even if remuneration is not paid, it would be regarded as undesirable that a Minister or Minister of State should hold a directorship; a resigning director can, however, enter into an agreement with a company under which the company would agree to reappointment as director on the termination of public office,</P>
      <P>&mdash;Ministers or Ministers of State should not carry on a professional practice while holding office but there would be no objection to making arrangements for the maintenance of a practice while holding public office and for return to the practice on ceasing to hold office.</P>
      <P>In case of doubt the Taoiseach should be consulted.  All Ministers and Ministers of State are made aware of these principles on appointment, which I regard as adequate.</P>
      <P>In relation to Members of the Oireachtas who are not office holders, I am arranging to have the question of whether any additional procedures in this regard are desirable raised with the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach indicates in his reply that he considers the guidelines to be adequate.  Can he tell the House whether he considers that if these guidelines are breached that is a matter for dismissal of such a Minister or office holder?  Could he indicate also, as I <Col N="4" /> requested, if there is any reason these guidelines could not be made available to the public by way of placing them either in the Library or the Government Publications Sale Office?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>They are available to the public and on the record now.  The reply to this question will be in the Library.  With regard to the other point, the question of what action a Taoiseach would consider appropriate in respect of any breach of the guidelines, that would be a matter for the Taoiseach of the day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach consider that all of his own Ministers and Ministers of State have abided by the guidelines in both the spirit and the letter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer is &ldquo;yes&rdquo;.  If the answer were otherwise, naturally I would take appropriate action.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to Question No. 2, while referring it to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, does the Taoiseach consider it would be appropriate for Members of the House to divulge the information I referred to in the question?  Will he indicate his own views on the divulging of business interests by all Members of the Oireachtas?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure that is appropriate.  I have reflected on it.  I have mixed views about it and I do not know whether telling the House what they are would add greatly to the enlightenment of anybody.</P>

      <P>I just want to ask something arising out of an answer given by the Taoiseach.  Did I hear him correctly and interpret him correctly when he said in reply to a question by Deputy De Rossa that no member of the present Government or Minister of State has, during the course of this Government, transgressed the guidelines laid down in his reply to Question No. 1?  Did I understand him correctly to say that and, if so, how can he reconcil that with the fact that a Minister of State was removed from office quite recently?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I merely asked if the Taoiseach would, as a matter of courtesy, indicate to me if I heard him correctly when he said in reply to Deputy De Rossa that no Minister or Minister of State under this Government has transgressed the guidelines laid down by him in answer to Question No. 1.  Did he or did he not say that?</P>

      <P>Has the Taoiseach indicated to the House that no member of this Government or Minister of State has transgressed the guidelines which he has outlined to the House?  If that is so, how can he reconcile that with the fact that a Minister of State of this Government was removed from office by the Government?</P>

      <P>I ask respect for the Chair.  We are obviously now about to discuss, in one way or another, something that is the subject matter of a court action.  I have a short statement to make on that later on and I ask the Deputies to leave it until then.  I have ruled these questions out of order.</P>

      <P>I do not wish to go into the area on which you intend to make a statement later on, presumably on the Order of Business.  But the point which Deputy Haughey has raised is important in relation to the answer given by the Taoiseach.  I clearly understood him to say that no member of his Government &mdash; which I understood to mean Ministers of State also &mdash; was in breach of these guidelines.  It would appear that the Taoiseach is not saying that.  I ask him again: does he consider that any Minister or Minister of State has been in breach of the guidelines which he read out today?</P>

      <P>On a point of order, I want to make this point.  Can you, Sir &mdash; and you are an experienced parliamentarian and have visited many parliaments in your capacity as our distinguished Ceann Comhairle &mdash; visualise any democratic Parliament in the world in which a Minister would be removed from office and that Parliament prevents itself from discussing the matter?  That is a straighforward question.</P>

      <P>I have had the great honour of representing this Parliament at a number of Parliaments throughout the world on a number of Continents, and I can honestly and truthfully say that the one message which was brought home to me is the lack of respect shown to this Chair compared with all the other Parliaments that I have visited. That is the one thing that struck me. I may go further now that it has been introduced.  I have noticed that visiting parliamentarians from abroad who have the privilege of sitting in that Gallery are surprised at the bashing this Chair gets. It is a case of &ldquo;us and him&rdquo;.  It should not be that.</P>

I do not know in what way you have come by this information.  But my information is that no statement of claim has been issued in relation to the writs which were due to have been made by last Friday. Therefore, it can be assumed that there is no court case in progress or likely to take place.</P>

      <P>Thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, I shall be very brief.  Neither I nor any of my colleagues has any wish to engage in any sort of personal witch-hunt in this matter.  We have already demonstrated that clearly.  I merely submitted a question in the interest of clarification. As you know, Sir, my question was to ask the Taoiseach to make a statement on all the circumstances surrounding the removal of Deputy E. Collins from his post as a Minister of State.  My question asked no more than that.  It left it entirely up to the Taoiseach as to how much he would wish to say or how far he would wish to go.  I submit, Sir, that that was a perfectly reasonable, legitimate parliamentary device, not involving any transgression of the <i>sub judice</i> rule or anything else.  I want to add to that my suggestion that it is really reducing this Parliament to total incompetence if &mdash; for whatever reason a Minister of State is removed from office &mdash; Members of this House, cannot question the Taoiseach of the day about such removal.  I do not think there is any other democratic parliament anywhere in the world which would place such an inhibition and prohibition on itself.</P>

      <P>I suggest it is reducing our affairs here and our status as a Parliament to an unbelievably negative role if we are to accept that position.  I believe that the matter now transcends any behaviour of Deputy E. Collins &mdash; and I am not for one moment making any accusation whatever in regard to any possible breach of these guidelines by Deputy E. Collins, because I do not know.  I believe the matter now transcends that aspect.  It concerns the Taoiseach: it concerns the Taoiseach's statement in this House as to whether that statement misled the House deliberately or inadvertently.  It also concerns whether or not the Taoiseach neglected his duties, as head of Government, by being inactive in this matter over a long period.  Thank you, Sir.</P>

      <P>As you know, Sir, from the seven questions which have been ruled out of order my concern in this matter relates exclusively to the manner in which the Taoiseach dealt with the question I raised here in February of this year, whether the replies given at that time were accurate and what investigation the Taoiseach pursued in order to provide the information requested by me for the House.  It seems to me that the interpretation being placed on the <i>sub judice</i> rule is extremely wide.</P>

      <P>I am sorry, Deputy.  If I were to allow every decision that I made here to be questioned and argued on the floor there would never be an end to anything.  I cannot allow that. There are ways of doing that.  As a matter <Col N="12" /> of fact I should say that the Chair deprecates &mdash; in the interests of the Chair &mdash; the dragging of the Chair into public controversy through the media.</P>

      <P>That is the nub of the problem.  It would seem that any person &mdash; and I am not referring to any particular Deputy in the House &mdash; who chooses to avoid having matters raised in this House simply has to issue a writ against somebody or other and leave it there.  Therefore, this House cannot discuss matters which are of relevance to this House, not of relevance outside it.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not wish in any way to be disrespectful to the Chair.  I fully accept the Chair's rulings but I should like to say that when I received the ruling with regard to the questions I found myself in a very invidious position because I wished to clarify a statement I made in this House on 11 February last. In the light of that I submitted to you, Sir, that I wished to make a personal statement.  It was my intention that the statement &mdash; as far as I could judge &mdash; would avoid any breach of the <i>sub judice</i> rule and, indeed for that reason, it would have had to be somewhat limited.  You ruled it out of order and I fully understand why you did so but I have to say that inevitably, from my point of view, <Col N="13" /> it leaves me in a difficult and invidious position when I had wished to make a personal statement.  I hope the House will appreciate the difficulty in which I have been placed.  We all appreciate, Sir, the difficulty in which you are placed &mdash; I have the greatest respect for your judgment in the matter &mdash; but I felt that at least I ought to make that point at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the House to let me explain briefly.  It is not usual for the Chair to explain his rulings but I feel that this is one occasion, having regard to the amount of publicity it has received, that I should explain.  The purpose of the <i>sub judice</i> rule, which has operated in this House for over 60 years, is to protect litigants, plaintiffs and defendants, and ensure that actions coming before the courts are not prejudiced by being discussed in this House which enjoys absolute privilege.  If the rule were to be ignored, the House used as a sort of a pre-trial forum or as an alternative for other court procedures &mdash; I have in mind interrogatories and discovery &mdash; in my opinion it would undermine our system of justice, bring about unfair judgments, and influence unfairly tribunals, judges and juries.</P>
      <P>I have carefully considered the position of the questions regarding the removal of Deputy E. Collins from the position of Minister of State.  A plenary summons for libel has been issued in the High Court.  An appearance has been entered thereto.  In the ordinary course the case would come on for hearing before a judge and jury.  I am satisfied that the subject matter of each question which is allowed will figure in the hearing of the action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy De Rossa mentioned the statement of claim.  It is not unusual &mdash; as a matter of fact it is quite usual &mdash; that the statement of claim does not arrive until some time after the plenary summons has been issued and served.  I am therefore clearly of the opinion that, in accordance with long standing and well established practice, the rule applies to those questions and I would be guilty of <Col N="14" /> a grave dereliction of my duty if I did not apply it.  What I am going to say now, in my opinion, goes to the core of the matter, and it is very important because the impression seems to have been given that this House is being muzzled by some individual or by some outside influence. It is very important therefore that it should be noted that this House has complete control over its own procedures.  It can abolish the application of the <i>sub judice</i> rule or it can modify it.  If everybody feels like that, this can be done in a very short time.  If the House did so, I would be only too glad to operate the new procedure, but it is less than fair to the Chair, and it is not reasonable to hand the Chair a group of Standing Orders and a well defined code of practice and then expect him to ignore them.  I regret that I am not prepared to do that.</P>
    <P>Finally, in accordance with the same authority and the same practice the Chair's ruling cannot be questioned except by way of a formal notice of motion.  I seriously ask the House to accept that I am acting in good faith.  I have not been approached by anybody nor have I approached anybody.  As Deputy Haughey said, I have long experience in this House and I have even more experience as a reasonably busy practitioner in the law.  I am acting in good faith and I believe that what I am doing is in the interest of the litigants in this case and, perhaps more important, in the interest of litigants who will come after.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully accept that you are acting in good faith and I hope nothing I have said would indicate otherwise. I realise you are wrestling with the very difficult matter &mdash; the need to enable our courts to operate properly &mdash; in fairness to all parties coming before them so that no litigant or defendant would be prejudiced in any way by anything that might happen here.  I can see your problem in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other difficulty that presents itself to us, and I am sure to yourself is, given the desirability of adhering to the <i>sub judice</i> precedent, how can the House, the Taoiseach, myself, or any Deputy, <Col N="15" /> discuss this very important matter?  I accept that you are presented with a very real difficulty and that you would wish the House to be able to explore this matter, as all Deputies and the public would want it to be explored, but I want to make two points in regard to the dilemma facing you.</P>
    <P>First, we are dealing here with the removal of a Minister of State from office.  The fact that this has happened removes this matter way outside the normal legal parameters and makes it very much a political matter which should and must be dealt with in this House. Secondly, so far as I am concerned, I am not anxious to discuss the behaviour of Deputy Eddie Collins as a Minister of State.  I do not like this House to be forced into that sort of situation because I have had enough bruising experiences of that myself from time to time.  I do not like it when this House sits in judgment on Members of the House.</P>
    <P>My question would have nothing to do with that aspect but would concentrate exclusively on the jurisdiction of the Taoiseach and the manner in which he discharged his responsibilities as Head of the Government.  I suggest, Sir, that if you let my question go, or if you let me raise it in some way tomorrow, I will confine my remarks entirely to aspects of the matter which would not in any way prejudice any legal action which might take place.  I am concerned that the Taoiseach may have misled the House, advertently or inadvertently, and I am concerned that the Taoiseach was inactive in his duties as Head of the Government over a long period.  They are the aspects I would have wished to raise and I think I could have done so under your guidance without in any way infringing a <i>sub judice</i> rule.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand Deputy Haughey's difficulties.  Any political difficulties that exist in this House can be resolved by the House within the machinery available.  If I were to breach the <i>sub judice</i> rule as I understand it, I might be doing damage to people outside <Col N="16" /> over whom I have no control by allowing this matter to be discussed in this House which has absolute privilege.  That is my difficulty.  I repeat that this House can remove any barriers and that there is nobody muzzling the House but the House itself.</P>

However, unlike Deputy Haughey, I consider that the underlying issues in the questions I raised and the manner in which the Taoiseach has dealt with them concerns other Ministers.

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach in view of his reported comments in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of 18 September that some decisions made by the health boards were pretty perverse, if he will elaborate on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Non-capital allocations from the Exchequer to the health boards in respect of their direct expenditure have increased from £665 million in 1982 to a proposed £827 million in 1986.  This represents an increase of £162 million or 24 per cent over that period.  The 1986 allocation of £827 million (which is subject to further adjustment) is an increase of over £81 million or 8 per cent on the corresponding 1985 provision in a year in which inflation has risen by 3½ per cent. Because expenditure on health services accounts for such a high proportion of Government expenditure, accounting for over 19 per cent of non-capital expenditure in 1985 and because successive Governments have been spending in this area more than the capacity of the economy can sustain, it is essential that the health services share in the efforts of the Government to secure a more effective and efficient delivery of services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad that the health boards generally have co-operated fully with the Government in securing reductions in the costs at which essential health services <Col N="19" /> can be delivered.  They realise, as the Government and objective informed opinion realises, that limitations on financial resources call for the most effective and efficient use of these resources. They have generally faced up realistically to deciding how their expenditure should be maintained within the 1986 allocation while maintaining essential services.  In some cases, however, health boards undoubtedly have tended to highlight their financial problems unduly in an effort to secure increased allocations of Exchequer finance.  I have no desire to prolong controversy or to give any credibility to these cases by referring to specific examples here but Deputies on all sides will be aware of the type of cases to which I am referring.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware of the anxiety caused by his statement that petty perverse decisions were made by the health boards?  Does he accept that it was intemperate language for the head of State to use?  Does the Taoiseach further accept that the real problem facing the health boards is the deficit of £30 million as a result of insufficient funding by him and the Government?  I am also concerned about administering the health boards by edict, when a Minister states in the House that eight hospitals will be closed down without consulting the health boards.  When the Taoiseach quoted figures, did he realise that there is no dental or optician service for adults?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy misquoted me.  When I spoke as head of Government &mdash; not head of State &mdash; I said that some decisions seemed pretty perverse, not petty perverse.  With regard to the inadequacy of resources, I pointed out that the amount provided for health boards this year is an increase of 8 per cent on last year, in a year in which inflation has risen by 3½ per cent.  Simple arithmetic will show that this involves a 4½ per cent increase in the real value and volume of resources to health boards. That is a very significant increase in a year of extreme financial difficulty.  Some <Col N="20" /> people might even regard it as an imprudent level of increase in present financial circumstances.  The Government, in endeavouring to help the health boards, provided them with that increase in the volume of resources, going well beyond the level of inflation.  It is a matter for health boards to use those extra resources to the best of their ability and for the best purposes.  Most of them have tried to do so in good faith although there have been problems in some areas and Deputies are well aware of them.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to particularise and induce further conflict in the area.  During the course of the year most health boards did a very good job and those who did not tackle the problem in a positive way in the earlier part of the year have come to realise the desirability of taking a more positive view because of the increased resources which the Government have provided.  The problem may resolve itself if left alone, I have no desire to stir it up by criticising any particular health board.</P>

      <P>I made it clear that I indicated to the Government that membership of an organisation, participation of which is by policy not a matter of public knowledge should be of concern to any Government.  The public are entitled to know if a member of a government is a member of an organisation which by policy keep their membership secret.  Certainly, members of the Government should not be members of such organisations.  That, of course, is not true of either the Trilateral or Bilderberg Commission, both of whom publish their reports and membership every year.

My concern, quite simply, is to ensure that the business of Government is carried on in a manner that would command the confidence of the public. For that purpose, it is important that no member of the Government should be a member of an organisation, membership of which is by policy kept secret or not <Col N="22" /> allowed to be public knowledge.  That would be against the public interest. After that, it is a matter for people to decide whether in relation to any organisation it falls into that category.  I cannot know.

      <P>I agree that it is somewhat extraordinary that I have been able to arrive at the right conclusion in view of some of the things the Taoiseach has said.  May I direct his attention to the fact that he is quoted in a book called &ldquo;In Civil Wars&rdquo; as saying that Articles 2 and 3 of our Constitution were an implicit claim of our Government and parliament to exercise jurisdiction over the whole of Ireland, including Northern Ireland, and that that represents a stumbling block to progress.</P>

      <P>First of all, I could not verify the quotation.  I do not recognise the exact phraseology.  I have never made any statement to the fact that it was unfortunate those Articles were included in that form in the Constitution.  My own view is that it would be better if they were not there in their present form.  I recognise that their reformulation would be advantageous, a conclusion reached unanimously by a Dáil committee in respect of Article 2 in 1967, with the full support of the Fianna Fáil Party.  So, I am not alone in having doubts about these Articles but I recognise that it would not be of advantage to the country to initiate any move of this kind in the present circumstances on the grounds that it could be divisive and damaging to the immediate situation in our State.</P>

      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether in the light of recent developments he now wishes to revise his prediction to the Irish Management Institute on 13 May 1986, that we are facing an environment of lower interest rates with long term interest rates likely to fall somewhat further and short term interest rates falling considerably further.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On 13 May 1986, the prime overdraft rate of the associated banks stood at 12½ per cent having fallen from 15½ per cent since early April.  In line with the improving outlook for inflation and for the current balance of payments deficit, the associated banks prime overdraft rate fell further to 11¼ per cent between 21 and 23 May and to 10 per cent around mid-June, its lowest level since 1978 at which it remained for several months until mid-October.  These moves towards lower interest rates, which I predicted on 13 May, have recently been interrupted by speculative outflows from the economy, a particularly disappointing development in the light of the continued sharp fall in inflation and the improvement in the <Col N="25" /> current balance of payments deficit.  But the measures announced in the Government statement of 16 October 1986, have led to an easing on interbank rates by up to 1¼ percentage points, up to lunchtime today, and to a considerable improvement in market sentiment.  I am confident that when the present temporary problems are resolved there will be scope to resume the earlier downward movement of interest rates.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will clarify and justify the recent <Col N="26" /> remarks on Irish workers made by him at Carlow Regional Technical College.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In my discussions with staff and students at the regional technical college in Carlow on 3 October I mentioned a number of areas where improvements are needed in order to provide better conditions for the creation of employment in this country.  Absenteeism and redundancy payments were among the matters on which I made comment.</P>
      <P>The thrust of my remarks about absenteeism was that absenteeism rates in Ireland are too high.  In a situation where we are competing against other countries for scarce, mobile international investment it is essential that we aim to create conditions attractive to such investment. High absenteeism rates are a constraint to attracting such investment.  Possibly more importantly, they are a constraint to achieving the higher levels of output growth in indigenous Irish industry which is a major objective of the Government's industrial policies.  High absenteeism rates form a problem which we share with many other developed countries.  Our objective, however, must be to do better than competitor countries in this and in other areas that effect our competitiveness. If Irish industry is to be competitive on home and world markets absenteeism must be reduced to the absolute minimum.</P>
      <P>My remarks have been interpreted in some quarters as being an attack on Irish workers.  This is, of course, a completely erroneous interpretation.  The Government, on taking office, established a ministerial task force to examine how absenteeism could be reduced and came very firmly to the conclusion that the control of absenteeism is primarily a management responsibility best tackled at the level of the individual firm.  I am sure the Deputy will agree with me on this point, which I have made repeatedly whenever I have had occasion to address this subject.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the FUE, IMI and IPC provide consultancy services to firms to help them reduce absenteeism the take-up level of <Col N="27" /> these services has been disappointing. The Government have now asked the IPC to take a lead role in designing a comprehensive programme to bring home to firms the importance of taking positive measures to control absenteeism and the elements that might be included in such a control programme.</P>
    <P>In Carlow I also mentioned the fact that some workers welcome the opportunity which the closure of firms sometimes provides for generous redundancy payments.  This clearly is a preserse and unintended outcome of our system of redundancy protection measures which should not be encouraged or condoned. The result of this position has been that workers, in a potential closure situation where generous redundancy settlements are available may in some instances opt for a closure involving such settlements rather than seek to take action which will maintain ongoing employment in the firm.  My remarks were intended to point out the reservations shared by many people about such behaviour which is not in the interests of workers generally in a situation where employment opportunities fall far short of our requirements.</P>
    <P>My remarks at Carlow were made with the intent of directing attention to factors which may be operating to deprive workers of greater employment opportunities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Lest it goes by default in the House I should like to say that on this side of the House we reject completely the Taoiseach's intemperate attack on the quality of Irish workers and particularly his suggestion that they would prefer to take redundancy payments rather than retain their jobs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Energy (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>The original financial package for Dublin Gas Company which received full publicity at the time comprised bank loans of £60 million; loan stocks of £10 million and suppliers credit of £10 million.  State support consisted of a £17 million loan plus £6 million stand by facility, with £41 million in 1981 values, in conversion and <Col N="29" /> development rebates and a conversion loan of up to £11.6 million.  The actual position showing the variance with the base case, up to the appointment of the receiver, is set out in the sources and application of funds table and notes which I propose to circulate to Deputies.</P>
      <P>As regards the losses on this project it will not be possible to give final figures until decisions are taken on write offs of assets and claims and until revised accounting concepts are adopted appropriate to the then state of the business.</P>
      <P>I am not quite clear what the Deputy has in mind by the expression, &ldquo;the cost of receivership&rdquo;.  The receivership is intended to have a net benefit rather than a net cost and the Government would not have embarked upon it otherwise.  The results already achieved in improving the efficiency of the company and giving them the prospect of a viable future demonstrate that the Government's view on this subject was well founded.  We expect, with the co-operation of the management and workforce, to achieve our aims of maintaining gas supplies to the gas consumers of Dublin, preserving jobs at Dublin Gas Company, and putting that company back on the rails again.  No loan guarantees or letters of comfort have been issued to the banks.  I issued a letter to the banks setting out the Government's intentions relating to Dublin Gas including its early nationalisation.</P>

      <P>I did not interrupt the Deputy.  I have answered the question put to me.  The Deputy is well aware, as I am, of the difficulties in relation to the banks on the appointment of the receiver by BGE.  Negotiations and discussions took place with the banks over a considerable period and agreements were reached in relation to the re-funding of the Dublin Gas Company.  The Deputy's question related to the content of the letters and I am satisfied to stand over the statement I made at that time &mdash; it has been repeated on numerous occasions since &mdash; that the letters issued to the banks were not loan guarantees or letters of comfort.  The Deputy will be aware that in years past guarantees or letters of comfort were given by the State guaranteeing repayment of loans irrespective of whether the project continued or otherwise.  That is not the position in regard to the Dublin Gas Company.</P>

      <P>I do not recollect what letters were accepted or received by the banks.  The important point at issue is whether the letter was issued.  I am aware that negotiations and discussions at that time lasted about two weeks.  They concerned the future financing of the project and its viability.  At the time my concern was to ensure that the Dublin Gas Company would continue to operate, that gas consumers in Dublin would continue to receive a supply of gas and that as many jobs as possible were preserved.  That is what I set out to do and I am well on the way to achieving that.</P>

The receiver has made public quite a lot of information about the implementation of the policy he is taking in relation to Dublin Gas.  As soon as I have the concrete figures I will have no hesitation whatever in coming before this House and presenting the figures.</P>

      <P>I am informed by BGE that the nature of this question is such <Col N="34" /> that if it were to be answered comprehensively a considerable expenditure of time and money by the receiver would be required.  This would add to the costs of the receivership.  The Deputy will be aware that since his question was put down I have made publicly available certain information on these matters and perhaps his requirements have now been satisfied.  If not, I am quite prepared to endeavour to answer realistic follow-up questions which do not involve a cost disproportionate to the results achieved and which can rightly be regarded as relating to matters of public concern.  Perhaps the Deputy would reconsider his question in the light of this information. I think it only right to say that as at present worded the question would pose great difficulties in this regard.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I am amazed, as everybody will be, at the Minister's reply.  Is he aware of the grave public concern about matters in the public arena?  He comes in here with a lame duck excuse. While hundreds of millions have been squandered, he is not prepared to spend the few pounds required to give the public the information they deserve.  Is he not prepared to do that?</P>

Perhaps he could give me details of any further information he requires.  I would also point out that it has been the policy undertaken by all Governments since the foundation of the State not to pursue the <Col N="35" /> answer to a question where the cost of discovering the reply is disproportionate to the public's interest in the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to protest in the name of the general public at the incredible attempt to side-step an issue of grave public concern.  If the Minister is interested in the public concern which exists, will he consider giving Government time for a full flush out of all the bad smells coming from that place?  How can any Government with any credibility walk out into the public arena having put together a deal costing the taxpayer £600,000 and not be prepared to come into this House and give details about when it was done?  If the Minister will not accept an invitation to debate this question in this House, I give notice that I will call for a public sworn inquiry into the affairs of Dublin Gas so that the public will learn the truth about what is happening behind closed doors.  The Minister is prepared to cover it up.  It is inexcusable for a Minister who has responsibility for Dublin Gas to say that he could not give the information.  I am serving notice on this House that I will call for a full sworn inquiry into this matter.</P>

He was highly respected and it would not be going too far to say that genuinely he was one of nature's gentlemen.  Cathal himself had been elected in a by-election in 1983 following upon the tragic death of his brother Clement.

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>This commitment was reflected in their work rate, in Dáil speeches and questions and their contributions to our own party debates.  I deeply regret the decision of the Taoiseach and the Government to deny the people of Donegal their constitutional right to full parliamentary representation and to elect a worthy successor to Cathal Coughlan.  By this decision, they are also flouting the rights of Dáil Éireann to full representation.  The wishes of the people of Donegal South-West were shown in the general election of 1982 and in the by-election of 1983.  Their wish is that their representation in this House would consist of two Opposition Deputies and one Government Deputy.  This is particularly important at a time when the Government are in such a tight voting situation in this House.</P>
      <P>Donegal south-west is a far flung constituency with a population of approximately 65,000.  It is at present represented by only two Members, including Deputy Pat the Cope Gallagher, and despite their best efforts they cannot possibly be expected to carry out the duties of a full complement of Deputies. Minister of State O'Brien, in denying the people of Donegal their rights, said that the two Deputies are looking after the constituency very well and that is enough.  The Constitution says that they are entitled to full representation.  Full representation means three Members.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State spoke about the precedent in Tipperary. I remind him that not only was there a contribution by the Taoiseach at the time but also by the present Taoiseach, Dr. FitzGerald.  The writ was moved by Deputy Noel Browne.  The Taoiseach, Dr. FitzGerald, stated in the Official Report in volume 326, columns 1465-1466 stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nevertheless, when Deputy Browne moved the writ we determined to support it and the grounds he gave for <Col N="271" /> moving it were certainly cogent. Everything other than the question of practice and procedure were in favour of the action he took.  In the face of the compelling case he made&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>The compelling case was mainly with regard to the lack of numbers in regard to members.</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;it seems right to us to support it in the hope that we might influence the Taoiseach towards the broader decision in relation to a general election.</P>
    <P>If that was true in February 1981, how much truer is it today?  The Taoiseach said again and again that he intends to run his full term in this House.  He and his Fine Gael Ministers went to great length at their Ard Fheis at the weekend to emphasise that they intend to continue in office until November 1987.  By opposing this writ the Taoiseach is condemning the people of Donegal south-west to an inadequate Dáil representation for up to a period of 18 months.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach talks a lot about the need for Dáil reform and preaches the supremacy of the ballot box.  In opposing this by-election writ, it is just one more example where he will be judged by his actions rather than his words.  It is not the only occasion he has ducked an election. He postponed the local elections of 1984 under the guise of introducing local government reform.</P>

      <P>We never saw that local government reform.  He had to hold the election in 1985 and of course, the Government were thrashed nationally.  I suggest to the Taoiseach that we still have not got the local government reform that was promised as the reason for the postponement of the 1984 local elections.  The Taoiseach will be thrashed nationally when the opportunity arises.  The people are crying out for a general election.  This was clearly shown by the IMS <i>Sunday Independent</i> poll at the weekend.  It <Col N="272" /> showed that satisfaction with this Taoiseach and this Government is in the region of 20 per cent in October 1986.  The rate of dissatisfaction with this Government and this Taoiseach is 73 per cent.  They want a change of Government.  Apparently this Government will try to hold on but the people want them out.  Disregarding the opinion polls, does any Member of this House ever remember the number of protest groups to the same extent as we have outside the gates of Leinster House today?  I am here in this House since 1973 and never in my time did I see such a varied group protesting against this Government.  Disregarding that element, the overwhelming wish of the people of this country is for a general election, whether it is the bankers who refuse to loan money to the Government, and who can blame them with a current budget deficit of £1,500 million, the highest in the history of this country, whether it is the unemployed who number 250,000, the hundred thousand who have emigrated since this Government came into power, the housewives who are facing another mortgage increase of 2 per cent or more who see their sons and daughters emigrate &mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash; whether it is the old, the sick or the farmers whose plight is sneered at by the Minister for Agriculture. Who will ever forget his interview in Clifden when he sneered at the GAA, the Church and the farmers?  This country needs a general election to give the people some confidence for the future.  If they are to be denied a general election, as the Government apparently intend to do, why deny the people of Donegal south-west their opportunity and their right to express themselves in a by-election?  This vote is not a matter of confidence which would defeat the Government.  That motion will be debated later this afternoon.  Consequently, I make a special and sincere plea to Deputies on the other side of the House, both Fine Gael and Labour, who <Col N="273" /> oppose this Taoiseach and his Government as we have seen in their statements throughout the summer, and who are being used on this occasion by the Taoiseach and his Ministers to deny the people of Donegal south-west their democratic rights.  I say to them: join us on this vote on this motion.  I have a reason for making that plea.</P>
      <P>In the debate of 11 February 1981 Deputy Oliver J. Flanagan who I am glad is present today, a man who has long had respect for the institution of the Dáil and for everything the Dáil stands for, made an eloquent plea about the problems of the people of Tipperary north.  He said that the constituency was represented by only two Members as is the case in Donegal south-west at the moment and it seems will be the case for the next 18 months.  At the time Deputy Flanagan made the case very strongly that constituents in Tipperary north were coming to his constituency and asking him to make representations on their behalf.  He recognised it was impossible for two Members to represent a constituency which should have three Members.  The people deserved better.  Other long-serving Members who have respect for the traditions of this House would not wish to deny the people of Donegal south-west the opportunity and the right to full constitutional parliamentary representation. I say to those Deputies, why should you allow yourselves to be used by this Taoiseach and his Ministers when their only interest is to retain power for power's sake and why should you be party to such disreputable tactics?</P>
      <P>The people of Donegal South-West are being treated in cavalier fashion by this Government, something which I have no doubt will not be forgotten by them when the inevitable general election comes. As the President of the United States recently stated on another matter &mdash; it is equally appropriate to the Taoiseach and the Government &mdash; you can run but you cannot hide.  On this occasion the Taoiseach might win this vote but he will eventually have to face the wrath of the Irish people in Donegal South-West and nationally.</P>

Deputy Burke is fooling nobody.  When his party were in Government no party played the political game better than they did.  They taught us how to play the game, and it is no credit to any of us in private life that we should not be able to fill a vacancy in a by-election without the political manoeuvring that goes on between political parties, and we are all guilty of it. However, Deputy Burke let the cat out of the bag.  He is no more interested in the by-election in Donegal than the Shah of Iran-Persia.</P>

The sincerity of the words in his opening remarks fools nobody.  It may fool those people in the public gallery who have come in for the first time to listen to what goes on here but it does not fool anyone who has served time here and watched the political manoeuvring that goes on. Deputy Burke was really saying, &ldquo;Let us have a by-election in Donegal but let us get into a general election position.&rdquo; He will get a general election whenever it comes and as his leader says, the opinion <Col N="275" /> polls do not always reflect the views of the ballot box.</P>
      <P>We are not talking about a general election here today.  We are talking about a by-election, and I have a point of view. Deputy Burke said that Clement Coughlan and Cathal Coughlan were his colleagues, but they were colleagues of mine also and probably I thought a great more of them than Deputy Burke did.</P>

      <P>I am saying that I thought highly of those two young boys and Deputy Burke thought no more highly of them than I did.  I got to know them very well as colleagues in this House, as colleagues on Donegal County Council, and I shared the grief of everyone in this House when both lost their lives in tragic circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us look at the record of two brothers. They were both elected to the 24th Dáil.  Neither of them completed the term.  Is it a credit to any Member of this House, whether in Opposition or in Government, that we should stop the cooption of a member of that family to complete the term of office?  If I believed that I should support that, then I would do so, but I am not prepared to step out of line to accommodate the Fianna Fáil Party to play the political game.  I know the Coughlan family probably better than many other people in this House and I would like to be able to say to the present Government, &ldquo;Let us by agreement, constitution or convention, stop this political manoeuvring that goes on at by-election times.&rdquo; Clement Coughlan was elected <Col N="276" /> in a by-election in 1980 over the entire county with a massive vote.  In the general election six months later he topped the poll.  Within six months he fought another general election.  The by-election was fought six months later and his brother was elected.  Two brothers inside 18 months fought four major elections, and we mature Members of Parliament argue about how we should co-opt or fill the vacancy.  Maybe the tragedy of these two young men should force a Government in office and the leaders of the Opposition parties to work out some convention whereby vacancies can be filled without by-elections being fought.</P>
    <P>Let us look around.  For example, in the US Senate and US Congress when someone dies the governor of the state nominates someone to complete the term.  In the US, one of the biggest nations in the world, they agree on that, but we cannot.  Usually the governor looks at the family of the deceased member.  He is not obliged to select someone from that family but generally he does.  He is obliged to look at the political party, of the deceased member and he is expected to pick someone from that party.  He does not have to do so but generally he does.  Surely that is an example of maturity.  Stop the quibbling and the political manoeuvring and playacting which Deputy Burke is guilty of and let us for once be sensible and mature in our approach to these things.</P>
    <P>I know that this Government cannot acknowledge what I am saying at the moment, nor would I expect them to do so, but I want to put on record the feelings of the Fine Gael Party in County Donegal. The feeling of the Fine Gael Party in County Donegal in view of the tragedy of the two Coughlan brothers is that if it is at all possible to accommodate the young girl who is going to be the candidate in the next general election let her be co-opted.  That would be the sincere wish of every member of the Fine Gael Party.  However, when you talk it out then you realise that that would not fit in with the political game, it would not be in accordance with the practice of the political game that operates at the <Col N="277" /> moment.  When the chips are down we all belong to a political party and we toe the political line.</P>
    <P>I will be supporting the Government on this issue but in supporting them I hope the Taoiseach will take note of the fact that this type of situation which arises from time to time is of no credit to any of us.  I hope that the Leader of the Opposition will acknowledge the same.  It is not beyond the bounds of reason that both of them could agree that in future when a Member dies the political party who elected that person to this House will have the option of filling the vacancy.</P>
    <P>Before this debate I felt that I could be quiet and just vote with the Government and not let my views be known, but I talked to a few people in the county and they felt that I should express the views which I have just put before the House. They are the views of Fine Gael people in County Donegal who have sympathy for the Coughlan family in their tragedy. It is without precedent in this Parliament that two brothers should be elected to the one Dáil and neither of them be allowed to complete the full term.  The tragedy of that spells out to all of us that we cannot continue to ignore the filling of vacancies in this House.  If any family have won the right to nominate someone to complete a term of office surely that family have done it.  There is no good in the Fianna Fáil Party shedding crocodile tears and saying that the facts are here, acknowledge them and follow the lead that Deputy Burke has just set and vote for them on this occasion.  When Fianna Fáil were in power they were no credit to themselves or to this House in the way they manipulated the situation.  They have been guilty of wrecking the Month's Mind and paying disrespect to the deceased Deputy, and of having a general election sooner than it should have been held because they wanted to take advantage of the political ploy.  They have also been guilty of postponing a general election when it should have been held.  We have played the same game.  It is the politics that we operate.  We are all guilty in this and it is no credit to us.  After the next general election or maybe before it is <Col N="278" /> held surely there should be a convention between Opposition and Government so that we will have a way of filling that vacancy which will be a credit to this Parliament, rather than the political manoeuvring and haggling that occurs when a Member dies.</P>

      <P>I, together with every other Member of this House, deeply regret the circumstances which have brought about the moving of this writ today.  The Government should not take away the democratic and moral right of the people of my constituency to have this vacancy filled.  The late Deputy Cathal Coughlan and also the late Deputy Clem Coughlan, both elected to the 24th Dáil, were I suppose the hardest working Members ever elected to this House.  It is wrong to suggest that both myself and my constituency colleague, Deputy McGinley, could give the people of that constituency the service to which they are accustomed. We have tried to do our utmost in the interim period.  But the people of my constituency have been affected adversely as a result of having no third Deputy there.  The best efforts of Deputy McGinley and I are just not sufficient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the surface it would appear that the by-election would affect south-west <Col N="279" /> Donegal only.  But it has much greater implications for the country as a whole. I am surprised at Deputy Harte referring to political games.  The fact is that if this by-election is held the Government will find themselves in a minority.  That is the only reason the Government are opposing this.  The people of my constituency will reflect the views of the rest of the country and prove the opinion polls wrong, prove that there will be 60 per cent in favour of Fianna Fáil and not 53 per cent.  That is the only reason they are opposing this writ here today, and it is morally and democratically wrong that they should do so.  They are doing this for their own selfish political purposes at the expense of my constituents.  The reasons put forward by the Government Chief Whip are not the real reasons.  The real reason is that the Government know that their performance of the past four years will be put to the test.  When we got an opportunity back in 1983 when this Government were only a short time in Government, the people of Donegal south-west were wise at that early stage and gave a negative result to this Government. And they would do it again this time in a very emphatic fashion.</P>
    <P>It comes as no surprise to me that the Government are abdicating their responsibility in the matter of affording the people of my constituency an opportunity to fill that vacancy.  They know only too well that the wise electorate of Donegal South-West will, in no uncertain terms, tell the Government that they are living on borrowed time.  The voters of that constituency will give the Government their answer.  I hope that before the end of this debate good sense will prevail and the Government might not oppose this, or indeed some wise Deputies might vote against it or at least abstain.</P>
    <P>During the past four years the Government have ignored my constituency.  The dole queues have steadily increased in those years leaving us with 12,500 people unemployed.  Thousands of young people are emigrating.  We have tremendous tourist attractions.  Yet there is no assistance from the Government to help to <Col N="280" /> develop them.  There are excellent opportunities for forestry, yet there is no investment in that sector.  In fact we paid off all the temporary employees in that county last week though there is sufficient work for them.  Indeed the social welfare benefits which will be paid to them will be almost equal to the wages they were in receipt of.</P>
    <P>Our county is largely dependent on fishing but in the past four years we have had progressively reduced quotas.</P>
    <P>Border roads are being closed without any serious objection to the British Government by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and these roads are used continuously by people trafficking between Donegal and parts of Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>We are receiving absolutely no money from the special fund for Border counties. Every other county along the Border will receive some aid from that fund but we are being fobbed off with the excuse that we have the benefit of natural gas. What good is natural gas to a county like Donegal which cannot use it?  Possibly it can be used in Ballyshannon and Letterkenny, but not in the rural parts.  We want our share of that special cross-Border money that is not available to us at the moment.</P>
    <P>We have the Gaeltacht areas which are being starved of investment by Údarás na Gaeltachta because the Government and Roinn na Gaeltachta are not prepared to make this money available. There are 800 jobs which could be made available to the people of my constituency in the morning for £1.5 million, but the Government are not prepared to do that.</P>
    <P>There was a new regulation last week in relation to new house grants.  I forecast that that will result in adding to the list of those waiting for council houses in rural areas and reduce drastically the number of people able to buy their own houses.</P>

      <P>In the summer I welcomed the sum of £374,000 for filling up potholes in the roads in Donegal.  But when this money came there were other conditions attached which meant it could not be used for the purpose for which we thought it was intended.  There are now signs up in various parts of the country on national primary routes stating that the projects in question have been funded from the Regional Fund.  I saw one notice recently on county roads to the effect that the potholes have been funded by the Coalition Government.  It is only in the past four years that the roads in the county have deteriorated to such and extent.</P>
      <P>A by-election in Donegal South-West would give Fianna Fáil a most resounding victory and the Government would face devastating defeat.  We will signal in a very clear and unambiguous fashion that we reject out of hand the policies of this extremely inept Coalition Government and that we do not favour their continuation in office.  Our result would reflect the views of the entire country.</P>
      <P>The Government side referred to precedents. I would like to refer to three precedents, all in south-west Donegal.  In 1970, after the death of the late Deputy P. O'Donnell in October, a by-election took place in December of that year.  In 1980 after the death during the summer recess, of the Ceann Comhairle at that time, Deputy Joe Brennan, a by-election took place in early December of that year.  After the tragic death of the late Deputy Clement Coughlan in February 1983, a by-election took place in May of that year.  Is that not sufficient precedent?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The opposition to the moving of this writ is purely on the grounds of political expediency.  It must be clearly interpreted as a grave insult to the people we represent in Donegal.  Quite apart from the Government's apparent fears of going north to my constituency, they must accept that this huge rural constituency has been deprived of a public representative since June of last year.  If we are to accept what the Taoiseach says, <Col N="282" /> that there will be no general election until the second half of next year, then that constituency will not have proper representation for a full 12-months period. This is something that cannot be accepted in a constituency of 60,000 people stretching from Bundoran in the far south to Creeslough in the north, from the islands of Aranmore and Tory to Drumking, Convoy and Castlefinn on the east.</P>

Therefore, the people of my constituency are the real losers today.</P>
      <P>I regret that a legitimate move &mdash; whether or not Deputy Harte thinks so &mdash; taken here today by our party has been opposed for selfish political reasons. However, we can take some comfort in the knowledge that our Constitution provides for an election every five years.  I sincerely believe that if it did not so provide this Government would endeavour to hold on for the next five centuries.</P>
      <P>The day of reckoning must come.  It has only been postponed.  The Government should face the electorate now either by way of a by-election or a general election. We are paying a high price in my constituency. The Government's poor performance will be tested by way of either election in south-west Donegal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I strongly support the moving of the writ.  Even at this late stage I plead with the parties involved.  Indeed, I issue an invitation to my constituency colleague, Deputy McGinley, if not to vote against the Government at least to abstain, not to ensure by way of such a by-election, <Col N="283" /> an alleviation of the amount of work both he and I have to undertake but rather to ensure that the people of Donegal are given the service to which they have been accustomed.

Since the day the late Deputy Cathal Coughlan departed this life anybody with a thinking political brain knew that in the political circumstances of today there was not a chance that a by-election would be held. There will be a vote tomorrow on that issue.  We have heard a Government Front Bench speaker make a case against the moving of the writ.  We have heard a Fianna Fáil Front Bench speaker make a case for the moving of the writ.  We have had the Fine Gael point of view put forward by a Donegal Deputy and the Fianna Fáil point of view, all on the ground.  I will be voting for the motion that the by-election be held but I am quite sure that it will not be carried, that it never was intended to be and, if anything were about to happen it would be a general election that would be held in its place.  That is the reality.  We can talk until the cows come home but that remains the reality.</P>
      <P>I say to Deputies P. Gallagher and McGinley &mdash; indeed I even ask Deputy Harte to throw in his lot with this &mdash; that I give a service in that part of the country as well despite the fact that I am not representing it here.  If they are really badly stuck in that constituency I suggest that those Deputies send their constituents over my way and I will look after them&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I agree with the decision of the Government not to hold the by-election in Donegal.  I had to come into the House when I heard the Front Bench spokesman for Fianna Fáil, Deputy R. Burke, call for a by-election. The Deputy must have more shrubs to give away when he calls for a by-election now.  It should be remembered in the last by-election in Dublin west when the Leader of the Fianna Fáil Party, having taken a member of the Fine Gael Party, danced in a Brussels hotel and was all over former Deputy Eileen Lemass but then deserted her at the count when the figures were going against her.  I should like to ask the Leader of the Opposition when will he build the airport in Letterkenny he promised at the last by-election there.  Deputy P. Gallagher spoke about potholes in Donegal, saying there was a signpost up to the effect that those potholes were sponsored by the Coalition Government.  I remember former Deputy Dr. O'Donoghue whom Fianna Fáil disowned &mdash; they did not even bother expelling him from the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party when he voted against their leader &mdash; say in 1978 that there would be no unemployment, that if it meant digging holes in the roads Fianna Fáil would dig them.  Soon afterwards the Fianna Fáil Government were thrown out of office because, when the potholes appeared in the roads they had not the money to fill them.  It is my belief that <Col N="285" /> there will be a general election held within a year.  If one looks clearly at the figures it would appear that Fianna Fáil are not that sure of winning it.  I was in this House in 1978 when Fianna Fáil won the election, when they presented their manifesto proposing no car tax, no rates, putting 25,000 people into the public sector.  When the late Deputy George Colley presented his first budget in that Government there appeared a caption in the <i>Irish Independent</i>&ldquo;Gamble George&rdquo; but by June 1979 the people wanted that corrupt, rotten Government out of office. I do not believe the people want a return to a Fianna Fáil Government, particularly when one remembers the internal telephone tapping, the tapping of telephones of journalists and so on.  I contend the sooner there is a general election held the better.  It would appear that the Leader of the Opposition does not understand the meaning of the word &ldquo;no&rdquo; because his party are promising anything at present.  While I am against it, perhaps it is a pity there was not a by-election held in Donegal when the Leader of the Opposition would be shown to be the irresponsible leader he is.  Bearing in mind the present financial state of the country it appears that the Opposition have no economic policies and that their leader cannot say no to anything.</P>

      <P>There are five TDs and one Senator in Donegal.  With only a year left to the lifetime of this Government I believe that is ample to serve the people of that constituency.  Indeed the Progressive Democrats have said that if they have anything to say in the formation of a future Government, there will be only 100 to 126 TDs in this house.  It will be interesting to watch how they vote because if that were the case the number of representatives for Donegal would be reduced from six to five anyway.  As I said, it will be interesting to see if they vote for a by-election or to reduce the number in this House.</P>
      <P>Everybody is talking about calling a by-election or a general election, but as a member of the Labour Party I want to make it clear that I back the policies of this Government, I believe the Government should finish their term of office and when the election is called we will face the people on our policies.  There is a great deal of legislation to be passed in the final days of this Government &mdash; the Children (Care and Protection) Bill, the homeless persons Bill and so on.  If Fianna Fáil are returned to office these Bills will never be heard of again because Deputy Haughey will do as he did with the family planning legislation &mdash; he will consult the Hierarchy to get approval before he brings Bills to the Cabinet.</P>

      <P>In response to Deputy McLoughlin, the Progressive Democrats are in favour of fewer Members in this House, and I am sure many people listening to a recording of the proceedings of this House for the first time will agree, but there is a difference between being in favour of fewer Deputies and filling a seat.  We support the holding of the by-election because we believe the people <Col N="287" /> of Donegal are entitled to be represented in this House.</P>
      <P>I agree with the sentiments expressed by previous speakers when they paid tribute to the Deputy whose death created a vacancy in this House.  Deputy Cathal Coughlan was a very able, sincere, dedicated and committed Member of Dáil Éireann and his death was a great loss not only to the people of Donegal but to this House.</P>
      <P>I accept the argument that if we were sure a general election would be held within the next few weeks, or even within the next few months, holding a by-election now would be a waste of time but, unfortunately, one cannot be certain that there can be a general election within the next few months.  In the circumstances, we will be supporting the writ moved by Deputy Vincent Brady.</P>

      <P>I want to mention a couple of points in relation to this motion which I support.  In my view the overemphasis on the fact that the Donegal South-West constituency has fewer Members to service the constitutents is unfortunate because the basic issue here is whether the electorate in that area are entitled to their representation in this House.  In my view that is a far more important issue than the question of servicing or otherwise of the constituents, important though that may be.  On that basis alone there should be a by-election unless the Taoiseach tells us there will be a general election within the next three, four, five or six weeks.  If that were to happen, I agree that there should not be a by-election now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State said the Government do not want a by-election because of the large volume of legislation which has to come before the House.  In my experience in this House, short as it is, I have yet to see the House close for a by-election. The House continues its operations even during a by-election.  If the <Col N="288" /> Government were serious about the large volume of legislation they would permit the by-election to be held and they would continue the work in this House of processing the legislation on the stocks.  The real question they must be asking themselves is whether the Government could win.  There is no doubt in my mind that if they felt the Fine Gael candidate could win the seat, we would have a by-election in a few weeks' time.  If the Minister of State had given that answer she would have been more honest.  That would have been a truthful statement.</P>
    <P>Deputy Harte suggested that we should arrive at a convention for the filling of vacancies in this house.  It is my understanding that the Constitution lays down that there must be a by-election held to fill Dáil vacancies.  Presumably that could be circumvented by an agreement between parties that only one candidate would stand and that there would be no election in effect, but I believe that would be fundamentally contrary to the spirit of the Constitution and would be taking us down a very slippery slope where the electorate would be denied the right to express their opinion in a general election or a by-election on the attitudes, policies and performance of any Government. Deputy Harte said this system exists in the United States.  I am not an expert on the position in the United States, but I understand that governments there do not stand or fall on the basis of having, or not having, a majority in Congress.  Therefore, the situation is not comparable.</P>
    <P>Regardless of the great sympathy we have with the tragedy of the Coughlan family, we should not assume that any family has an automatic right to a place in this House.  A seat in this House should be only on the basis of the votes of the electorate.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann reaffirms its confidence in the Taoiseach and the Government.</P>
      <P>The form of this parliamentary debate is a vote of confidence in the Government but the real issue posed in the debate is whether this House can have more confidence in the Government or in the Opposition.  This raises immediately the questions of how the Opposition behaved in office and how they have performed over the past four years.  Let us look at the record.</P>
      <P>When in Government, the Opposition built up public borrowing to a point where in one year it was equivalent to one-fifth of the total output of this country. No person or country can borrow at such a rate without the most disastrous consequences.  Public expenditure was then on a trend which, if continued, would have meant that the Government would have absorbed every penny of national output.  We were spending abroad £115 for every £100 we earned there.  That excess is a measure of the rate at which we were heading for national bankruptcy.  Inflation was at levels it had reached only once before, at the height of the first oil crisis.  At over 20 per cent, it meant that money was halving in value every four years or so.  Wages and other incomes just could not keep pace.</P>
      <P>Unemployment was increasing at a rate of over 40,000 a year which, if maintained would soon have produced a scene of total social and economic collapse.</P>
      <P>At the end of 1982 our relations with our nearest neighbour were to say the least frigid, so frigid that there could be no hope of any development in relation to Northern Ireland, no hope of movement towards the reconciliation which is so necessary if peace and stability are to be established there and friendly relations established throughout the island.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know that the Opposition dislike intensely any reference to their record in Government, or to the condition in which they left our economy and our people when they were defeated first in mid-1981 and again, after a brief interval, at the <Col N="293" /> end of 1982.  Every conceivable propaganda effort has been put into discouraging us from referring back to that period of four to five years ago.  It is the constant contention of the Opposition that the past is irrelevant, that the question of where this Government started from must be ignored, and that our performance must be seen in splendid isolation from the real world in which we found ourselves when we took over the reins of Government from Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>This simply will not wash.  The Opposition can justify their return to office only on the basis of two considerations, their performance when last in Government and their performance during five years of Opposition.  The 1977-81 Fianna Fáil Government with a 20-seat majority was a calamitous failure.  The second Fianna Fáil Government in 1982 was a disaster that ended in disgrace.</P>
    <P>Even Fianna Fáil's best friends do not claim on their behalf that they have been an effective or constructive Opposition. In the vast majority of serious debates critical analysis of the Government's proposals has been largely left to the Government's own backbenchers.  This has certainly raised the quality of debate in both Houses, and has made for much more interesting and stimulating parliamentary sessions than has been the case in the past.</P>
    <P>The contrast between the lively and critical debates initiated on this side of the House on many issues and the generally fairly pathetic efforts of the Opposition have been widely noted by the media and by public opinion, and I need not dwell on this contrast.  There have, of course, been individual honourable exceptions to this, but far too few to convince any impartial observer of the parliamentary scene that today's Fianna Fáil Front Bench has the capacity to offer an effective alternative Government.</P>
    <P>Even <i>Magill</i> magazine, which no-one could accuse of being over-friendly to or uncritical of the present Government, has, in its current issue, the headline, &ldquo;Yes, The Alternative Government Could Be Worse&rdquo;.  In the body of that <Col N="294" /> article it is stated bluntly of the Opposition spokesmen that, only five could rank of adequate calibre for ministerial office, apart from the Leader of the Opposition himself, although, somewhat curiously, only four are named in the article.  This out of a total of 39 Members of the Opposition who are in shadow posts.</P>
    <P>However, I do not propose to embarrass the Opposition by dwelling on this point; it speaks for itself so eloquently that it requires no embellishment from me.  What I want to pay more attention to is the contrast between the condition in which Fianna Fáil left this country, both in mid-1981 and at the end of 1982, and the position in which we find ourselves today.</P>
    <P>There are of course a number of different ways in which our performance can be measured.  Many see unemployment as one of these, although I believe this is largely incorrect.  For when one looks at the unemployment figures for the last seven years one is struck by the extent to which changes of Government have appeared totally irrelevant to the upward trend.  It was in September 1979, barely two years after Fianna Fáil had come into Government, that unemployment began to rise from a figure of 82,500 a rise that has continued since then.</P>
    <P>During the seven years since autumn 1979 the rate of growth in unemployment has peaked twice at the beginning of 1981 the level was almost 40 per cent higher than a year earlier and in early 1983 the annual increase actually reached 43,000.</P>
    <P>Since early 1983 the rate of growth of unemployment has steadily declined, to a figure of less than 3,000, or barely 1 per cent, in the last 12 months, although part of this reduction had undoubtedly reflected a rise in emigration.  There really are no political points to be made on this subject.  The underlying cause of unemployment has been the effective stagnation of the world economy for most of the period since the second oil crisis, and the exceptional demographic position in Ireland where the number of young people seeking employment is so <Col N="295" /> much higher than in other developed countries.</P>
    <P>The truth is that the upward surge in unemployment, latterly partially substituted by emigration, has been an endemic feature of our economy throughout the past seven years, under four Governments, and it is time that we stopped trying to score off each other in relation to a problem as tragic as this and in respect of which really effective action will require the co-operation of all political parties.  What we need to do is to set aside propaganda consideration in the interest of making common cause so as to create more favourable conditions for the generation of employment and for steps to mitigate the impact of unemployment.</P>
    <P>Most of the underlying causes of unemployment lie outside this country, as we all know, and there is no more point in my trying to blame Fianna Fáil because the rise started when they were in office than there would be any point in their stating the obvious fact that after seven years of continuous increase, the figure is now much higher than it was at the beginning.  What we have to do, both of us, is to get away from this futile point-scoring and seek common ground in terms of making such changes as are within our own control in this country, so as to mitigate the impact of unemployment, most especially by removing any domestic obstacles to employment creation.</P>
    <P>At my party's Ard Fheis I made some concrete suggestions in this regard some of which I know are potentially controversial. I would hope that, however much we may disagree in other matters in this debate, it may be possible for the ideas that I put forward to be looked at objectively in the interest of the common good.  Some of the changes I have suggested could become really effective only if there were a bi-partisan approach to them.</P>
    <P>Neither of our parties is individually responsible for the present unemployment situation and neither of our parties can be really effective on their <Col N="296" /> own in trying to reduce its impact both upon older workers who have lost their jobs and young people who cannot even secure an initial toe-hold in the labour market.</P>
    <P>I want to turn now, however, to matters that are more clearly in our control and where policies that different Governments have pursued have produced different results.  No one can deny, or ignore, what has been happening in relation to inflation here.  Four-and-a-half years ago consumer prices were rising at a rate of 21 per cent or well over twice the average in the developed countries as a whole at that time.</P>
    <P>That disparity in inflation rates was, unarguably the product of our own decision in this country.  It was attributable in particular to the unrestrained growth in income both in the public and private sectors that had taken place during the immediately preceding years 1980 and 1981, which had pushed up or prices far faster than elsewhere.  Instead of seeking to restrain this disastrous development the Government of the day gave it every encouragement, boosting the public service pay bill by 35 per cent in the single year 1980, a year in which all control in this sector was lost by a Government whose irresponsibility in this matter has no parallel at any other period in the history of the State.</P>
    <P>Since we came into office at the end of 1982 we have set about tackling this problem, and have, I contend, been outstandingly successful.  In the other developed countries inflation has fallen by 6 percentage points, from 9 per cent to 3 per cent; in Ireland it has fallen by 18 percentage points, from 21 per cent to the same figure of 3 per cent.  This has not happened by chance.  This has happened because the Government have pursued responsible policies on the public finances, the exchange rate and incomes. We have persistently preached the message that pay restraint is necessary for lower inflation and higher employment. We have put across the point that unrealistic pay demands are ultimately self-defeating.</P>
    <P>It is an undeniable fact that in four <Col N="297" /> years the Government have reduced the rate of inflation three times as fast as in other developed countries.  The result of this success in curbing inflation has been that, whereas in mid-1982 pay increases in average industrial earnings of 12-13 per cent were associated with an actual fall of 8 per cent in the average workers' purchasing power because inflation was running at so much higher a rate, the current position is that money income increases of about 6 per cent are giving workers this year significant real income growth, probably of the order of 3 per cent or &mdash; in view of the major tax reductions in this year's budget, perhaps nearer to 4 per cent.</P>
    <P>There are those who will fault me for having cited so many figures in the course of making this point, but I believe that a mere assertion that we had achieved such remarkable results, not backed up by the actual figures, might fail to carry full conviction and I think that it is of great importance that our people should appreciate just what has been achieved &mdash; just what a Government can achieve &mdash; when they tackle a problem that has been allowed to get completely out of control by their predecessors.</P>
    <P>Closely connected with this is the question of competitiveness, our ability in terms of our unit wage costs to match our competitors.  Back in 1981 and 1982 our unit wage costs in terms of our own currency were rising by about 10 per cent per year.  We were visibly pricing ourselves out of our own market, and out of other people's markets.  The shelves of our supermarkets were filling up with foreign goods, replacing Irish goods that had formerly been able to hold their own. The substitution of Irish products by imports was destroying employment and certainly contributed to the exceptionally high level of unemployment at that time, although as I have said earlier the primary reasons for the growth in unemployment then as since lie outside our shores.</P>
    <P>We do not yet have equivalent figures for the current year, but we know from the figures published in the Central Bank bulletin that last year our unit wage costs rose only fractionally, by half-a-percent. <Col N="298" /> As a result in 1985 we gained a lot of ground on our main competitors.  If we can keep this up our order books will grow and we must keep it up.</P>
    <P>That improvement in our competitiveness, that turn round in the whole position in regard to competitiveness is a most crucial achievement, for on it depends our capacity to turn around the rise in unemployment and emigration by increasing employment here once again after the prolonged period during which employment in manufacturing has declined.</P>
    <P>In what I have said so far I have been referring to matters that affect our people very directly &mdash; to unemployment and emigration, to increases in consumer prices, to declines and increases in the purchasing power of workers' pay packets and to our competitiveness <i>vis-à-vis</i> our neighbours.</P>
    <P>There are other matters also which are much more difficult for us to come to grips with as individuals, but which are also of vital importance to us all.</P>
    <P>When we came into office in 1981 the State had a balance of payments deficit equivalent to 15 per cent of our national output.  That means, quite simply, that we were not merely consuming the equivalent of what we were producing at home, in our own country, but 15 per cent more besides.  This was a degree of overspending which no country could sustain for any period without a serious collapse.</P>
    <P>We were heading for a catastrophe.</P>
    <P>In 1982, after our Government had taken tough measures, both in our supplementary budget of 1981 and in the 1982 budget on which we were defeated, but which, in a modified form, was reintroduced by Fianna Fáil in March of that year, the rate of overspending abroad had been reduced from 15 per cent to just over 10 per cent &mdash; still frighteningly high. This year the margin of overspending abroad has been cut to less than 2 per cent &mdash; an amount which for a country at our stage of development, needing to import machinery and equipment and to attract foreign investment from abroad in new industrial enterprises, is a tolerable <Col N="299" /> one, although I do not suggest that we should not be complacent about this.</P>
    <P>No one can doubt the enormous progress that has been made in five years, during which we have almost wiped out our external overspending.</P>
    <P>There remains the question of the public finances &mdash; the area of greatest difficulty for us, now and for many years past and, I fear, also for many years to come.</P>
    <P>In this area too we have made real progress, although it is less impressive and less satisfactory than in the other areas I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>The best and most complete measure of what is happening in the public finance area is the public sector borrowing requirement &mdash; the total amount borrowed by the Exchequer, whether for current or capital purposes, together with the borrowings of State enterprises.  It is this figure, related to our total national output, that measures most completely and accurately the extent to which our public finances are within control or out of control.</P>
    <P>I want to resort to several further figures designed to illustrate just what has happened in this area during the past nine years.</P>
    <P>When the National Coalition Government left office in 1977 total public sector borrowing was the equivalent of one-eighth of our national output.  By increasing the volume of spending by half between 1977 and 1982 without raising the necessary taxes to meet, Fianna Fáil increased borrowing indiscriminately and left us all to try to pick up the pieces.</P>
    <P>Four years later by 1981 this figure had risen to £2,200 million, or the equivalent of over one-fifth of our national output &mdash; as a result of a combination of three factors: Fianna Fáil in those four years had doubled the current budget deficit, they increased by two-thirds borrowing by the Exchequer for capital purposes and increased by two-thirds borrowing by State enterprises &mdash; all these in terms of the proportion that this borrowing bore to our national output.</P>
    <P>That expresses as simply as one can the <Col N="300" /> record of the Fianna Fáil Government who were in power between 1977 and 1981.</P>
    <P>That left us facing an appalling crisis, one which has still not gone away and has only partially been resolved.  No country can sustain a position where its public spending is on such a scale that it has to borrow the equivalent of one-fifth of its national output in order to supplement the yield from taxation any more than an individual could year after year live 20 per cent beyond his or her means and hope to survive.  That way lies the road to ruin &mdash; and we were well down that road in 1981 when our Government took office.</P>
    <P>Indeed it has to be said that the fact that the level of public sector borrowing represented &ldquo;only&rdquo; one-fifth of our national output, and not well over a quarter, was due solely to the prompt and tough action which our Government took in July, 1981 and again in January, 1982. The figures given to me when I took office on 1 July 1981 showed that without the action we took the position in both 1981 and 1982 would have been far worse &mdash; one-third worse in 1982.</P>
    <P>I must for a few minutes, however, go into the question of our public finances a little more closely, to contrast the performance of Fianna Fáil in the years immediately after 1978, with what we have achieved since we started our present term of office.</P>
    <P>Between 1979 and 1982 the out-turn of the current budget deficit was on average almost three-fifths higher than the deficit the Fianna Fáil Government had estimated each year at budget time.</P>
    <P>Compare those figures with our results in each of the last three years.  The margin of error in the current budget deficit itself in these years has ranged between 5 and 7 per cent &mdash; in one year on the right side.  Taking the three years together, the average error has been only 2 per cent, as against three-fifths under Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>In relation to the total amount of revenue and expenditure taken together, since errors and changes can occur on either side, the margin of error in each <Col N="301" /> of these three years has been less than one-half per cent of the total.</P>
    <P>Once again I apologise for citing so many figures.  But the contrast between the total failure of budget control under Fianna Fáil and the extraordinarily tight control that we achieved in each of the last three years is sufficiently striking &mdash; and sufficiently important I believe &mdash; to justify this presentation.</P>
    <P>This year, as everyone knows, we have faced greater difficulties, and the margin by which the current budget deficit will exceed that planned in the budget is significantly higher than in any of the three preceding years.  But the overrun of just over one-eighth contrasts strikingly with the excesses ranging from one-half to four-fifths which Fianna Fáil registered during their closing four years in office.</P>
    <P>Moreover the overruns that occurred at that time owed little, so far as I can see, to factors external to our own economy. Certainly Fianna Fáil in those years faced nothing like the problems that we are faced with in the current year when we have had to grapple with a combination of:</P>
    <P>(1)  The collapse in oil prices, and thus in the rate of inflation and the level of Government revenue, which took place after the budgetary decisions on public service pay and social welfare had been taken,</P>
    <P>(2)  a drop in non-tax revenue, in particular from Bord Gáis as a result of a combination of lower oil prices and the need to finance the continued operation of Dublin Gas, and</P>
    <P>(3)  unforeseen additional expenditure in relation to such matters as compensation, for farmers in particular, for the effects of two successive years of exceptionally bad weather.</P>
    <P>The great bulk of the overrun in this year's budget deficit &mdash; something like two-thirds &mdash; emerged during the third quarter of the year, too late for remedial action to have any significant effect on this year's outturn.  However, even allowing for the fact that part of the excess in <Col N="302" /> the budget deficit is due to non-recurrent factors, these developments will make it necessary for the Government to take firm action in respect of 1987, and the Government have already announced the limits within which both the current budget deficit and Exchequer borrowing will be maintained next year.</P>
    <P>We believe that this announcement was desirable in order to offer reassurance to the financial markets from which the Government have to borrow, markets in which, in the absence of such a clear commitment by the Government, fears could have arisen of an excessive level of borrowing next year, away beyond the reasonable capacity of our own financial sector, combined with reasonable recourse to foreign borrowing, to accommodate.</P>
    <P>This reassurance which has already contributed to a 1.25 per cent drop in interest rates, was all the more important in view of the speculative pressures from which we are currently suffering owing to the uncertainties that exist in relation to sterling &mdash; pressures that have been having a strong, if quite unjustified, effect upon domestic interest rates.</P>
    <P>During the course of this debate the Opposition party will have the opportunity of adding their voice of reassurance on this point if, as two of these parties seem to think, for obviously opposite reasons, they might find themselves in Government through the course of the next year.  As there is, at any rate, an element of uncertainty in the political situation for 1987, this would, I believe, be a constructive and statesman-like move &mdash; even if, as I expect, it will prove in the event to have been a superfluous one.</P>
    <P>So far as possible in the course of my remarks to date I have refrained from provocative attacks on the Opposition, limiting myself to criticism of those areas where, objectively, criticism is unavoidable. This kind of debate can be very unproductive and quite demoralising, for the general public if it descends to the level of a slanging match &mdash; and none of us is immune from the temptation to take the debate in this direction, nor from <Col N="303" /> criticism that we have in the past fallen needlessly for this temptation.</P>
    <P>It would I think be more constructive, and probably very much more appreciated by the general public, if the occasion of this debate were used to get across, from our very different points of view, just how difficult and how serious is the financial situation of the country.  The management of the economy in the last few years has been an extremely difficult task.  It has in a very real sense involved walking a tight-rope, as I recently have had occasion to remark, with the ever-present danger of falling off either on one side or the other &mdash; of over-deflating the economy by excessive cuts in spending or tax increases on the one hand, or of failing to control the level of borrowing on the other.</P>
    <P>It is, of course, possible to make a case for criticising us for leaning too much in one direction or the other but what is really less convincing is an attempt to suggest that we have leant too far in both directions at once, which has sometimes been the burden of less informed criticism of Government policy.</P>
    <P>The simple truth is that whatever Government are in office, the problems facing them in present circumstances are formidable.  They will not be solved without a much greater degree of public understanding of the scale of our difficulties. I believe that it would be helpful if that much, at least, emerged from this debate.</P>
    <P>I want to turn now from this review &mdash; a review which I have made as objective as I can &mdash; of the relative performance of Fianna Fáil and the present Government during their respective terms of office in respect of what are described by economists as the major macro-economic factors, to other aspects of Government policy in respect of which I believe we have secured significant successes, even in the face of the financial problems that confront us.</P>
    <P>The principal socio-economic problems which have confronted us, and which we have sought to tackle, even <Col N="304" /> within the limits of the tight financial constraints facing us are:</P>
    <P>(i)  the expansion of the educational system to meet the needs of the ever growing number of students,</P>
    <P>(ii)  the maintenance and improvement of the purchasing power of social payments available to the disadvantaged,</P>
    <P>(iii)  resolving the local authority housing problem which has been with us since the sixties, and encouraging the expansion of home ownership and the recovery in the house building section of the construction industry,</P>
    <P>(iv)  developing our primary road infrastructure the neglect of which over a long period has been an impediment to industrial dispersion and economic expansion.</P>
    <P>Of course, another Government might have chosen different priorities but these have been ours.</P>
    <P>As far as the educational system is concerned, it has within the past four years accommodated 55,000 additional students and the total number employed in the educational sector has been increased by over 3,000.  Expansion has, of course, been most rapid in the third-level sector where the numbers of students are now 23 per cent higher than five years ago and where a major expansion of the construction programme, designed to provide additional places, and announced in the national plan, is now well under way.  Expansion in this sector has brought us to the point where well over one-quarter of young people now have the opportunity of undertaking third-level education, a figure two-thirds higher than in Britain and slightly higher than in the EC as a whole.  For a country whose resources per head are so much lower than in the rest of the European Community, and in which the proportion of young people of an age to participate in education is greater than elsewhere in the EC, this is a remarkable achievement.</P>
    <P>So far as social welfare is concerned, <Col N="305" /> the additional payments that have been provided for in recent years in respect of a 12-month period in July, have in every instance exceeded by some margin the increase in the cost of living during the period in question.  As a result there has been a relatively consistent improvement in the purchasing power of the incomes of the more disadvantaged members of our community, even at a time when, in the earlier years of the decade, the living standards of those at work were falling as a result of the financial crisis generated by Fianna Fáil in their later years in office.</P>
    <P>As far as housing is concerned, the number of people being housed in local authority dwellings has been almost one-quarter higher in recent years than previously, with the result that the average waiting time for local authority housing has been halved.  This has been achieved through the operation of the Housing Finance Agency and the £5,000 grant scheme for council tenants, and, far from requiring additional expenditure on local authority housing, has released resources which it has been possible to apply to the house improvement grant scheme, where the multiplier effect of public spending on construction activity is twice as great as in local authority housing.</P>
    <P>With 115,000 applications for these grants now received, the total volume of construction activity that will have been generated by this number of applications is conservatively estimated at £350 million, of which about £200 million will fall within the next calendar year.  This is in marked contrast to the Opposition's sole contribution to this area of policy &mdash; the repetitive promise of £200 million for unspecified construction activity &mdash; all to come from the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>Finally, the road building programme, which had fallen so much in arrears under Fianna Fáil, has been accelerated to the point where, on present plans, activity next year will be considerably in excess of the planned level.  Throughout almost every part of the country significant improvements in our main roads are being achieved, with obvious economic and social benefits.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="306" /> It is unnecessary for me to detail the many steps that have been taken to encourage investment in enterprise, and co-operation between workers and management through profit-sharing schemes. Measures of this kind have been features of the various Finance Bills which we have introduced and, together with the enterprise allowance scheme, which has already helped 15,000 people to move from unemployment to self-employment, have contributed significantly to reducing the rate of increase of unemployment.</P>
    <P>The imaginative social employment scheme, by spreading the overheads of supervision and materials over twice as many people as in a normal environmental works type of scheme, has helped over 10,000 people to break the cycle of long-term unemployment which is so demoralising for those concerned.</P>
    <P>I mention these merely as some examples of the kind of imaginative measures which this Government have introduced.  The contrast between our many initiatives in these different areas and the obvious stagnation of Fianna Fáil policy-making during their period in Opposition, has been one of the most striking features of political life during these recent years.  It provides, I believe, one of the reasons why, when the time comes for people to make up their minds between the present Government and the present Opposition, the pattern of voting will be much less favourable to the Opposition than they now seem to believe.</P>
    <P>Thus at the level of individual policies as well as at the level of broad economic policy, this Government, in the face of great odds, have, I believe, merited the confidence of this House, and of our people.  But there are other areas also in respect of which the Government's achievements deserve at least a mention in this debate.  Other speakers may develop some of these points more fully.</P>
    <P>In a number of sectors we have initiated fundamental reviews of policy for the first time in very many years, industrial policy, reform of the public service manpower policy in the form of a rationalisation of the various manpower bodies and reform of the criminal law, <Col N="307" /> which will come fully into effect shortly with the appointment of the new police complaints board.</P>
    <P>The whole area of State enterprises, which was in considerable disarray when we took over, has been the subject of intensive remedial action &mdash; one result of which can be seen in the sharp reduction in the borrowing requirement for this sector, much of which was going to finance losses incurred, in significant measure, as a result of the faulty policies of our predecessors in Government.  In the last five years, since losses have been brought under control, public sector borrowing by State enterprises as a share of our national output has been reduced by no less than 40 per cent.</P>
    <P>While all this has been going on, major social reforms have also been introduced, including the introduction of community service as an alternative to prison; an Act to control the misuse of drugs; the establishment of the Office of Ombudsman; the lowering of the age of majority; the elimination of discrimination between men and women in respect of citizenship and domicile; the rationalisation of the law on family planning and the establishment of the Combat Poverty Agency.</P>
    <P>Other reforming measures currently under way include the Bill for the housing of the homeless, the Children (Care and Protection) Bill and the Status of Children Bill and measures currently in preparation and shortly to be introduced will include a further Children Bill, legalising the adoption of legitimate children who have been abandoned; a measure for protection of spouses' interest in the family home; measures to establish family courts and to reform the law on marriage and separation and a Bill to extend protection against violence in the home.</P>
    <P>Other important measures designed to protect the citizen include the police complaints Bill already referred to and the Interception of Postal Packets and Telecommunications Messages (Regulation) Bill which will introduce additional control against abuse of telephone tapping in particular &mdash; a measure <Col N="308" /> the need for which was unfortunately all too well established during the concluding stages of the last Fianna Fáil administration.</P>
    <P>I have touched on only some of the areas of reforming legislation which have been introduced or are under way.  Suffice it to say that the last and the present session of the Dáil and Seanad will, I believe, have seen the introduction of a greater volume of reforming legislation than in any other two sessions of the Oireachtas that I can recall.</P>
    <P>There are two other areas of achievement that I must also refer to in this debate which relate to the question of confidence in the Government.  The first of these concerns Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>The House will recall that, when this Government came into office at the end of 1982, relations between the Irish and British Governments were at their lowest ebb for very many years and the prospect of any progress being made with regard to Northern Ireland seemed to most people to be completely remote.  During 1983 while the New Ireland Forum was meeting and drawing up its report we set out to restore a working relationship with the British Government upon which we could build in terms of negotiation of an agreement designed to alter fundamentally the position of Nationalists in Northern Ireland.  We succeeded in this objective in November last year and I need not dwell here on the significance of the agreement that was then signed.</P>
    <P>The only point I would like to make at this stage is that the perception of the working of the agreement promulgated by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition on television recently &mdash; that the only matters being dealt with in the Conference relate to security co-operation &mdash; was fundamentally and totally incorrect. The whole range of matters covered by the agreement is under discussion in the Conference and, while I would naturally like to have seen more rapid results in some areas, considerable progress has been made under various headings outlined in the agreement.  These include improvements in the administration of justice and in the working of the security <Col N="309" /> forces in Northern Ireland, in relation to discrimination, and in relation to areas which are of great importance to the Northern Nationalists such as the use of the Irish language and a review of measures such as the Flags and Emblems Act &mdash; measures that for them are crucial to acceptance of the legitimacy of their identity.</P>
    <P>I regret that the agreement has recently been precipitated into the area of public controversy and for my part I accept the validity of Séamus Mallon's concern lest division among ourselves on these issues damage the prospect of peace and stability in Northern Ireland and the achievement of genuine equal treatment for the minority there.  I do not, therefore, propose to refer in this debate to the issues recently raised by the Leader of the Opposition and hope that he will take the same account of concern expressed by Séamus Mallon on behalf of Northern Nationalists.</P>
    <P>I want to turn now to the question of our participation in the European Community. Within the Community our period in Government has been a critical one for this country in more than one respect.  In 1983 and 1984 we faced the extremely difficult negotiation over the milk super-levy, which ended with notable success when we achieved a right to an advantage of 23 per cent <i>vis-à-vis</i> our partners in terms of milk output &mdash; giving us the right to increase our output further beyond the increased level we had already achieved in 1983, at a time when our partners were being cut back almost to their 1981 output levels.  This achievement was in line with the similar arrangement negotiated in October 1976 by the National Coalition Government that gave us the right to double our fish catch within three years and to continue increasing it thereafter at a time when other countries were being required to reduce their catches of fish.</P>
    <P>The super-levy battle was, of course, only one episode in what has proved to be and continues to be a long drawn out battle to maintain the essentials of the Common Agricultural Policy in the face <Col N="310" /> of the enormous financial problems created within the Community by the scale of surpluses of milk products, cereals and, for the moment at least, beef.</P>
    <P>In all these discussions we have benefited as a Government from the close relationships we have built up over the years not only through our two parties' participation in the Socialist and Christian Democratic groups in the European Parliament, which between them represent a clear majority of members in that body, but also through the close and friendly bilateral relations we have established with the Heads and Foreign Ministers of other Governments of member states.</P>
    <P>These contacts stood us in good stead at a time when the Single European Act was under negotiation.  The House will recall the problems that were created in 1981 when the then Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Brian Lenihan, conceded at a meeting in Venlo in the Netherlands the examination of matters relating to political co-operation on the basis of what was then described as the &ldquo;Third Option&rdquo; namely, the preparation of a new report which would change the nature and expand the scope of political co-operation &mdash; an error which was successfully retrieved by Senator Dooge at a subsequent meeting in London.</P>
    <P>Building on this success, our Government were able to secure in the Single European Act a clear distinction between co-operation in relation to the political and economic aspects of security &mdash; which had always been a function of the system of political co-operation established by the then member states early in the seventies &mdash; and the defence area which, in accordance with Article 30(6)(c) of the Single European Act is clearly identified as being a matter to be dealt with in the framework of the Western European Union or the Atlantic Alliance.  The problem posed by the position taken up by Fianna Fáil in Venlo in 1981 has thus been resolved in a manner that is satisfactory to Irish interests.</P>
    <P>In a brief survey of this kind of the work of this Government it has been <Col N="311" /> possible to refer only to some of the highlights of our activities in the framework of the European Community which, in the period ahead, will be opening up to us new possibilities in the internal market of the Community, of which I hope and believe Irish firms, both in the services and in the industrial sector, will take the fullest advantage.</P>
    <P>I think the House will appreciate, in the light of the general review I have undertaken of the performance of this Government in the past four years, just why I believe that the Government are entitled to the confidence of this House and should be accorded the opportunity to conclude their work in the many different areas in which they are engaged in pursuing the national interest.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, the contrast between the wide-ranging achievements of the Government in the face of extreme difficulties in the financial and economic area, as well as external pressures in relation to matters such as the Common Agricultural Policy, are in striking contrast to the almost total inertia of the Fianna Fáil Party in the Dáil during this period.  It is clear that the Leader of the Opposition is a firm believer in the proposition that Opposition parties cannot win elections and that it should be left to Governments to lose them.</P>
    <P>We do not, however, intend to oblige him in this respect and I believe that the tactic of lying low and saying nothing, while it may appear as if it serves some purpose during the mid-term period of a Government facing considerable financial and economic difficulties, will receive much less appreciation from the electorate when an election comes.  Then Fianna Fáil will be expected both to demonstrate that they have been effective in the performance of their duties as the biggest Opposition party and to put forward clear and cogent alternatives to the policies being pursued by the Government.</P>
    <P>I can assure this House that the Government will for their part make very clear just where they stand on the crucial issues facing us.  We will not flinch from <Col N="312" /> the measures that will have to be taken to ensure that our current deficit and borrowing remain within the limits we have felt it right to prescribe for ourselves and which, both externally and domestically, we will be expected to observe by those on whom we depend for our borrowing needs.</P>
    <P>In this debate it will be for the Opposition to discharge the onus that public and media opinion will place on them to demonstrate the reasons for believing that they have the capacity to achieve more for the country than we have done, something they have totally failed to do hitherto, either in the Dáil or outside. All I can say at this stage is that on the basis of what has happened during the past four years they will in this respect be starting very far behind in the struggle for the public heart and mind.  Their belief that power will be handed to them on a plate by the people, simply for the sake of a change, is fundamentally naive.</P>
    <P>However, all that is for the future.  Our job today and tomorrow is to satisfy the Dáil that our performance gives grounds for an expression of confidence in us that will enable us to continue our work in the months ahead.  Much of that work is of vital importance to our country.  We have to take the necessary measures to bring the current budget deficit and borrowing down to a level that will not impose an excessive strain on the capacity of our domestic financial markets, or the willingness of external lenders, to provide us with the resources required to supplement Government revenue from taxation and other sources.</P>
    <P>We have to approve in this House the Single European Act, which is of such vital importance to the success of our membership of the Community, which, in 1985 contributed net £900 million in the form of transfers across the exchanges in this country &mdash; supporting Ireland's agricultural sector on a massive scale as well as providing a very large part of the resources needed for training and employment measures for our young people and for regional development. Approval of this Act will also clear the way for measures to establish fully an <Col N="313" /> internal market by 1992, something that is of particular importance for this country in view of our dependence for our livelihood on exports of goods and services to the European Community.</P>
    <P>We also have in our programme a whole range of measures which I have mentioned already dealing with the rights of children and other family matters, legislation in respect of which Fianna Fáil failed to take any initiative during their last two periods in office but to which we, and the people of this State, attach great importance.</P>
    <P>There is also a whole series of other reforms to be carried through in areas in respect of which Fianna Fáil have demonstrated no commitment &mdash; for example, the new legislation in respect of building societies, in respect of which we look forward to hearing the Opposition's views, the Bill to establish on a permanent basis the National Board for Curriculum and Assessment, the measure to ensure against abuse of interception of postal packages and telecommunications, and many other measures which, if Fianna Fáil were in office, would be unlikely to see the light of day, but the enactment of which is greatly in the public interest.</P>
    <P>It is for these reasons that I call on this House to confirm its confidence in this Government so that we may finish the job we set out to do when we took office almost four years ago, at one of the darkest moments in Irish political life.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there has ever been in the history of Dáil Éireann a motion of no confidence put down in respect of any Government which would command such a universal degree of public support as the one we put down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In seeking to bring this administration to an end and the holding of a general election Fianna Fáil are simply responding in the most effective way we can to an urgent and insistent public demand. An overwhelming majority of people at this stage want to see an end to this Government and their policies.  They are increasingly impatient and angry every <Col N="314" /> extra day this discredited Coalition stay in office.  Every Deputy in the House is aware of the intensity of that public animosity toward this Government and to their continuing in office.  Any Deputy who would canvass any cross-section of constituents and who would respond honestly and democratically to their wishes would certainly vote to bring this Government to an end now.</P>
    <P>The economic and financial policies of this Government have brought us to a state of deep, far-reaching crisis.  The present crisis is different in its nature from anything that we have ever experienced before in this country.  It is comprehensive and total.  It is felt everywhere.  It permeates every sector of our national life.  Members of the general public who never had any great knowledge of economic or financial matters, or who would not indeed have taken much interest in them until now, know that something is radically wrong.  There is widespread anxiety about the future. There is a loss of confidence which affects the entire community.</P>
    <P>The failure of this Government manifests itself in a hundred different ways. Some of them are clearly visible and can be measured and recorded.  Others are less tangible but even more corrosive and destructive in their effects.</P>
    <P>The major failure of this Coalition Government has been unemployment. The present figures are horrendous. When the registered number of 240,000 unemployed and the 80,000 who have emigrated in the last four years are taken together, the overall picture amounts to a national catastrophe.  The figures mean that a major shift has taken place in our population structure.  As a result of that shift, the ability of a smaller working population to sustain a growing dependent sector is seriously diminished.</P>
    <P>The situation is so ominous that it demands a dramatic emergency type response from the Government.  They should give some indication that they are aware of the real implications of the figures and put forward some positive programme of action.  Instead of any such response, Government Ministers can do <Col N="315" /> no more than engage in destructive, sterile politics, attack positive Fianna Fáil proposals and invent imaginary ones to attack us.</P>
    <P>Is there any point in reminding the members of this Government that they came into office pledged to halt and reverse the growth in unemployment? They do not seem to appreciate that they have lost all credibility on this issue.  They do not seem to be concerned either about the effects and implications of permanent, mass unemployment and how it undermines the very basis of society.  In human terms mass unemployment is a degradation; in economic terms it is an absurdity.  Instead of the individual being in a position to make the beneficial contribution in goods and services to the community of which he or she is capable, that individual is condemned instead to a demoralising state of reliance and dependency.</P>
    <P>Unemployment at present is 65,000 higher than when this Government took office and when emigration is taken into account the real number of unemployed persons for whom this Government are responsible is away above 300,000.  This Government have been consistently dishonest over the past three years in claiming that the unemployment trend has improved.  The Taoiseach made that fraudulent claim here on 3 July of this year and on a number of occasions since, even though there has been massive emigration and the labour force dropped by 9,000 in the last recorded year.  The Taoiseach has never told the truth, but has misrepresented the statistics to give a false illusion of improvement, when there has in fact been none.</P>
    <P>It is not just that unemployment and emigration are rising steadily.  The numbers in employment have also contracted sharply and fallen back to what they were in 1975 at least.  They are probably even lower today because the latest figures we have are nearly 18 months out of date.</P>
    <P>During the first two and a quarter years of this Coalition, the period for which we have figures, a net 60,000 jobs disappeared. Year after year the Taoiseach <Col N="316" /> claimed that the fall in employment had come to a halt.  For example, on 11 March 1985 the Taoiseach claimed and I quote: &ldquo;Already, there is a perceptible quickening in the pulse of economic activity ...In particular, employment should soon begin to pick up&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>All over the country, as a result of the failure of this Government's employment policies, young people have despaired of finding jobs and more and more adult workers are being thrown out of employment. It is a bad, depressing, heart-rending scene.  Families are being broken up and communities disrupted as young people leave in an increasing flood.</P>
    <P>The drain of emigration has opened once more in our towns and countryside. For those who are familiar with the pattern of life in rural areas in particular, one of the saddest manifestations of the reality of this haemorrhage is the inability of the parish or village to field the traditional football or hurling team because the young people have gone.</P>
    <P>Under this Coalition the country has been forced back to the situation of 30 years ago.  Young people are going away in frustration and despair, but families are also selling up and going because they have lost confidence.  Members of this House who are also members of local authorities know from the housing lists the extent to which emigration is eating into and undermining local communities. In many areas houses are being left on the local authorities' hands as families emigrate.  In Dublin city and county, for instance, the figures are startling.  In 1982 there were 2,117 dwellings available for letting.  At the end of 1985 that figure has increased to 3,642.  A new insidious doctrine is now emanating from right-wing Fine Gael circles.  They would have us believe that a certain proportion of our young people should and must emigrate as part of the normal economic process.</P>
    <P>Before this Coalition came along, most of us thought that this defeatist acceptance of emigration was something that had been banished from Irish life since the sixties.  The fact that it is now manifesting itself again with such devastating <Col N="317" /> force is one of the greatest single demonstrations of the failure of this incompetent and ineffective Government.  To us in Fianna Fáil acceptance of emigration as a normal feature of our national life would be the ultimate in defeatism.  To end it successfully was Fianna Fáil's great achievement in the sixties.  To eliminate it again from Irish life will be our objective in the eighties.</P>
    <P>This Government have not met either the objectives in the Joint Programme for Government or the subsequently scaled down objectives set out by themselves for themselves in that great bogus document, <i>Building on Reality 1985-1987.</i> Unemployment rose and rose, even though the labour force actually fell.  The fall in 1984-85 was 9,000 as a result of massive emigration while <i>Building on Reality 1985-1987</i> had actually forecast an annual increase of 15,000.</P>
    <P>The new industrial strategy announced in the summer of 1984 was supposed to lead to an increase of between 3,000 and 6,000 net new jobs in industry, and an increase in service employment of about 7,000 a year.  In fact, manufacturing employment declined by 5,800 in 1985 according to the IDA.  Service employment also fell by 4,000 between 1984 and 1985.  These figures reflect the disintegration of this Coalition's employment policy.  They leave the Government without even the semblance of a credible policy for the most important area of policy, namely employment.</P>
    <P>What have the Employment Task Force of the Cabinet, announced with such a flourish in 1982, been doing all this time? Any Government who have presided over a major contraction in the number of jobs available while the need for jobs was growing all the time, whose whole employment strategy has aborted, should not even attempt to claim credibility for their economic policy.</P>
    <P>New investment in industry has largely dried up over the last four years.  New projects and job approvals have been running at virtually half the level that was experienced in the years 1979-82.  Even the best and most intense public relations efforts are not able to gloss over the <Col N="318" /> deterioration in the employment situation. At the same time, if a Government consistently, and as a matter of calculated economic policy, permits major projects in important national companies to go one after the other without lifting a finger to help and often in fact precipitates their closure by their own action, it is inevitable that the dole queues will lengthen and emigration increases.</P>
    <P>This Government have no credibility whatever left in regard to the public finances.  To his eternal discredit, the present Taoiseach, recklessly and irresponsibly as far back as 1981 set out, for his own partisan, political purpose to make the public finances of this country a party-political football.  He mobilised all the resources of the Fine Gael propaganda machine for this campaign and he did this without regard to the detrimental effects such a campaign would have on financial stability and economic development and investment.  They unscrupulously and consistently built up a false picture about the handling of our public finances and about borrowing.  They fed out a constant stream of misrepresentation of the facts.  They are continuing to do so.  The true history of the Irish public finances shows that the sharp deterioration in our public finances began under the 1973-77 Coalition.  Under it, current public expenditure increased by 42 per cent in real terms.  The 1973-77 National Coalition broke all public spending records, being responsible in 1975 for an increase in current spending of 42 per cent and an increase in the public service pay bill of 50 per cent.  The highest level of Government borrowing ever was 16 per cent of GNP in 1975.  The highest current budget deficit overrun was also in 1975, when there was an overrun of 107 per cent.  Inflation, that same year went to 24½ per cent.</P>
    <P>Let us also remember that in the days of the 1973-77 Coalition when Dr. Garret FitzGerald was again waxing as the economic prophet of the Government, inflation was in fact 24½ per cent, and he has the temerity to come in here and talk about inflation and reducing it.</P>
    <P>Our national finances today, after four <Col N="319" /> years of Coalition, are in the worst state they have been since the foundation of the State.</P>
    <P>There is a major crisis of confidence and chaos in the financial market.  The crisis of confidence has been brought about by the massive overrun on current Government expenditure this year, by the record current budget deficit forecast for this year of £1,500 million and by the disastrous imposition of the DIRT in the 1986 budget.</P>
    <P>The crisis manifests itself in the massive outflow of capital from the country, the inability of institutions and individuals to sell the Government stocks they hold, the inability of the Government to borrow on the domestic market the vast amount of money they need to keep going to the end of the year and the damaging and detrimental increase in interest rates.</P>
    <P>In addition to their general mismanagement of the economy during the last four years there have been also a number of specific situations which have been disastrously mishandled and caused heavy losses to the Exchequer and the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>The very dubious arrangements made and the bad judgment shown in dealing with Dublin Gas have cost the Exchequer at least £100 million.</P>
    <P>The ill-judged, panic-stricken way in which our national shipping company, Irish Shipping, was suddenly liquidated has probably cost the Exchequer about £175 million.  One of the ships belonging to the people of this country which was worth over £30 million has been disposed of for £2 or £3 million.</P>
    <P>The Insurance Corporation of Ireland debacle has been responsible for adding £226 million to the liabilities of this nation.</P>
    <P>This Government stood by and allowed our only ship-building yard, the Verolme dockyard to be put into liquidation.  That liquidation need not have happened.  As a result of it, however, valuable assets worth at least £15 million even on a break up value are now being given away by the liquidator for about £2 million; it will <Col N="320" /> be interesting in due course to ascertain to whom exactly.</P>
    <P>The whole picture is one of culpable mismanagement and incompetence by a Government who have again and again mishandled any economic situation that called for sound judgment and foresight.</P>
    <P>It has been one long procession of blunders with losses running into many hundreds of millions.  The handling of the situations I have mentioned, alone, by this Coalition Government has cost the taxpayer of this country more than £500 million.</P>
    <P>The management of the State's finances has been marked by bad judgment and vacillation.  It has brought us record deficits, soaring interest rates and a general collapse of financial confidence.</P>
    <P>This Coalition made a basic and fatal error of policy when at the outset they took the decision to reduce the budget deficit through higher taxation only.  That policy has been totally counterproductive. The increasing burden of taxation imposed in budget after budget has had the inevitable consequence of depressing the economy further and further. It has forced the economy into a downward spiral which fed on itself, until it has reached the present disastrous state of affairs.</P>
    <P>Under this Coalition we have become a heavily overtaxed economy and the clear proof of this is the fact that over the last four years revenues have regularly fallen short of the projected targets.  The Irish economy is as a result of the high-tax policies of this Coalition in a state of diminishing returns.</P>
    <P>The present devastated state of the building and construction industry can be attributable directly to Coalition policy. The capital budget was steadily reduced over four years until it is now in real terms only two thirds of what it was in 1982; the increase in VAT on building and construction from 3 per cent to 10 per cent, in the curtailment of the highly successful section 23 incentives, have all combined to devastate that once proud and successful industry.</P>
    <P>Even more damaging have been the <Col N="321" /> tax measures directed at the investment market.  This Government did not seem to realise that we are not a closed economy, that in practice exchange controls can be of limited effectiveness only against powerful market forces.  Measures that shake confidence or provoke a flight of capital from the country should have been carefully avoided, whatever theoretical arguments could be made in their favour.</P>
    <P>The Fine Gael record on devising new kinds of taxes is very bad.  The residential property tax for instance, costs the maximum to administer and yields the minimum in revenue.  The land tax is heading in the same direction.  The `bond-washing' measures in the 1984 budget had an effect on confidence, and it may not have been entirely coincidental that the `black hole' phenomenon first began to loom large in the spring of 1984.  The introduction of the DIRT was the Coalition's latest and by far the most disastrous experiment.  Recently, the full extent of damage done by this ill-considered, hurriedly devised tax has become apparent.</P>
    <P>Following its introduction there was a dramatic fall of £500 million in resident bank deposits and a further £180 million fall in non-resident, current and deposit accounts in the first eight months of this year.  A massive £1.5 billion of the savings of the Irish people has been taken out of the State since the autumn of last year.</P>
    <P>Dr. Antoin Murphy of Trinity College has stated &mdash; and I quote him from <i>Business and Finance,</i> 16 October &mdash; that there has been a loss of confidence which has been accentuated by DIRT.  The <i>Irish Press</i> on 4 October quoted a named stockbroker as saying that the market seems to have little confidence in the Government.  I would suggest that to be a classic understatement.</P>
    <P>Even though the Coalition spokesmen attacked our proposal to abolish DIRT it is known that soon after it had been announced it was made clear to the Coalition that they had made a major mistake in introducing DIRT and its abolition as a retention tax in 1987 was considered.</P>
    <P>Under this Government, for the first <Col N="322" /> time, the Irish currency has come under sustained speculative pressure.  The policy of Fianna Fáil Governments, from 1979 to 1982, was to keep the Irish pound stable during EMS realignments.  It was the Coalition budget of 1981 which added six points to the rate of inflation that first pushed us out of line with our EMS partners and subjected this policy to some strain.  The substantial devaluation by the Coalition, in March 1983, added about £400 million to our foreign debt.  This year, at the time of the alignment in March, the Minister for Finance first rejected devaluation and said that it was extremely shortsighted to consider devaluation as benefiting exports from a country that was so greatly dependent on importing raw materials and that any price advantage would be very quickly whittled away.</P>
    <P>A few months later, however, he devalued by 8 per cent unilaterally and at the worst possible time.  That devaluation increased the burden of our foreign debt by at least another £250 million.</P>
    <P>This Government, having added £650 million to the burden of our foreign debt by devaluations of the Irish pound, have the audacity to talk about responsibility and credibility in handling the public finances.  Interest rates have risen by several percentage points for the second time this year, with the likelihood that mortgage rates will rise by 4 per cent. Ordinary borrowers could be facing overdraft rates of 19 per cent, while industry and agriculture could be facing rates of 17 per cent.  Such rates will be above the rates prevailing in December 1982 when this Government took office, even though interest rates have fallen dramatically all over the world since.  Today there is a real interest rate of over 10 per cent for the vast majority of borrowers in this country.</P>
    <P>The business and the finance communities have clearly voted no confidence in this Coalition Government.  They have, by their actions, stated in the clearest possible terms that they do not believe the Government any longer. They have not accepted as genuine this Coalition's statement of intent in regard <Col N="323" /> to next year's budget.  The target has been shifted too often.  That represents a very disturbing departure in our affairs and the way our country is governed.</P>
    <P>If a Government are doing their job properly the financial institutions and the operators in the money market adapt to Government fiscal and economic policy and get on with their own business.  What has recently been happening however is that, because the Government have totally failed to control Government expenditure and adhere to their own stated budgetary targets, the money market instead of fulfilling their proper, subsidiary role of providing a financial service to the public and private sectors have taken over control and are now deciding the course of events.  They have taken over the Government's role in this crucial area.</P>
    <P>This Government came into office with a solemn undertaking to eliminate the current budget deficit by 1987, later reduced to a promise to bring it down to 5 per cent of GNP.  Far from doing anything of the kind, they ran the budget deficit up to 8.4 percent of GNP last year.  This year it is likely to be £1,500 million or close to 9 per cent of GNP.</P>
    <P>In 1985 borrowing in relation to GNP, reached the highest level ever, 134 per cent.  In 1986 we will see the highest level of the nation's income output ever taken in taxation, 37 per cent of GNP.  Is it any wonder, with that sort of performance, that the hard-headed decision-makers in the money market openly scoffed at them when this discredited Government came up, last Thursday night, with yet another revised target &mdash; a promise to reduce the current budget deficit next year to 7.5 per cent of GNP?  First, it was zero, then 5 and now it is 7.5 per cent.  The market just refused to believe it and said so.</P>
    <P>The failure to make any progress towards achieving their economic financial targets has knocked the heart out of workers and employers alike.</P>
    <P>This Coalition Government have failed to defend and protect the interests of the Irish people, in so far as the nuclear menace is concerned.  Because they have <Col N="324" /> abandoned any attempt to maintain an independent Irish foreign policy they seem to be reluctant or unable to speak out and act when they should.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil have, time and again, raised the issue of the threat that British nuclear installations, especially Sellafield, pose to the health and safety of the people of this country.  We have also, in international affairs, fully supported the concept of multi-lateral nuclear disarmament.</P>
    <P>This Coalition Government, however, have been completely ineffective and inarticulate about these issues.  I suspect this is because they do not wish to offend, or to be considered difficult or troublesome. They now have a vested interest in rowing along and keeping quiet.</P>
    <P>The fall-out from the Chernobyl nuclear accident, however, and the, as yet, unquantified and unknown dangers arising from the sinking off the American coast of a fully-armed Russian nuclear submarine have brought home, more vividly than ever before to an alarmed general public, the danger that both civil and military nuclear power represent in our modern world.  Ministers of this Government, when pressed to take action over Sellafield to safeguard the health and safety of the Irish people, tried to suggest that the matter could be dealt with through the machinery of the European Community.  That has been demonstrated to be a completely futile exercise.  But the Coalition will still not pursue the issue firmly and resolutely with the British Government as a bilateral issue, as they should.</P>
    <P>Their negligence in dealing with this issue and taking action to protect the Irish people from the nuclear danger that exists all around us, either in the field of foreign policy or in our domestic arrangements, would in itself be sufficient grounds for Dáil Éireann passing a vote of no confidence in this Government even apart from the disastrous state of the finances and the economy.</P>
    <P>This Government have shattered the morale and the confidence of the Irish people.  Not content with doing that they <Col N="325" /> are now embarked on a deliberate, calculated campaign to undermine confidence in the only alternative available to the people, the only party to whom the people can turn to get the country out of its present difficulties.</P>
    <P>The leadership of Fine Gael and Labour know better than anyone that the country needs a reasonable period of stable, one-party Government and that only Fianna Fáil can provide such a Government.  They know that the worst possible thing that could happen to the country at this stage would be another period of political uncertainty and instability in Government.  They know the danger from greater political fragmentation. They cannot believe that it is in the best interest of the country to have another prolonged period of Government by bargaining and compromise.</P>
    <P>They are not doing parliamentary democracy in our country any service by deciding, as they would appear to have decided, that their campaign will be a completely destructive one and that their energies will be devoted, not to a In tting to defend their own record, but to a sterile, strident campaign of abuse, attack and vilification.</P>
    <P>The present Taoiseach has often lectured the Irish people about political standards.  Where are they now?  Where are the high sounding moralistic sentiments we have all had to listen to so often in the past?  The general election campaign has not yet commenced, but already the shape it will take is beginning to emerge.  Certainly the sort of tactics Fine Gael will rely on were clearly indicated at their Ard Fheis last weekend. That was not a pretty sight.  Fine Gael made it clear that whatever they are going to do, they are not going to go down with dignity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>They are not going to go down at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Because they have no hope under the sun of attempting to defend their own record over the past four years; because there is that long list of broken promises on the record, the <Col N="326" /> numerous targets set one after the other and discarded, they have no hope of being believed in regard to any future policies which they may put forward. They clearly intend, therefore, to be totally destructive.  Their campaign will be a negative, destructive, abusive one.  They must attack because they cannot defend.</P>
      <P>Their principal target will, of course, be Fianna Fáil but the Labour Party should take note of some stones being cast in their direction.  Already the Fine Gael handlers are assiduously feeding out the message that Fine Gael could have avoided the present crisis and could do much better in the future if only they were free of this burden of the Labour Party.</P>
      <P>What is the position of the Coalition Parties, following the Taoiseach's statement at the Fine Gael Ard Fheis?  The Taoiseach has clearly stated that this present Government will not be seeking re-election.  For that relief much thanks but that poses some very interesting questions. If the Taoiseach is not prepared to recommend his present Coalition Government to the people in the next general election, surely this means that he has lost confidence in them?  He has clearly signalled that he does not wish to stand over this Coalition in a general election or to carry on with them in the future.  If he has lost confidence in his Government, how can he ask the Dáil to vote confidence in them?</P>
      <P>Deputy FitzGerald is now, in effect saying to the Labour Party that he is finished with them and that he proposes to jettison them as soon as it suits his purpose.  The Labour Party are being told publicly that their only function now is to keep Fine Gael in office until it suits Fine Gael to call a general election.  Thereafter they can be of no further use.  Are the Labour Party prepared to accept this open insult, this public humiliation?  Are they prepared subserviently to continue to vote to keep Fine Gael in Government until such time as it suits Fine Gael to discard them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I find it incredible that any party like the Labour Party, with their own history and traditions, would publicly accept <Col N="327" /> such deliberate denigration.  The Labour Party have a philosophy and a set of principles which have been at the basis of their existence as a separate political entity and which their supporters expect them to serve.  How can that party now play the subsidiary, supporting role allotted them by the Taoiseach on Saturday night last, of keeping him in office until he decides to go?</P>
    <P>The lower this Coalition sink in public opinion the more absurd and removed from everyday reality the Taoiseach and his Ministers become in their statements and accusations.  There seems to be no limit to the level of political diatribe to which they will not resort.  I listen with increasing incredulity to what they are saying and the false accusations they fabricate and the ridiculous claims they make.</P>
    <P>I invite Deputies to look at another proposition that has been, and in spite of all that has happened, will continue to be put forward to the public.  This is the time-worn theory that Fine Gael and Fine Gael are alone the party of principle and integrity.</P>
    <P>In the 1981 election campaign the Fine Gael Leader, Deputy FitzGerald, the present Taoiseach, promised that if elected he would give every housewife in the country £9.60 in cash directly into her hand.  She did not have to go to the post office for it.  It would be delivered through her letterbox.  He also promised to reduce the standard rate of income tax to 25 per cent, a proposition which incidentally has surfaced again from another right wing direction.  He did not bother to honour either of those two promises.  But Fine Gael are the party of principle and integrity and, accordingly this could not possibly have been a piece of dishonest political opportunism on their part.</P>
    <P>On coming into office this time in 1982 Fine Gael promised to reduce unemployment. During their four years in office unemployment has soared to record levels and, in addition, about 80,000 people have emigrated.  That, however, could not be their fault because surely a party of principle and integrity <Col N="328" /> do not dishonour their pledges in this way.</P>
    <P>When they came into office this time in 1982 they also promised to eliminate the current budget deficit by 1987.  Four years later, the current budget deficit this year will be £1,500 million &mdash; the highest ever recorded.  But the party of integrity and principle cannot be blamed for this failure.  It must, of course, be someone else's fault.</P>
    <P>At the start of this period in office the spokesmen of the party of principle and integrity spoke firmly and resolutely about controlling Government expenditure and reducing borrowing, particularly foreign borrowing.  As the party of principle and integrity they remain of course firmly committed to these objectives even though as it happens the national debt has been practically doubled in four years, the greatest amount ever will be borrowed abroad this year and Government expenditure is well out of control.  However, it must be understood that their principles and their integrity are still intact because the Minister for Finance has promised that he is quite determined to cut Government expenditure next year.</P>
    <P>This high-minded party of principle and integrity promised that in their administration there would be no jobs for the boys.  The principle it must be realised is still revered even though the boards of every State company and agency are stuffed with Fine Gael financial subscribers and party activists.  Presumably, however, they are all men and women of high principle and integrity.</P>
    <P>I wanted to leave the Dublin Gas Company out of this debate because the Fine Gael people involved in that situation were very special people and it does not really affect the general overall level of principle and integrity for which Fine Gael are still well known and respected.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach as leader of the party of principle and integrity when he came into office made the ringing statement that he would always tell the people the truth.  The fact that he has time and time again misled the Dáil and the public about the state of the economy, the <Col N="329" /> trends in employment and the state of the public finances may be somewhat difficult to reconcile with that original statement, but we can be certain that he will not be prevented from claiming that in spite of any apparent contradiction, principle and integrity are still very much the hallmark of Fine Gael.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach and the Tánaiste know they can do no good by hanging on to office.  They are running a lame duck Government.  In the present state of affairs they can achieve nothing.  There is no point in hanging on.  The economic and financial problems facing the country are of an overwhelming nature.  A Government which cannot be certain of their position from day to day cannot possibly act in the radical courageous way the situation demands.</P>
    <P>It is seriously irresponsible for the Taoiseach and Tánaiste to allow the situation drag on any longer.  The present atmosphere of political instability is preventing any economic initiatives and is actually undermining the financial base of the State.  Soaring interest rates and the outflow of capital are clear indications of a complete lack of confidence at every level.  There is widespread agreement that this situation will continue until there is a general election.  The Taoiseach owes it to the country to bring the present crisis to an end.  The Government are paralysed and cannot formulate or implement any worthwhile policies or programmes. They can no longer claim to serve any legitimate purpose by remaining in office. In fact, the opposite is the case.  They are prolonging the present damaging climate of instability and indecision.  By refusing to bring the present uncertainty to an end in the only way possible the members of this Government are doing real harm. They are now doing measurable damage to the economy and our financial resources and they are also damaging our prospects for future recovery.</P>
    <P>This Coalition of Fine Gael and Labour lost the confidence of the people a long time ago.  They have succeeded in losing the confidence of the business community, the farmers, the workers, the trade unionists and the young.  Worse <Col N="330" /> than that, four years of Coalition under fumbling and incompetent leadership have brought this country to its knees. They have destroyed not only the people's faith in the Government, but they have undermined the people's faith in themselves.  Deputy FitzGerald and his Coalition have shattered morale.  They have spread their depressing mantle of failure over the entire nation.</P>
    <P>The Coalition are now desperately clinging to office as an end in itself.  They are hanging on when every responsible voice in the community is calling for an end to political uncertainty.  If the Taoiseach and this Government just for once practiced the honesty and integrity about which they used to preach they would surely recognise that their Administration has been a failure in terms of its own objectives and targets and that they can only cause further serious damage to our economy and to our financial stability by lingering on.  The flight of well over £1 billion from the country in recent months, the inability of the Government to fund their borrowing requirements from the domestic market indicate the seriousness of the situation.  Only the calling of a general election can resolve the present damaging uncertainty.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has failed to provide either competent or effective leadership over the last four years.  His promise to tell the people the truth has not been adhered to.  He has misrepresented the situation all along the line and did so more than ever last weekend at the Árd-Fheis.</P>
    <P>His policies have not had any success. Yet for a long time he claimed that things were improving, even claiming at one stage that we had the healthiest economy in Europe when every economic indication told him the opposite.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach always tries to blame others for his own failures.  He has been doing this for a long time now in regard to the deep crisis which he has precipitated in the public finances.</P>
    <P>He has now found a new target.  He wants to shift the blame for his own disastrous management of the economy on to the backs of the workers.  Absenteeism <Col N="331" /> is the real problem he says, and workers are closing down their own factories.  It is not apparently his mismanagement of the foreign exchange rate of the Irish pound; it is not the crushing levels of taxation, nor the lack of competitiveness arising from high interest rates, the high cost of energy and local services; it is not even ineffective management.  Foreign companies will not invest here, according to the Taoiseach, because of the failings of Irish workers.</P>
    <P>Unemployment is at an all time high. Our productive base is contracting alarmingly. Thousands of farmers are being forced out of business by harsh weather and harsh pricing policies without protection from the Government.  The level of taxation is crushing and totally out of line with our immediate neighbours.  Our position in the EC is being steadily eroded.</P>
    <P>After the abject performance of the past four years the Taoiseach has the audacity to put down a motion of confidence in this discredited Government. He may use his temporary artificial majority to secure such a vote here in the Dáil.  He certainly would not get it outside it.  This Government have not a single substantial, positive achievement to their name.  Their promises have been broken, their projections inaccurate, their judgment faulty, their actions disastrous, their excuses pathetic.  Promises for the future have no credibility left, when matched with the experience of the last four years.  In their terminal condition this Government are no longer in a position to govern effectively or to take decisions.  Every day longer they stay in office is another day wasted in the life of the nation.</P>
    <P>The basis of our no confidence motion is that the Coalition Government have been a failure.</P>
    <P>In their period of four years of Government they have failed to improve the situation of our people in any one single respect.  They are now in a state of political paralysis, which renders them totally incapable of dealing with the <Col N="332" /> economic and financial crisis facing our country.</P>
    <P>It may appear to many that this Government, as they go down, seem to want to pull the whole house down around them.  The financial situation will not come right as long as political instability continues.  The only way to restore the situation is through a general election and a new Government.  The members of the Coalition parties know that is the case and they also know that every extra day this Coalition stay in office the more harm is done to our prospects for economic recovery.</P>
    <P>There is no point in their remaining in office, because they can do nothing, achieve nothing, solve nothing.  No Deputy in this House looking at the state of the economy today can possibly claim that he or she has any confidence in this Government or in their ability at this stage to bring any improvement in our affairs.  If Deputies vote in accordance with the realities, the Government motion will be rejected by a large majority.</P>
    <P>Let me conclude by summarising those realities.  The Coalition have failed to curtail Government expenditure; incurred massive budget deficits; practically doubled the national debt; raised taxes to unprecedented disincentive levels and driven a massive amount of the nation's capital out of the country.</P>
    <P>They have created massive unemployment and large scale emigration. They have seriously damaged the economy with no growth for four years, brought about the collapse of industry and investment and deserted the farmers at a time of crisis.</P>
    <P>They have dangerously curtailed the health services and inflicted widespread hardship and deprivation right across the community.  They have shattered national morale and confidence and failed to protect the interests of the people in a number of vitally important areas.</P>
    <P>Can any Deputy in this House in conscience give a vote of confidence to a Government with that abysmal record of <Col N="333" /> failure and incompetence?  It is time to bring the nightmare to an end.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond) Barry Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Haughey's analysis of the interest rate and financial problems facing the country have been simplistic in the extreme.  The Deputy argues first that a general election is the immediate and most urgent necessity to right the situation &mdash; without giving any indication of how this might bring down the level of interest rates.  The Deputy also argues that the Dublin gift market has shown that it has no confidence in this Government and that, therefore, the Government cannot continue.  Deputy Haughey's third major argument is that DIRT tax should be abolished since this, the Deputy says, is causing money to leave the country, thus creating high interest rates.</P>
      <P>Taking each of these arguments in turn there is no doubt that in this, as in most other countries, the prospect of a general election has a very destabilising effect on financial markets, with confidence weakening since no one knows with certainty what the next Government or their policies will be.  These uncertainties are especially great in the Irish context with six political parties, the IRA and independents contesting the next election.  It appears very unlikely that there will be a clear majority for a single party, so that lengthy negotiation on alternative Government possibilities is now very likely to follow the next election.</P>
      <P>However, Deputy Haughey is unrealistic in suggesting that an election, if followed by a new Fianna Fáil Government, would suddenly lead to financial stability, low interest rates and confidence in the hearts of those financial experts and their clients utilising the gilt or other financial markets for their transactions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I detected a note of apology on the part of Deputy Haughey in a rather poor recent letter to <i>The Irish Times</i> on 14 October 1986.  He put forward a very weak argument in the form of a rhetorical question asking if it is not an almost universal rule in parliamentary democracies <Col N="334" /> everywhere that a change of Government at least temporarily brings a surge of hope and optimism.  Having listened to Deputy Haughey, that prospect is rather grim.  I have never come across any such rule in political theory or philosophy and I suspect that this &ldquo;almost universal&rdquo; principle has been invented to comfort the nerves of a worried Fianna Fáil after the more recent &ldquo;own goals&rdquo; of their Leader concerning the Anglo-Irish Agreement and his having hatched yet another clutch of day old promises in Cork city.</P>
    <P>The advent of a party in government already committed to spending much more and at the same time taxing much less, with their appalling record of relying on ever more borrowing to finance the yawning gap between wild expenditure plans and actual Government revenue could do nothing but cause terror rather than bringing hope and optimism for anyone dealing on the financial markets.</P>
    <P>Secondly, it is argued by Deputy Haughey that the Dublin gilt market has shown that it has no confidence in the Government who should, therefore, resign.  In this line of argument Deputy Haughey appears to be suggesting that this democratically elected Government should meekly hand over their decision making powers and functions to those in the financial markets whose main job is to secure and ensure their wealthy clients who have money available for financial investment get a much better return in order to build their fortunes even higher. Any party who are prepared to abnegate the democratic powers of government because of the views of a small, private and self-seeking group of individuals are not fit to govern.</P>
    <P>The third major argument proposed by Deputy Haughey is that most of the current difficulties have been caused by the DIRT tax which should not be withdrawn. These calls for the abolition of taxes impinging on the wealthy, whether the land tax, the income related property tax or almost any form of capital taxation, are unfortunately becoming too familiar in Ireland where those with wealth, property and influence seek to minimise their taxation in order to conserve the moneys <Col N="335" /> they have and which for the most part they have no intention of investing in productive enterprise.</P>
    <P>Deputy Haughey knows quite well that the financial institutions have by now paid the DIRT tax for 1986 which they were obliged to pay.  It is outrageous that Deputy Haughey should propose that not only should they get back the £75 million but that next year they should not be obliged to pay any money at all.  That is the level of his contribution this evening. We rate the need to maintain our social services much higher than the petulant objections of those with money on deposit to paying a mere 35 per cent to the Government on the interest only from their accumulated deposit funds compared with the 58 per cent paid by those very moderately off but also within the PAYE sector.  The DIRT tax is a fair and reasonable one which will take only standard rate tax which should have been paid anyway from very many depositors. We must now accept that some of those depositors have been dodging taxes for years and are, therefore, trying to get their untaxed gains out of the Government's tax net.  Because of the extreme difficulty in operating effective exchange controls in the open trading Irish economy and because the banking system is in any event hostile to the tax, they have availed of opportunities, legal and otherwise, to transfer funds.</P>
    <P>I would strongly point out we should not confuse speculation with our major trading currency transactions which require very substantial management of funds on a day-to-day basis.  I have not the slightest objection to that form of management but I abhor any major effort, which has occurred, to evade exchange controls.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil, in effect, in arguing against the DIRT tax are saying that they support those who would dodge, evade and avoid tax.  They are saying that if you are relatively well off in Ireland you should not be forced to pay tax or have it deducted at source as does the PAYE taxpayer.  In arguing against DIRT, Deputy Haughey is stating most clearly <Col N="336" /> that he supports the avoidance of tax and that in any future Government he would accommodate the rich while taxing the poor.  This is the nub of the argument. The money for 1986 is now in in relation to the DIRT tax.  Is Deputy Haughey going to refund that money?  Is he going to abolish the prospect of bringing in substantial additional revenue over and above the figure I have mentioned from that tax in 1987?  I challenge him to come clean.  Apart from rhetoric and a ritualistic denunciation of the Government this evening there was not a shred of originality, new thinking, alternative tax measures or any other approach which would enlighten us as to how he would run the economy on a more effective basis.  Rather is he hoping, against hope I would submit, that the Government will fall and he will fall into Government without having to go through the exercise of coming clean on these fundamental issues.  I hope that will not happen and that the Deputy will get his answer tomorrow afternoon.</P>
    <P>The same applies not merely in relation to the DIRT tax but also to the land tax where a similar pattern emerges, which would increase the tax take from larger farmers while simplifying the system and cutting costs for small and medium-sized farmers.  Some IFA leaders, as with Fianna Fáil, have always sought to improve the lot of the relatively better off farmer on many good acres by arguing the case of the poor and smaller farmer. As a Labour Deputy, I am pleased to find growing support from many of those on small and medium-sized farms for a land tax which, while accepted as far from ideal by the Labour Party, is still regarded as a first reasonable step on the road to a fairer and more equitable tax system.</P>
    <P>The present problem with interest rates, as is well known to Fianna Fáil and to their financial advisers, has not been caused by any lack of confidence in the Government.  I might say it has been caused partly by those who endeavoured with Deputy Haughey right through the summer to hype an election at any cost, and particularly caused by those who hoped that if we had had an election by <Col N="337" /> now the money which has been paid in the last fortnight in relation to the DIRT tax would have escaped the net.  I hope that this democratically elected House will respond to that reaction.</P>
    <P>The four major causes of high interest rates in Ireland are, first of all, the refusal of the British Prime Minister, despite much sensible advice from her colleagues in Cabinet and many financial experts in the UK, to join the EMS.  Secondly, the fall of both British and US currencies has created long-lasting uncertainties in all financial markets of the world.  Thirdly, there is the growing problem in financial and currency markets worldwide of speculators with large sums of hot money but with no concern or feeling for their own countries or for anyone else prepared to use any instability in order to play the markets and to shift enormous sums of money from one country to another in the hope of making second fortunes over fairly small changes either in currency values or in interest rates. While there are a number of international speculators involved, it is worrying to think that people in Ireland, possessing the expertise and the privilege and opportunity which wealth brings, would use this in such a way as to make unavoidable the substantial rises in interest rates which we are experiencing and which drastically affect the small business, the first-time home buyer and many others. Obviously, Fianna Fáil have decided to abolish the DIRT tax and decided there are more votes to be won from the rich and powerful than from the poor and the underprivileged.</P>
    <P>Fourthly, there is the undeniable reality that we, in a society which still has wide and unfair differentials of income, are living well beyond our means on domestic and foreign borrowing and well above a prudent level of budget deficits. That is acknowledged and widely known. Hence, the added pressures on the domestic moneylending market.  This part of the equation cannot be ignored despite an over preoccupation by many commentators with the overrun on the 1986 budget deficit.</P>
    <P>I now want to deal with the Progressive <Col N="338" /> Democrats because their plans offer, as usual, large reductions in taxes for those on high incomes and they intend to maintain subsidies for the better off, particularly on mortgages and health insurance.  These are to be financed by drastic cuts in public expenditure in the areas of education, health and social welfare. On that basis the less well off will also suffer.  In that sense there is no difference between Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats.</P>
    <P>The Government who are under attack this evening have been a progressive Government.  We have no apologia whatsoever to offer to Dáil Éireann for our work over the past four years.  In a period of major recession we have ensured that the standard of living of the less well off in our community has been protected and improved.</P>
    <P>We have published the watershed report of the Commission on Social Welfare. We have enacted the multiple provisions of the Finance Acts, in 1983 to 1986 to curb tax evasion and avoidance; we have set up the National Development Corporation, the Combat Poverty Agency, the National Social Services Board and the Vocational Pension Board and we have reformed Bord Altranais and the psychiatric services and introduced major expansions of employment intervention schemes.  Without this Government there would have been no reform of the laws relating to contraception, adoption, status of children laws and there would have been no divorce referendum, irrespective of the result of that event.</P>
    <P>We stand over our record in Government and I scorn what I regard as the ignorant conservatives in opposition and the newspaper correspondents who want an election now simply for the hype.  I scorn those who have received VAT promises from the Fianna Fáil Party. Inevitably, we have the construction industry wishing to hitch themselves once again to a borrowing bonanza by Fianna Fáil.  Deputy Haughey has said that there is a better way but there is something far more important, an honest way.</P>
    <P>When we are dealing with that level <Col N="339" /> of honesty Northern Ireland is in many respects a watershed in terms of the approach of the Opposition to the problems there.  I deeply regret the successive U-turns by Deputy Haughey in relation to Northern Ireland and they alone ill fit him to ever occupy the position of Taoiseach:</P>

      <P>They were most unwelcome.  The extremists on both sides in Northern Ireland have sought for years to deepen the divisions between the people on this island and between Britain and Ireland.  In relation to the appalling approach of Deputy Haughey on Northern Ireland, many people have sought to characterise and even caricature this country as the enemy of one community or the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">

      <P>If the United Kingdom can no longer be the untrustworthy traditional enemy of the wilder republicans of the Fianna Fáil Party, if Ireland can no longer be the hostile foreign country for the wilder loyalists in Northern Ireland and, worse still, if Britain and Ireland are agreed on a joint policy towards Northern Ireland, then there is not an effective future for Deputies such as Deputy Haughey.  Indeed, there is no future at all for IRA candidates contesting Dáil seats or for other extremists such as the UVF doing so. That explains to a great extent the almost hysterical denunciation which is coming from the Fianna Fáil Party, particularly the Fianna Fáil leader.  The views he has advanced time and again have not been supported in relation to the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  I deeply regret that he has <Col N="340" /> decided to take such personal political advantage of the situation because it has been shown clearly that the majority of Fianna Fáil members are in favour of the agreement.  It has been shown clearly that the Deputy did not even discuss with his own Front Bench before he adopted his many oscillating attitudes towards the agreement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the general economic position, I must point out that we tend to look at the black and gloomy side of things and frequently fail to pinpoint or appreciate when general economic indicators are in our favour.  It is a matter of benefit to the economy that the level of inflation has fallen so dramatically, from the 20 per cent when the Government took office to the 3 per cent this year.  That has brought about considerable benefits.  It is also a considerable achievement for a small open economy that the balance of payments <Col N="341" /> deficit has come down from 14 per cent of GNP in 1981 to 3 per cent of GNP in 1985 with a trade surplus of £313 million, the first trade surplus since 1944.  It is also a matter of pride that the GNP is still on the upward side although not as high as we would have wished so that it would have an impact on tax revenue.  Nevertheless, it is on the increase.</P>
      <P>On the negative side I admit that unemployment has been very high but I must point out that the extension of unemployment benefit under the new EC equal treatment directive for women caused a sharp increase in the number of people registering as unemployed.  Inevitably it was reflected in the current figures. I am pleased also to state that for the fouth year in succession the Estimates of the Departments of Health and Social Welfare are again well within budget. That has been an exceptional achievement in a time of major recession.  I am concerned about the overrun in the current budget deficit but it is not one which is uncontrollable.  There are many nonrecurring items in that deficit.  I challenge Fianna Fáil on this issue.  I submit that if we had a much lower level of budget deficit as a percentage of GNP, or in real terms, inevitably we would have had increased poverty and instability.  The Government have sought to achieve the right budgetary balance in this area. Major cuts in State expenditure would have caused much more unemployment than at present and many schools and hospitals would have had to close and social welfare payments would have been reduced.  We have taken a calculated decision to maintain a relatively high budget deficit but, at the same time, we are ensuring that borrowing domestically and abroad will not be unduly excessive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to taxation levels I should like to make the point that the total burden of taxation in Ireland is not very high by international standards, nor has it worsened appreciably compared with other countries over the last decade. Indeed, measuring total tax as a percentage of GDP, Ireland came fairly consistently in sixth or seventh place among European countries from 1973 up to the <Col N="342" /> present.  The really heavily taxed countries in Europe are the Netherlands, Denmark, Belgium, France, Italy and Luxembourg with a much higher proportion of tax compared with national income than Ireland.  The real problem here is that there is still a high level of evasion and tax avoidance.  We have done a lot to tighten up the regulations and enforcement procedures.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil have an endemic infection overriding their whole economic approach to give all sorts of special exemptions from general taxation, often for the flimsiest of reasons.  The House will recall my confrontation, minor as it was, with the GAA in regard to taxation. In that regard we witnessed a classical example of Fianna Fáil yielding to those who want exemptions from the overall level of taxation.  We must point out to the people that if they want the services they demand in health, education, social welfare and so on then they have to be prepared to pay.  We must be prepared to put the blame on those irresponsible citizens who refuse or try to avoid paying their share of taxation.  However, Fianna Fáil have tried very hard to separate the revenue-gathering function of the Government from that of spending.  They have argued at the same time in a hypocritical way for lower Government taxation and higher Government expenditure.</P>
    <P>Regarding the general economic development work of Government, there is something of a schizophrenic nature in both the Fianna Fáil and PD economic policies.  It shows up very clearly in contrast with those sounder views of all the political parties in the sixties.  In the late eighties the PDs intend to implement drastic cuts in the Government's role and in the amount of tax gathered, while assuring us that essential Government services will be maintained.  The Fianna Fáil Party are even less in touch with reality than the PDs.  In a totally hypocritical way they are arguing simultaneously for less tax and, at the same time for more Government expenditure on nearly everything.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="343" /> The Labour Party put forward the view of Ireland as having a mixed economy with a strong role for both Government and private sector, as was the case in the sixties and the early seventies.  We have not performed any U-turns or reversals in our approach to that policy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>What about <i>Building on Reality</i>?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The greatest period of growth and progress in the Irish economy occurred in the context of a strong Government commitment to economic planning, a positive role for the Government in the economy and an emphasis on the valid role of both public and private sectors in economic development.  This is what occurred in the sixties and early seventies.  I think we have not fully realised that the role of an open economy which we accepted in those years, relying on imports and exports, involves penalties as well as advantages for our country. Our full acceptance of membership of the European Community and of free trade in goods and services has left us open to many more insecurities and uncertainties in international trade and business.  This is because as a small open economy we are very vulnerable to inevitable rapid currency fluctuations and interest rate changes and to unexpected changes in the economic circumstances of our trading partners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We need a return in many respects to the pioneering spirit of the sixties in order to combat our social and economic problems. I agree with the view recently expressed by Mr. P.J. Moriarty, chief executive of the ESB, when he called for that return.  The major problem of high unemployment requires a concerted effort by both the private sector and the State working together if it is to be solved, rather than the empty rhetoric of the New Right trying to create hostility between the private and public sectors and arguing that only private enterprise can successfully create jobs.  In Ireland's recent history and in our current problems it is quite clear that many private sector <Col N="344" /> companies &mdash; God knows, we have had a litany of them in recent years &mdash; have shown their inability to manage effectively or to create jobs all on their own.  In many respects they have created serious financial difficulties for the Government of the day.</P>
    <P>It is time to cast aside the negative criticism of the State, for its supposedly high levels of taxation and often as well for its failure to spend sufficient tax revenues on health, education, social welfare and so on.  We must realise that all the resources of this country must be devoted to development and to economic growth and, in particular, to caring for the disadvantaged in our society.  I assert that the State sector is neither an enemy to be cut down to size, as the PDs would endeavour to do&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Or the Minister's colleagues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;nor, as Fianna Fáil would suggest, is it the provider of largesse from some secret fund for every vociferous pressure group.  The way Deputy Haughey has caved in to those pressure groups in recent months is a matter of great concern.</P>
      <P>Ireland, the State, is all of the people of this country and all that they contribute in taxation.  It is their votes which decide how their money should be spent in providing the services, hospitals, schools and social welfare payments that we, the electorate, require and demand.</P>
      <P>I ask that we return to the more perceptive, more sensitive, better and more realistic understanding of the proper role of Government and the State which we began to accept in the sixties and up to about 1979 when, I regret to say, Deputy Haughey came on the scene.  I refer in particular to that famous leaflet of 1977 when rates were to be abolished and the country was to be led off into the promised soft land.  That never transpired.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Government have done an outstandingly good job in the past four years in maintaining the cohesion of our society.  I have been proud to participate as a Minister in this Government as <Col N="345" /> Deputy Leader of the Labour Party, along with my colleagues.  We were not prepared to turn our backs on our fellow Irish men, women and children for the sake of some theoretical, transient situation which could have come in years ahead.  We have made an effort and will continue making that effort to right current injustices and to work towards the implementation of our policies and clearly held ideals, even if on occasions the pace may seem too slow and too painful.  We have been proud to do this with the Taoiseach, Garret Fitzgerald, and his colleagues and we will continue to do so in the lifetime of this Dáil, however long or short that may be.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer to a few points made by the Minister for Health. When he talked about the DIRT tax affecting the rich he seemed to forget that, were it not for stubborn opposition from this side of the House, the old and the charities would have been mulcted to the tune of £35 per £100 of interest earned for their worthwhile causes.  That proposal got past the Minister for Health in the Cabinet and it was only because of pressure exerted by Fianna Fáil that the old and the charities were excluded from the ravages of the DIRT tax.  We did not succeed in saving the piggybanks of the young.  I am sure the Minister for Health is proud that he let that proposal past him in Cabinet.</P>
      <P>He also mentioned small farmers and expressed his great concern for them.  He more or less predicted Fianna Fáil as being supported by large farmers.  It is well known that the large farmers, who are to a great extent represented by the IFA, are not supporters of Fianna Fáil; the vast majority of small farmers support Fianna Fáil.  I know more about them in County Cavan than does the Minister in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown because to my knowledge it is not a constituency noted for large numbers of small farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another point the Minister made related to the DIRT tax.  He asked whether Deputy Haughey as Taoiseach would refund the 1986 contributions.  I see in that perhaps a straw in the wind <Col N="346" /> and an indication that Deputy Desmond believes that this Government will not survive until 31 December, 1986. However, a more important question would be what kind of policies a Fianna Fáil Government would implement to restore confidence in this country and its economy which might influence the people who, under the very noses of the Minister for Health and his Government, took £1.5 billion out of the economy.  We could do with it here for developmental and investment purposes and that was a more relevant question than those which Deputy Desmond asked.</P>
    <P>Deputy Desmond says that there is the undeniable reality that we are living well beyond our means.  I ask: who is making the decisions?  I shall come to the deficit on current accounts later, but if we are living beyond our means who is responsible? Surely the most powerful economic engine is the Government.  What are they doing about it?</P>
    <P>The reading out by the Minister for Health of something about Northern Ireland which was written into his script for him by the Taoiseach &mdash; I was watching the operation; there is not a word about Northern Ireland in his own script &mdash; was a pathetic exercise, indeed.  I am afraid that the motivation was not concern for Northern Ireland or the Six Counties, or the people living up there, but was a purely propagandist exercise.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health also said that in reality the total burden of taxation here is not very high and went on to compare it with other countries.  That was not what he was saying when Fianna Fáil were in Government and when he was supporting parades and campaigns on the basis that taxation here was too high.</P>
    <P>The last point I should like to make about Deputy Desmond's speech is in connection with his attack on the New Right, which I found very interesting.  The New Right to which he was referring &mdash; and it was barely concealed in his speech &mdash; was, of course, his colleagues, the young New Right, the young tigers of Fine Gael. Why does he not do this where it counts and where it is effective?  What is the point in making a generalised attack on <Col N="347" /> the New Right in the Dáil on this occasion?  I do not understand his method of approach in any way.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil, in calling on Dáil Éireann to vote no confidence in the Taoiseach and Government, simply express the views of the people of Ireland at the present time.  We are Deputies in the true sense of that word &mdash; we are bringing the views of the vast majority of the people of Ireland before this House for consideration. In voting no confidence, Dáil Éireann will be at one with the thinking of the people of Ireland, as anybody who is at all in touch with the electorate at present knows only too well.  The Taoiseach has, like the March hare, been careering madly up and down the country, trying to save the small percentage of support which he and his Government have at present.  During his careering around, he visited the constituency of Cavan-Monaghan.  While there, he spoke of the Government's competence in financial matters, about unemployment and emigration, about agriculture and about the North of Ireland.  The pseudo argument being advanced by the Taoiseach and his supporters is that in some way Fianna Fáil are responsible for the huge national debt, the huge national debt being as of now &mdash; taking foreign and domestic debt into account &mdash; something in the region of £22 billion.  It was something in the region of £12 billion when this Government took office.</P>
    <P>This is the fiscal rectitude, this is the financial competence, this is the expertise which we were told this Government would bring to bear on the finances of the country in the campaigns of 1982. Every Fianna Fáil speaker in this debate and every Fianna Fáil speaker throughout the country should take cognisance of the very heavy exercise in propaganda which is being conducted in this matter by the Taoiseach, by the national handlers through scores of speakers and scores of press releases, on the principle that if you repeat a lie often enough someone will believe you.  We should pin down the responsibility for the national debt to the end of 1986.  A solid estimate is that the <Col N="348" /> Coalition Government have been responsible for 62 per cent of that debt and, even higher still, 65 per cent of the foreign debt included in that figure for the national debt.</P>
    <P>Another major plank in the campaign conducted by the Coalition Government in 1982 and about which they continue to speak was the elimination of the current budget deficit.  Before they were very long in office they changed their tune and began to talk of the gradual elimination of the deficit.  I sat in this House last January and listened to the Minister for Finance stating that the deficit for 1986 for which he was budgeting would be £1,250 million.  The summer was barely over when there was considerable panic in the Government propaganda machine about the overrun.  Now we find that the current budget deficit will be up to £1,400 million or £1,500 million as Deputy Haughey, Leader of the Opposition, mentioned earlier.</P>
    <P>The Government spokesman debated about £180 million for the benefit of citizens who are battered by higher taxes and higher mortgage rates and savaged by bigger deductions from their pay-as-you-earn packets.  They realise that the talk should have been not about £180 million &mdash; and it was very cleverly confined to the discussion of the £180 million &mdash; but about the total overall deficit of £1,400 million or £1,500 million.  Again, with unparalleled effrontery, in Government propaganda the old hardy annual crops up &mdash; it cropped up in this debate &mdash; that Fianna Fáil are responsible in some way for this.  It is enough to make a duck vomit, when one realises that for almost nine of the last 13 years Coalition Governments have been in office.  They have the sad and sorry record of the highest budget deficit and the highest percentage increase in the national debt ever in this State.  As is well known, in 1975 there was an overrun on the current budget deficit of 107 per cent.  Again the apostles of fiscal rectitude, the holier-than-thou preachers of the 1982 campaign told us at that time how they would create an atmosphere suitable for industrial development.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="349" /> An amount of £1.5 billion, as I have mentioned already, is now conservatively estimated to have left the country in part of this year, some of it fleeing before the DIRT tax, some of it being taken out of the country by industrialists who made the profits in this country out of industries that were attracted here by Fianna Fáil when in office.  It is their entitlement to take the money out, but a Government which cannot restore confidence in these people for further investment are betraying the people and particularly the youth and are falling down on the promises which they made to the people in the campaign of 1982.</P>
    <P>This Government had a unique advantage over all Governments since 1973, in that the cost of oil has dropped dramatically in their period of office.  <i>The Economist</i> of 11 October 1986, volume 301, number 7467, page 111 quotes North Sea Brent at $14.25 per barrel.  That was a drop of 50.3 per cent in 12 months. Colossal sums of money that, due to the high prices, transferred to the coffers in Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Iran, Britain and other oil producing countries are now available to this country for development if the Government inspired confidence and gave the lead.  Instead, we have the ever-growing numbers unemployed, no confidence and no investment.</P>
    <P>When we decided to invest heavily in education in the seventies we did it so that young people would have the skills and the expertise for the development of their own country.  We visualised that they would deploy these skills and expertise in new manufacturing ventures in this country.  How can we blame the manufacturers who, having made a profit here, repatriate their money when they have no confidence in the economy as it is being directed and see no future for further development during the reign of this incompetent, feckless and luckless Government?  The background to the studies of young people between 1977 and 1981 was one in which the then Minister for Labour &mdash; and the House should not forget this &mdash; Deputy Gene Fitzgerald, advertised in the English newspapers and travelled over to Britain to <Col N="350" /> try to attract people back to the industries which had been established by us.</P>
    <P>The saddest fact of all during the reign of this Government is that of emigration. Young people whom I met in the United States this summer from my own area and from my own family circle are disillusioned and bitter.  Many of them have excellent qualifications.  Some of them are in the United States illegally and cannot use their qualifications to the full extent.  The ones who are legally there are the cream of our universities and particularly our engineering departments in the universities, as this House and the whole country knows.  Their skills are needed here.  If we had a Government who would give a lead, who would inspire confidence and who had any kind of developmental plan, those people would not have to emigrate.  They were not told this would happen to them.  They tend to be sceptical and cynical about all promises on development and who can blame them?  I refer in particular to those who developed skills in the construction area, whether civil engineers or otherwise. They have been deeply disenchanted. Statistics for May 1986 and July 1986 show that the building and construction industry has been halved.  Of the people who worked in the construction industry in 1980, there were only 56 per cent in May 1986 and 49.5 per cent in July 1986. From 1980 to July 1986 the building and construction industry was cut in two.  It has not merely been beheaded but has been truncated as well.</P>
    <P>There has been a campaign of sneering conducted by the Coalition Government with regard to Fianna Fáil's commitment to invest in the building and construction industry.  We have in the past delivered on promises and we shall do so again. This will be a heartwarming development for the many skilled people who are anxious to come home and for those who are on the dole.  The sad story of rural Ireland is being repeated.  The social fabric of rural Ireland is being wrecked.  Football clubs, drama societies and social groups have disintegrated as the youngest, fairest and most adventurous are simply walking away from the land in which they <Col N="351" /> want to stay.  The GAA conducted surveys in my county and discovered how grave is this problem.  Clubs have been decimated.  Is it any wonder when the rate of emigration is about 31,000 per annum?</P>
    <P>The Government put forward reduced inflation &mdash; the Minister for Health, Deputy Desmond has just done so &mdash; as a plus for them.  I have already given the figure for the fall in the price of crude oil for the last 12 months and earlier.  This is the basic reason for the drop in inflation. The Government can claim no credit for it.  OPEC are trying to remedy the situation and it is believed that there will be a slight rise in the price of oil.  The colossal rise in oil prices in 1979 was the reason for the rapid increase in inflation between 1979 and 1981.  We are never honest enough to admit these things in our political dealings.  There has been such poor achievement by this Government that they are ready to grasp at any straw, even provided by OPEC, to try to justify themselves.</P>
    <P>This Government, in which we have an opportunity to pass a no confidence vote, was the first Government in the history of the State which liquidated a 100 per cent Irish owned company.  It is ironic that Deputy Desmond, Minister for Health, should spend the latter part of his speech lauding State enterprises, attacking the New Right which he finds in Fine Gael, but still had not a word to say about the deliberate act of liquidation of Irish Shipping Limited.  It was liquidated by the Minister for Communications. We now know that the action was a hasty one.  If we look at the history of the Far Eastern company we will see what I mean by that.  Valuable ships were sold for a song.  The workers in Irish Shipping were left in the lurch after years of dedicated service and an excellent industrial relations record.  This Government will go down in history for this deed and for the shabbiness with which they treated citizens who had given superb service to this company.</P>
    <P>Today we read of another shipping debacle.  We opposed the Government's <Col N="352" /> expensive plan for the B &amp; I when it was announced.  The new arrangement got rid of 400 workers and now 370 more jobs are to be axed.  The whole shipping scene in Ireland is in chaos.  We have just had a period when there was no service from Rosslare.  I warned the Government in this House that that could happen.  It happened much more quickly than I expected it would.  Rumours abound that Irish shipping companies are about to take their ships off the Irish register.  Let the Minister slough off the expensive management and consultants in B &amp; I and get down to structuring a sensible and profitable operation in that company. We have had enough Tír na nÓg promises and programmes.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach, on his tour of Cavan-Monaghan, mentioned agriculture.  He would have to.  Neither the Taoiseach nor his Minister for Agriculture show much interest in or dedication to the development of agriculture.  Ask the farmers and supporters of Government from among the farmers and you will be able to gauge the extent of their disillusionment.  The Minister for Agriculture has indicated year after year since he took office how low he and his colleagues in Government estimate agriculture as an industry for investment.  There has been a drop of 43 per cent in State spending on agriculture during their period of office up to the end of last year.  This is a true indication of what they think about farmers and the prime industry in this country.  The Minister for Agriculture, when he took time off from belabouring the GAA and the bishops, also belaboured the people who have barely survived under severe pressure, under his incompetence and the bad weather we had over the last two years.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach's statement in Cavan-Monaghan takes the biscuit.  He attempted to pull the wool over the eyes of his hearers.  I quote from <i>The Anglo-Celt</i> of 18 September 1986.  This was a formal interview given by the Taoiseach to Mr. Tom Carron, a journalist with that newspaper:</P>
    <P>QUESTION &mdash; It was recently stated by a member of Cavan County <Col N="353" /> Committee of Agriculture, who met the Minister for Agriculture while on a deputation from Killeshandra Co-Op. that the Minister was prepared to have all of County Cavan included in the Severely Handicapped Area.  Is that correct and if so, when is it likely to take place?</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach's answer was:</P>
    <P>We are seeking in negotiations with the Commission to have a re-classification of the Severely Handicapped Area.  I understand in Cavan and Monaghan that this would involve effectively, the re-classification of the whole of both counties.  About one-third of both counties are at present classified. The matter has to be negotiated with the Community and it will take six to twelve months to do so.  Being an optimist I hope it will be six months.</P>
    <P>This is the sentence that is significant:</P>
    <P>We cannot prejudge our application in relation to this, but I think there is a fair chance of success</P>
    <P>From reading the last sentence there the hero was supposed to believe that an application had been made for the extension of the severely handicapped area to the whole of Counties Cavan and Monaghan. No such application has been made by the Minister for Agriculture or by the Government.  As of this morning no application had been put in, and I do not know how the Taoiseach thinks that he should ever be believed again by anybody as a result of this deliberate misleading of the electorate in Cavan-Monaghan.</P>

      <P>Even if we had not reason enough to vote no confidence in this Taoiseach and Government for the national debt debacle which I have mentioned, for the anarchy in the current budget deficit, for the abysmal failure in the field of unemployment, for the blighting of the hopes of the young and the corollory of emigration, for chasing money out of the country by their taxation policies and chasing investment money out by their spiritless management of the economy, the Taoiseach's playing party politics with the Six Counties of Northern Ireland is so despicable that this Dáil should vote him out of office at once.  I quote from page four of the same newspaper:</P>
      <P>this Government had done more for the rights of Nationalists in the North, without prejudicing the rights of Unionists, than any government in the history of the State and the comments expressed by Mr. Séamus Mallon, MP cast doubts on Fianna Fáil's ability to maintain that position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="355" /> Here is a blatant politicking of a discredited Taoiseach trying to make political capital out of the misfortunes of the Northern people.  I am glad that since then, when the Taoiseach repeated the gaffe and in a thoroughly irresponsible manner added to it at a Fine Gael Ard Fheis, Mr. Mallon shouted &ldquo;Stop&rdquo;.  My constituents have been asking since when the Leader of Fianna Fáil or any member or any citizen for that matter had to apologise for defending the people's Constitution whether speaking at Bodenstown or anywhere else.  We do not apologise and we will not.</P>
    <P>I have here a quotation from <i>The Sunday Times</i> dated October 1986 and another quotation from the <i>Economist</i> dated 11 October 1986, neither of them noted Fianna Fáil sheets.  I quote first from <i>The Sunday Times:</i></P>
    <P>The failure to carry a referendum on the introduction of divorce into the public earlier this year has severely damaged FitzGerald's credibility.  His avowed aim was to break the relationship between church and state and to introduce liberal social reforms.</P>
    <P>On the economy, likely to be the dominant issue in an election campaign, things are even more bleak for FitzGerald.  Although inflation has been brought down to around 3 per cent, the country is heading for its largest ever budget deficit.</P>
    <P>The quotation continues:</P>
    <P>The other major issue is Northern Ireland.  Although FitzGerald received a temporary boost from the Anglo-Irish Agreement, the unwillingness of the British Government to contemplate the major reforms envisaged means there is nothing FitzGerald can point to as a major achievement.</P>
    <P>The quotation from <i>The Economist</i> is:</P>
    <P>Since last November's signing of the Anglo-Irish agreement isolated or outnumbered Catholics have been stoned and petrol bombed.  When the IRA extended its murder list to include the <Col N="356" /> most menial services, the Protestant thugs retaliated by threats against Catholics working in Protestant areas. Social security officials in Lisburn, Co. Antrim, where more than 200 Catholic families had already been intimidated into moving were told two months ago to leave and not to come back.</P>
    <P>Those two quotations are an indication that things are not well in the North, that we should not be using the North for political purposes, politicking in Cavan-Monaghan or at a Fine Gael Ard Fheis. What I have just mentioned are accentuated problems which a Fianna Fáil Government will have to address.  We have stated clearly that we welcome any benefits which may come to a long-suffering minority from the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  We do not compromise on our party's principles.  If the Taoiseach has any further intention of using the Six Counties question as a shield against the consequences of disastrous social and economic policies and resulting social and economic evils, let him be warned that a single party Fianna Fáil Government are on the way.  They will tackle all the political, social and economic problems which they are about to inherit.  Let the Taoiseach read and take to heart the balanced article in <i>The Irish Times</i> today on the ineffectiveness of smear campaigns.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>Until Deputy Wilson was about to conclude his speech he did not refer to the position of Northern Ireland nor, indeed, to the depressing situation that exists in Border areas at the moment and which as a Deputy coming from that area I propose to speak on.  What surprises me about Deputy Wilson is that his party came into power on two fundamental promises, the restoration of the Irish language and the unity of the Irish people.  Those were and still remain the two basic principles of the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us see how they got on.  This debate today is not about a vote of confidence but about a general election, a change of Government, and the whole thrust of the Fianna Fáil debate so far has been <Col N="357" /> examining the mistakes of the present Government.  Let us examine the mistakes of Fianna Fáil when they were in office.</P>
    <P>Look at Fianna Fáil's record as a national party on the two fundamental principles on which they founded their party, on which they broke with Sinn Féin and decided to come into this House as a constitutional party.  After 60 years, if my arithmetic is right, in this Parliament we have a little box over there where we pay an official of the establishment of this House to translate what we call the native language into what we refer to as a foreign language so that the natives of this House can understand it.  There is not another parliament in the world where the language which is claimed to be the native language is translated for the benefit of the Members of that parliament.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the progress we have made on the national language. That is the progress that Fianna Fáil have made after 60 years.  We can see that clearly.  There is no ambiguity about what I am saying.  There is no misunderstanding of my painting of the picture of the progress on the Gaelic language.  The physical presence of a little box over there &mdash; as we say in Donegal, a wee box &mdash; where we pay an official to translate the Gaelic language for members of Deputy Wilson's own party to understand in English if the Irish language is spoken, is the progress of the Fianna Fáil Party on that fundamental issue.  They have been as great a failure as far as the unity of the country is concerned. Their pious platitudes, their beating the drum, their waving the flag, their blowing the horns of Irish nationalism when it suits them, has contributed more to the division of the Irish people than the bombs and the bullets of Provisional Sinn Féin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Haughey says that Fianna Fáil should not apologise for being at Bodenstown. Wolfe Tone never talked about nationalists, unionists, republicans or loyalists.  In fact he said we should replace <Col N="358" />&ldquo;Catholic&rdquo; and &ldquo;Protestant&rdquo; with the common name of &ldquo;Irishman&rdquo;.  But every time a Fianna Fáil speaker speaks he talks about the Nationalist minority in the North of Ireland or, as Deputy Wilson has just said, the suppressed minority. When will Fianna Fáil Deputies ever mature to the point where they can talk about people, about Irish people?  What difference does it make to Fianna Fáil Members of this House where a man or woman in the North goes on a Sunday morning.  If one looks at the situation more clearly it will be seen that there is no such thing as a Republican, no such thing as a Nationalist.  These are other words for a Catholic.</P>
    <P>In the last 12 months two things have happened in this island.  We had the Anglo-Irish Agreement in the North and we had a referendum on the Constitution in the Republic.  The Anglo-Irish Agreement has clearly shown that the Unionists in the North are not really Unionists; they are Protestants.  And the referendum in the South has shown that we are not really Nationalists but Catholic.  If we could see Ireland as Catholic and Protestant and if we could focus on the reason people use the terms republican, nationalist, unionist and loyalist, it would be a step in the right direction.  There are extremists in varying degrees on the Catholic side calling themselves republicans &mdash; and that is what they are, extreme Catholics.  Then there is the moderate Catholic who calls himself a Nationalist, moving as close to a centre position as possible.  The same applies on the Northern Protestant side. There is no such thing as a Loyalist &mdash; loyal to what?  There is no such thing as a unionist.  Yes, the republicans believe they are republicans and the unionists believe they are unionists.  But let us step back and look at them.  What way would a foreigner look at it?  He would see it in its nakedness, the way I am trying to spell it out.  Let us stop talking in clichés, substituting words for Catholic and Protestant bigotry and nothing else.  If Fianna Fáil do not see a reason to apologise for Bodenstown, let them look at Wolfe Tone's words.  He did not speak like a bigot.  He could see that unless Catholic <Col N="359" /> and Protestant came together nothing could be achieved.  He could see Ireland more clearly than the present day Fianna Fáil leaders.</P>
    <P>Let us look at the record of Fianna Fáil in Opposition.  In 1957, in Clery's Ballroom, Seán Lemass announced 100,000 new jobs.  That is forgotten now. Fianna Fáil were in Opposition and were trying to get back into Government and the late Seán Lemass announced that he had a plan for 100,000 new jobs.  He said &ldquo;Get your sons and daughters out to work. Get your sons and daughters back from abroad&rdquo;.  We heard Deputy Haughey at it today.  We heard Deputy Wilson at it today.  It is going to happen again.  It is the same policy, the same promises.  Who will have a bonanza, a honeymoon?  At that time Seán Lemass said &ldquo;Get Fianna Fáil back into Government and get the country back in order&rdquo;.  Fianna Fáil came back into office and stayed there for 16 years.  I do not know how but they did.</P>
    <P>In 1977 we had more promises contained in the manifesto.  People do not need to be reminded of that.  I can remember the newly elected Taoiseach, Jack Lynch, being interviewed on television on that night and being asked by the interviewer if the Fianna Fáil Party could deliver on the promises contained in the manifesto and Deputy Lynch answered yes because the economy of the country was buoyant.  Deputy Lynch asked for an overall majority in 1977 and he got the biggest majority ever given to an elected leader in this country, bigger than de Valera or Seán Lemass ever got.  But what were we doing within two years?  We were decrying our mistakes and blaming sterling for pulling us down. So we joined the EMS.  I remember people in this House calling the EMS not the European Monetary System but &ldquo;easy money soon&rdquo;.  This was the attraction of Fianna Fáil &mdash; grab the money. Deputy Lynch took the advice of people like Deputy Martin O'Donoghue, the late Deputy George Colley, Deputy Charles Haughey.  If anyone wants to read the funnies and relax at night and see how gullible people can be I would <Col N="360" /> refer them to the Dáil Debates of that time to read some of the most interesting speeches made by Fianna Fáil Deputies, then Ministers in this House, on why we should break with sterling and join the EMS.  They said that our currency would get stronger than sterling: it did not.  They said that the interest rates in the country would fall: they did not.  They said that unemployment would fall: it did not. They said that it would be an attraction to the Unionists in the North to join this economy: that did not happen.  They said that we should get control of our own currency, that we are not independent if we have not control of our own currency: we have control of our currency, or so it would appear.</P>
    <P>Let me digress for a second, a Cheann Comhairle.  At that time I made a public protest in this House and was suspended for three days for misbehaving myself because I felt deeply about it.  I met an old man in County Donegal a couple of days later who would not claim to have the knowledge and experience of any Member of this House and nobody would listen to him if he made that claim.  He is just an ordinary Donegal countryman. He referred to my suspension from the Dáil: He said &ldquo;I see Jack Lynch kicked you out of the Dáil for three days over the break with sterling&rdquo;.  He added &ldquo;They should give him three years for doing it&rdquo;. He also added something which I want to put on the record of this House.  He said &ldquo;Educated men make mistakes like that but smart men do not&rdquo;.  In other words, the little country shopkeeper who had to think about how he was going to survive tomorrow would have thought twice before breaking with sterling.</P>
    <P>I mention these things because I now deeply believe, after 25 years' service in this House &mdash; and I do not point the finger at Fianna Fáil but all around &mdash; that Irish nationalism has been led by people from this city and south of it who cannot understand the things that need to be understood to correctly appreciate the Northern situation.  I do not say that disparagingly because the people who have led Irish nationalism have been very good people.  I may not have agreed with them <Col N="361" /> because of their political pronouncements but that does not detract from the fact that they were sincere people who wanted to do right, who believed in themselves.  But after 50 years of Government since we broke with the economy of Britain in an economic war, we have gone in the wrong direction economically.  Even the speeches of today have so far been about this part of Ireland with no reference to the North. And who pays the piper for all that?  The little businessman living in Border areas, the people who sold petrol at the filling stations that are now closed, the hotels that do not have any more guests coming to them, the publichouses that are losing their business to pubs over the Border, or one could cite the example of the small family grocers who can almost no longer remain in business.  Who gets the flak for it?  It is Government Deputies.  The economic thrust of the Fianna Fáil Party since they first came into power was economic independence when it suited them but they talked about the unity of the country politically.  How an anti-partitionist party could successfully bluff their supporters, sincere people who believed in the Fianna Fáil Party, who voted for them, while they consistently followed economic policies which were so blatantly partitionist I cannot understand. By so doing they erected more partitions between North and South than ever the British could think of or the Unionists dream of.  Who carries the can? Who pays for all the bad policies of that Fianna Fáil Party?  Little businesses in Border areas, the petrol filling stations, the people who have to eke out a living in those areas.  If I might quote Deputy Wilson again: smart men do not make mistakes like that.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil argued that we should break with sterling.  I argue that they wrought a currency division between North and South, rendering Irish money foreign currency on the island of Ireland. The argument advanced was that we should have our own currency here.  So what if somebody says that sterling is foreign currency in the Republic?  The <Col N="362" /> answer is that if one renders sterling foreign currency in the Republic then it follows that one renders our money foreign currency in six Irish counties.  The Fianna Fáil Party who see so much wrong with the present Government, who pretend they will have all the answers if returned to power, were guilty of rendering Irish money foreign currency in Ireland.  How bloody blind can a party be?  The explanation is that there is nobody in that party qualified to devise a Border policy that will render the economies of North and South so harmonious the Border will not matter.</P>
    <P>This debate, properly, is about economics. We had better understand that unless we head in the direction of a policy of economic union, we shall never achieve Irish unity.  To talk about uniting a people in advance of the economic unity of the country is to put the cart before the horse.  It is ludicrous, time-wasting and bloody dangerous, placing sections of people in the North of Ireland against one another.  Sooner or later I hope Governments here will really understand that one cannot achieve the unity of Ireland in advance of the economic unity of the island as a whole.  That calls many things into question.  It dictates that we recall what Grattan talked about, he being probably the most forgotten man in Irish history.  Grattan identified four basic factors in order to have an Irish nation separate from Westminster.  For example, he identified political separation &mdash; that the Catholics of the South and Protestants of the North did not want to be governed by Westminster but to what degree was another matter.  To this very day the Catholics of the South do not want to be governed by Westminster. When we examine the speeches being made by people like Jim Molyneaux, Ian Paisley, Harold McCusker and other leaders of the Unionist people in the North of Ireland, we see that they do not want to be governed by Westminster; they want political separation.  If we are to get them to come in our direction, is there anybody in this House foolish enough to think that they want a protectionist, separatist policy from Great <Col N="363" /> Britain, so that the goods they manufacture in the North would have to cross customs boundaries before reaching their customers in Great Britain?  Do they really believe that the Unionists in the North would want to join our economy? Do they really believe that the Unionists of the North would give up sterling, an international currency, to join the punt? If they believe that, they should get up and say so in advance of the economic unity of the country because I can assure them that no Protestant in the North would believe that.</P>
    <P>If we want to make the Anglo-Irish Agreement work we must look in the direction of economic union, harmonisation, co-operation &mdash; call it what you will &mdash; but an economic agreement which will render both parts of Ireland similar economically so that it would be easy for somebody in, say, Donegal to go to Derry, buy what they want without being disloyal to their next door neighbour selling the same goods at double the price.  Remember that the difference nowadays is this and it is not appreciated by this Government, the Fianna Fáil Party or this House: when de Valera in 1932 decided on a separatist State, he provided customs duties and tariffs to protect small business people along the Border.  That is no longer the case.  We are now a member of the EC.  It is now quite legal to go across the Border with four people in one car and buy £400 worth of goods.  People are doing so out of need. Who carries the can?  The answer is their next door neighbour who may run a little grocery business.  They no longer buy their groceries from them.  But then it should be remembered that the grocer is no longer buying his petrol from his neighbouring filling station and the grocer and petrol filling station owner are no longer going to their local pub to spend their money.  They are going across the Border.  We must ask why: it is because we created economic convulsion when we broke the link with sterling in 1979.</P>
    <P>When the electorate are faced with a decision I hope they will study both sides of the coin and not just at what this <Col N="364" /> Government have failed to do because, bearing in mind the difficulties with which they are presented, it would take a superhuman to deliver on what the Fianna Fáil Party would expect of the Taoiseach today.  There are no superhumans around.  Our economy can be controlled only by somebody operating within our economic parameters.  The people should understand that the general election in 12 months time will solve two things only. It will decide which Deputies come into this House and what Government will assume power but nothing else.</P>
    <P>Even though Charles J. Haughey may use his hands in the manner of the Sermon on the Mount to indicate to his backbenchers the way in which he would lead the country, if Charles J. Haughey does come into Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Examine their record in Government.  When Fianna Fáil came into office in 1977, in the words of the then Taoiseach the economy was buoyant, but what a mess Fianna Fáil made of it.  If they were to be returned to Government now when the economy is under stress, what kind of mess would they make of it, especially if they got an overall majority as they did in 1977?  It would take a revolution to get them out of Government.</P>

      <Col N="365" /> Let the Fianna Fáil Party in opposition not try to govern this country.  Let them examine in detail the policies of the present Government.  They should admit that this Government came into office when things were very difficult and that everything they have done has been for the benefit of the country and the economy, not to gather votes.  Does anybody remember Fianna Fáil talking about the 100,000 jobs in 1957, telling people to bring their sons and daughters back from Britain?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>After 30 years this man still believes that.  In 1977 Fianna Fáil promised to abolish tax on cars, rates on houses and to provide grants for this and that.  Does anybody believe those promises were made in the interests of the economy?  Does anybody believe that the promises contained in the 1977 manifesto were in the interests of the economy? They were made to get Fianna Fáil back into Government.  The object of the Fianna Fáil Party has always been to get near the loot, to get into power and to hell with everything else.  They had overall majorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If this Government are under stress let it be because they do not have the numerical strength of the Fianna Fáil Party.  Fianna Fáil say this Government are under stress but how can they explain what happened in 1977 when they had a majority of 20 and they made such blundering mistakes?  When Deputy Haughey took over the leadership of Fianna Fáil in 1979 he borrowed from every international bank to get the ship sailing again.  His idea was to borrow as much as he could to get the ship back on course and then to go to the country for a general election.  He did not have to go to the country in 1981.  He could have stayed in office for a further 12 months but he did not do so.  The big question we must ask is why?  Why does a man with a majority of 20 call a general election 12 months before he needs to do so?  The answer is because the international banks <Col N="366" /> were saying they would give him no more credit.  They were telling him to put his books right, but to do that it would have been necessary to reverse the policies he was pursuing.  He went to the country for a quick decision but he lost.  For the last 12 months he has been silent in the belief that people will vote the Government out of power.</P>
    <P>I have been outlining some of the problems I see in the Border area.  The situation is very serious, let there be no doubt about that.  I try to explain to my constituents that the duty of the Government I support is to get the economy right, but to do that the Government had to enforce policies which would put the economy in a different direction to the North, with the result that people on both sides of the Border are suffering.</P>
    <P>No one can say that is the fault of this Government.  It was the fault of a Government who decided on a policy of economic separation.  Separatism rather than unity is the policy Fianna Fáil have been following since they came into power in 1932.  Their policy has always been separatism.  In his speech today Deputy Haughey did not mention the economic harmonisation of North and South.  He never referred to the problems of the Border areas.  He is insulated against all that; he is not aware of these problems.  If I believe I can communicate these views to him, I am fooling myself. For many years I thought I could do this but I sadly came to the conclusion that it was not possible.  What worries me is this: as the value of sterling falls and our punt gains parity, what will happen the Christmas trade in the Border areas?  The Border traders will be in for a very bleak Christmas.</P>
    <P>This debate is about a general election. I listened to Deputy Haughey talking about the devaluation of the punt.  He was the man who contributed more to the break with sterling than any other Deputy.  He was in a position to know all the arguments.  I was not, and neither were the Fianna Fáil backbenchers, many of whom I spoke to at the time.  The Fianna Fáil Party when in Government <Col N="367" /> decided to break with sterling to get control of our own currency.  Twice we had to devalue our currency because the value of sterling fluctuated and the lower it goes the more it endangers the punt.  This was a very bad move on the part of Fianna Fáil.  Deputy Haughey said it was wrong to devalue the punt by 8 per cent and 3 per cent.  When we broke with sterling he devalued our currency by 25 per cent.  In other words, when we were importing oil and buying petro-dollars with sterling, as soon as we broke with sterling we were paying 25 per cent more for oil and we inflated our economy by 13 per cent. These are the mistakes which led us to this serious position in which we find ourselves today.</P>
    <P>No matter what Government had been in power in the past four years they could not have solved the problems facing this country.  As one journalist put it, the chickens are coming home to roost.  Yes, the chickens are coming home to roost, not because of the bad policies of this Government but because of the terrible policies of Fianna Fáil between 1977 and 1981.</P>

      <P>The moving of the motion of no confidence is not just a political start of term exercise: it is a legitimate political response to the demand of the electorate.  There are thousands who would love to contribute to this debate this evening.</P>
      <P>The disintegration of the Coalition has been witnessed daily by everyone over the past six months.  The internal wrangle between the opposing factions in Government, the failed initiatives in every economic sector, the loss of credibility of the Government on their fiscal policies, the sheer degradation of whole sections of our community, these are the facts that have demanded a no confidence motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There can be no return to stability until the country gets an opportunity to express its opinion on this question. Everywhere there is talk of a general election and anger at the Coalition's reluctance to test their mandate.  The most innocent political observer can <Col N="368" /> recognise the crisis in Government and with the Coalition record there for all to see and the sure knowledge that the Labour Party are only waiting for the suitable vehicle with which to scuttle the partnership, the Taoiseach should do the dignified thing and put his record of public service to the test of public opinion.</P>
    <P>This Government are out of touch with reality.  The statistics of Coalition political failure are there for everyone to see: borrowing and the budget deficit at an all time record and out of control, unemployment, emigration, and job losses at their highest level since the foundation of the State, crippling taxation levels, our major industries, agriculture, the building, construction and tourism industries in serious decline, with every individual, family and business concern struggling for survival.  We have the highest budget deficit ever, standing at £1,400 million and this is as a direct result of Government mismanagement.</P>
    <P>We had no deficit budgeting until the Coalition started it in the 1973-77 Coalition.  They took a conscious, deliberate policy decision at that time of huge deficits and they were responsible for the biggest single overrun ever in a budget deficit in 1975 at 107 per cent.  The elimination of the budget deficit was one of the main coalition planks in their <i>Joint Programme for Government 1982</i>, they modified their targets in <i>Building on Reality</i> to a deficit of 5 per cent of gross national product to be achieved by 1987. The reality is that in 1985 their budget deficit stood at £1,254 million, or 8.4 per cent of gross national product and this is to be increased still further in 1986 with an estimated outturn of at least £1,400 million, which at 8.5 per cent of gross national product will be the highest budget deficit since the foundation of the State.</P>
    <P>Uncertainty of the budget deficit can be seen from the situation where three months ago the Taoiseach and his Ministers talked of budgetary targets being met in this area.  Some months later they were talking about a possible overrun of £60 million.  Now they suggest that the <Col N="369" /> overrun will be £180 million and increasing. The reality is that the general public will not believe any figures emanating from the Taoiseach or his statisticians.</P>
    <P>In 1982 the electorate was seduced by promises of fiscal rectitude &mdash; a failed economic policy which has inflicted untold hardship on families, individuals and commerce.  While the Taoiseach is gracious enough now to concede that the latest publication of statistics are disturbing, he promises not less hardship, but greater punishment for the unhappy electorate.  This one area, more than any other, shatters the Government claim to credibility.  It hardly bears thinking about the extent to which services will suffer when the Government promise to withdraw a further £250 million from the budget Departmental Estimates, is implemented next year.</P>
    <P>The four years of mismanagement have created enormous personal difficulties for a great number of people and to add to their misery would be an act of vandalism against them.  The Coalition claim to honest Government is dishonest in itself.  They think that admitting the statistics of shame confers honesty on the administration.  It does not.  The honesty of any Government depends on their ability to meet their stated targets, in this case the joint programme and <i>Building on Reality.</i> Creating new base lines for phony policies from the outturn of the previous year's failure is patently dishonest.</P>
    <P>This administration has sought to confuse the country as to the real state of affairs by an expensive public relations exercise devised to mislead.  The slogans of consumer boom and impending growth around the corner have turned sour. <i>Building on Reality</i> was the Government answer to economic survival.  Every page is a millstone around the necks of the Coalition and a cold reminder of the Government failure.  Every home in Ireland bears witness to the changed fortunes of our people, living standards have been slashed, there are broken families and poverty.  The Government strategy has failed and they have no answer to the statistics of shame.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="370" /> The high sounding moral preaching of the Taoiseach and his Government on Government borrowing should be seen for what it is &mdash; a fabrication &mdash; a cleverly orchestrated public relations exercise designed to mislead even the enlightened. The tinsel has now been moved aside and the dismal state of the economy and the national finances stand out as a huge indictment of Government credibility. Their own statistics prove they have reached the bottomless pit of total loss of credibility.</P>
    <P>Central to the Government electorate seduction of 1981 and 1982 was a strategy of raising fear in the people because of alleged imminent bankruptcy due to the level of the national debt, then standing at £12 billion, or £3,680 <i>per capita</i>.  It had risen inexorably to £22 billion in 1985 or £5,751 <i>per capita</i>.  There can be no justification for this scandalous figure and not surprisingly, there is no Government defence for their incompetence in this area.  There is every reason to believe that the allegation of bankruptcy has now become a reality.</P>
    <P>Two-thirds of all our debt has been incurred under Coalition Governments. The first Government to engage in heavy foreign borrowing was the Coalition of 1973-1977 which had the dubious honour of holding the record for increasing the level of foreign debt eight fold between 1973 and 1977 and they also hold the record for the highest level of Government borrowing in any one year &mdash; 1975 &mdash; when it stood at 16 per cent of GNP.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Building on Reality</i>, the Coalition Government policy for national recovery, has been a total disaster and their projection for national debt has been completely missed.  They promised that in 1987 the national debt would be at 9.75 per cent of GNP.  This is an impossible target to achieve.  Our foreign debt has more than doubled since 1982 and now stands at more than £9 billion.  There can be no distortion of the unpalatable facts &mdash; what was a Fianna Fáil venial sin has become a Coalition mortal sin, but worse, the Coalition are now trying to make a virtue out of their misdeeds.</P>
    <P>The figures of greatest political shame <Col N="371" /> are surely the unemployment and emigration statistics.  Unemployment at 240,000 is up 70,000 since 1982 and now stands at 18 per cent of our labour force. Employment is down by 60,000 since 1982, a massive 63,000 short of the <i>Building on Reality</i> target.  Redundancies stand at 83,595 in the period 1983 to 1985 and factory and business closures have been averaging more than a 1,000 per year. The scourge of emigration which has been the cause of national debilitation for centuries is back with a vengeance and the figure of 100,000 having left since the Coalition took office has brought Coalition failure to the doors of tens of thousands of Irish families.</P>
    <P>How can any self-respecting Government responsible for such devastation ask the people to vote confidence in their continuing in office?  These statistics may be odious to the Coalition, but they make a nonsense of the Taoiseach's protestations that things are improving.  His promises of four years ago and the targets that he set in <i>Building on Reality</i> are jokes to the 380,000 who are unemployed, in temporary part-time jobs or who have left forever.  The Taoiseach's recent Ard Fheis speech had nothing to say to the ordinary man in the street and had less to say to the thousands of dispossessed persons that he has forced to flee the country.</P>
    <P>Who is interested in name calling and useless rhetoric when the country is in the grip of a national paralysis which is threatening the very survival of the State? The national confidence has been completely destroyed.  We are exporting people and money, exporting graduates, technicians and tradesmen, the cream of Irish society, the strength we boasted would guarantee our future prosperity. We are also exporting the money we desperately need to fund our services, protect our interest rates and provide seed capital for new ventures.  Because of the total mismanagement and misdirection of the economy the Government are condemning our country to Third World status, making us the paupers of Europe <Col N="372" /> and the Lazarus of the international community.</P>
    <P>In the area of taxation PAYE workers are being squeezed to the point of despair.  Our direct taxes as a percentage of GNP are 37.3 per cent, our PAYE sector pay 36.6 per cent of all the tax paid, despite the <i>Building on Reality</i> promises of a reduction in proportion of total tax paid under PAYE.  The figure was 32 per cent of all tax in 1982, but it has crept up by deliberate Government policy to increase taxes on those who had no alternative but to pay up and look happy.  There is no happiness in the PAYE sector except seething anger at a Government who have taken £2.2 billion in extra taxes in the past four years and still we have the highest indirect taxes in Europe.  People are taxed beyond their capacity to pay and one can only speculate the number of lost jobs, lost opportunities and disillusioned emigrants because of the Government's inability to rationalise their tax policy.</P>
    <P>What is at issue here is the record of Coalition Government performance on taxation and not Coalition challenging Fianna Fáil intentions.  The Coalition have been in Government almost ten years out of the past 14 and an ample opportunity was available to them to fulfil their manifesto promises.  This is the Government who introduced the 1 per cent employment levy, abolished the 25 per cent tax band, imposed residential property tax, introduced the 10 per cent VAT on clothes and shoes, increased building taxes by 10 per cent, increased employees' PRSI from 4.7 per cent to 7.5 per cent and punished all householders with service charges.  The citizens of this State are punch drunk from the crippling taxes that have been imposed by this Coalition Government.</P>
    <P>The Coalition taxation policies have driven thousands of our best managers abroad and made it impossible to recruit senior personnel for our limping industrial base and they round off their cruel tax record by introducing &ldquo;DIRT&rdquo; tax, a tax designed to attract money irrespective of any considerations of equity. Never since the foundation of the State <Col N="373" /> has there been such resentment and anger at this particular tax.  No tax has ever been seen as more punitive.  There is total public rejection of the tax &mdash; it is causing a shortfall in available finance for Government expenditure in the home market because of the determination of big and small investors to transfer resources abroad and this tax cannot now be relied on to produce the expected revenue for the Government.  It discriminates against the old and the very young investors and only now since the half yearly accounts have been issued by the finance houses do the public fully realise what the Government intention on budget day was, simply to rob the savings of all investors irrespective of their ability to pay.  This tax must be withdrawn.  There is a fear generated in small investors and large financial controllers alike resulting in money so urgently needed at home being utilised by our competitors abroad for the benefit of their economies.  How can we hope to generate a sense of patriotism among investors when we continually rob the financial nest?  The money market has had the jitters for months, Government gilts are paralysed and would have completely collapsed on several occasions in the recent past, but for the intervention of the Government broker making it impossible for investors to withdraw. There is no confidence in financial circles, no belief that the Government have or are capable of implementing a fiscal policy and it is now generally understood that stability will not return until political stability exists.  This can only happen after a general election.  If the Government had the real interest of the State at heart then they would see that this stability can only be brought about by a general election campaign and we invite them to participate in that now and let the electorate be the judges of their record in office.</P>
    <P>We must also remember that investment is at its lowest level for ten years now.  Industrial investment has been halved since the Coalition took office and State spending on industry is down almost 40 per cent.  Public capital investment has <Col N="374" /> been cut by almost a third since 1982 in real terms and this has been one of the major reasons unemployment levels in the construction industry are so high.</P>
    <P>The spectacle of high interest rates is very disturbing at this time and is of critical importance for mortgage holders and industry alike.  People were genuinely shocked when they heard the Minister for Finance last week say he was completely impotent in dealing with the crisis and was prepared to stand idly by while individuals and business go to the wall.  New increases in bank lending will have serious consequences for manufacturing output and employment levels.  Industry is already in a state of crisis.  National output contracted by .75 per cent in 1985 and industrial output is down 4 per cent in the third quarter of this year.  Manufacturing employment is down from 227,000 in 1980 to 185,000 in 1986 and still falling.  The spectacle of having more people on the dole queue than working in manufacturing industry is the imbalance that shows just how seriously out of line our production policies are.  Despite a ten fold increase in Government expenditure to State organisations involved in manufacturing industry between 1971 and 1985 employment in the sectors involved has fallen by 4.5 per cent.  There is a serious decline in output and this has been influenced by a decline in currency adjusted cost competitiveness due to the weakening of sterling and the dollar.  Our competitiveness has declined by 6 per cent this year, the equivalent of the total decline in the preceeding 12 years since we joined the EC.  Our interest rates are way out of line with our competitors within the EMS.  They can borrow between 5 and 7 percentage points below our rates and when one considers that every percentage point difference is a cost penalty of £15 million to manufacturing industry the effect of the differential is plain to see.</P>
    <P>The Irish pound now stands some 12 per cent stronger against sterling than its average in 1985.  Indigenous Irish exporting industry is tottering at the brink and exporters in the traditional industries are <Col N="375" /> being priced out of their traditional markets, particularly the UK market where we continue to lose market share.  The Government response has been to do nothing in the face of this threat to our competitive edge.  The cost of money and essential services directly under Government control are not at an international competitive level and the Government cannot expect a return to industrial growth until they introduce appropriate economic and taxation policies.  Immediately the Government must allow business to borrow European money at the same rate as our competitors without exchange risk burden.  They should also move to reduce the cost of essential services, particularly in energy sources so as to protect our indigenous industries.</P>
    <P>The speculative outflows are a direct investors' response to jittery Government &mdash; the smallest investor wants nothing to do with our financial system and the DIRT is seen as the crucifixion piece of a punishing taxation system. Commerce trying to survive by forward purchasing of sterling together with the outflows have bled the system dry and have resulted in a very severe shortage in the money markets.  That will continue until the Government either change course or get out.  The latter is seen as the preferred option of the vast majority of people.  Ordinary people have been scandalised in the recent past by the massive attempts at selling off Government gilts and these attempts have not yet eased.  The position of Government gilts is the true test of investor confidence. This does not now exist and the turmoil in the money markets is a cause of greatest concern, not just to financiers and financial controllers, but to every single person who has a stake in the country and an investment be it large or small.</P>
    <P>There is widespread depression in the tourist industry and the decline in the number of foreign visitors has seriously affected the viability of the industry. Hotels and guesthouse owners have had their worst season in a decade.  We continue to lose international market share and the Government White Paper on <Col N="376" /> tourism is now seen as no response to the needs of an industry in crisis.  There has to be a complete rethink of the tourist industry, its promotion and marketing. This Coalition Government have failed to produce a national policy for the industry in the area of taxation, environmental control, access transport and tourist infrastructure.  The Government have failed to consult with Bord Fáilte, the tourist confederation and other involved agencies in an attempt to provide new ideas, new markets and new promotional strategies.  There is no evidence that the political will exists in the Government to give the tourist industry the recognition it deserves as our third largest industry. The problems of the industry have been sufficiently identified over the past number of years.  What was needed was a political response to make our industry internationally competitive and an imaginative approach to marketing and promotion.  It seems that while the Coalition are in office we must be content to limp on in the same old way of treating a modern developing world industry in an <i>ad hoc</i> casual fashion.  In every sector the Government's performance was a shambles.  Their figures of shame are indefensible.  In a modern democracy where a Government have authority over their own actions such appalling results can only mean failure and loss or credibility. Nothing further can be done by this Coalition.  Everything they touch withers and dies.</P>
    <P>Not even the ardent supporters of the Government expect them to survive and they would see their dissolution as a merciful relief.  To prolong the national agony further is to risk permanent damage to an already seriously wounded economy. Surely even a discredited Coalition hanging on to their now worthless authority must recognise that the game is up and that events have overtaken them.  The Coalition record is one of dismal failure. Their misguided policies have brought unprecedented hardship to thousands of Irish families.  Coalition failure is not new to Irish politics and memories of past failures are still remembered.</P>
    <P>Just as the Coalition economic policies <Col N="377" /> have failed, so have their social policies. They continue to misunderstand the Irish people.  The Coalition have failed in every electoral test in the past four years and still they refuse to recognise the majority wish of the people.  A new start, fresh initiatives in job creation and taxation policies are necessary if we are to survive our present difficulties.  The Coalition which can have no future beyond the next election should step aside now and let a refreshed and determined Fianna Fáil take over and restore confidence to our people and to the economy.</P>
    <P>What a sad spectacle of political waste of time the Fine Gael gathering was in the RDS last weekend.  If the Taoiseach, and his Ministers, had not Fianna Fáil and the Leader of Fianna Fáil, to criticise then they would have had nothing to say whatsoever.  How consoling it was for us to note that the biggest cheers at the Fine Gael Ard Fheis erupted at the mention of the name of the Leader of Fianna Fáil, Deputy Haughey.</P>
    <P>Devoid of any worthwhile response to our problems, torn by internal dissensions, the last political refuge of Fine Gael is to attack the Leader of the Opposition in a personal way.  Somebody should tell the Taoiseach and his people, that it is old hat now, that it is tired stuff and it is not what the electorate expect from responsible Government.  It is rejected out of hand by a depressed electorate, depressed to the point of despair by the mismanagement of this Coalition. Somebody should also remind the Taoiseach that people in glasshouses should not throw stones and there are a fair few broken panes in the Coalition glasshouse at this time.  There is a danger that the entire roof of the glasshouse will collapse on them.  With privatisation of State companies now an essential ingredient of Fine Gael policy the final insult to Labour ideology has been handed down.  Not only can there be no Coalition again for the foreseeable future, the loose vote transfer arrangements between Fine Gael and Labour is now terminated.  The disillusionment of Coalition policies and politics is now complete.  Hopefully, <Col N="378" /> the experience will be only a bad memory soon.  In a strange way the Fine Gael supporters' greeting for the prospect of ditching Labour from any future Government arrangements was a clear indication by Fine Gael of the recognition of the failure of Coalition policies.</P>
    <P>Coalitions do not work for Ireland and this one has been the worst ever.  There is a better way.  A growing economy is the only guaranteed way to ease the financial straitjacket around the economy and to produce an investment climate that will attract back the hidden billions and encourage new venture capital.  Fianna Fáil are the only party willing and capable of undertaking that task.</P>
    <P>Tá ré an Chomhrialtais rite.  Tá deireadh leis an dallóg ar aghaidh na ndaoine. The great illusion of promise created by the national handlers is over.  The arrogant days of Coalition Ministers are over also.  How the mighty have fallen.  The sooner an end is put to this punishment of the Irish people the better for all concerned.</P>

A vote of confidence from the point of view of an Opposition party is calculated to instil in the public the feeling that they, the Opposition, are more capable of doing things that the Government are doing.  It is no harm, having listened to speakers in this debate, to focus our attention on the type of confidence the public may have in the ability of the Opposition to do the things they would like to see done. One must examine all the areas of the economy and compare the performance of the Opposition when they had the responsibility of governing the country and ask how confident the people will be in their ability to deliver.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fianna Fáil say that there is a better way.  If that is so I wonder why they have kept it a secret for so long.  Why is it that they have kept this secret for the past eight years, four of which they were in office?  One hopes that they do not go to <Col N="379" /> the cupboard and discover the pale white skeletons of the chickens that have rested there since 1977.  If they discover those chickens the public's memory will be jolted quickly into recognising that if there is a better way the Opposition have not found it and are not likely to find it.</P>
    <P>Let us examine the various statements by the Opposition in recent months.  With regard to agriculture the Opposition have howled like wounded rhino every time the weather changed and called for more expenditure in that area but in the same breath they opposed the farm tax.  They also called for reduced borrowing and reduced taxation but never asked themselves if their policies were reconcilable. That is a question that the public must consider.  It appears that the public are giving serious consideration to that question and coming to the conclusion that there is not a better way as far as the Opposition are concerned.</P>
    <P>It is not my wish to denigrate a party or personalities in a party.  I do not think that should be done and it was not done at our Ard Fheis.  At that gathering it was pointed out what the Opposition had to offer, and rightly so.  It was also pointed out that the Opposition are led in a certain way.  Certain policies of the Leader of the Opposition must be examined and it is the duty of the Government of the day to point out the effect of the policies that are likely to be pursued.</P>

      <P>This is not muck raking. I did not interrupt Deputy Flynn.  The question of borrowing has taken up a lot of time in this debate and the Government have been castigated for the amount they borrowed, the deficit and all areas associated with spending.  What will the Opposition do?  It is obvious that they intend to reduce borrowing but does that mean that they will remove some of the services they provided so dearly in 1977? They say they do not intend to increase <Col N="380" /> borrowing or increase taxation but they must accept that the services that exist must be paid for.  If the Opposition do not intend to increase taxation or borrowing the only alternative open to them is to reduce the services.  Are the Opposition prepared to tell the public the services they propose to remove?  Which improvements brought about by them in their famous election manifesto of 1977 &mdash; we all have to live with the consequences of that &mdash; will they remove?  Will they admit that those services were introduced in a moment of haste, a moment of enthusiasm which lasted for 18 months after that election?  Which of those services are they now prepared to set aside, saying the country cannot afford them?</P>
      <P>The Opposition should consider very carefully the building industry.  They have helped for quite a long time to perpetuate the myth that they alone are capable of generating any confidence or enthusiasm in that area.  Let them examine their own record.  In 1977 they had a package which included a £1,000 new house grant.  It was a good idea but it is debatable whether it was necessary at that time.  The oil crisis had occurred a couple of years before and its main impact had worn off slightly. It is debatable whether that injection was required just then.  It inflated production in the building industry for a short period of about 18 months.  What happened then?  The then Government, who now claim to have a better way, decided they did not have enough money to finance their enterprises in the building area.  The only honourable thing they could do was remove the grant aid for home improvement. It was not a nice thing to do, especially as it was Christmas time, but they had the courage to admit that they did not provide for it in the first place and had not the ability to provide for it afterwards because they failed to raise by way of taxation or otherwise the money required to finance it.  The only reason they did not raise the money by borrowing was that they could not get it. What confidence will the public now have in the ability of that party to do anything other than they did before when they had control of the coffers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="381" /> Much has been said today from the Opposition benches on the subject of interest rates.  Interest rates were lower during the past six months than at any period in the past ten years.  The Opposition say this was due to external factors, but it must be pointed out that interest rates elsewhere, including the UK, were not that low.  Because in recent times there has been an increase, the Opposition see fit to lambaste this administration. When they were in control interest rates were considerably higher than at present and for a long time they remained higher than in most other European countries.  I would have to ask what confidence the public could have in the ability of the people opposite to do anything other than repeat their performance of a few years ago.</P>
    <P>We have not heard much about inflation for the simple reason that it is now extremely low &mdash; about 3 per cent. Most of our industries, including agriculture, were calling for many years for a reduction in inflation but they called in vain during the term of office of the people opposite.  Nothing happened and no measures were taken within this economy to pull down inflation because nobody had the courage to do it.  When we compare our current rate of inflation with that in a number of other countries the record of the Government stands fairly well and compares more than favourably with a similar comparison made during the years when the Opposition had control of the coffers.  This is another area where the public will have to assess the ability of the Opposition to do what they claim.</P>
    <P>Let us consider the areas of education, social welfare and health.  We have listened to claims that the Government over-borrowed to keep services in train. This Government have increased expenditure on education, despite difficulties. At the same time there have been continuous cries from the Opposition for further and greater expansion and expenditure.  We must ask whether it is proposed to raise the necessary money by taxation or by borrowing or what they really mean when they ask for further <Col N="382" /> expansion in that area.  The public will have to ask themselves that question as well.</P>
    <P>It is likewise in regard to social welfare services.  Despite the difficulties the administration have managed to provide most people who are unfortunately in receipt of some kind of social welfare payment, particularly the unemployed, with a modicum of a standard of living in order that they may get through the recession which this country has experienced, in common with the rest of the world.</P>
    <P>We have heard much about health, an area of large expenditure.  For the past year we have been hearing squeals about various cuts.  We have been hounded at every opportunity by the Opposition who claim that people are in danger day and night, that hospital wards are being closed and that people are being left without services.  At the same time, for some unknown reason, expenditure in that area has continued to increase.  If one takes seriously the views expressed by the Opposition one must conclude that they intend to spend more.  How will they find the money?  Economic buoyancy will probably be their answer but that is a difficult one to repeat after 1977.  I doubt if the public would buy it again.</P>
    <P>Nobody would deny that the number of people unemployed during the past few years has been unacceptably high. That includes the period during which the Opposition were responsible.  When the public examine their consciences they must also consider what happened in the period 1980-82 when the average rate of increase was between 30,000 and 40,000 per year.  There are still increases but they are certainly not of that magnitude. While it is true to say that we have unacceptably high numbers of people unemployed and that every effort must be made to rectify that problem, I doubt if the public can be confident in the ability of the Opposition to do other than repeat their performance at a time when numbers were increasing by 40,000 per annum.  That was a rather doubtful achievement.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="383" /> Another subject which has been dragged up again and again is the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  I do not wish to make a political football of that issue but the public have a right to examine the views expressed by the Opposition as to what they propose to do in relation to that agreement.  The public also have a right to expect that following the implementation of the Opposition policies, changes would take place.  Would those changes be for the better?  Would they protect lives?  Would they be anything other than cheap political manoeuvring at the expense of the people of this island?  A careful analysis will reveal that nothing further is intended than a short-term political expedient and an attempt at the traditional green flag waving which will achieve nothing to save the lives of the people in danger or do anything about the lives which have been lost over the last number of years.  The public have a right to expect some measure of stability in that area.  The present administration have done a good job in so far as a job could be done and have succeeded in so far as success could be achieved.</P>
    <P>Stability is important to the life of any country and it is particularly important to economic life.  I thank the Opposition for raising that question again and again this afternoon because it gives us an opportunity to examine the stability of the country from 1977 to 1981, at a time when, as Deputy Harte has already said, the then Government had a majority of 20.  Surely that was a sound foundation for a stable Government.  With that majority the stability was not so great that the then leader did not decide to seek a mandate from the people a year before it was necessary.  That did not sound like a move born of the conviction that there existed a stable situation at the time.  Why did our money markets go into a tizzy at that time?  What was the reason for the buying and selling on the exchanges then?  Was it because there was little confidence in the ability of the then Government to continue as they were doing, having regard to their record for the previous number of years?  Was <Col N="384" /> one of the reasons the fact that the markets had seen what had happened and the amount of hair-raising borrowing that had gone on, regardless of the consequences, over the previous four years? Was that not one of the reasons for the instability created at that time?</P>
    <P>Let us remember also that fingers have been pointed across the House on numerous occasions at the Coalition Government and the concept of coalition has been questioned.  It has been questioned on the basis that two parties cannot govern in a stable fashion.  Let us examine the record of the Opposition.  With the one single party, which is allegedly the only way that the State can be governed and with 20 of a majority, what happened? Some Members threatened to resign, some were fired, some did resign, some asked their leader to resign.  What did that do for the stability of the country? What did it do to instil confidence in the people?  When the public come to examine the proposals put forward now by the Opposition they must have regard to what happened then.  They must ask a very serious question.  This is, are the Opposition now capable of doing what they failed to do then?  Will it be necessary for the Opposition to get a greater majority than 20?  What majority would they need before they were capable of giving us stable government?  I would have to conclude &mdash; and I am sure the public will also conclude &mdash; that there is a considerable doubt as to whether they are capable of doing now what they failed to do then.</P>
    <P>The present Government, as speakers on this side of the House have often admitted, have come through a very tough time, through an economic recession the equal of which has not been known in modern times, and have attempted to maintain for the people a reasonable standard of living.  That has not been easy and decisions had to be taken many times that were unpalatable. Governments, like all politicians, are hardly likely to do things which are unpalatable just for the sake of doing them. They do them simply because there are few alternatives.  No politicians worth <Col N="385" /> their salt would introduce policies which were to the detriment of the people and none ever will.  Certainly, on this side of the House none was introduced for any reason other than that there was no other way.</P>
    <P>If we compare the record of the present administration over the past almost four years with that of their predecessors, that administration will come fairly well out of that comparison.  We must remember that the public were told by the Opposition a few years ago that by voting for them and supporting them, that party would get the country moving again.  This time it is different.  Now there is a better way.  They did not get the country moving again or, if they did, certainly it was not in the direction in which the people hoped it would go.  It is highly unlikely that the better way they have in mind will improve the situation.  The public must look carefully at the situation and compare like with like.  If they do, their confidence in the Opposition will be extremely shaken.</P>
    <P>Listening to the Opposition over the past four years or so, inside and outside the House, one could only conclude that nothing that they have said or done would do anything to instil confidence in the minds of the people.  Nothing they have said or done during the past eight years can do other than indicate their total inability to tackle any situation that looks in any way difficult.  If ever they had to take a tough political decision, far from showing the stability that would come with a single strong party they showed themselves completely incapable of overcoming that obstacle and wound up with internal dissension.  There is no need for them to look at this side of the House and talk about the dissensions that are here.  They can look at their own record.</P>
    <P>One thing which I fail to understand, even coming from the Opposition, is the usual wildly exaggerated statements from that side of the House about the economy, about the number of people unemployed. We hear about 350,000 and 360,000 unemployed.  We heard a couple of years ago that it would reach such figures.  Now they tell us that it would be at such figures if the measures that the <Col N="386" /> Government took in the meantime had not been taken.  What exactly do they mean?  Do they mean that there are 360,000 unemployed, which there are not?  In that case they are trying to con the public.  Are they misleading themselves, or telling us in some way that they intend to remove the schemes that have been put in train by the present administration to alleviate unemployment?  If they are, then if they got control there would be 360,000 or 370,000 people unemployed.</P>
    <P>There are also the wild predictions in relation to the money market from the opposite side of the House. They seem to forget that money markets usually fluctuate once or twice in the life of a Government and usually respond to measures taken by Government.  They did not respond to the measures taken by the Government in 1980-81.  The then Government failed to take the measures necesary to restore confidence in the money markets.  I am sure the Opposition must have learned that since then.  Exaggerated statements about the alleged failures in this country do nothing for the economy or for the morale of the people. Crying aloud at every opportunity about the hundreds of thousands of people who are allegedly emigrating does nothing for the country, its morale, its people or the economy.  The Opposition seem to spend most of their time harping on such issues. The public, looking for someone in whom to place their confidence, will have to look much further.  Most people to whom I have spoken seem to have little confidence in what they are saying, what they are doing and what they are capable of doing.</P>
    <P>In the various fields of agriculture and industry a reasonable degree of confidence has existed for the past number of years.  For the first time in our history we have trading surpluses, a steady sign of growth in the industrial sector and a steady indication of growth in our exports over the past number of years, month by month and year by year.  That has been recorded despite all the cries, protestations and criticisms that have come <Col N="387" /> from the other side of the House.  In spite of all that there has been a steady amount of growth.</P>
    <P>Now is a good time for the public to focus on the Opposition and to ask themselves, are the Opposition confident they can deliver where they failed to deliver before?  Are they confident they can reduce taxation, reduce borrowing, increase expenditure, get the people back to work and get the country moving again without repeating the performance of the chickens that must surely be uneasily roosting somewhere since 1977?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think this is a routine motion.  It is not a normal vote of no confidence.  I sense something different about this motion.  It gives us all a chance to make a genuine decision in this Chamber when the vote is called tomorrow afternoon which could change the direction of the country in the next few hours.  I do not think it is simply Fianna Fáil or the Opposition giving out a plea and saying that the Government must go and we must get in.  The country desperately needs to end the uncertainty which is all around us today.  This uncertainty is now an independent source of instability in this country and in this economy. I firmly believe that we have reached a state of crisis which demands a quick resolution.  For that reason I suggest to my colleagues that this is not a normal regular vote of no confidence put down by Opposition parties.  It is different because there is unease, fright, instability and uncertainty.  If we can end that uncertainty tomorrow we will put the country in a new direction.  The most effective way the Dáil can act is to take a decision tomorrow to have a general election.  That would end the uncertainty and clear the air and this needs to be done quickly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we do not take this decision tomorrow this House and the country faces the prospect of some kind of paralysis for the next 12 months, a paralysis on two levels. First of all, the business of Government will not go on in the ordinary sense in which this country needs it to go on. <Col N="388" /> Ministers will be concentrating, as they must as good politicians, for the next 12 months if the Taoiseach insists on holding the Government together for that period on getting themselves re-elected.  What will happen to the country while all of us spend the next 11 or 12 months getting ourselves re-elected?  This election campaign is on, whether the election is in 11 months, six months, three months or three weeks which is what I hope will happen as a result of tomorrow's vote. My colleagues know that as well as I do. Posters have been put up, people are campaigning and Ministers are dashing to marginal constituencies.  This is bogging down the running of the country.  It is having a dreadful effect on the money market, and is creating uncertainty in business quarters.  That is leading to a tremendous feeling of paralysis.</P>
    <P>In the business world we all know the one thing a business needs is some kind of certainty, of a parameter within which to work.  It does not like uncertainty; it runs away from it as has been shown by recent money market developments.  Can we allow that to drag on for 11 or 12 months without clearing the air in the interests of this country and of the political democratic system?  I have no doubt that there will be months of paralysis in Government, in business and in the finance world while waiting for an election to take place.  We have a chance tomorrow to call a general election and to clear the air so that the business people and the new Government, of whatever colour, will get back to work.  Let us stop the campaigning and get down to work. We cannot afford 11 or 12 months of paralysis in the state of crisis that this country now finds itself in.</P>
    <P>I want to turn to the question of the national finances and the state of the economy.  The Taoiseach said at his weekend Ard Fheis &mdash; and I quote him because it is important that he not be misquoted: &ldquo;Each year since we took over in Government we have had to devise policies that would control public spending, halt the rise in tax and hold on or reduce the level of borrowing; each year we have had to attempt what Fianna <Col N="389" /> Fáil failed to do, that is to keep our budgets on or close to targets.&rdquo; That is what he said at the weekend.  I would like to look at whether he has achieved any of that, but first it is interesting to look at what he said in 1982 which is a commentary on his suggestion that Fianna Fáil failed to take any action.  This is what he said in December 1982, the day he was appointed Taoiseach, and I would like to know how he squares this with his recent suggestion that all the troubles in this country are due to Fianna Fáil's economic policy.  He said to the House on 14 December, speaking about the policies of the previous Government: &ldquo;Its results do provide us with some help in starting to undertake the tasks that face us.  It would be ungenerous and dishonest of me not to recognise that fact.&rdquo; When the Taoiseach came to office he pointed out that he had some help in starting to undertake the tasks that faced them from the previous Government and that it would be ungenerous of him not to acknowledge that.</P>
    <P>Why has he changed?  He came to office that day and thanked the outgoing Government for their work on behalf of the country.  Now at a weekend Ard Fheis the suggestion was that he did not mean that when he said it in 1982.  I would like to put that on the record.  At the Ard Fheis a very different picture was painted last weekend from the one he painted then in 1982.  Now I am afraid he is blaming the Opposition party for the situation when the Government took over.  That argument has one major defect, that even given that there is some truth in the suggestion that the Government could not do the job because they got some bad books passed on to them &mdash; I do not suggest for one moment that that is accurate &mdash; two years later in 1984 when the Government were two years in office and had two budgets behind them and a national planning report to assist them, they sat down and wrote a plan called <i>Building on Reality 1985-1987</i>.  My colleagues on the other side went into that plan with their eyes open after two years in office, after two budgets and on the <Col N="390" /> advice of the national planning committtee. Therefore, it makes no sense now to suggest that the reason they could not do their job was some difficulties which they inherited.  If that was so, why not approach it honestly in 1984 in their national plan <i>Building on Reality 1985-1987?</i> Why not put it into that document and say that they inherited some scrambled situation and that these were the plans to counter that?  That was not done. They set the targets themselves.  These were not targets which they inherited. They set them in 1984 and it is quite clear from what I am about to say and have said many times that even since 1984, let alone 1982, those targets have not been met.  Therefore, it is a little disingenuous and unfair to the people to suggest that now they have discovered suddenly that they got some difficult situations in 1982. What happened in 1984?  They had two years of knowledge of any situation that existed and it is a little disingenuous to suggest that now they have discovered suddenly that they inherited some kind of difficult figures.  They had two years to look at those figures, put them together and write a plan.  They wrote a plan with their eyes open and suggested it as being a considerable advance in regard to the country's problems.  Quite patently, it has not been so.</P>
    <P>I want to look at the four items mentioned in the Taoiseach's address to the Ard Fheis.  Contrary to the assertions, he says that public spending was coming down and getting under control.  It is up 16 per cent since the Government took office and this year current spending is running at 9 per cent above last year's figure, and that is when inflation is only 3 per cent, so current spending is not coming down.  These are independent figures available from banking sources, particularly from the Central Bank.  The Taoiseach was quite adamant that public spending was coming down.  My figures tell me that it is up 16 per cent.</P>
    <P>He talks about reductions in taxation. Receipts from income tax are up 12 per cent on last year and from these figures it is clear that the Government have been taking larger and larger slices of the <Col N="391" /> national cake in taxation over that four-year period or, indeed, over the period from 1984, if we choose to take that as the base.  I do not need to say much more about the borrowing.  We owe £2 billion more today than we owed this time last year.  Nobody can be proud of that.  It has been made often as a political point but it is important to say it in the national context also.  The national debt figure was £12 billion in 1982 and now it is £23 billion.  It has almost doubled in the lifetime of one single Government.  It took us ten or 20 Governments to get it up to that level and one single Government comes in and doubles it again.</P>
    <P>That is bad enough, but it is a little unfair to the intelligence of the public to suggest that because of the £12 billion that they started with they had to go and double it in order to pay the interest on it.  You do not need to be an economist or an accountant to know that those sums do not add up.  That is a new, fresh debt. It would have been a far healthier weekend for the country had the Taoiseach said that he found it difficult to govern, that he found the problems insurmountable and he wanted another mandate to try again.  That at least would have had the benefit of being an honest approach.  Instead he said that he was sorry, it was 1986, he had discovered suddenly that things were not as they should have been in 1982 and that is why he could not do it now, despite the fact that he came into this House in 1982 and told us that he thanked the outgoing Government and felt that there was something on which to build.  It is not the basis on which to seek a fresh mandate.</P>
    <P>He said in that address that they were meeting their targets, that they had met or were very close to meeting their targets every year since coming to office.  &ldquo;On or close to target&rdquo; was the phrase he mentioned.  What is the target?  When the Government came in in 1982 did they not publish a document on policies for economic development and did they not say in that document that if these policies were applied the current budget deficit would be eliminated by 1986?  Two <Col N="392" /> months later, in December 1982, the <i>Joint Programme for Government</i>, another document, said that the current budget deficit would be eliminated by 1987.  It got an extra year.  Two years into office after that and after the advice of the National Planning Board a new commitment was given: &ldquo;to reduce the current budget deficit to 5 per cent by 1987&rdquo;. In this year's budget did the Government not from the mouth of the Minister for Finance undertake again to reduce the current budget deficit from 8 per cent to 7.5 per cent?  There in a period of four years we have four different targets. Therefore, when the Taoiseach says that they have been on or close to target he may be right but the problem is that they keep changing the targets, starting with eliminating the deficit in 1986, moving to eliminate it in 1987, moving to 5 per cent by 1987 and now moving to 7.5 per cent at the present rate.</P>
    <P>In March 1986 the Minister for Finance said that he would ensure that the budget targets would be achieved.  I do not wish to say this in a party political sense but it must be said that if we are to get the act together the first thing is that if we make a target we stick to the target, try to achieve it.  We do not keep shifting the target and then proudly announce that we made our target.  That means nothing if we keep changing the target.  That means the Government can come in here next week with a whole new range of targets, for example, to hold unemployment at 250,000 and come in six months later and say that they reached their target.  One cannot run a country like that.  We have had four different targets for current budget deficits here in as many years and that is the first time, to my knowledge, that it has ever shifted as rapidly.  Is there going to be an announcement soon of a new target for the current budget deficit?  Against that failure of meeting targets how seriously can we take last week's target which was announced in a panic attempt to keep the money markets happy?  Last week's target was to hold the current budget deficit on borrowing at the present levels. That is the fifth current budget target <Col N="393" /> announced in four years.  Let us see how that one works out.  The previous four did not go anywhere near it.  The money markets have given their answer to that kind of thing already.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go through a lot of the facts and figures which have come before this House many times but it is what has happened.  In manufacturing industry which was and is the wealth creating sector of this economy there were 215,000 people working in 1982.  There are now 185,000 people working in manufacturing industry.  The building industry has some 50 per cent of its workforce unemployed today and agriculture has come down from 190,000 to 170,000 people.</P>
    <P>Those figures do not really grasp the human tragedies and the emotional tragedies behind the figures because they are, after all, only figures but there is tragedy and there is human misery behind those figures.  The result of that is that whole building firms in this city and in many other towns have emigrated to London and the south of England &mdash; not just individuals but whole companies, lock, stock and barrel, workforce and the lot.</P>
    <P>I do not doubt the Taoiseach's sincerity and the sincerity of the Government in their aspiration to solve emigration, to solve unemployment.  The last speaker said that no Government ever deliberately brought in a bad measure but that is not the point at this stage in the crisis we are in.  Of course the Government are sincere, of course their aspirations to end unemployment and emigration are worthy.  There is nobody in this House who has not got those aspirations.  The problem is that the Government have not the capacity to deliver on the aspirations. The place for people with aspirations that cannot be delivered is outside Government. The type of Government this country needs is one that can deliver on its aspirations, not just have them.  I do not doubt the sincerity of the Taoiseach in trying to handle unemployment and emigration but he cannot deliver.  He has had four years to try it and it is patently clear that neither he nor the Cabinet have the <Col N="394" /> capacity to stop the rot before we are all in even more difficulties.</P>
    <P>There were 170,000 people unemployed the day the Government came into office.  That figure is now 237,000.  I want to make this point because an earlier speaker suggested that the figures on unemployment were being exaggerated. I want to suggest that they are not being exaggerated half enough because if the figure is 237,000 officially what is the figure?  What about emigration, the people who have gone abroad?  I would count them as being unemployed.  What about the training schemes that are going on?  I would count that unemployment because the schemes are there to soak up people and a major condition for participating in these schemes is that one is unemployed.  So if one adds emigration and the training schemes one comes to a situation where one is heading for 380,000 people effectively out of work who should have work here.  That is one hell of a figure to contemplate.</P>
    <P>All of this has happened &mdash; and I want to make this point as strongly as I can &mdash; at a time when there is not an international recession.  All of this has happened at a time when the international economy is recovering.  In America, in Europe, in Japan, the economies have been recovering while ours has been declining.  The price of oil has been coming down, inflation has been coming down internationally and our own exports have been quite buoyant.  In the middle of all that we have over 380,000 people who should be employed but are not employed here.  In the developed world it is only happening in Ireland. It is not worldwide recession.  For some reason we cannot get our act together in this country and have not been able to.</P>
    <P>Any objective outsider of any political party would have to say to any Government who have been in charge of managing and who come up with those figures that the blame must lie squarely with them.  Those projects were laid out in 1982 and changed a few times so that by 1986 they were hopelessly out of line. Would anyone who has any experience of business or the shareholders in such a <Col N="395" /> company dismiss such management?  I would like to bet they would because if they did not they would not have a company very long.  If we do not soon dismiss the management here we will not have a country soon.  People have been voting with their feet for many years by emigrating.  They have now started to vote with their money by taking it out of our country and that is a situation that the management of this country has to face squarely and come up with some solution.</P>
    <P>In 1982 the Taoiseach told the country in his joint programme for Government that the most urgent problem was that of unemployment.  Last week the Taoiseach said &ldquo;our greatest challenge is to put our unemployed back to work&rdquo;.  Now that is the same statement four years later from the same person.  What has happened in between?  Why does it have to be said four years later?  It is quite obvious that some 70,000 extra people have become unemployed in between those two statements. Last week's suggestion that unemployment was now a major concern is one with which I agree.  The Taoiseach is right.  The only difficulty I have with that is that he also said it in 1982.  He has had four years in charge of the country and has not done anything about it.  It is significant and I think it is a fair and objective comment.</P>
    <P>I would not like to be in the position tonight of just making an Opposition party speech in the sense that we think everything the Government do over there is wrong and that everything we do over here is right.  That has never been my attitude to politics and it is not tonight.  What I am saying is that on an objective analysis, looking at the figures coldly, comparing them with what the Government said they would do and what they brought in as a result, there is only one conclusion and that is that the management has to go and we have to get a fresh start.  A good time to do that is tomorrow because if we do not do it tomorrow we may not get another opportunity for some time.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="396" /> At the weekend Ard Fheis the Taoiseach turned to the unemployment problem and talked about some solutions.  He talked about job sharing; that is not very fresh.  He talked about absenteeism and he talked about making up jobs in the Civil Service for youngsters at half the price.  Maybe some of these things are worthy.  There may be something in those and I would be happy to examine those with any Member of this House.  There may be something in it that may help the country but I want to say bluntly that those solutions coming out this weekend are totally disproportionate to the scale of the problem we face in this country.</P>
    <P>They are fiddling while Rome burns. They are fiddling around the edges with those kinds of solutions.  What was needed from the Taoiseach last weekend or today in the House was some more imaginative, dramatic and radical approach.  After four years of difficulties and facing the crisis we do now, we deserve better from the Head of the Government than to be told that the solution lies in reducing absenteeism, in job sharing and putting some youngsters into the Civil Service at half price.  There has got to be more than that and if there is not then clearly we must have new management and have it quickly.</P>
    <P>In 1981 1,000 people annually were coming into this country.  There are now 31,000 leaving it annually.  Those figures speak for themselves.  In the 1970s there were 14,000 people coming into the country annually.  In ten short years we have moved from a position in which 14,000 people were coming into the country annually to one in which 31,000 people now leave it annually.  We must ask ourselves: can we allow that to drag on without taking some decision to clear the air? I suggest that that decision should be some fresh management of the country and quickly.  We shall have a chance to do so tomorrow.</P>
    <P>Interest rates are crippling Irish industry. They will push up many farmers' debts.  They will add £70 million to the cost of Irish industry, all of which could be avoided if the correct financial policies were pursued by this Government.  I shall <Col N="397" /> go into that matter in more detail on another occasion.  The reasons for those high interest rates are excessive levels of Government borrowing, a loss of confidence in our economy leading to an outflow of £1 billion or more and a clear monetary vote of no confidence which is being given this nation at present.  The Government's response to those high interest rates has been to blame speculators, contending that traders are taking their money out and speculating in sterling. In my view that is no way to behave &mdash; to blame traders and business people because they take their money out of the country.  It should be remembered that they do so when there is uncertainty.</P>
    <P>There was also a Government announcement to accelerate foreign borrowing. Is that not where we came in?  Is that not how the problem started?  The Minister announced last week that he would accelerate foreign borrowing in an endeavour to cool down interest rates. Finally he said he would put a limit on borrowing and on the deficit.  That is fine if one could believe it but there were five other targets and this is just another.  That response to the crisis on the financial markets in recent weeks was not adequate and a lot more imagination was deserved in all of that.</P>
    <P>I had wanted to cover the rate of taxation and so on.  I might make one point about that, a very important one.  Ten years ago 25 per cent of people here paid over the standard rate of income tax whereas today 40 per cent pay above the standard rate.  If that does not constitute an increase in taxation on a dwindling number of people working &mdash; there are fewer people working, paying more taxation trying to create some wealth out of that small base &mdash; I do not know what does.  It constitutes a very heavy weight to be carried by the public.</P>
    <P>There are some answers to all of this. The first is to decide whether we will have this management for another 12 months or some other, so that we can get some certainty, get Ministers out of marginal constituencies back into their offices where some decisions can be taken.  We must get the Government let alone the <Col N="398" /> people back to work, stop the electioneering that is taking place at present and get back to running the country.  If that is not possible then they should get out and let somebody else do so.  Somebody has got to run this country, starting now.</P>
    <P>This debate is about time.  We are talking about when the Dáil will end.  It will end and I want to suggest to my colleagues this evening that time is of the essence.  We could wait a few months.  It would not matter much to many individual politicians, but why do so when we have this crisis on hand?  I ask those few people who will have the deciding votes tomorrow evening to take the decision. In the interest of the country I ask them to realise that time is of the essence and to change the management.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughCoveney" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say a few things first about the achievements of this Government and the overall economic situation.  It is true to say that any Government will have success as well as failure.  It would not be honest of me to suggest that everything this Government do is right.  The previous speaker made the same point, that right is not all on the one side.  However, there are significant achievements that ought not be overlooked in a debate of this kind.  The Taoiseach referred to some of them today so I shall not dwell on them for too long.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People would have short memories indeed if the successes in the whole area of inflation and competitiveness of this administration were not acknowledged. Undoubtedly the biggest single issue facing the country at the start of the 1980s was inflation which was seemingly out of control.  At that time I remember that sectors that would not normally be involved in the general economy, such as agriculture, were contending that the biggest single issue confronting them was not anything to do with agriculture directly but the whole question of inflation when prices were pegged to European levels and costs were pegged to outrageous inflation here.  That is one example only.  Many other sectors felt similarly.  All companies whose prices <Col N="399" /> were determined abroad were rapidly going out of business.  That trend has been reversed dramatically.</P>
    <P>The question of interest rates has been raised here today.  It is easy to make a point about them in relation to what has happened in the last few weeks. However, when we talk about currency and interest rates, it is only fair to talk about general trends over some kind of an extended period rather than merely the occurrences of a couple of weeks.  On that count, to date the trend has been downward.  Having said that, there is no doubt but that the widening gap between interest rates and inflation represents a serious problem not for this country alone but also for Great Britain.  Indeed the issues related to that fact need to be carefully identified as between those within our control and those that are of an international nature and about which we should be making representations abroad.  Undoubtedly if inflation is dropping and interest rates rising, or being maintained at levels way above the level of inflation, then business cannot afford to borrow, invest or expand and that is vital to our future.  However, it is not fair simply to represent the issue as something that has occurred in the last couple of weeks as a result of particular circumstances.</P>
    <P>On the balance of payments, the Government have had a considerable success record.  I think the Government have failed on the question of the current budget deficit.  I agree largely with many of the things Deputy Séamus Brennan had to say about that but it presents this, or any other Government, with some very difficult questions related to tax, borrowing and public expenditure.  This Government are consistently criticised for high rates of tax, excessive borrowing and public expenditure but nobody I hear is really providing an alternative workable solution.  Assuredly, if any Government wish to solve the problem of the current budget deficit and the associated finances of the country, then choices have to be made in regard to tax, borrowing levels and public expenditure.  We cannot <Col N="400" /> have high public expenditure, low borrowing and low taxes.  The equations simply will not work.</P>
    <P>I want to say something about employment. It is almost a cliché now to say that it is the biggest issue facing the country. It is that and will remain so for as long as anybody can think into the future.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach spoke today about employment and the fact that the rate of employment has been drastically reduced, but that is not in any sense a satisfactory answer to the problem, nor did he suggest that.  Simply saying that this Government have presided over a rapid increase in unemployment is stating the obvious in that no Government in the period of international recession with a rapidly growing labour force and with an international trend of substituting machines for people, would have presided over anything different, although there may be marginal differences.  We have a semi-permanent problem in this area and we need to address it together.</P>
    <P>I believe there are solutions but it would be glib to say there is a solution that will eliminate the problem.  That is not so.  We are talking about solutions that will reduce the problem consistently and ultimately to levels that would be regarded as acceptable.  The only way to do that is to increase the growth rate rapidly, and the only way to increase the growth rate rapidly is to increase our exports dramatically.  I am suggesting that all our efforts should be bent in the direction of export driven rapid growth which would include hidden exports like tourism and import substitution.  How to do that is not easy because it is a complex matter requiring advances and improvements in a myriad of areas so that our goods and services are competitive and are what people worldwide wish to buy.</P>
    <P>There are advantages and disadvantages. On the advantage side we are a small producer by reason of our size and population, and if we were to double our growth rate and exports we would not cause any hassle for competitor countries. This means there are opportunities for us to grow without a serious reaction <Col N="401" /> from out trading partners and competitors. We are on the edge of the biggest and wealthiest market in the world &mdash; 300 million people in the Community of which we are a member and to which we have total access.  To the west there is a unique situation in that the United States claimed in their last census to have 40 million people of ethnic Irish origin.  If that is not a potential market I do not know what is.</P>
    <P>Our problem does not lie in markets. The markets are there &mdash; huge massive markets &mdash; which we can expand and grow to fill, but, unfortunately, we are not very good at doing that.  That is what all future Governments need to bend their minds to because while it is possible to alleviate unemployment with social employment schemes &mdash; and they are important, particularly now &mdash; nothing should divert us from making this an export driven high growth economy which means a competitive economy, and at that we must be better than anybody else.</P>
    <P>Recently I came across an OECD survey which attempted to rate the export performance of 25 developed countries, including Ireland.  Under the vital headings of &ldquo;Marketing and Sales&rdquo; we were placed last.  I take heart from that because we can only go in one direction.  There are enormous potential opportunities for us once we improve our marketing skills and salesmanship, but this will not happen just by talking about it.  The fact is that this is being done by some companies, Waterford Glass, Baileys Irish Cream and a range of companies which have been market leaders worldwide in the products they have chosen.  This proves Irish companies can succeed, Irish workers can produce the quality and Irish management can manage, but it is not happening often enough and there are not enough success stories to make the breakthrough in the export markets which will lead to growth, wealth, employment and the higher living standards to which the people aspire.  It is in that direction I believe we must go in the future.</P>
    <P>I disagree with some of the emphasis <Col N="402" /> given to certain elements, such as absenteeism. Of course this is important but I do not believe we should spend our time debating absenteeism as a major factor in job creation.  We need more radical approaches.  We need to motivate people to improve their marketing and design skills, and the quality of their products. If that means better management and union relations, we have to promote that. If it means involving people on the shop floor, making people feel a part of the product they are making rather than a them-and-us attitude, which has prevailed too long in Irish industry, we must address that, and we must not be afraid to legislate in that area if we cannot get agreement.  We have to be price competitive and that does not mean simply cutting wages or keeping wages down. Wages are only one element.  We are talking about unit costs.  There is no reason we cannot have well paid high producing jobs.  We have to concentrate on better delivery.  That is a problem for Ireland because no matter what form of transport we have, we are competing with continental countries which can drive their trucks from Holland into Germany, but we have to fly or ship our products. The Government should concentrate on streamlining our transportation system.</P>
    <P>We need to do something about energy.  Our energy costs are not competitive. It is not enough to talk to industry and labour about their costs.  We have to talk about the costs that we, as a Government, impose on them because we have high uncompetitive energy costs, very expensive transportation and relatively poor infrastructure.  All these elements are contributory factors to costs.  This is an area where the Government can do something.  I believe we must concentrate very heavily on those areas in the future as well as encouraging and promoting efficiency and excellence in the workplace and in management, and an openness on the part of negotiators, management and unions to the fact that they have a common objective rather than a continuous tussle.</P>
    <P>These are attitudinal changes but if <Col N="403" /> politics and Government are about anything, they are about trying to get consensus and about leadership.  For too long we have developed and attitude of a splitting up of the people.  We are all in the same boat but very often we are rowing in opposite directions.  We need a single-minded approach to the problem of employment based on developing a high, rapid growing economy related to our export performance and we must do everything possible to bring about the efficiency, excellence and impetus needed for us to compete on world markets.</P>
    <P>I want to say a few words about the Cork region.  In the past week there have been reports that neither the Government not the Minister for Foreign Affairs are doing enough for Cork.  I want to set the record straight.  The leading Opposition Deputy from Cork is on the other side and he might want to contradict me, but I do not believe he can seriously contradict the facts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not do that.  I am listening with bated breath and with keen interest to hear what Minister Barry has done for Cork.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughCoveney" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say something about the Government's achievements and then I want to say something about my priorities and what I believe the Government's priorities should be.</P>
      <P>Cork suffered a disastrous period in the early eighties through the collapse of the old industries &mdash; Fords, Dunlops, Verolme and many others.  Those trying to pick up the pieces were faced with very difficult decisions as things were catastrophic, socially and economically. Against that background, during the period of this Government, many new industries have come to Cork in the electronics, chemical and food industries and other high tech organisations.  These are the hope for the future although we want more companies to come in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the first time the IDA established a board outside Dublin and the small industries board in Cork have been <Col N="404" /> hugely successful in the creation of small industry.  In addition, the Government, through the IDA, provided a new enterprise centre which it is hoped will become a centre of economic activity for new and developing businesses.  A new craft centre has also been provided in the Shandon area.  It is easy to forget that one old industry, Irish Steel, was supported by the Government and taxpayers by the injection of huge sums because the Government saw that as a priority.  I hope that industry is now thriving.</P>
    <P>In the area of infrastructure, which is an important element in the rebirth of Cork, more has happened in the five years of this decade than in the previous 25 years.  Major new roads and three new bridges have been constructed.  The quay walls have been rebuilt and two large multi-storey car parks have been built, one by the public sector and the other by the private sector.  As far as the private sector is concerned, that could only be done because of the important tax concessions given to people who invest their money in projects of that kind.  The deep water berth at Ringaskiddy has been completed and there has been no lack of commitment to developing infrastructure in Cork.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">

    <Speaker pid="HughCoveney" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>Schools and sports halls have also been developed and a large number of primary and post-primary schools are on the drawing board, under construction and completed as well as a number of sports halls.  A series of Garda barracks have also been erected around the city.  There has been a significant investment in a major environmental park in the centre of the city as well as continuing investment in housing.  In attacking the Government for not providing other facilities &mdash; which I, too, would like to provide &mdash; it should not be forgotten that they have injected massively in Cork&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I will do so and I am sure the Deputy will assist me.  What about priorities for Cork?  No matter what any Government provide, there will still be priorities.  If that was not the case there would be no purpose to public life. People quickly forget anything that has been done in their anxiety to promote other ideas and desirable objectives.  I fully accept that.  There are priorities for Cork which must be delivered quickly, not for any political reason but because they are needed for the development of the Cork region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="HughCoveney" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no disagreement between Deputy Lyons and me in regard to priorities.  The first priority is for the IDA to urgently procure a number of large industries.  That is self-evident but at least things are happening now which was not the case some years ago.  Major companies are coming to Cork and if they are interested there will be a high percentage of success in locating industries in the area.  Nothing would lift the morale of Cork more than a decision to locate one or two major industries there.  I am very hopeful in that regard although I am not in a position &mdash; no more than any other Deputy &mdash; to make any announcement.  The high level senior manager from the IDA head office is committed to delivering a major industry to Cork which would change the face of the city.  If that means Ministers or anybody else intervening and assisting the IDA, that must be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second priority is support for the five-year development plan at the microelectronics research centre led by Dr. Rickson.  This centre is the reason for industrialists coming to Cork but it needs to be continually upgraded and developed.  There must be major infrastructural transport links and extension of the runway at the airport which is essential for a variety of reasons, the main one being that larger planes could then use the airport and the relatively high diversion rate associated with Cork airport in certain weather conditions would <Col N="406" /> be halved.  I have no doubt that in the consideration of the Estimates which has just commenced that project will meet with favour and that plans in that regard will be announced when the Estimates are introduced.  If not, I will be gravely disappointed.</P>
    <P>The other important transport link, which has wide implications for the whole county of Cork and the tourist areas of Cork and Kerry, is the ferry.  The proposal for a ferry has been with the Government long enough.  It is a moving target because one reads in the paper that perhaps the proposal is no longer viable. I do not know but there is a solution to the problem provided we can get the same, or marginally more, level of commitment than in previous years.  It should not be forgotten that over the last three years the Government offered to support it but it has not been possible to put it together for reasons not related to the Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughCoveney" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I call on the Government to make an urgent decision on the matter and I make no apology for doing so as it is vital for the region.  We also need a decision, in principle, about the type and timing of a lower river crossing on the Lee.  Nobody suggests that it should be built tomorrow but we should be thinking about it.  Traffic arrangements in Cork are substantially better now since the new bridges and roads have been completed. Undoubtedly in the next decade, the question of industrial development at Ringaskiddy, which I hope will have taken place by then, will require that all the traffic will not have to go through the city and that there will be a linkage lower down the river.  In that context it would be good for the confidence, future and planning of Cork if a decision was taken about this matter in the not too distant future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In conclusion, this debate gives us an opportunity to talk about the achievements and failures of the Government and the hoped for priorities which are <Col N="407" /> important for the future of Cork.  I do not think therefore that there is any need for a change of Government.  There is much work to be done.  I look forward to the months ahead when we will complete many of the things which are important for this country and for the region I come from.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Health Board Decisions.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>First, a Cheann Comhairle, I thank you for granting me permission to raise this matter on the Adjournment and I thank the Taoiseach for coming into the House at this late hour to deal with it.  Today during Question Time I asked the Taoiseach, in view of his reported comments in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of 18 September that some decisions made by health boards were pretty perverse, if he would elaborate on that statement which he made at a rally of Fine Gael in Clondalkin on 17 September. That was rather intemperate language, not the sort of language one would associate with a Head of a state.  It caused a lot of anxiety to members and staffs of health boards as they believed that the Taoiseach was pointing the finger at them.  What I would have liked the Taoiseach to tell me today was which board or boards he was pointing the finger at and to give us examples of the perverse decisions they made.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach in his reply quoted mainly statistics as to the increased allocations made to the health boards over a four year period, a 24 per cent increase in the non-capital allocation.  While on all sides of the House we would be concerned at the high cost of health care &mdash; 19 per cent of non-capital expenditure in the current year &mdash; I do not think that the remarks of the Taoiseach were justified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach quoted a figure of an increase of 24 per cent in the non-capital allocation between 1982 and 1986 but <Col N="408" /> in answer to a question in this House, Question No. 496 on 19 February 1985, the Minister for Health stated that there was a real decrease in every health board area, except in the Eastern Health Board area, in the period from 1982 up to and including 1985.  The only reason the Eastern Health Board area did have a small increase is because they operate in a rapidly growing area with a rapidly growing population and because they provide a wide range of services nationally.  The situation is that the health boards had a real decrease and this has been admitted by the Minister for Health.  Yet, the Taoiseach tells us that there has been a 24 per cent increase and that they should be satisfied with that.</P>
    <P>The estimated deficit this year between the eight health boards is between £25 million and £30 million some of which has been carried over from last year.  In fact, only one health board area last year had a credit balance.  Some of the boards are in a very serious situation.  The South Eastern Health Board, the Southern Health Board and the Eastern Health Board, for example, have very serious problems with their deficits because of a lack of funding by the Government.  All the health boards have problems.  There are problems in the acute hospital service where wards have been closed down, where there are long delays for outpatient services and where people are being discharged earlier than they normally would be discharged.  In the community care services there is no dental service available for adults who have medical cards. In many parts of the country there is no optician service.  In our constituency, a Cheann Comhairle, I recently met a widow on the lowest income in the land going off to the credit union to see if she might borrow the money to enable her to attend a dentist as there was no dental service available to her under the health services.</P>
    <P>The health boards have a statutory obligation to provide a service and because of insufficient funding by the Government they are unable to do so.  It was wrong of the Taoiseach to blame the health boards and at a party rally to state <Col N="409" /> they were making pretty perverse decisions.  I would submit that the perverse decisions have been made by the Government and imposed on the health boards by edict.  The Government, apparently on the eve of the budget, made the decision to close eight hospitals. There was no reference whatsoever to the health boards and on 30 January the Minister for Health on behalf of the Government announced that eight hospitals were to be closed.  That was the first anybody knew that these hospitals were to close.  Included among those hospitals were St. Dympna's in Carlow and St. Patrick's in Castlerea, both of which are psychiatric hospitals.  This caused great anxiety not alone to the members and staffs of the health boards but also to the patients, the patients' relatives and public generally.  It was stated in this House that those hospitals were to close by the end of June.  In fact, they are still open.  Much unnecessary anxiety has been caused to the people and the health boards by that decision of the Government which I would consider a perverse decision.  Certainly, it was not made by the health boards because they did not know anything about it.  There had been no consultation whatsoever with them.</P>
    <P>While Beaumont is not a health board hospital there have been a number of U-turns by the Government, including one to reverse a decision of the previous Government, that the consultants be allowed build their own private outpatients' hospital on the site.  Apparently that decision has since been reversed and the consultants are to get that permission.  The Minister in a reply to a question in this House stated that work was to commence on a nurses' home in the autumn of 1984 but then he announced that a nurses' home would not be built there.  One of the problems the health boards have is that they do not know what is happening.  It is not that the health boards are making perverse decisions but they are in a critical position because they do not know the direction the Government are taking or their policies.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="410" /> At regular intervals the Minister promised to introduce a Green Paper on the health services but in reply to a question on 15 May he said that he did not now intend to publish a Green Paper.  He told the House on that occasion that he intended making submissions to the Government.  Today in Questions Nos. 281 and 282 tabled by me I asked the Minister, about an extraordinary statement by the Secretary of his Department at a meeting of the World Health Organisation at Dromoland Castle where he said that it was the first time a policy direction had been announced publicly. He produced a 39-page document outlining the future policy.  I do not know if he was articulating official Government policy or the policy of the Fine Gael or Labour Parties.  In answer to those questions the Minister said:</P>
    <P>I have now decided that this preliminary statement should be developed into a consultative document for dissemination to all concerned with health in its broadest terms.  This will be available shortly.</P>

      <P>My question to the Taoiseach today related to his remarks about pretty perverse decisions being made by health boards.  He did not deal with that issue and said he did not wish to get involved.  He said he had no desire to prolong the controversy or to give any credibility to those cases by referring to specific examples.  In my view it is important that he should refer to specific examples.  I have given a reason why there may be confusion in the Taoiseach's mind about health boards because those organisations, staff and members, admit to being confused about what is happening in regard to Government policy and about precipitive decisions made, such as the closure of hospitals on 30 January last.  An announcement about those closures was made in the House on that date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="411" /> Today the Minister made the statement I quoted and it appears from that that we are to have a Green Paper.  The kernel of the problem as far as health boards are concerned is that they do not know what is happening.  An element of confusion exists but I do not think it justifies the Taoiseach's statement that health boards are making pretty perverse decisions.  The Taoiseach, when asked to elaborate on that statement, should have given examples of those decisions and indicated to us the boards who are making such decisions.  The boards are entitled to know because the Taoiseach's statement, as reported in the newspapers, points the finger at all health boards.  I do not think it is right to point the finger at any health board because they have a statutory obligation to provide health services but they have not been given sufficient funds to do that.</P>
    <P>In reply to a question in the House earlier this year the Minister told me that there was a real decrease in each board, with the exception of the Eastern Health Board and the Southern Health Board, the two organisations who are catering for expanding cities.</P>

Health boards are expected to operate with a real decrease in their allocation. They are being asked to provide a greater level of services in that they have been asked to develop the community care services and must cater for the greater demand for existing services. That demand has come about because of Government policies, particularly in <Col N="412" /> regard to employment creation.  Unemployment increases the demand for health services.  I should like to give the figures in relation to the North Western Health Board as an example.  The decrease in 1983 over 1982 was - 2.8 per cent, in 1984 over 1983 it was -3.4 per cent&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am anxious to give this information to the Taoiseach because it was he who said that health boards in the last four years received a gross increase of 24 per cent.  He used that figure to justify the remark he made at Clondalkin.  It is only right to point out that there has been a real decrease and that health boards are not making perverse decisions, as accused by the Taoiseach. In fact health boards have behaved in a responsible way in that they have maintained a level of services, not an adequate one, with a grossly reduced allocation from the Government.  There has been pruning in some areas such as in the amount of stock carried, the use of transport and in energy costs.  Two years ago health boards reached the stage where they could not prune any more without reducing the level of services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are entitled to get clarification of the Taoiseach's statement in Clondalkin. He should give us examples of the pretty perverse decisions he spoke of and indentify the health boards and the decisions. If he does not do that he should withdraw the remark.  It is not sufficient for the Head of our Government to make such intemperate remarks and try to justify them in the House on the basis of a gross global figure that is not in accordance with what is happening in health boards. It is not good enough for him to say that he has no desire to prolong the controversy or to give any credibility to the cases by referring to specific examples and that Deputies on all sides should be aware of the type of cases he was referring to.  As a members of a health board I am not aware of what the Taoiseach <Col N="413" /> had in mind and I should like clarification of his statement.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand Deputy O'Hanlon's concern about this matter because his own health boards is one which has not offended in this respect and his experience would not correspond to the points I made.  I readily accord that the North-Eastern Health Board has an excellent record and nothing I said relates in any way to that health board.  Unfortunately, this is not true of everywhere else.</P>
      <P>I have not in front of me the exact figures back to 1982.  I have figures from 1983 to 1986 showing the total current expenditure on the health services as rising by about 17.5 per cent or 18 per cent and the consumers price index rising by exactly the same figure.  Certainly since 1983 there has been no reduction in the real volume of expenditure on the health services.  I believe the same is true since 1982 but I have not the exact CPI figure and I do not want to make any statement which I cannot stand over.</P>
      <P>In respect of the last two years, quite contrary to what the Deputy has said, there have not been real reductions in allocations to the health boards.  Last year, 1985, the increase in the CPI was 5.25 per cent.  No health board got an increase of less than 5 per cent &mdash; within a fraction of 0.25 per cent, there were no reductions.  The average was nearly 6 per cent and in some cases increases of up to 7.75 per cent were given.  In 1985 overall the health boards got an increase in real terms of 0.5 per cent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a detailed reply and I am giving straight facts.  The actual figures are here.  I will give the figures.  In 1985 the figure was £781 million, while it was £737 million the previous year.  That was an increase of 5.9 per cent, while the CPI increase was 5.3 per cent.  In 1986, however, during which the CPI is estimated to rise by 3.5 per cent the increase to health boards is 6 per cent.  I was <Col N="414" /> erroneously informed when I said 8 per cent.  That is the total increase in current health spending.  The amount actually going to health boards is an increase of 6 per cent and I am glad of the opportunity to correct that.  It represents an increase this year of 2.5 per cent in the volume of resources available currently to health boards and any suggestions that there has been a reduction during the past couple of years is incorrect.  There has certainly been no reduction since 1983.  There was a small increase last year and there is a significant increase in resources this year, the figures being £826.64 million in 1986 as against £781 million last year.  That is a 5.9 per cent increase in a year when the CPI is estimated to have risen by 3.5 per cent.  Do not let us pretend things are other than they are.  This year has seen a significant increase in the volume of resources to health boards and there was a small increase last year.  Attempts to suggest otherwise are simply not correct.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am giving the figures as they relate to these two years for health boards.  The earlier figure related to total health expenditure.  Since 1983 every health board except the North-Eastern Health Board have submitted estimates for the years ahead which are well in excess of the allocation accorded to them. They have then proceeded to classify the differences as shortfalls or cuts because they look for more than the amount provided and call that a cut, even though they have had real increases in the past couple of years, and over the period as a whole there has been no reduction.  The Southern Health Board, for example, projected cuts of £9 million a year in 1984 and 1985.  The reality was a figure of £2 million which was accommodated by the usual overdraft accommodation and overrun of balances.  The £9 million figure proved to be fictitious and was known to be fictitious at the time it was produced. The Deputy is pressing the issue.

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would prefer not to get involved with any particular health board in matters of this kind but the Deputy has pressed the issue and suggested in some way that my credibility is at stake.  I prefer in those circumstances not to make reference to particular boards but as the Deputy has challenged me and brought me here for an Adjournment debate I feel I ought to reply to the points he has raised.</P>
      <P>The Western and South-Eastern Health Boards have indulged in the following type of hype.  They have threatened to disemploy staff, to close wards, withdraw medical cards and close nurse training schools because of the alleged cuts, which were not cuts at all but excessive demands by them over and above the allocations to them, which in fact in the last two years involved real increases.  At the end of the year, of course, none of these things has happened.  This type of excercise has been very political indeed. The Deputy is well aware of the members of his party who have engaged in it in collaboration with people who are not directly involved in politics but who have an interest in getting more money for their sector, as have so many sectoral interests.  The combination of those kinds of approaches has led to this type of hype.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think I am justified in making a critical reference to this kind of behaviour.  I do not think it is proper behaviour for a public authority, even with a number of politicians on it, to disturb staff by threatening to disemploy them, to worry <Col N="416" /> patients or potential patients by threatening to close wards, to disturb greatly less well off people from whom they are threatening to withdraw medical cards and to upset the nursing profession by threatening to close nurse training schools when there is no need to do so and when no such events would happen within the amounts actually provided. Therefore, I regard the way in which some health baords have acted under political inspiration as undesirable and I think I am entitled to say so.</P>
    <P>I did not wish to mention particular health boards but the Deputy asked the question and brought me here on the Adjournment and I have given him a straight answer.  I hope the Deputy is satisfied.  The facts as stated fully justify the comment I made.  I think we are too mealymouthed in this country.  We spend our time pussyfooting around, never telling the truth about different kinds of behaviour or abuses.  Everybody knows there is massive absenteeism running to three or four weeks per person which is far beyond the average amount of actual sickness per worker.  Yet if one makes a reference to it it immediately becomes a major political issue.  I do not operate like that.  I believe that in politics you should come out and tell the truth bluntly.  If any public body is behaving in a way which is not proper to its function, then it is right that I, as head of the Government, should make appropriate comments.  It is the failure of politicians to confront these issues and the sweeping of things under the carpet that have this country in the mess it is in.</P>
    <P>We are talking of health boards, of which there are eight.  Does the Deputy know the total cost of travelling and subsistence expenses for the eight health boards?  Would he like to hazard a guess at the figure?</P>

Does the Deputy feel that amount is fully required and that wards could be kept <Col N="417" /> open if there were more prudent use of these kinds of resources by some of the the health boards concerned?  Can the Deputy defend that volume of money on people dashing back and forward to meetings when much of that money could be used to keep wards open?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am arguing that total travelling expenses are a very large figure.  Those are the kinds of things we want looked at.  There has been an enormous increase in the total spending on health and employment in health services over the last ten to 20 years.  It has been grossly excessive.  We are spending 40 per cent more of our national output on health than neighbouring Britain with its national health service which is supposed to be extraordinarily good.  Although we are a much poorer country than Britain, we are actually spending <i>per capita</i> almost 90 per cent of what Britain is spending, although our income per head is far lower.  Over-expenditure on health is the most striking aberration in the public expenditure of this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no area in which spending here is so out of line with other countries.  In education there is also a high level of spending but in that case we have 25 per cent more people in the educational bracket.  We do not have 25 per cent more people sick.  This is an area, therefore, in <Col N="418" /> which prudence is required.  We are very fortunate in having a Minister for Health who is willings to take on and tackle these problems and who has provided the resources.  This year there is an increase of 2.5 per cent in the volume of resources. He has tried to ensure that health boards act prudently but he is up against political attempts at the expense of staff, patients, potential patients and nurses to hype matters in such a way as to disturb and worry people for political reasons.  I do not believe that is the right way to do things.</P>
    <P>The whole question of the operation of health boards needs further consideration in the light of that.  I do not regard it as good democracy to frighten people with false scares for political reasons.  That is the worst kind of democracy. It is the kind of democracy of which we have had too much and it is time a stop was put to it.  It is time to speak the truth and come clean on these things.</P>

Until the necessary evaluation and planning work is completed, I am not in a position to comment on a supply to particular centres or on the timescale for such projects. In this context discussions are currently underway with the EC Commission on the content of a programme for submission under EC Regulation 3637/85, taking into account the adverse oil price movements since the Border areas gas project was mooted.</P>
      <P>I would add that all extensions of the supply network are considered on their own merits and the terms of supply to existing customers have no bearing on this evaluation.  Furthermore, it is not to be assumed that the extension of gas supply to the Border regions is more economic than meeting the needs of BGE's existing customers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Energy (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 19, 25 and 28 together.</P>
      <P>In relation to a Community inspection force the Commission in a communication to the Council dated 20 August 1986 stated, among other things, that if a system of Community checks were established it could operate selectively in order to ascertain the effects of national practices on safety standards and that by focusing on particular installations the Commission could be in a position to advise member states independently of the national inspectorates. The Commission indicated that this was one of the ideas they would be exploring.</P>
      <P>The question of a Community inspection force is currently under discussion in a Council working group and Ireland is pressing to have it put on the agenda for the next Council of Energy Ministers which is expected to take place towards the end of November.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every opportunity has been taken to express our concerns about Sellafield to the UK authorities.  I have explained to <Col N="42" /> this House on a number of occasions that the Government are totally opposed to any discharge of radioactive waste from Sellafield into the Irish Sea and want to see these discharges minimised and eliminated as soon as possible using the best available technology.  Furthermore, the frequency of incidents at Sellafield has caused a loss of confidence in the operation of the plant.  The view of the Government is that this is an international rather than a bilateral issue and that it should be resolved under the provisions of the Euratom Treaty.  The Government consider that a European inspection force is necessary to determine independently whether Sellafield can operate safely or whether operations should be suspended or cease until it can be rendered totally safe.</P>
    <P>The Government have been called upon from time to time to demand the closure of the Sellafield plant.  As I have previously stated, the question of closure is not a simple matter.  There is already a large quantity of spent fuel for reprocessing stored at Sellafield.  This would continue to require attention and management even if further reprocessing were discontinued.</P>
    <P>Ireland took the opportunity to raise the question of an international nuclear inspection force at the IAEA Conference in Vienna in September-October 1986. We called upon nuclear countries to implement their programmes in conformity with the highest possible levels of safety and contended that fulfilment of this obligation would require the establishment of an international nuclear safety inspectorate.</P>

      <P>There is no EC mechanism for giving financial assistance for either cut-away bogs or bog development.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="43" /> There are, however, proposals under consideration for use of part of the regional fund for exploiting indigenous energy potential in certain regions, including Ireland.

      <P>In May 1986 a sum of £383,000 was approved for office and laboratory facilities for the Nuclear Energy Board.  In addition £60,000 was approved for equipment and provision was made for five extra staff.</P>
      <P>As monitoring demands continued to increase in the wake of the Chernobyl accident, the Nuclear Energy Board sought and was granted an additional £167,000 for further monitoring equipment and four extra staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is unrealistic to contemplate the possibility of the board being equipped to deal with every conceivable nuclear <Col N="44" /> accident which might occur, bearing in mind in particular the fact that the installations and materials which would give rise to such accidents do not reside within our jurisdiction.  No country in the world is in a position to do this.  We are preparing emergency plans which are deemed to be appropriate in our circumstances, and the resources to be allocated to the NEB will be determined accordingly.</P>

      <P>Estimates of the mid-April labour force classified by broad sector of economic activity are compiled on an annual basis.  The figures for the 1980-85 period are shown in the following table which contains data for the agricultural and building and construction sectors, respectively.  There are no corresponding estimates for tourism which is not identified as a separate sector in economic activity classifications.  Tourist related activities extend across a number of sectors including transport, commerce, hotels, restaurants and other services, none of which are exclusively devoted to tourism.</P>
      <P>Estimates for 1986 will not be available until the second quarter of 1987 when the results of the 1986 Labour Force Survey come to hand.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach, given the potential for an Irish film industry, if he will state whether any progress is being made on the consideration of measures to encourage further investment in film making; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been a lengthy history of film making in Ireland from the turn of the century onwards.  It is, however, only since the establishment of Bord Scannán na hÉireann in 1981 that this country has had what might correctly be regarded as an Irish film industry.</P>
      <P>Since the establishment of the board, some 40 films in total have been made with the assistance of the State through its capital grant to Bord Scannán na hÉireann.  Of these, seven were full-length feature films, with the balance being a variety of short fiction, documentary, experimental and training projects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="56" /> As film making is commercial as well as cultural by nature, it is appropriate that Irish investors be encouraged to treat film making as an appropriate medium for investment.  In the course of production, film making offers considerable employment opportunities as well as ancillary benefits to service industries.  The Irish film industry also has potential for import substitution, foreign currency earnings, and offers the potential of promoting a favourable image of Ireland abroad.</P>
    <P>Bord Scannán na hÉireann and the Irish film industry in general are keenly aware of the need to attract additional Irish private sector investment to underpin the development of the Irish film industry.  The board has very recently submitted to my Department a detailed proposal designed to encourage such investment.  This proposal is currently being studied by my Department in consultation with the Department of Finance and I am hopeful that positive initiatives will ensue in consequence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Minister for Energy (Mr. Spring) Dick Spring">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Energy (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the receiver of Flair Resources (Ireland) Limited, which holds the State mining lease over the Ballingarry coalfield, was precluded, as a consequence of commitments entered into by the company prior to receivership from advertising the lease for sale prior to June of this year.</P>
      <P>In July the receiver advertised in Irish newspapers the availability of the lease for sale and he invited interested parties to contact him.  He received a number of indications of positive interest.  He is now in the process of advertising further in selected international publications.  It is not possible to say at this stage whether a suitable purchaser will come forward.</P>
      <P>I am anxious that the Ballingarry mines should re-open as soon as possible and my Department will give the fullest co-operation and assistance to the receiver in his efforts to find a purchaser.</P>

      <P>The Irish citizen in question was arrested in January 1985 and is currently serving a three year and nine month sentence for assault.  Written representations were made on behalf of the prisoner by <Col N="59" /> the Irish Embassy to the prison authorities on 4 August 1986.  These were followed by discussions with the assistant Governor of the prison on 1 and 17 September.</P>
      <P>The prison authorities informed us by letter on 20 August and in the subsequent discussions that they are prepared to consider an application from the prisoner for alternative work should he decide to apply.  The Irish Embassy has written to the prisoner and to his family informing them of the representations made and of the response received.  The Embassy will continue to pursue the matter with the prison authorities.</P>

      <P>As will be appreciated I am not at liberty to go into all the measures we take to ensure against falsification of Irish passports by drug traffickers or indeed any other criminal elements.  The Deputy's attention is drawn to two very significant developments which have been introduced in recent years and which will <Col N="60" /> ensure such falsification is rendered extremely difficult.</P>
      <P>The first was taken in December 1984 when the scheme of identification in Garda stations already in use in the rest of the State, was extended to Dublin. This scheme helps to prevent false applications and thus ensures that passports issued in the State get into the right hands from the beginning.</P>
      <P>The second step was taken in January 1985 with the introduction of the new Irish passport.  Special attention was given to security in the design of this passport.  The result is a passport of a very high standard which cannot easily be tampered with.</P>

Under Article 29 of Bunreacht na hÉireann, that agreement must be approved by the Dáil before it can come into effect.  I intend to introduce a motion for that purpose early in the current session.  After Dáil approval of the Agreement, the Government will make an order under the Diplomatic Relations and Immunities Act, 1967, giving the fund the capacity of a body corporate in Irish law.</P>
      <P>The Agreement establishing the fund provides for an independent board as the sole, principal organ of the fund.

        <i>Limerick East):</i> I understand that the Industrial Development Authority has approved grant assistance to the International Hide Group of Kilkenny towards the phased opening of their tannery plants, including Carrick-on-Suir, in the south east region.  The opening of the plants is to be phased by the promoters so as to facilitate their establishment on a sound commercial basis.</P>
      <P>I understand that the IDA is also providing support to a group of former workers of Irish Leathers Limited for the carrying out of a feasibility study on establishing a tannery project in Carrick-on-Suir. A report on the initial phase of the study is expected shortly.  The consideration of proposals involving assistance by way of grant or by other forms of capital funding is a day to day matter for the agencies concerned and consequently is one in which I have no function. However, my concern to see the establishment of viable commercial investment projects to provide employment in the Carrick-on-Suir area is known to those agencies.</P>

In addition, negotiations are taking place between the IDA and a number of overseas and indigenous companies in the county relating to the expansion of existing projects which, if proceeded with, will also provide significant additional employment.</P>

      <P>There are no proposals before my Department at present from Tipperary (SR) County Council for the provision of individual isolated cottages. Under the present cost control procedures, housing authorities are generally not required to submit such proposals where they already have a unit cost approval for such houses from my Department.  Tipperary (SR) County Council have such a unit cost approval.</P>
      <P>In submitting their claim for capital to meet expenditure on their housing construction programme in 1986, the council sought £180,000 for nine isolated cottages that they hoped to commence in 1986. The £1.1 million capital allocation notified to the council on 31 July to meet commitments on their existing programme, catered for expenditure on two of the cottages on which work had been commenced.  I will, if necessary, consider the question of making additional capital allocations in due course to finance new work (including isolated cottages) where I am satisfied that there is an established housing need and that the housing authority cannot meet any expenditure arising this year from their existing allocation.</P>

      <P>On 3 June 1986 Dublin County Council was informed of my decision to approve, in principle, the proposed completion of a new road link from the New Nangor Road to Boot Road in the Clondalkin area, without prejudice to any statutory procedures that may arise.  Outline technical proposals for the scheme, which were received recently from the local authority, are being examined by my Department.  As the scheme is at outline stage the question of providing a road grant does not arise at this stage.</P>

      <P>The Government arranged that an additional £1 million would be made available to the Task Force on Special Housing Aid for the Elderly and Needy operating under the aegis of my Department for the purpose of reinstating housing affected by the severe flooding to a habitable condition. At a special meeting of the task force held on 29 August 1986 it was decided that the local authorities involved should determine the nature and level of assistance to be given in individual cases where structural repairs and basic decoration, were necessary. Expenses certified as having been incurred on this basis are recoupable to local authorities from the special provision of £1 million.  At that time the local authorities, where there was evidence to hand of severe flooding in their areas, were circularised in the matter.  Subsequently the position in Sligo was dealt with on the same basis following an approach to the Department by the local authority.</P>

      <P>The delay in payment arose from the fact that the pensioner's husband's prior teaching service was only brought to light in 1985.  It was immediately pursued but there was considerable difficulty in verifying the service which was from 1935 to 1937.  The pensioner was advised on 18 July, 1986 that it had been verified and that arrears would issue as soon as possible.  The subsequent delay arose due to difficulties in relation to the application of the 25th Pay Round terms to all Civil Service pensioners.  Arrears in this case will issue from the office of the Paymaster General next week.</P>

      <P>Of the 44,500 hectares in question an area of approximately 5,500 hectares is reserved for conservation and amenity purposes.  Planting has been deferred on an area in the region of 800 hectares pending resolution of legal problems involving, for the most part, claims by local landowners to rights on commonage lands which my Department has purchased.  About 8,500 hectares of land are held subject to grazing and/or turbary rights in favour of local landowners arising mainly from legal settlements made by my Department in the course of partitioning commonages.</P>

Following discussions which I have had with the Central Fisheries Board, I will shortly be making a by-law which will prescribe a strict limit on the number of <Col N="128" /> pike which an angler may catch and retain in any one day.

      <P>My Department is very conscious of the impact of forestry on the landscape and, when establishing and managing plantations, takes this into account.  However, regard must also be had to such other factors as the location, setting and size of the plantation, the nature of the soil, the growth potential, edge effects etc.  The potential of the site frequently limits the variety of species that can be planted but whatever opportunities present themselves for good landscaping are availed of by the Department as far as possible within the limit of such constraints and prudent silvicultural practices.  Indeed, my Department has in the past been complimented in many areas for well-executed landscape work.  I should add that concern with the quality of the landscape is also reflected in the content of training courses for forestry staff and, <Col N="129" /> when required, specialist staff are available to advise forest managers on landscaping.</P>

      <P>The Foyle Fisheries Commission have informed me that despite comprehensive analytical investigations it has not yet been possible to establish what caused the tainting of salmon in certain areas in the River Foyle on or about 8-9 July last.  However, it appears from investigations carried out by the commission that the problem was confined to a small portion of the river, was of limited duration and that not all the salmon in the area were affected.</P>

The inspector wrote to the taxpayer on 10 August 1986 for the required details but there has been no response.  A reminder has now been issued to the taxpayer.</P>

      <P>The Revenue Commissioners advise me that there is no error in this case.  In addition to a retirement pension the taxpayer is in receipt of an old age pension and living alone allowance from the Department of Social Welfare.  All sources of income are chargeable to income tax.  The social welfare payments are made gross and it is standard practice to collect the tax attributable to them by restricting the aggregate tax-free allowances under PAYE.  As the amount of the taxpayer's social welfare payments for the current year exceed the total tax-free allowances due, there is no balance of such allowances available to be set off against his retirement pension which in consequence is liable in full at the 35 per cent rate.  A &ldquo;nil&rdquo; certificate of tax-free allowances was issued to the taxpayer on 14 July, 1986.</P>

      <P>The Revenue Commissioners have advised me that representations have been made on a number of occasions in recent years concerning this taxpayer's tax affairs.  In reply to a previous question tabled by the Deputy on 26 November 1985, it was pointed out that the taxpayer had been requested by the inspector on 18 April 1985 to submit certain details to enable the correct amount of tax-free allowances to be allocated against his retirement pension.  This information is still outstanding despite further requests by the inspector on 13 December 1985 and 15 September 1986.</P>
      <P>The inspector will not be in a position to carry out a review of the taxpayer's liabilities for the years 1982-83 to 1985-86, inclusive, until the necessary details are supplied.</P>

    <P>Notes on Table:</P>
    <P>(a)  The figures shown in this column are available only by reference to income tax years.  A married couple who has elected or has been deemed to have elected to have the income of both spouses assessed on the husband is counted as one taxpaying unit.</P>
    <P>(b)  Income tax collected through the PAYE mechanism covers more than income tax on ordinary wages and salaries.  It includes tax paid by directors of close companies who are akin to the self-employed as well as tax on &ldquo;other income&rdquo; of employees such as rent and other investment income.</P>
    <P>(c)  The average tax payment for each year is obtained by dividing the net receipt of PAYE tax in each calendar year by the number of taxpaying units effectively liable to tax in the income tax year in which the calendar year ends e.g. the 1980 net receipt is divided by the number liable to tax in 1980-81.</P>

      <P>The Commissioners of Public Works were not in a position to purchase the site on which it is intended to construct the new employment exchange until title to the site was established by the vendor.  It was also necessary for the Commissioners to negotiate for the purchase of an additional area of land adjoining the site so that conditions imposed by Limerick Corporation in relation to off-street car <Col N="158" /> parking could be complied with.  These negotiations have been successfully concluded and subject to satisfactory proof of title being provided by the vendor the Commissioners intend to purchase the site very early in 1987 and to commence construction of the new exchange during that year.</P>
      <P>In view of the proposal to purchase the site and commence construction work I hope that the industrial action will be suspended.</P>

      <P>Ireland has had a relatively small number of AIDS cases to date.  The USA experience is that cases double every seven to nine months but a similar pattern is yet to emerge here.

      <P>My Department, in consultation with the Attorney General's office, is currently examining the possibility of introducing new legislation, which would provide for the seizure and confiscation of the assets of drug traffickers.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will appreciate, this type of legislation is quite complex and has constitutional implications.  While it is not possible at present to give a date for the introduction of this necessary piece of legislation I can assure the Deputy that I regard it as a high priority and will introduce it at the earliest possible date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 280 and 283 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy is aware the budgetary arrangements for the health services for <Col N="161" /> 1986 require that expenditure be contained within the limits of approved allocations. Health boards and voluntary hospitals have been instructed accordingly and are expected to take all possible steps to achieve satisfactory budgetary results for the current year.</P>
    <P>Some health boards and hospitals are, however, experiencing difficulties in containing expenditure within the limits of approved allocations.  My Department is in close touch with these agencies on a continuing basis to ensure that all possible steps are taken to resolve the difficulties, consistent with the maintenance of emergency and other essential services.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances the Deputy will appreciate that the budgetary outlook for the year is constantly changing and that any estimates of shortfalls at this stage would imply my acceptance that in general health agencies have reached the end of the road as regards achieving further reductions in expenditure.  This I am not prepared to accept.</P>
    <P>I have not entered into negotiations with a bank to fund health care agencies during the remainder of 1986.  The traditional bank facilities are basically a matter for arrangement between the health agencies and their banks.  I expect that these will be adequate to meet health agencies' requirements in 1986.</P>

      <P>The presentation made to the World Health Organisation seminar in Dromoland Castle by officers of my Department represents my views and those of the Government in relation to an evaluation of the current status of health and health services in Ireland, and assessment of present problems and an indication of the direction which health policy should take for the future.  In the light of the favourable response to the policy statement from the World Health Organisation, the seminar participants and from many sources in this country, I have now decided that this preliminary statement should be developed into a consultative document for dissemination to all concerned with health in its broadest terms. This will be available shortly.  I will be inviting comments on the document leading to the possibility of a broadly-based national conference on health in mid-1987.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond) Barry Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>The closure of Sir Patrick Dun's hospital was part of the rationalisation plan for general hospital services in Dublin.  This plan which has been endorsed by successive Ministers for Health will result in the creation of a rational, cost efficient and integrated hospital system.  The occupancy rate in Sir Patrick Dun's was declining for the past number of years and having regard to the fact that the building was not suitable for the provision of modern acute services the Government decided to close the hospital in 1986.  The major specialist services formerly provided at Sir Patrick Dun's hospital have been incorporated into other south-city hospitals, mainly St. James's hospital.  This will result in an enhanced service for the total population of south Dublin.  The hospital was also, in fact a fire hazard.</P>

      <P>The members of the Nuclear Energy Board are appointed by the Minister for Energy.

      <P>Prior to Chernobyl the board operated an environmental monitoring programme principally designed to monitor the contamination of our marine environment which arose from radioactive discharges from Sellafield.  When Chernobyl occurred the board was called upon to expand its monitoring activities particularly in the areas of human and animal foodstuffs and in air and water samples and was immediately granted additional resources by the Government to do this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 294, 296, and 298 together.</P>
      <P>The borrowing requirements of health boards and health agencies fluctuate from day to day, being influenced by a number of variable interlocking factors.</P>
      <P>It is envisaged that the existing arrangements for funding health agencies will be adequate to meet their cash flow needs during the remainder of the current year.  The sources of funds for this purpose are grants payable from the Health Vote, income from sources such as payments for maintenance in private and semi-private accommodation and short term overdraft accommodation.  The level of cash flow needs of an agency is also influenced by balances of funds on hands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The cash flow needs of health agencies are kept under constant surveillance by my Department.  In the case of health boards there is a cash management system in operation under which their <Col N="169" /> cash needs are assessed at weekly intervals, based on relevant data supplied by the boards, and the grant payments by the Department during the week ahead are determined.</P>

      <P>I am not prepared to include asthma in the long term illness scheme.  The cost of so doing would be at least £10 million and such additional expenditure cannot be contemplated at present.  At least 40 per cent of asthma patients are covered by medical cards and those who are not so covered can avail themselves of the refund scheme, limiting monthly expenditure to £28, a limit which has not changed since January 1984.  Health boards are willing to take full account of the costs attributable to asthma, and other special conditions, when assessing applications for a medical card and will also make such arrangements as may be necessary where normal operation of the refund scheme would result in hardship. I am satisfied that, in the circumstances, the service available to asthma sufferers is adequate.</P>

      <P>Following investigation of the unemployment assistance claim of the person concerned he was assessed with means of £16 weekly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This assessment was calculated on the basis of the value of his board and lodgings in his parents' home by reference to their net income from an old age contributory pension of £84.20 weekly and from a county council pension of £44.84 weekly.  However, the assessment was subject to the limitation applied in such cases that the amount of means assessed against a claimant shall not exceed 12½ per cent of his parents' net income and he was, accordingly, assessed with means of £16.00 weekly.  He appealed against the means assessment and an appeals <Col N="178" /> officer on 26 September 1986 also assessed him with means of £16 weekly.</P>
    <P>He is, accordingly, in receipt of unemployment assistance of £19.50 weekly, being the appropriate maximum rate payable in his case of £35.50 less means of £16.</P>

      <P>The school meals scheme in Dublin city is administered by Dublin Corporation under legislation which enables, but does not oblige, urban local authorities to provide school meals in their functional area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the alteration of the city boundary in 1985 Regulations were made extending the school meals legislation until 1 <Col N="180" /> August 1986 to the areas excluded from the city and included in the county council area.  This provision enabled Dublin Corporation to continue to provide meals in schools in the excluded areas, including the schools referred to in the question, and the corporation continued to do so until the end of the 1985-86 school year.</P>
    <P>It was then decided to continue this provision indefinitely and regulations were made accordingly on 28 July 1986. Despite the enabling legislative arrangements Dublin Corporation decided not to continue providing meals on the existing basis in the two schools in question as well as three other schools in the excluded areas.  There is no legislative provision under which meals can be provided in these schools other than by the corporation on the existing basis.  Representations were made to the corporation by the Department but the Minister is disappointed that the corporation so far has declined to continue the provision of meals on the existing basis for the schools in question.  The Department will be in further contact with the corporation in the matter.</P>

      <P>The person concerned submitted a claim for contributory old age pension on 4 June 1984.  A second claim for the pension was received from him on 10 April 1986.</P>
      <P>One of the qualifying conditions for receipt of a contributory old age pension under the Social Welfare Acts requires a person to have a yearly average of at least 20 reckonable contributions over the period from the beginning of the 1953 contribution year or from his year of entry into insurance, whichever is the later, to the end of the last complete contribution year before reaching pension age.  The Department's records show that the person concerned does not satisfy this condition as he has no record of Irish insurance in the relevant period which, in his case, is from 5 January 1953 to 31 December 1973.</P>
      <P>Under EC Regulations on Social Security a person who has also been employed in another member state may have his insurance record in that member state combined with his Irish record during the relevant period if this would enable him to satisfy the foregoing condition. In such circumstances he would qualify for a <i>pro rata</i> pension based on the number of his Irish contributions in proportion to the combined total. However, in order to qualify for a <i>pro rata</i> pension from the Department a person must have some record of Irish contributions from 1953.  The Department has the British record of the person concerned but since he has no Irish contributions recorded in respect of him since 1953 he does not qualify for a <i>pro rata</i> pension.</P>
      <P>He is in receipt of a non-contributory old age pension at the rate of £11.75 per week from the Department and is also in receipt of a British retirement pension.</P>

      <P>The Social Welfare (Amendment) Act, 1985 provided for the implementation of EEC Directive 79/7/EEC on equal treatment for men and women in matters of social security. The Act was enacted in July 1985.  The revised definition of dependency under the Act is based on the principle that one spouse will be regarded as dependent on the other only if he or she is being wholly or mainly maintained by that spouse.  The 1985 Act provides that a spouse in employment will not be regarded as an adult dependant.  However, regulations being made under the Act will provide that where a working spouse is earning not more than £50 a week the spouse will continue to be regarded as a dependant and an adult dependant increase will be payable where the other spouse claims benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1985 Act provides that a spouse in receipt of a social welfare benefit in his <Col N="186" /> or her own right will not be regarded as an adult dependant of the other spouse. However, in the case of families where, in the week preceding implementation of the second phase of equality measures, both spouses are independently entitled to benefit, a special transitional payment of £10 a week will be made for up to one year to cushion the impact of the revised dependency conditions in these cases.</P>
    <P>With regard to the payment of child dependent allowances, where the spouse of the claimant is regarded as an adult dependant, the full child allowances will be paid to the claimant.  Where the spouse of a claimant is not an adult dependant, the claimant will be entitled to 50 per cent of the child dependant allowances. Where both spouses claim, each will be entitled to 50 per cent of the child dependant allowances.  The new provisions will come into operation on 17 November, 1986.</P>

      <P>Invalidity pensions in payment to married men with dependants were renewed from 2 October 1986.  Normally invalidity pension renewal books are in in the post offices of payment on the date of the last order in the old pension books.</P>
      <P>On this occasion, however, a delay occurred in the printing of the books which resulted in a slight delay in issuing the books to post offices.  However, the vast majority of them were in the appropriate post offices by the date of the first orders in the new books &mdash; 2 October 1986.  The remainder of the books were in the post offices within two days.  If, however, the Deputy is aware of undue delays in individual cases and he forwards the pensioners' names and pension numbers to the Department, the cases will be attended to as a matter of urgency.</P>

      <P>It is assumed that the Deputy has in mind the proposal for a universal minimum flat rate payment payable to all persons, with all other income being taxed at a single rate.  A guaranteed minimum income is a feature of what are known as negative income tax or social dividend schemes.  Under such arrangements, low-income households are allowed to retain their pre-tax income and they may also receive a supplement of &ldquo;negative tax&rdquo; to bring their income up to the target income.  The essential feature of both approaches is that they represent an attempt to integrate social security and taxation systems.</P>
      <P>The Commission on Social Welfare examined such proposals and assessed their relevance as strategies for social welfare-provision in the country.  The commission concluded, however, that such theories do not represent a useful approach in the Irish context, particularly because of the inherent cost of such schemes and because they constitute an inflexible method of meeting income needs.</P>
      <P>The commission's recommendations in this area are being examined in the context of the examination of their report generally.</P>

      <P>The Government have been considering proposals for the overhaul of the disability benefit scheme by transferring responsibility for payment of disability benefit during an initial period to employers and have consulted the National Economic and Social Council in the matter.  The council, having considered the proposal, indicated a number of areas where practical problems might arise in their implementation.  In particular, concern was expressed in regard to the costs for small firms and the difficulty of ensuring that small firms would fulfil an obligation to pay statutory sick pay.</P>
      <P>The Commission on Social Welfare considered that there are a number of positive aspects associated with the proposal but recognised also, that there are problems associated with it.  The problems which have been identified are at present being examined with a view to formulating an outline scheme which would provide a basis for further discussion of the proposal with employers and trade unions.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 374 and 375 together.</P>
      <P>The recommendations made by the Commission on Social Welfare in the area of income support for families include proposals that child dependant increases with social welfare payments should be retained and rationalised into one payment for all child dependants of social welfare recipients and that additional payments be made on a quarterly basis for families long term dependent on social welfare payments.</P>
      <P>The commission also recommends differentiation of child benefit rates by age and family size and the retention of the family income supplement scheme.</P>
      <P>The commission's recommendations in this area are relatively complex and the approach they recommend would differ from the approach outlined by the Government in the National Plan <i>Building on Reality, 1985-1987</i>.

However it is possible to have this quota transferred to the co-op on a year to year basis with the result that no super-levy would be incurred on deliveries to the co-op up to the aggregate of the two quotas involved.

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture the total number of gallons of flexi-milk which was available for farmers in 1985-86; the number of farmers who qualified for flexi-milk; if he will give a breakdown of the different categories of farmers who qualified and the gallonage allocated to the following creameries: Kerry Co-op, Ballyclough, Mitchelstown, Golden Vale, Waterford and Avonmore; the total amount available to all other creameries; the number of farmers who qualified in each creamery area; the gallons allocated to each farmer in the categories; if he will explain the supervisory role being adopted by his inspectorate in policing the allocation of quotas; the number of new entrants to milk production in each creamery area; the number of farmers who ceased production; the number of quotas that have changed hands; if he is satisfied with the overall working of the quota system since its introduction; if the creameries should show more efficiency in the operation of the quotas; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Deasy) Austin Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Deasy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The distribution of flexi-milk is only relevant in the case of co-operatives and other purchasers which exceeded their quotas.  In the case of purchasers who do not exceed their quotas such distribution does not arise because none of their suppliers are liable for super-levy.  The quantity of flexi-milk available for reallocation by purchasers which exceeded their quotas in 1985-86 was approximately 26 million gallons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1985-86 four categories of producers qualified for priority in flexi-milk allocations. These were (i) producers with quotas of 25,000 gallons or less who were following a milk development or <Col N="222" /> improvement plan (ii) producers in financial difficulty especially those in the &ldquo;rescue package&rdquo; (iii) producers who sold their land in 1983 or in early 1984 and who unwittingly relinquished their quotas and (iv) producers whose deliveries in 1983 were abnormally low due to an animal disease outbreak in the 1978 to 1980 period and who did not benefit from the reserve set up in 1984 under the cessation scheme.  In the case of the distribution of flexi-milk by those purchasers who exceeded their quotas the number of producers in the various categories was as follows: (i) 6,730; (ii) 762; (iii) 6; (iv) 286.</P>
    <P>The amounts reallocated to farmers were dependent on the quantities available in the purchasing area and the quantities required by the special categories in that area.  As the quota system is operated on a purchaser basis, details of the amounts allocated to each individual farmer are not collected.  Officers of the Department are, however, empowered to examine purchasers' records to ensure that the guidelines laid down for flexi-milk reallocations together with the other provisions relating to the quota system as contained in the regulations are being observed.  The Department does not have details of the number of producers who went out of milk production or of quotas that have changed hands.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that, taking account of the constraints which it imposes, the system is working reasonably well and that the purchasers are operating within the guidelines laid down.</P>
    <P>As regards the co-operatives named by the Deputy, two (Waterford and Mitchelstown) did not have super-levy liability in 1985-86 and consequently the distribution of flexi-milk is not relevant in their cases.  The following table gives particulars of the numbers qualifying in categories (i)-(iv) as furnished by the other co-operatives concerned:&mdash;</P>

      <P>The quantity by which our milk quota for deliveries was exceeded in 1985-86 was 670,000 gallons and super-levy of approximately £650,000 was paid on this quantity.  However, the Department is at present completing checks on the operations of dual quota holders (i.e. producers with a direct sales quota as well as a deliveries quota) and it is expected that as a result of transfers the net excess will fall to be reduced by approximately 200,000 gallons.  The appropriate refunds will be made to the purchasers and producers concerned in due course.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Dukes) Alan Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Dukes)</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer the Deputy to my reply to Question No. 58 on 27 February.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the time I referred to an announcement in January by my predecessor and the Minister for Health that a new unit <Col N="230" /> in the grounds of the Central Mental Hospital would, when completed, be transferred to my Department for the use of the prison service.  I indicated that the broad purpose of the unit's transfer was to enable facilities to be provided to treat offenders with medical-related problems in modern and hygienic conditions and that, for the foreseeable future, it would be used to cater primarily for female offenders.</P>
    <P>Such a move will involve the transfer to the unit of many of the women currently located in Mountjoy and a number from Limerick prison.  Because of the small size of the female offender population and the large proportion of them who have medical and related problems the transfer to the unit will mean that there will no longer be any need to accommodate female offenders in Mountjoy. Conditions for female offenders at the prison have been unsatisfactory for some time and the difficulties there have been greatly intensified by the increase in medical and related problems among female offenders.</P>
    <P>The regime at the new unit, however, will be different from that which has operated traditionally at the women's prisons and the emphasis at the unit will be on using the extensive modern facilities there to enable the needs of the female offenders, and particularly requirements arising from medical and related problems, to be coped with in a manner which is not possible in the existing traditional prison settings.  Accordingly, it would be entirely misleading to characterise the new unit as being a replacement for Mountjoy Prison.</P>
    <P>I should make it clear, however, that while, given the nature of the problems of the offenders who will be accommodated at the unit, emphasis will have to be placed on the medical services available to them the unit will not, in any sense, be a hospital.  The traditional arrangements whereby the health board provides hospitalisation for offenders in need of it will continue.  The women in the unit will be there because of decisions by the courts to confine them in custody and the role of the unit will be to confine <Col N="231" /> them in conditions which can take account of their medical and related needs in a manner which is not possible in a traditional prison setting.</P>
    <P>It will be clear, therefore, that while there are factors of security and health involved in both the Central Mental Hospital and the new unit the institutions will fulfill very different roles and, in these circumstances, it is intended that the unit will be run entirely separately from the hospital.  To facilitate this it is proposed in the course of a few months to erect a wall around the unit to completely separate it from the rest of the hospital grounds and to provide a separate entrance to it in the perimiter wall (it is hoped that it might be possible initially to run the unit to a limited extent without these works being in place but this is a matter which requires further consideration and discussion).</P>
    <P>The relationship between the unit and the hospital would essentially be one of &ldquo;good neighbours&rdquo;.  The unit will form part of the prison service and will be operated by my Department.  The hospital will continue to be run by the Eastern Health Board.  Prison service staff will not be involved in the operation of the hospital and, equally, hospital staff will not be involved in the operation of the unit.  In practical terms the only connection the unit will have with the hospital is that it is located (separately) in the same grounds and that heating etc. supplies will be shared.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances, there are no grounds for suggesting that the use of the unit by the prison service will interfere in any way with the existing services to patients at the hospital.  As I have indicated the institutions will be physically divided and operate separately.  The specific security requirements relating to the unit will not impinge on the patients of the hospital and are not expected to be any more intensive in kind than those which already apply in respect of the hospital itself.  Indeed, in relation to some individual patients who have attended the hospital the level of security which has <Col N="232" /> been applied to them has been far higher than anything envisaged as appropriate for any of the women who will be housed in the unit.</P>
    <P>Given the difficulties at present in providing appropriate facilities for many of the women in custody I am anxious that the transfer of the unit should proceed as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>For the first eight months of this year &mdash; the latest period for which figures are available &mdash; the Garda have recorded a total of 462 armed robberies and armed aggravated burglaries.

These figures are provisional at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have said in response to previous similar parliamentary questions and in the course of debates in the House, the Garda authorities have introduced certain measures to deal with the problem of armed raids.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Dukes) Alan Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Dukes)</NameTxt>
      <P>Expenditure on prison overtime to end September 1986 was £9,790,739 inclusive of £741,152 arising from the payment of arrears under the terms of a &ldquo;special&rdquo; pay award to prison staff.  Total expenditure for the full year is estimated at £13.40 million.</P>
      <P>Based on expenditure to the end of September and the average number of prison staff of all grades serving during that period the average overtime per prison officer for the nine months is £5,572.  This corresponds to an average of about 590 hours overtime per officer or 15 hours per week.  I should emphasise that these figures are averages and that levels of overtime vary between individuals and from prison to prison.</P>
      <P>Details of the maximum overtime earnings this year are not available at this stage and their calculation would take up a disproportionate amount of staff time. In 1985, the maximum payment was £20,336.39.</P>
      <P>I am conscious of the need to keep overtime working to a minimum.  Only essential overtime is worked and this is closely monitored in my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following a recent thorough review of prison staffing needs the Government has approved 184 new posts in the prison service.  Recruitment to fill these vacancies is now proceeding and most of the vacancies will be filled by trained staff by the end of this year.  I expect that the recruitment of these additional staff will <Col N="234" /> have an impact on reducing overtime expenditure in 1987 and following years.</P>

This project presented some complexities and cost difficulties, which it is hoped have now been resolved following consultation between the professional persons involved in the architectural planning.  A revised scheme including a cost plan has now been submitted by the school's architect and is being examined by the professional officers of my Department.  It is not possible at this stage to say when construction work will commence.  In the meantime, defective windows in the existing school have been replaced.</P>

      <P>In the National Plan <i>Building on Reality 1985-1987</i> the Government committed up to £1 million for adult education by 1987, directed primarily towards the provision of courses to overcome illiteracy and towards the development of community education.  The courses are intended to reflect the needs of the local community, in particular those in disadvantaged areas.  The amount so allocated in 1985 was £150,000 and in 1986 £350,000.</P>
      <P>Of these sums the City of Dublin VEC got £18,000 and £41,500 respectively.  My information is that approximately £32,500 was expended between January and June 1986, and £9,000 has been committed to cover the costs of literacytutor organisers for the period September-December 1986, leaving the committee in no position to support further projects of the kind referred to by the Deputy.  Following consultation with VEC's, and subject to the necessary funds being available, my Department has agreed to consider the position of committees which may have entered into such commitments in good faith and which they now find themselves unable to finance.  An appeal along these lines, recently received from the City of Dublin VEC is being considered in my Department in respect, <i>inter alia</i>, of projects of the kind referred to by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>The Business Expansion Scheme &mdash; also known as the Business Development Scheme &mdash; provides tax relief for individuals on money invested for specific purposes and is operated by the Revenue Commissioners.  Companies in receipt of grants under the employment incentive scheme and the work experience programme operated by the Department of Labour can also qualify under the business expansion scheme.  As the information sought is not compiled for qualifying purposes, I regret that I cannot be of any assistance to the Deputy.</P>

      <P>The incident has been the subject of continuing investigation by the industrial inspectorate of my Department.  Due to the many complex factors involved it has not yet been possible to reach a conclusion about the cause of the explosion. When the findings of the investigation become available the industrial inspectorate will issue advice on measures necessary to avoid such explosions.</P>
