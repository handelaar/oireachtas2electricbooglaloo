    <Speaker pid="MichaelBegley" hpid="Mr. Begley Mr. Begley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if the Government have any proposals to restructure the Seanad; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no such proposals at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBegley" hpid="Mr. Begley Mr. Begley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that graduates from Irish universities now domiciled in South Africa and who support apartheid can elect Members to the Houses of the Oireachtas?  Will he allow that position to continue?  As we have <Col N="2" /> banned their fruit, why not ban their votes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The electorate for university seats in the Seanad consists of graduates no matter in which country they live.  We have never made any distinctions in this regard and the issue has never arisen.  I note the Deputy's comments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBegley" hpid="Mr. Begley Mr. Begley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach still allow graduates who actively support the South African Government in public relations exercises around the world to vote in Seanad elections?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="3" />
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, some graduates may be in jail but they still have a right to vote in Seanad elections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Taoiseach, in one of his many capacities, do anything to ensure that university registers for the Seanad elections are updated and made more accurate than they usually are?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be very happy if that should be done as effectively as possible as I share the Deputy's awareness of the defects of the system which lead to very inadequate registers because of the problem of establishing addresses and the survival of graduates.  The registers are defective and I know that efforts have been made to improve their quality but, by the standards of other registers, because of the way they have to be compiled, they are defective and unsatisfactory in certain respects.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if the Government will consider marking the 70th year since the 1916 Easter Proclamation by a cultural or historic measure or measures, designed to encourage true patriotism based on nonviolence and the common good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There are no proposals for special commemorative measures this year to mark the 70th anniversary of the 1916 Easter Proclamation.  In the past, special commemorative events were organised for the 25th and 50th anniversaries. The annual commemoration will be held in Arbour Hill on 7 May 1986.</P>
      <P>Arrangements are also being made, as recommended by an informal Oireachtas all-party committee, for the holding each year of a national day of commemoration to honour all Irishmen and Irishwomen who died in past wars or on service with the United Nations.</P>

      <P>asked the Taoiseach the <Col N="4" /> consultations, if any, he has had with the Army regarding National Day of Commemoration 1986, to be held in July; the form the parade will take; and the organisations which will be invited to attend and participate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume that the Deputy is referring to the proposed national day of commemoration.</P>
      <P>I refer the Deputy to the reply which I gave to a similar question on 13 November 1985.  I am arranging to have the recommendations of the inter-departmental committee discussed with the parties in this house at an early date.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I ask the Taoiseach if consideration will be given to the report of the all-party committee in the sense that he will ensure that there is a substantial military presence in relation to the parade?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The form of commemoration will be discussed between the parties.  The existing proposals involve the participation of the Army but it is a matter for discussion between the leaders of the parties.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach the number of claimants of unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance in Dundalk town and Monaghan town; and the percentage of the labour force these represent, in each of the two towns.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. Barrett,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Dún Laoghaire</i>): I propose to circulate a tabular statement showing the numbers of <Col N="5" /> persons on the live register at Dundalk employment exchange and Monaghan employment office on 28 March 1986, distinguishing claimants for unemployment benefit, applicants for unemployment assistance and others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A special area of residence analysis of the live register is carried out in respect of the second last Friday of February, May, August and November.  On 21 February 1986, the latest date for which figures are available, there were 2,439 persons on the live register resident in Dundalk urban district and 457 resident in Monaghan urban district.  A classification <Col N="6" /> by type of claim is not available from this analysis.</P>
    <P>Since current estimates of the total labour force in urban districts are not available it is not possible to calculate unemployment rates.</P>
    <P>Following is the statement:</P>
    <P>The following table shows the number of persons on the live register at Dundalk employment exchange and Monaghan employment office at 28 March 1986 and distinguishes unemployment benefit and assistance applicants and other registrants.</P>

      <P>I do not want to give the wrong impression and we in the Border area agree that unemployment is high in Monaghan.  However, in view of the substantial numbers unemployed in the Louth area, with particular reference to north Louth, would the Minister use his good offices in arranging for the same facilities to apply to the level of grants for County Louth as to other Border counties and to investigate this matter?</P>

Suim £4.175 mhilliún atá údaraithe mar dheontas-i-gcabhair do chaiteachas caipitil i 1986 i gcomparáid le suim £5.125 mhilliún i 1985.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>As an 119 dtogra a dúirt <Col N="7" /> mé a bhí ann, tá sé an-deacair figiúr a fháil den mhéid a bhí ceadaithe roimh dheireadh na bliana seo caite toisc go raibh cuid acu gur tugadh cabhair dóibh cheana.  Tá sé an-deacair ag an bpointe seo é sin a dhéanamh ach d'fhéadfainn an t-eolas d'fháil don Teachta.  Deirtear liom go mbeadh deacrachtaí faoi leith ag baint le figiúr a thabhairt ag an bpointe seo.</P>

      <P>Is aisteach go dtabharfadh an tAire freagra den tsórt sin nuair atá figiúirí a dtabhairt ag na meán-chumarsáidí le roint seachtainí anuas.  Níor fhreagair an tAire an chéad chuid de mo cheist.  Níl mé sásta ar chor ar bith leis an bhfreagra atá an tAire ag tabhairt mar chuir mé an cheist san cheist Dhála.  Creidim go bhfuil deacracht uafásach ag an Údarás faoi láthair mar an deontas caipitil gur as a n-íoctar deontais chuig comhlachtaí a chuireann postanna ar fáil sa Ghaeltacht, tá laghdú mór ar an méid a fuair siad i mbliana thairis an bhliain seo caite agus teastaíonn uaim a fháil amach cé mhéid de na tograí atá ceadaithe do 1985, go háirithe i ndeireadh 1985, nach bhfuair aon deontas fós agus a thógas suas airgead na bliana seo i dtreo nach mbeidh aon airgead de chuid na bliana seo ar fáil do aon togra a cheadófar i mbliana?</P>

      <P>Glacaim leis go bhfuil deacrachtaí airgeadais ag an Údarás ó thaobh chaipitil de agus ta an cheist sin á plé agam faoi láthair leis an mbord.  Bhí cruinniú agam leo, mar tá a fhios ag an dTeachta.  D'fhéadfadh sé tarlú &mdash; agus níl anseo ach tuairim &mdash; go gcaithfí an t-iomlán ar thograí a cheadaíodh sa bhliain seo caite.  Níil an t-eolas sin agam go beacht agus níor mhaith liom dalladh mullóg a chur ar an Teach ach d'fhéadfadh sé tarlú.  Braitheann sé ar cén saghas togra atá i gceist agus nuair a bheas léibhéal na ndeontas agus chuile rud eile déanta amach go mb'fhéidir go dtarlódh sé go gcaithfí an t-airgead iomlán ar thograí a cheadaíodh roimh dheireadh na bliana.  Mar a deirim tá ceist airgeadais an Údaráis á plé agam faoi láthair agus <Col N="8" /> beidh mé ag dul ar ais ag an mbord agus ag an eagraíocht féin.  Tá súil agam amach anseo freagraí a thabhairt agus teacht ar réiteach, más féidir é, ar an gcruachás ina bhfuilid.</P>

An dtuigeann an tAire cé chomh docharach agus chomh timpisteach agus atá sé sin d'Údarás na Gaeltachta agus an é atá i gceist ag an Aire ná go stopfadh Údarás na Gaeltachta ag feidhmiú nuair a thiocfadh sé go dtí lár na bliana agus go mbeadh sé éasca aige féin an eagraíocht a dhúnadh síos.

Nílimse ag rá go dtarlóidh sé sin ach d'fhéadfadh sé tarlú agus ní chuile dhuine a dhéarfadh sin ag seasamh ar an dtaobh seo den Teach.  Táimse ag rá go bhféadfadh sé tarlú ach níl an t-eolas sin agam.  Ní maith liom ach eolas beacht a thabhairt don Teach.  Anois, tuigim sin ina iomlán cé hiad na deacrachtaí atá ag cur as don Údarás.  Níl sé ar intinn agam &mdash; níl a fhios agam cé mhéid uair a chaithfeas mé é seo a rá &mdash; an tÚdarás a chur as agus níl mé ag cruthú leithscéal go ndéanfaí é sin agus ná ceapadh an Teachta nó aon Teachta eile sa Teach seo gur b'shin atá ar intinn agam.  Mar adeirim, tig leis an Teachta a bheith cinnte go bhfuilimse agus go mbeidh mé ag plé na ceiste seo leis an Údarás agus tá mé cinnte go mbeimid in ann teacht ar réiteach ionnas go mbeidh an tÚdarás ábalta an job atá idir lámha acu a dhéanamh ar an mbealach is fearr do mhuintir na Gaeltachta.</P>

Níl airgead acu.  Tá tograí acu ach níl siad in ann na postanna a chur ar fáil.

      <P>Concerns about unapproved accommodation have been expressed from time to time and this matter is being continually monitored by my Department.  In my view, Bord Fáilte approval of tourist accommodation confers a very real competitive advantage on the premises concerned.  Approved operators are, for example, eligible to avail of capital improvement grants and to participate in all the board's promotional activities.  The Bord Fáilte sign of approval is a clear indication to the tourist of standards and service.  Nevertheless, in the light of recent complaints I am again examining this whole question to see whether there is scope for addressing the matter under existing consumer protection legislation.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 23 and 39 together.  The amount allocated to my Department for harbour development in 1986 is £1.8 million.</P>
      <P>The amount allocated for harbour development in County Mayo from the Fisheries Vote for 1986 is £143,430 apportioned as follows: Killala, £26,250; Purteen, £93,750; Ballyglass, £11,250; Blacksod, £3,000 and Killerduff, £9,180.</P>

I do not have the information the Deputy has requested with <Col N="19" /> regard to the western seaboard, but there is a total of £143,430 available for harbour development in County Mayo.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Minister for Tourism, Fisheries and Forestry (Mr. Kavanagh) Liam Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Fisheries and Forestry (Mr. Kavanagh)</NameTxt>
      <P>In their plan <i>Building on Reality</i> the Government affirmed their determination to ensure that our national forests are developed to the maximum national advantage and that Government investment in forestry over the period of the plan would aim, <i>inter alia</i>, at the establishment of plantations at an annual average rate of 7,500 hectares.  The current State planting programme is broadly in line with that target.  In addition to the State planting programme, my Department operate two planting grant schemes aimed at encouraging the expansion of private forestry and a special publicity campaign was recently carried out to promote those schemes.  I am glad to say that the response to that campaign has been quite encouraging and I am hopeful that as a result there will be a substantial increase in the level of private planting in the years ahead.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>It is fine to talk about afforestation, but it is a very serious matter to ensure that at maturity the timber will be used to the best advantage and will produce jobs.  Will the Minister agree that there is great dissatisfaction among processors &mdash; and this has been the case over the years &mdash; regarding the tendering system and the practice of imposing restrictions regarding quantities and so forth?  Small processors have been practically eliminated from tendering in many cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>The question referred to proposals to intensify afforestation and boost employment in rural areas and I think I have given a reasonable reply to that question.  The points raised by the Deputy have been taken up by me since I have come into this Department.  We are certainly taking action in those areas to eliminate, as far as possible, some <Col N="25" /> of the difficulties which have arisen in procuring supplies for the sawmilling industry.  I would have to say that the capacity in the sawmilling area vastly exceeds the amount of timber which is now available in the industry.  Forests that were proceeded with during the first Coalition almost 40 years ago will come to fruition in eight or nine years time and when this timber becomes available there will be a huge increase in the amount available for the industry.  The amount of timber becoming available is increasing annually but the people involved in the timber processing and sawmilling business have capacity that far exceeds the amount of timber available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister must be aware that the planting targets have not been reached.  In fact the rate of planting is in decline.  Last year something in the region of 6,000 hectares were planted, whereas the objective is 10,000 hectares.  Can the Minister indicate what action he proposes to enable us to fulfil the objective of planting 10,000 hectares per year?  The Minister cannot say that last year's planting of 6,000 hectares was on target.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy would listen he would get the facts and may be he would take them on board.  In 1985-86 there was an increase from 6,380 hectares to 7,284 hectares.  As well as that, a total of 764 hectares were planted with the assistance of private planting grants. That is an increase of about 1,600 hectares in one year, if my arithmetic is right. The figures of planting are actually going in the right direction towards the target we have set out.  The Deputy should accept the figures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully accept the figures but the planting target is 10,000 hectares, of which roughly 6,000 hectares were <Col N="26" /> planted last year.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know if the Deputy is even listening to the replies he is getting.  If he listened to the figures he would see that the target is being improved very considerably each year. In 1984-85 6,380 hectares were planted while in 1985-86 7,284 hectares were planted, an increase of 900 hectares.  The Deputy uses other figures because these do not suit his case.</P>

      <P>While we agree that there is adequate capacity, is it not true that the location of this capacity often involves the long haul of timber?  Would it not be better to put more emphasis on small units which are not now grant-aided in a constituency such as my own where there are very heavy imports of pallet timber, fencing and posting which could be produced in small units, thereby creating employment where there is none at present?</P>

Reports were received by the local forestry staff of a forest fire in the Ballyhoura area at 2.30 p.m. on 26 February 1986.  Due to the difficulties of the terrain and adverse weather conditions the fire was not finally extinguished until 4.30 a.m. the following day &mdash; despite strenuous efforts of the forestry workers, fire brigades, gardaí and Army units.  The fire destroyed about 300 hectares of young forest with a write-off value of £100,000. The area will be replanted as soon as possible and there will be no job losses arising from the fire.</P>
      <P>The gardaí who are investigating the causes of the fire are following a definite line of inquiry and pending completion of their investigation I do not wish to make any further comment other than to express my appreciation and thanks to all concerned who helped in extinguishing the fires.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister agree that there was a breakdown in communication between members of his staff because of the different areas that were involved?  Would he agree that the fire was seen at 10.30 in the morning preceding the blaze?  Would he explain to the House why there was such a misunderstanding among the area staff?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>A small group initially tackled the fire but due to the increasing wind velocity they were unable to control the fire.  The forester then implemented the major fire plan involving forestry workers, the fire brigade, the Gardaí and the Army.  The efforts of those involved in fighting the fire &mdash; who numbered about 190 at one stage &mdash; were greatly hampered by the conditions, but the fire was eventually brought under control 13 hours after it was reported and totally extinguished at 4.30 a.m.  I accept that initially there was an attempt to tackle the fire by a small group but when that proved not to be possible the major fire plan was brought into operation.  Reports in the media of £20 million worth of timber lost and huge amounts of mature timber being destroyed were not in accordance with the facts.  Only 300 hectares with a value of £100,000 were lost. The people involved, forestry workers, fire brigade, the Army and the Gardaí, showed their worth in being able to bring the fire under control and I am satisfied that everything was done to keep losses to the minimum.  Compared to what was originally reported, this was a very small loss indeed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am right in saying that the fire was noticed at 10.30 in the morning and no action was taken until late evening.  I have been informed that one of the reasons is the tight budget within the Department of Forestry.  The two foresters concerned were not in agreement as to who was responsible for what.  Their funding will be exhausted by October if the present trend continues and that was the major reason for the fire not being extinguished and the loss of trees in the area.  The Minister must be more aware of that than I am.</P>

There is an investigation currently taking place and if he has such facts his knowledge would be very useful <Col N="29" /> to the Garda in investigating the causes of the fire.</P>

      <P>In agreement with representatives of the Irish Timber Council I have recently set up an <i>ad hoc</i> committee representative of the sawmilling industry, the trade unions and the Departments concerned under an independent chairman to examine allegations about possible distortions of competition and trade in relation to the sale of timber from State forests to sawmills south and north of the Border and I have asked them to report to me within two months.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will be aware that substantial quantities of timber are being taken to places outside the State for processing while our mills are working at only half capacity.  A number of sawmills closed recently, for example, the mills at Kilrush and Mountrath as well as a number in the Minister's constituency. These closures left a substantial number of people redundant.  In the circumstances can the Minister provide any better answer than to tell us that another committee is to be set up?  He will be aware of having received a report recently from one such committee who had sat for more than 12 months and who indicated the way in which this issue should be dealt with.</P>

      <P>Again, the Deputy has engaged in some exaggeration.  He asked first what action I was taking and when I told him what I had done in this area he was not prepared to accept that.  I have <Col N="36" /> set up an <i>ad hoc</i> committee for the purpose of ascertaining whether the problems he outlines are as he indicates.  I have asked that committee to complete their work within a very short time &mdash; two months &mdash; and I trust that they will be able to conduct their investigation within that time.  The committee's task is to ascertain whether there is distortion of competition and trade in relation to the sale of timber.</P>
      <P>Under Article 34 of the Treaty of Rome which the Deputy's party accepted in the context of our accession to the EC, tenders may be accepted from nationals of other EC countries.  In practice, only companies from Northern Ireland have submitted tenders to date.  Regarding the other rather exaggerated claim made by the Deputy, the total sales of timber to Northern Ireland in the past three years have been as follows: 1983, 8 per cent; 1984, 8.5 per cent and 1985, 9.6 per cent. The matter should be put in perspective and not distorted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Dukes)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make a statement concerning the incidents surrounding extradition proceedings involving Miss Evelyn Glenholmes on Saturday, 22 March 1986.</P>
      <P>An investigation has been carried out by the Garda authorities into the incidents in question.  Statements have been taken from those members of the force who were in any way involved.  In addition, a number of people, mainly journalists, who appeared to be likely to be in a position to provide useful information have been interviewed.  The Garda have not sought to interview persons known to have been involved as associates or supporters of Miss Glenholmes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A particular word of thanks is due to a number of journalists who had witnessed some of the events and who helped in the Garda investigation.  They provided very useful information &mdash; without pointing a finger of blame at any identifiable person inside or outside the Garda Síochána. Some journalists, however, indicated that they were unable to agree to assist and among them were some who had, in the news media, made assertions which are denied by the Garda.  I mention them because, although they were of course entirely within their legal rights in refusing to co-operate, an inescapable consequence is that the investigating gardaí were not in a position to seek clarification of various points arising from their media reports.  They could not, for example, establish how far those journalists were referring to matters observed by themselves and from what distance, or to what <Col N="186" /> extent they were relying on material supplied by others.</P>
    <P>In the normal course of events, if a question is to be raised as to whether the Garda have improperly interfered with the liberty of a member of the public, it is for the person directly concerned to raise it and to make himself or herself available for interview.  Alternatively, the complainant has the right to challenge the action of the Garda Síochána by taking legal proceedings.  In this instance, however, some of the allegations made raise issues of public importance in a way that calls for a public response.  Most of those allegations may be taken under two headings, viz. (1) allegations that the courtroom door was locked, closed or deliberately &ldquo;blocked&rdquo; by gardaí so as to prevent Miss Glenholmes leaving and (2) allegations that a member of the Garda Síochána fired shots indiscriminately or recklessly on the public street.  Some account of events preceding the court decision to release Miss Glenholmes is necessary for an understanding of the role of the Garda Síochána in subsequent events.</P>
    <P>On Friday, 21 March in the course of the relevant extradition proceedings, it became apparent to those concerned with representing the interests of the State on the legal side that there was a distinct possibility that, because of certain circumstances relating to the way in which the warrants of arrest had been issued in England, the District Court might decide that the warrants were insufficient.</P>
    <P>In view of the apparent weakness in relation to the warrant which emerged in the course of the cross-examination of a member of the London Metropolitan Police Force on 21 March, the State sought and secured an adjournment and arrangements were made for the attendance in Dublin early the following morning of an official from the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions in London for the purpose of clarifying the precise circumstances in which the warrants had been issued.  In particular, it was hoped that the precise circumstances in which information had been laid before the London magistrate would be clarified <Col N="187" /> by this official.  As it turned out, the information that he gave on Saturday morning was not such as to assist in progressing the matter before the court.</P>
    <P>It is important to note that the crimes of which the prisoner was being accused included several murders and other serious crimes.  Contrary to what has been alleged or implied in certain quarters, the provision for the execution here of English warrants &mdash; the arrangement is of course reciprocal &mdash; is not something that follows from the Anglo-Irish Agreement or from some recent developments in Government policy.  It is an arrangement for which legal provision exists under an Act of 1965.  Subject always to scrupulous adherence to the provisions of the Act &mdash; which provides safeguards for the accused person, including a 15-day waiting period during which an accused person may go to the High Court &mdash; it is the duty both of the Garda Síochána and of the legal services of the State to take such steps as are open to them to ensure that persons are brought before the court to answer charges in every case where such a course is legally justified. This, apart from being a matter of duty in the general interests of the administration of justice, is also a duty arising from the international obligations of the State. And it is a duty which, in the implementation of the arrangements for extradition, requires that both the legal services and the police in the two jurisdictions concerned should provide such mutual assistance as is practicable and as is reasonably required to make the arrangements effective.</P>
    <P>Against that background there were consultations between the services concerned in both jurisdictions.  It was agreed that a new warrant would be sought as a matter of urgency in England, but only if and after the District Court had found against the existing ones and that, as soon as it was obtained, an inspector of the Garda Síochána would be informed by telephone and he would then apply to a district justice here for a provisional warrant for the re-arrest of Miss Glenholmes for the purpose of bringing her <Col N="188" /> before the District Court.  Contrary to certain suggestions that have been made, there is no question of a person being extradited on the basis of material supplied by telephone.  Information supplied by telephone in that way has to be confirmed formally by legal documentation and the person arrested on a provisional warrant has available the full range of legal safeguards, including a court hearing. The issue of provisional warrants is in accordance with standard international practice and is specifically provided for by the Extradition Act, 1965.</P>
    <P>Certain comments reported in the news media would suggest that there was something furtive about the making of those arrangements.  There is no basis for that.  Naturally, the fact that such arrangements were made was not going to be disclosed to the person concerned or to her legal representatives before effect had been given to them.  But, beyond that point, there was no question of those responsible for the arrangements having any interest in concealing the fact that they had been made.  It should be noted that effect would be given to the arrangements only in the event that the District Court might discharge Miss Glenholmes, as it subsequently did.</P>
    <P>Because special arrangements were made to have telephone lines available, it was thought &mdash; erroneously in the event &mdash; that it would be possible to obtain the new, provisional, warrant within a very short time of any decision that the existing one was inadequate.  On that basis a number of members of the Garda Síochána were informed by their superior officers of the proposed arrangements and they were instructed, in the event of Miss Glenholmes being released by the court, to keep her movements under close observation so that the expected new warrant could be executed when it became available.  In the event, it took longer to obtain the new warrant than had been expected.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the events in the courtroom, and will deal first with the principle. All members of the Garda Síochána, and especially members with <Col N="189" /> any role in relation to courts or courtrooms, are well aware that the independent status of the courts must be respected in all circumstances and that no considerations of expediency could justify arrest or deliberate obstruction of movement within the courtroom, or indeed in the court precincts, of a person whose release has been ordered by the court.</P>
    <P>I now deal with the facts.  Despite some allegations about locked doors or closed doors, it is clear that at the relevant time the courtroom door in question was not and could not have been locked and, moreover, the evidence of those at the scene is such that it seems quite clear that suggestions that the door was closed are also unfounded.  The only allegation in this respect that calls for any more detailed response is that the door was deliberately blocked by gardaí, with the result that Miss Glenholmes and her legal advisers had to leave by the district justice's room.</P>
    <P>As has been reported in the news media, the courtroom in question is a small one, 20 feet by 18 feet.  Apart from the district justice's desk, it has a number of benches so that, even in uncrowded conditions, free movement is effectively limited to the aisles surrounding the seated area.  Moreover, the relevant door opens inwards into the room, in such a way that it substantially reduces speed of exit if any significant number of people are trying to get out quickly.</P>
    <P>On the occasion in question the courtroom was full to the point where some people seeking admission could not be admitted and a number of those people remained outside the room, but in the vicinity.  Among those in court were legal representatives, a fair number of journalists, members of the public, including associates of Miss Glenholmes, and gardaí.  As it was necessary to provide for the discharge of various specific duties of a security nature, the number of gardaí had to be significantly higher than is usual at court hearings.</P>
    <P>Amongst those waiting just outside the courtroom door were associates of Miss <Col N="190" /> Glenholmes.  There is ample evidence that, when the court's decision was announced and communicated to those outside, they or some of them sought to get in while various people inside, including journalists seeking interviews or wishing to file reports, were trying to get out. The result was that there was confusion for a short time, with a great deal of pushing and shoving.</P>
    <P>I had occasion a few days ago to observe that a particular person was not there.  I do not want to have to make that observation again.  The Garda Síochána have stated that there was certainly no Garda plan to obstruct Miss Glenholmes in leaving the courtroom and that, as far as can be established by them, no member of the force sought to do so. There is, however, some conflict of evidence as to whether a small number of gardaí who at that stage were in the vicinity of the door were themselves caught up in the situation or were deliberately adding to the obstruction.  What seems to be clear in any event is that those conditions lasted only a very short time &mdash; apparently, a matter of a minute or so &mdash; when Miss Glenholmes was taken by her legal advisers through the district justice's room from which she emerged into the same corridor as she would have reached had she come through the public door.  There appears to be no dispute about the fact that, when moving along this corridor, she had full freedom of movement even though, obviously, the gardaí would have been physically in a position to block her movements either there or at some stage before she had passed through the gates of the court complex if that had been part of their plan.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the firing of shots in Prince's Street, Dublin.  The circumstances in which the shots were fired are stated in the Garda reports to be as follows.</P>
    <P>By the time Miss Glenholmes reached the vicinity of Prince's Street, the fact that a provisional warrant for her arrest had been issued was known generally to members of the Garda Síochána on duty in the vicinity.  Very shortly after that, a member of the detective branch saw a <Col N="191" /> uniformed colleague on the ground and being beset by some members of the crowd and he went to his assistance.  He in turn was manhandled by members of the crowd.  At that point, the member, although armed, had not drawn his gun which was being carried out of sight but, despite that, he and a number of other members of the force heard a call from the crowd to have his gun taken from him.  The language used was hostile.</P>
    <P>As he was a person who had on a number of occasions given evidence against persons involved in crimes associated with paramilitary organisations and as some of those in the vicinity were persons well known to the gardaí to be involved in paramilitary activity, he believed that there was a strong likelihood that he was personally recognised &mdash; and not just recognised as being a member of the Garda Síochána &mdash; and that he was in imminent and serious danger of being disarmed.  He therefore fired two warning shots in the air.  While most of those concerned stood back at that stage, a small number did not, so he fired a third warning shot.</P>
    <P>While references have been made to shooting over the heads of the crowd, there appears to be no serious suggestion that any of the three shots was fired otherwise than vertically.</P>
    <P>I have already publicly stated that it is always a matter of very great concern if shots are fired in a public place with large numbers of people about.  I reiterate that now.  The Garda authorities have assured me that they fully share my concern and that they will vigorously maintain a policy of strict control as far as the use of firearms by members are concerned. What occurred on this occasion occurred in quite exceptional circumstances and does not in any way imply that there has been or will be any weakening of resolve in this respect.  I must, however, also say that any attempt to disarm a member of the Garda Síochána whose duty it is to carry a firearm, or any incitement to others to engage in such an attempt, must be characterised as reckless and irresponsible and, despite the restraint which the <Col N="192" /> gardaí are rightly called on to exercise in the general interests of the public, anybody who is involved in any such action cannot evade the primary responsibility for any untoward consequences.</P>
    <P>As I indicated earlier, I believe that the matters in respect of which questions affecting the public interest have mainly arisen are: first, the allegation that the gardaí, by conduct in the courtroom, disregarded the special status of the courts, and, second, the firing of shots in a crowded central city area.  I have dealt with those two matters in some detail. There were, of course, other incidents in between.  They, however, concern primarily the person directly involved in the legal proceedings and those who were associated with her on that occasion. There are, nevertheless, some points even in relation to those matters on which I think it is appropriate to comment, on the basis that they are points in respect of which the element of public interest as distinct from private interest may reasonably be said to predominate.</P>
    <P>Specifically, there were suggestions that the Garda Síochána acted in a highhanded and intimidatory fashion in relation to some members of the general public who were going about their business and who were not of their own volition involved in the various incidents. In particular, it was suggested that the gardaí commandeered a truck and used it to block a roadway and that, at other points, they blocked bridges or streets.</P>
    <P>I am informed that the gardaí blocked no bridge or street and that there was no commandeering of a truck.  In fact, I understand that the initial reports that such things had happened were contradicted in later reports.  On a more general level, I have already mentioned that the arrangements that had been made between the agencies concerned in both jurisdictions were expected to result in a provisional warrant being obtained more quickly that it was in the event.  This in turn contributed largely to the fact that the practical problems that arose for the Garda Síochána in seeking to maintain observation of Miss Glenholmes were substantially greater than had been <Col N="193" /> anticipated.  I can assure the House that everything that arose in the aftermath of the court decision is under review by the Garda authorities with a view to learning such lessons as may be learned from the various incidents.  I would add, however, that just as the legal difficulties that arose had not arisen previously, they are likewise most unlikely to recur because, arising from the legal points that were raised on this occasion, the necessary precautions will have been taken in future cases by those concerned with the legal requirements and procedures.  On that basis it seems highly unlikely that the gardaí will again have occasion to deal with a similar situation.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to take this opportunity to clarify two points raised in a speech reportedly made by the Fianna Fáil spokesman on Justice, Deputy Woods, on Friday last.  I confine myself to points that are relevant to the matters I have dealt with in this statement.  First, contrary to what Deputy Woods reportedly said, I did not promise a report on the affair within 24 hours and then within a few days.  What I said quite clearly on a number of occasions was that I would make no statement until I had received a full report of the events.  Second, Deputy Woods is reported as having said that I have an obligation to explain why the authorities here did not properly scrutinise the defective warrants.  I must point out that it has been explained more than once that no amount of scrutiny of the warrants could have detected the deficiencies which emerged in the court proceedings and which the court held to be such as to invalidate the warrants.  The reason is that what was at issue was not something that appeared in the warrants themselves but in the procedure that led to their being issued.  The British Home Secretary has very frankly and fairly accepted that responsibility for what occurred in that respect rested entirely with London.</P>
    <P>In association with this statement I am circulating to Deputies a diagram of the courtroom and the immediately surrounding area and I propose also to make it available to the library.</P>
    <Col N="194" />
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The statement read by the Minister on this very tragic and appalling affair is nothing short of a whitewash and a Pontius Pilate act.  That is outlined very clearly when one takes into consideration the different statements the Minister has made.  I ask the Minister in his reply to say whether the solicitor, the barrister and the District Court clerk concerned were questioned.  The Minister said members of the force and a number of other people who appeared to be likely to be in a position to provide useful information had been interviewed and that the gardaí had not sought to interview persons known to have been involved as associates or supporters of Miss Glenholmes. Is the Minister suggesting that her lawyers and the District Court clerk are supporters of Miss Glenlholmes? Were they asked about the alleged blocking of the court?</P>
      <P>The barrister spoke of structured lawlessness, a structured planned arrangement to frustrate the operation of the law.  He also spoke of a plan to keep Miss Glenholmes amenable to re-arrest.  Did the Minister ask the barrister for his views if that was the case?  The solicitor and the barrister said that they tried to bring Miss Glenholmes through the exit, but it was blocked.  Their view seemed to be different from that given by the Minister here today.  They did not give the impression that the exit was blocked by journalists and others getting in the way.  They said there was a specific attempt to block the doors of the court.</P>
      <P>There is another aspect which is very relevant, but to which the Minister did not refer.  There was a judicial finding that the court order granting freedom to Miss Glenholmes was frustrated by the action of the security forces.  The Minister must say why the court found the order had been frustrated.  I am surprised he did not mention this because it is very relevant.  The Minister said there were pre-arranged plans.  He said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Friday, 21 March, in the course of the relevant extradition proceedings, it became apparent to those concerned with representing the interests <Col N="195" /> of the State on the legal side that there was a distinct possibility that, because of certain circumstances relating to the way in which the warrants of arrest had been issued in England, the District Court might decide that the warrants were insufficient.</P>
    <P>The Minister told us plans were made&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Read the next sentence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>He claims that the nature of the plans were somewhat different.  He said:</P>
      <P>In view of the apparent weakness in relation to the warrant which emerged in the course of cross-examination of a member of the London Metropolitan Police Force on 21 March, the State sought and secured an adjournment and arrangements were made for the attendance in Dublin....</P>
      <P>It was clear from Friday that there would be a difficulty.  It is also clear that the court, not the media or the Opposition politicians but the court, made a finding, and the Minister has set it aside.</P>
      <P>This episode is very similar in principle to what happened when a leading member of the Australian Mafiosa got away because it was found by the court that his liberty was improperly curtailed. A judge of the Supreme Court said at that time that there was a plan to deprive him of his liberty and that is why he was set free by the court.  It is not as if the Minister did not have knowledge of similar cases, because there was this very highly publicised case earlier of which the Minister should have been aware.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the special arrangements being made by telephone, the Minister pointed out at some length that he had no responsibility in this area.  He said it would not have been possible on the face of the second set of warrants to know they were defective &mdash; the first set had been found to be defective.  As I said on the face of it, the warrants looked to be in order.  Is the Minister suggesting that <Col N="196" /> nobody asked any questions about the warrant, when it was sworn in, who swore it in and if it was in order?  We are given the impression that there was no questioning of the second warrant which looked to be in order, but it did not take much questioning to discover that it had not been properly sworn in and that it was defective.  I believe the Minister did not ensure that the warrants were properly scrutinised before they were presented to the court.  I presume he was informed of what was happening but if he was not, he should have been.</P>
    <P>The Minister said there were some preplanned arrangements but, in his view, they were not deliberately designed to frustrate the decision of the court.  The court found that the order granting freedom to Miss Glenholmes was deliberately frustrated, but I will not say any more about that because that is a matter of record.</P>
    <P>I want to know if the security forces were carrying out what they understood to be the wishes of the Minister, or if they were acting under specific instructions from the Minister.  The Minister said:</P>
    <P>... a number of members of the Garda Síochána were informed by their superior officers of the proposed arrangements and they were instructed, in the event of Miss Glenholmes being released by the court, to keep her movements under close observation so that the expected new warrant could be executed when it became available.</P>
    <P>Who gave those instructions?  Was the Minister aware of them?  In what way were they given?  What happened is not what the Minister told us here.  He suggested that Miss Glenholmes should be kept under observation, but we know there was a plan to keep her amenable to re-arrest which is, in effect, what happened. The question the Minister failed to answer here is: under whose authority and general direction were the lives of the Garda and civilians put at risk in the shopping streets of Dublin following the <Col N="197" /> court's decision to free Miss Glenholmes? It is not sufficient to talk about the situation in which an individual member of the force found himself because that was the result of what had gone before and was consequent on the instructions which had been given.</P>
    <P>At the conclusion of his statement the Minister mentioned Mr. Hurd.  He said that the British Home Secretary had very frankly and fairly accepted that responsibility for what occurred in that respect rested entirely in London.  First, it is quite clear that the debacle was initiated by the incompetence of the British authorities and their apparent contempt for the rule of law in our courts, but the Minister might recollect that Mr. Hurd said when interviewed that the courts could have taken another view.  He was very happy with his chum, the Minister, and with the Taoiseach, another chum of his, but he was not so happy with the Irish courts.  I want to know whether the Government protested against such a statement and such a show of contempt for the Irish courts and the rule of law in Ireland indicated by that statement on the part of Mr. Hurd.  The only other view the court could have taken was not to vindicate the liberty of the citizen in the circumstances, which the court was bound to do and did. Again we see a one-sided, &ldquo;palsy&rdquo; sort of summary from the Minister where his pal on the other side was a fairly nice fellow despite the fact that he showed utter contempt for the Irish courts in a statement which was totally unacceptable to this House, and the Minister should convey that to the British authorities when he meets them.</P>
    <P>There is a clear need for a review of the whole question of the extradition of Irish citizens to other jurisdictions.  The 1965 Extradition Act was never intended to apply to political offences.  As we know, it excludes specifically a political offence or an offence connected with a political offence, and we know also that this worked very well as long as the concept of a political offence was interpreted in line with international law and as understood by the Oireachtas and practised by the courts here.  However, we <Col N="198" /> know also that the decision of the courts last year in the McGlinchey case, although made in the circumstances of that case, has led to confusion and uncertainty as to what would constitute a political offence at present in the eyes of the courts.  The former Attorney General, Peter Sutherland, adopted a very high political profile in ensuring that this case was rushed through the courts here.  It may well be that the Oireachtas will now have to clarify the situation by statute in accordance with the generally recognised principles of international law.  This Government have created further uncertainly by the manner in which they rushed into signing the European Convention on the Prevention of Terrorism.  Every other country except the UK has qualified its signature of the convention by making reservations protecting its own nationals from extradition or concerning the principles which should govern non-extradition for political offences.  Unlike all these countries, the Coalition Government have made no reservations for the protection of our citizens or to cater for the provisions of the 1965 Extradition Act which prohibits extradition for political offences.</P>
    <P>The Government have a duty to protect and vindicate the rights and liberty of Irish citizens especially when this means providing a fair and equitable trial and punishment in an environment free from political prejudice.  Can the Coalition Government say that the Maguire Family, Giuseppe Conlon and the Birmingham six were given a fair trial under British justice as it applies to Irishmen today?  In the eyes of Britain these Irish men and women were terrorists.  They had already been subjected to trial by the British newspapers.  In the eyes of any independent observer they were innocent. Does the Government expect us in future to surrender Irish citizens to this system of British justice without question?</P>
    <P>
      <i>The Economist</i> of 29 March 1986 under a heading &ldquo;Come out, we know you're in there&rdquo; made an interesting comment on the British approach to extradition which I quote: <Col N="199" /></P>
    <P>Fitting, really.  Justice ministers and police forces in several countries might understandably smirk at Britain's difficulties in getting Miss Evelyn Glenholmes extradited from the Irish Republic.  Bound by ancient laws, Britain is a black sheep among extraditing nations.  It is harder for foreigners to retrieve their fugitives from British than from most other shores.</P>
    <P>They go on to spell out some of the statistics in relation to that.  Further on they say:</P>
    <P>In 1978 Spain became so annoyed at the failure of its efforts to get criminals out of Britain that it abrogated the extradition treaty between the two countries.  Spain and Britain now have a new treaty: but meanwhile, sun-seeking British criminals have reaped the benefits of the rift, setting up the so-called &ldquo;Costa del Crime&rdquo;.  The French authorities too have been miffed for some time, and the extradition procedures between France and Britain are now used only in the most serious cases.  Britain's &ldquo;refusal rate&rdquo; would be much higher were it not for the fact that foreign judges know how hard it is to win an extradition from Britain and so sometimes do not even try.</P>
    <P>Further on they say:</P>
    <P>When the proposed criminal justice bill becomes law and Britain has some new general extradition law, it will be able to sign the European convention on extradition which, embarrassingly, it has been unable to do until now.</P>
    <P>This is the jurisdiction with which the Minister is dealing, a jurisdiction which has shown contempt for our system of extradition here and for our courts.  The Government should openly and honestly bring their intentions in relation to extradition before Dáil Éireann and state openly what precisely they mean now by the concept of a political offence and how they intend to apply this concept in future.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="200" /> The fiasco surrounding the Glenholmes case also highlights the need for a review of the procedures for extradition as set out in the 1965 Act.  At the very least consideration must be given now to the provision of <i>prima facie</i> evidence in support of extradition warrants for Irish citizens.  A clear onus lies on the Government to end all the uncertainty which they have created where extradition is concerned.  It is vital also that the Government are not slipshod in their administration of extradition procedures.  It is essential that the Government state their intentions before Dáil Éireann and clarify the extradition process before the entire procedure falls into disrepute.  Extradition is an extremely sensitive area, particularly where it concerns Irish citizens. The lessons of the Evelyn Glenholmes case must not be lost on this Government. They should review urgently their whole approach to extradition and give assurances to this House that this appalling debacle will not be repeated.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, let me say that I find the Minister's statement very disappointing. He has said that in his view there was no problem with the doors.  I do not think that anybody suggested seriously that the doors were locked.  The suggestion, as I understood it, was that the doors were blocked and that the barrister went back to the judge to say that the doors were blocked, that he could not get his client out, that in those circumstances the situation was most unsatisfactory and effectively the order of the court was being frustrated.  It looks as if the Minister did not consult the barrister and solicitor concerned. He has not told us if he did so. They made statements which we and the country are aware of.  If he did not consult with them, is he saying that they were associates of Miss Glenholmes and that on that basis he did not question it?  That is not good enough.  It is not acceptable. Just as it is not acceptable for Mr. Hurd to show contempt for our courts, it is not acceptable for the Minister to show contempt for the members of our legal profession who are doing their duty in relation to the law.  It is quite clear from <Col N="201" /> what the courts have said that Miss Glenholmes was maintained in a situation in which she was amenable to re-arrest.  It is also clear from what the Minister said at the beginning of his statement that some instruction to that effect was given by someone in higher authority.  The Minister has not told us who, or exactly what instruction was given.  That is the kernel of the problem as far as the blocking of the courts is concerned.</P>
    <P>It is quite interesting that in 1964, before the 1965 Act came in, there was a case in which the court gave a decision on warrants, whereupon the authorities got new warrants and extradited without coming before the District Justice.  This led to a new situation and was one of the factors which contributed to the change in the law in 1965.  The events which surround the Glenholmes fiasco indicate two things very clearly.  One is that we must once again review very thoroughly the whole question of extradition, particularly the question of <i>prima facie</i> evidence. Second, the Government must look once again at their policy and the impression which they are giving to various people in relation to extradition and the confusion and difficulties which are being created.  The Minister has made it clear that special arrangements were made to provide telephone lines.  The Minister has not clarified the general instructions which led subsequently to the debacle.  In that sense, the whole statement by the Minister is very unsatisfactory.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened carefully to the Minister's statement on this matter.  While acknowledging its length and its detail one must nevertheless regret the fact that it is not by any means satisfactory.  In certain respects it seems to be quite selective.  It is very difficult to talk about this whole series of incidents, many of which are interconnected, without making any reference at all to what transpired and what was said at the second hearing on the Saturday, and that is very relevant to what had happened before and constitutes a judicial pronouncement on these matters which is of some <Col N="202" /> importance even though the court concerned is only the District Court.  It is, therefore, quite unrealistic of the Minister to have ignored this entirely in the course of a lengthy statement.  It underlines, one fears, that he is endeavouring to be somewhat selective in the matters which he is talking about and in the manner in which he refers to them. Unfortunately, that serious omission from his statement takes something from the strength of what he has said in respect of the other matters.</P>
      <P>The whole problem of extradition from this country to Great Britain and the North in the last four or five years in particular has become a very confused one and a very controversial one.  Nearly all of these extraditions or attempted extraditions have given rise to difficulty and complaint of one kind or another and to a certain amount of public apprehension as to the basic propriety of the whole operation.  It is regrettable, particularly at a time like this when this island is beset by terrorism, that there should be this level of public doubt about all the procedures that are involved and about the way in which they are carried out.  As the Minister will know within the last couple of days, my party have announced their intention to put down a Bill in this House within the next week or so seeking to have certain aspects of the Extradition Act of 1965 amended to bring them into line with what seems to us, and probably to most people, to be the proper sort of procedures that should be followed in regard to these potentially very controversial activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1965 Act, for reasons best known to those who formulated it, distinguishes between extradition to Britain and Northern Ireland on the one hand and extradition to every other country in the world on the other hand.  Since we, in this part of the island, have been independent of Britain since 1922, it seems very difficult to understand now why this distinction was drawn and why a totally different and much higher standard of proof is required in respect of extradition to any other country.  The only explanation that one can see on the face of it for <Col N="203" /> this rather anomalous position is the fact that the 1965 Act is carried forward from earlier legislation of the 19th century when these two islands constituted the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland; it was necessary to have some procedure to move people from one jurisdiction to another within the then United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>One of the legal jurisdictions at that time was Ireland, another was England and Wales and another was Scotland.  If somebody was arrested in one of those jurisdictions in respect of an alleged crime for which he was wanted in another one of them, it was necessary to have some procedure to have him moved from one to the other even though, at that time, they were all within the one country. But the procedure was a relatively perfunctory one by comparison with extradition to a foreign country.  To the best of my knowledge, the same procedure still remains in respect of, for example, extradition from Scotland where there is a separate jurisdiction and a separate legal system, to England, or from England to Scotland.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that it would have been appropriate after we had achieved our independence that our extradition law would be changed and would reflect the sovereignty of this country.  That was not done and, to the best of my knowledge, there was no extradition legislation in this country until the 1965 Act was introduced. That was brought about by the Quinn case where a gentleman was removed by the Garda and brought straight up to the Border from outside a courthouse where an order for his release had been obtained and was just pushed over the Border to the police in Northern Ireland. There was, naturally, a serious complaint about that at the time and the Bill on which the 1965 Act was founded was brought forward as a result.  But curiously the 1965 Act retained the same sort of provision as existed when we were still part of the United Kingdom and I believe that this has contributed in no small way to a lot of the agitation and the difficulties we have had in recent times.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="204" /> That is why in the Bill which we propose to bring forward the Progressive Democrats will suggest the repeal of Part III of the 1965 Act and instead to insert a provision in the Bill to say that the provisions of Part II of the 1965 Act, which relate to all other foreign countries, will also relate to extraditions to and from Britain and Northern Ireland. That will help to clarify matters and to restore public confidence in a system where public confidence has been badly shaken over the years.</P>
    <P>One of the interesting aspects of the 1965 Act dealing with extradition is that it does not define the term &ldquo;political offence&rdquo;. It deliberately did not define that term and the probability is that those who formulated the Bill were not keen to do that.  Unfortunately, this is often a feature of the proceedings of this House. When particular nettles are regarded as being a little too difficult to grasp we tend to opt out of grasping them and let the courts grasp them.  Our predecessors in 1965 deliberately did not define &ldquo;political offence&rdquo; and it was left to the courts, who, as they often have to do, filled that lacuna and defined the term &ldquo;political offence&rdquo;.  The definition of &ldquo;political offence&rdquo;, which now stands as law in the same way as if it had been enacted in statute, is the definition by the then Chief Justice in December 1982 in the McGlinchey case.  It could well be considered by this House as to whether the definition of &ldquo;political offence&rdquo; enunciated by Chief Justice O'Higgins should stand or be amended.  It is open to us in this and the other House to amend it but, given the circumstances of the times in which we live, I query whether Chief Justice O'Higgins's definition is not correct.  It may well be.  It reflects reality to a very high degree and has removed itself from the slightly more generous view of political offenders which was common in the 19th century and in the earlier part of the 20th century.  It looks not so much to the motives of the people involved as to the nature of their actions and it properly looks to the nature of their actions.  However, that is a matter which could be <Col N="205" /> debated in more detail when the Progressive Democrats bring forward their Bill. On first sight I am not anxious to change the definition of the term &ldquo;political offence&rdquo; as set out by Chief Justice O'Higgins.</P>
    <P>It is interesting in a matter of this kind to look at the British media reaction because they have an entirely different standard when it comes to looking at events in this country from their attitude to events in other countries or in their own country.  In this respect we can give two recent examples which are of some interest.  There is tension between the British and Indian Governments at present because of the refusal of the British authorities to countenance the extradition of Sikhs who are wanted for alleged terrorist offences in India.  The reluctance of the British authorities is based on the fact that the Indian authorities have not provided <i>prima facie</i> evidence of the involvement of the wanted Sikhs in terrorist offences in India.  Quite properly the British authorities are reluctant to see such people extradited but they cannot have it both ways or complain if we bring our law <i>vis-á-vis</i> Britain into line with the way it is <i>vis-á-vis</i> every other country and the way British law is <i>vis-á-vis</i> other countries, including countries like India which up to relatively recently were colonies of Britain.</P>
    <P>It is also interesting to note how little reaction there was in Britain and in the British media to a decision of a Dutch court within the past few weeks when two escapees from the Maze Prison in Northern Ireland, both of whom had been convicted of very serious terrorist offences, including murder, came before a Dutch court for extradition to Britain and, presumably, Northern Ireland.  The Dutch court agreed to make an order of extradition in relation to one of them but refused in respect of the other.  Those two gentlemen were not in the position in which Miss Glenholmes was or others who had simply been charged with offences; they had actually been convicted of very serious offences and had broken out of prison, which in itself is an offence after serving prison terms of <Col N="206" /> some years there.  The second offender was ordered not to be extradited from Holland on the grounds that, as the Dutch court saw it, his offence was a political one; and the distinction was drawn between the two on what to me seems rather nebulous grounds &mdash; that one series of offences were carried out against civilians and the other series carried out against policemen or non-civilians. If that happened in this country there would be an outcry in Britain, but there was very little about it.  It was reported and regretted, but that was it.  There was also no outcry in relation to the attitude of the British authorities towards the Sikhs living in the United Kingdom at present. This underlines the need for an urgent review of the whole extradition law and procedure here and, therefore, it is timely for us to bring forward this Bill. Because of its importance &mdash; I know it must be a matter of concern to the Minister and the Government at least as much as it is to all of us &mdash; I hope that the Bill will be looked at objectively and that its passage will not be blocked simply for political or opportunist reasons.  If it needs amendment or expansion to cover some of the additional matters which we have been talking about today arising out of the Glenholmes incident I hope that amendments or expansions can be made.</P>
    <P>We would be very unwise to allow our extradition law to remain as it is at the moment.  I have enormous sympathy with the unfortunate gardaí in the court and on the streets who were confronted with such difficulties on that Saturday.  If they did not act in a particular way they would have been open to very serious criticism and because they did act in a particular way they are open, from certain quarters at least, to very serious criticism.  It is one of these classic no-win situations and I do not think our Garda should be put in that kind of position again.  Our law on these matters should be clarified and, in particular, it should be impressed once again on the British authorities that this law and procedure is a technical one, that all courts, not just Irish but, as in the examples I have given, Dutch and other courts, are very assiduous in seeing that <Col N="207" /> the people concerned get the benefit of the letter of the law in every respect. Therefore, the law must be clarified.  The law in respect of all extradition should, in my view, be put on the same footing as far as all countries are concerned.</P>
    <P>It is particularly urgent that this whole matter should be clarified because of the unfortunate tragic situation of terrorism that exists on this island.  While that exists it is obviously essential for us, and for all other countries who are anxious that terrorism should be put down as rapidly as possible, to have a clear law where people know exactly where they stand and where all these procedural misunderstandings can finally come to an end.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>My initial response to the Minister's statement is that as an investigation it seems to have been quite inadequate.  The Minister opened by saying that the investigation was carried out by the Garda and that they did not seek to interview persons known to have been involved as associates or supporters of Miss Glenholmes.  Whatever reservations the Garda may have had about interviewing supporters of Miss Glenholmes it would seem likely, at the very least, that the legal advisers or others such as relations and so on of Miss Glenholmes would have been ideal people to speak to in that presumably they would have been the closest to the events that occurred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said that the Garda were not in a position to refute some statements made by some journalists because they refused to be interviewed and, therefore, the Garda were not in a position to judge from what distance or to what extent they were relying on material supplied by others.  To some extent we are in the same position today.  We do not know to what extent we are relying on material supplied by people and at what remove or distance they were from the events concerned.  It seems that the investigation is not adequate, if one is to judge by the statement of the Minister today.  For instance, apart from a reference to the garda who fired shots, there <Col N="208" /> is no reference to the reports that two other gardaí drew weapons and that one of them went behind a car.  We do not know if that report was accurate but the mere fact that it was not referred to in the report of the Garda investigation seems to indicate that the investigation was not all that thorough.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the matter of the garda firing the shots.  The Minister in his statement on this said:</P>
    <P>As he was a person who had on a number of occasions given evidence against persons ... he believed that there was a strong likelihood that he was personally recognised &mdash; and not just recognised as being a member of the Garda Síochána &mdash; and that he was in imminent and serious danger of being disarmed.</P>
    <P>I read through the regulations governing the use of firearms by the gardaí, published in <i>The Irish Times</i> on 25 March last, and I did not see any reference in them to the circumstances when gardaí might fire shots if they felt they might be disarmed.  In fact, regulation No. 12 states:</P>
    <P>The indiscriminate firing of shots over the heads of disorderly crowds or unarmed criminals in flight in the hope that they will desist from some unlawful act or surrender cannot be justified.</P>
    <P>There is a failure in the Minister's statement to justify adequately the firing of shots by the garda concerned.</P>
    <P>I do not have any intention of adding to the problems of the garda concerned but it seems that where gardaí are armed, particularly gardaí who are not in uniform, there is a clear responsibility on the Minister, and the Garda authorities, to have very strict well-defined regulations on when and how arms may be used, shots may be fired or arms drawn.  It is not sufficient for the Minister to say that the member concerned felt that he was in imminent and serious danger of being disarmed.  There is no reference in the statement to whether the call from the crowd was confirmed by an independent observer or if it was heard only by the <Col N="209" /> garda or his colleagues.  This statement is not an adequate response by the Minister and does not overcome the loss of confidence and the feeling of security which the public should have in the Garda or when in the presence of gardaí.</P>
    <P>The main part of the blame for the debacle must rest with the British authorities. Whoever was responsible for drawing up the warrants was clearly incompetent. It is only right that if a person is to be extradited from this jurisdiction to Britain under our law all the warrants and other documentation should be subjected to the most rigorous scrutiny possible. There cannot and must not be any legal shortcuts in the process.  There is no excuse in cases as serious as this for incompetence on either side.  Whoever was responsible for drawing up the warrants in the office of the British Director of Public Prosecutions should have known that the warrants, and other documentation, should be closely examined. If there are errors the courts are obliged to rule the warrants invalid.  That has always been the procedure since the extradition agreement with the British Government came into effect in 1965 and it has been the procedure in so-called political and non-political cases.  There is even less excuse for the blunder on this occasion as previous warrants had been found to be invalid.</P>
    <P>There is a need to look again at extradition procedures between this country and Britain.  Extradition agreements between countries are normally based on the principle that a <i>prima facie</i> case has to be established before a person can be extradited. In the case of the agreement between this country and Britain extradition is on the basis of simply a warrant being issued and proved valid.  We hold that extradition to Britain from Ireland must be on the basis of <i>prima facie</i> evidence and we urge that the legislation be amended to bring that into effect.</P>
    <P>The right of any country to refuse to extradite a person wanted for political offences in another country has always been a recognised part of international <Col N="210" /> law.  This country should not be used, or be allowed to be used as a refuge for those accused of acts of terrorism.  The Workers' Party do not consider the placing of bombs in pubs or in Wimpy bars to be a political act.  It is a criminal act even if those who do so try to disguise their criminality by political slogans.  The real victors in this whole episode have been the Provisional IRA.  They scored a major publicity coup which no doubt they will use to the full to further their vicious campaign of sectarian murder and violence in Northern Ireland, as they have done in the past in Britain.  The Garda have been the real losers.  They have been made to look foolish and incompetent. Members of the public were shocked to see the Garda, seemingly out of control, running in the main street of our capital, one member firing over the heads of unarmed people.  It has damaged the relationship between the ordinary man and woman in the street and the Garda.</P>
    <P>To return to the question of the use of arms, it must be a matter of concern that the carrying of guns by all except the uniformed members of the Garda has now become the normal practice.  Apparently it is no longer just members of the Special Detective Branch who carry guns; more and more ordinary detectives are doing so as well.  There have been a number of unfortunate incidents in Britain in recent months arising from the carrying of weapons by the police there. Of course it will be remembered also that a man was shot dead in controversial circumstances by a garda in the North Wall in November 1982.</P>
    <P>The Garda are operating under considerable pressure and risk arising from the greater use of guns by criminals.  If we want to preserve the essentially unarmed status of the Garda it is vital that the carrying and use of guns be kept to an absolute minimum.  One serious aspect of all of this is that those gardaí who carry weapons and who may be called on to use them are in plain clothes and are not readily identifiable as member of the Garda.  I fear it will be only a matter of time before a tragedy occurs, that a plain clothes garda who produces a gun may <Col N="211" /> be mistaken by a colleague or by a member of the public for a criminal, with disastrous consequences.  If guns have to be carried by some gardaí &mdash; and I would prefer that they did not have to do so &mdash; they should be readily identifiable as being armed.  The Minister must clearly define the circumstances in which guns may be drawn and used.  Indeed, the competence of members of the Garda to carry guns must also be checked regularly, in particular their psychological suitability to be in possession of a weapon.</P>

      <P>On the last occasion on which this Bill was before the House I had dealt with various aspects of poverty. Before the Easter Recess I had been <Col N="212" /> speaking about the Government contribution to poverty.  Indeed, since Easter we have seen a further example of that contribution in the reduction of the food subsidies, causing greater hardship to the poorer people in our community.  It should be remembered that essential commodities such as bread, milk and butter are used by the poorer people, particularly those with large families.  We had an example also of the Government's good public relations in advertising the fact that the children's allowance was being increased by £3 per month or 75p per week.  This will not in any way compensate the poorer sections of our community for the serious consequences of Government policy.  What we need now is action.  There is sufficient known about poverty.  Indeed, there has been sufficient information passed on to the Government from these benches&mdash;even if they do not realise it themselves&mdash;to alert them to the fact that something needs to be done urgently.</P>
      <P>The increase of 75p per week in the children's allowance will not in any way compensate the less well off for the hardship they are suffering.  The Government advertisement did not state that in the last budget those with large families, entirely dependent on social welfare payments for their livelihood, were granted no dependant's allowance.  For the first time there was no increase granted in the child dependant allowance to those families entirely dependent on social welfare for their livelihood.  Naturally that will create hardship for those people.  The whole approach of the Government to children's allowances has been antifamily. There was no increase whatsoever granted in children's allowances in 1983, an increase of 7 per cent granted in August 1984&mdash;it should be remembered that such increases were always effected in April when Fianna Fáil were in power&mdash;no increase whatsoever in 1985 and this small one only this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Not alone has there been no increase granted for the dependants of persons on social welfare benefit but the tax free <Col N="213" /> allowance for children has been abolished, again something which is very antifamily. There are many couples with children over 18 years of age who will not qualify for any children's allowance, and they will lose the tax free allowance. Those with children who qualify for the children's allowance&mdash;if paying 48p in the £tax&mdash;will receive £36 per annum by way of children's allowance, losing £48 as a consequence.  Therefore they will be worse off to the extent of £12.  That is not what the Government have been telling people either by way of statements or advertisement in the national papers.  For example, if a taxpayer is paying 58p in the £&mdash;that is the taxpayer with eligible children &mdash; he will receive £36 per annum extra but will lose £58.  In other words, that taxpayer will be worse off to the extent of £22.</P>
    <P>On a number of occasions the Taoiseach recognised that there was poverty in the community.  In a speech in Jury's Hotel on 15 November 1984, speaking to the Simon Community, the Taoiseach had this to say:</P>
    <P>If, even in a period of grave economic difficulty, even at a time when a high measure of priority must be given to the restoration of economic growth&mdash;from which alone the resources needed for social progress can come&mdash;we were to set on one side, or to show ourselves forgetful of, the social needs of our people, we should be turning our backs on a fundamental moral duty and might at the same time undermine the social stability necessary for the attainment of our economic objectives.</P>
    <P>That was the Taoiseach himself speaking 18 months ago.  One might well ask: what has he done about it?  The answer is nothing.</P>
    <P>The Government have done nothing to alleviate poverty among the people.  I have pointed out what they have done in regard to children's allowances, and for the second time in a year they cut food subsidies, thereby creating more hardship for more people.  Those who depend on social welfare payments for <Col N="214" /> their livelihood were always given the increases in benefits early in April.  This Government first of all postponed these increases until early July, now recipients will not get their increases until the third week in July, when one-third of the year has gone.  This makes a major contribution to poverty.</P>
    <P>The Government said they were showing their concern about poverty through the introduction of this Bill and the setting up of this agency.  They should be looking at what they have been doing to find out if they have not been creating more poverty.  Certainly they have been doing nothing to alleviate it.  It is fair to ask why we have not been getting any of the radical, progressive policies we saw in successive years under Fianna Fáil, such as free electricity, free television licences&mdash;it was interesting to hear the BBC advocating that the British Government should adopt the policy begun by Fianna Fáil in this regard&mdash;and Fianna Fáil also introduced the telephone rental allowance, which showed great foresight. We have been having a difficult period in the more remote areas of the country because of robberies, and it was a great comfort to elderly people living alone to know they could communicate quickly with people close to them if they found themselves threatened by people roaming about the countryside.</P>
    <P>I do not think anything contributes more to the creation of poverty than the reduction in health care which we have been seeing.  I will make only a passing reference to it and its contribution to hardship.  Not alone have the Government created the highest percentage level of unemployment in Europe but they have set about dismantling the health services and cutting back the hospital service, particularly by reducing the number of staff at weekends.  Illness knows no time limits, but the Government have reduced the working week in hospitals. Dental services are non-existent for adults, though there is a limited service for children.  Consequently, we can see widows with dependent children having to pay for dental care.</P>
    <P>It is important to stress all these things <Col N="215" /> when discussing this Bill.  It would be wrong for us to say that by setting up another statutory body we are making a major contribution to the alleviation of poverty, because all of us can see poverty and we should be taking action to do something about it.  The poor have to compete with more powerful groups to get their rights.  Where services are available, access to those services for the poor, in remote rural areas and in the centre of urban areas, is not available. This is something Government should be looking at.</P>
    <P>I am not opposed to the setting up of this agency but I fail to understand why, if the Government are serious, they did not allow the National Community Development Agency, set up by Fianna Fáil and given £2 million in 1982, was not given a chance to operate.  If the Minister had allowed that agency to work for a year or two and then told the House that he did not think it was doing any valuable work, we would have accepted it, but the Government did not do that.  The Minister announced that he was dismantling that agency without a satisfactory explanation before it had time to do anything.</P>
    <P>The Government have a grave responsibility to the poor in the community. On all sides we have enough evidence to prove the existence of widespread poverty.  On this side of the House we have drawn attention to it time after time. What we want is not more statutory bodies but action to alleviate poverty.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Combat poverty&rdquo; is a phrase that may be unacceptable to those who do not or, indeed, cannot believe that poverty exists in Ireland today.  It may also sound offensive and patronising both to those people who suffer the multiple effects of deprivation and those who are working and enabling them to deal with such effects.  The real challenge facing all of us in Ireland in the eighties is to confront and eradicate the evils of poverty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="216" /> At present the poor are being systematically excluded from a full life in Ireland. This is not new.  In fact, the first clear warning was given nearly ten years go when Séamus Ó Cinnéide reported at the Kilkenny conference organised by the Episcopal Council for Social Welfare that 25 per cent of Irish people were living in poverty.  Poverty does not come about by accident: rather our system is planned in such a way that poverty is an intergral part of it, emerging from social, economic and educational policies which favour the non-poor.  The whole structure of our society is underpinned by its philosophy which is totally inimical to the poor.</P>
    <P>The Bill before the House is in fulfilment of the commitments in the Programme for Government to re-establish the structures of the combat poverty organisation, with local involvement and development of constructive community action against poverty.</P>
    <P>The conclusion from the Catholic Bishop's Conference on Social Welfare in Kilkenny that a quarter of the population of the country were poor, aroused serious concern among statutory agencies, voluntary bodies, academic institutions and others concerned with poverty and the Coalition Government which came into power in 1973 set about considering what action could be taken to deal with the problem.  The opportunity to initiate action at EC level arose at the same time when the EC Commission was formulating its proposals for a new EC social action programme.  The Irish Government proposed that the programme should include special action against poverty and this proposal was agreed when the programme was approved at the end of 1973.</P>
    <P>Poverty is not an accident.  As I said earlier, it is a direct consequence of the way we order society.  It is a reflection of the values of society and, in particular, it is a reflection of the emphasis on competition as a basic value in society.  Deputy Skelly said that society is like a competition where we have winners and losers. He is quite right.  In order to identify the <Col N="217" /> winners, we determine a level of affluence and consumption as a mark of success. On the other hand, it is necessary to have poor people in order that the success of those who are successful can be measured.  Poverty is not an accident. It is the necessary consequence of the values that we have in society.  The poor are necessary to reassure the powerful that they are successful.</P>
    <P>One of the major causes of poverty is unemployment.  This was referred to by Deputy O'Hanlon before the recess, when he said that the greatest problem at present was the high level of unemployment; that it was a major challenge to this House, especially to the Government, because the only way to alleviate unemployment is through proper economic policies.  The Government's policies, he said, have been a major contribution to unemployment.  He said today that the Government have created the highest level of unemployment.  I cannot accept what the Deputy has said.  The Government do not go out of their way to create unemployment.  Indeed, they are very sensitive &mdash; as are all politicians &mdash; to that problem and are doing everything possible to alleviate it.  They introduced recently a number of policies which will help to reduce the number of unemployed. They also introduced a number of programmes, such as the social employment scheme to assist those who are unemployed.</P>
    <P>At a meeting of Dublin City Council which I attended last night, it was urged once again on the trade unions who employ staff for Dublin Corporation to introduce the social employment scheme. They are one of the very few local authorities who have not put that scheme into operation.  I ask the trade unions to reconsider allowing it to be introduced. People on long term unemployment could be assisted by this means.</P>
    <P>What frightens me is the indifference to the plight of the unemployed.  It is characterised by a positive hostility to them, a lack of sympathy to their needs and feelings and, most of all, by the continuous talk of abuse of the social welfare system.  There are abuses in that system, <Col N="218" /> one must acknowledge that.  There are abuses in every system.  I understand that the social welfare abuse amounts to a small fraction of the total welfare expenditure.  People who criticise social welfare assistance for the unemployed are people who have never seen the inside of a labour exchange.  They have never seen the inside of a social welfare office. They have never had to suffer the humiliation of signing on, the long queues and the deliberate humiliation of the extraordinary procedure of having to sign a receipt for money before it is placed in one's hand.  Above all, they have never had to suffer the humiliation of being compelled to be available for work when work sometimes is not available.</P>
    <P>There are many in our society who state that unemployment assistance and unemployment benefit are too high and become a disincentive to work.  Does any man or woman with two children and in receipt of £70 per week regard that assistance as a disincentive to work, especially at this time of year when parents are preparing their children for First Holy Communion, with the ensuing expenditure, and at Christmas when they are trying to put a few pounds together to buy toys for their children?  It is fascinating that people talk about disincentives when as much is spent on a meal for two as a married couple on unemployment assistance have to live on for a week.  Unfortunately, what we have in society today are not only a new wealthy but a very insensitive wealthy.  I find it most offensive when newspapers detail an intimate dinner for two which will be equal to or cost more than social assistance for husband, wife and a family of two for a week.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of poverty in our society concerns old people who live alone.  We are indebted to many organisations who give assistance in this area, particularly to the Society of St. Vincent de Paul.  We are further indebted to that society for the sample survey, published in September 1980, mentioned by Deputy O'Hanlon, of the 80,000 who are old and alone in this country.  The survey <Col N="219" /> told a tale of physical deprivation in relation to the old, lack of washing facilities, indoor toilets and so on.  It also showed that loneliness affects about two-thirds of elderly people at varying levels.  It affects 25 per cent occasionally and as many as 35 per cent of those surveyed suffer from depression occasionally and about onetenth are constantly subject to it.  Before passing from the elderly, I would like to pay tribute to the special task force operating from health boards to assist the elderly living alone in the upkeep of their homes.  Substantial progress has been made in this area.</P>
    <P>I want to state very clearly that I welcome the Bill because I believe it has benefited from the input of the working groups which have been serving in the interim and have made representations to the Minister.  In particular, I would like to pay tribute to Sister Stanislaus Kennedy and the work of her national committee on pilot schemes to combat poverty.  I am pleased to see that the principal functions of the agency are, first, the question of advising and making representations to the Minister on all aspects of economic planning in relation to poverty in the State.  This means that they are integrating their anti-poverty approach with the social and economic planning process.  That is a real achievement. I should like to put that on record. The next function &mdash; and I commend those who gave it second place in priority &mdash; is the initiative which is aimed at overcoming poverty in the State and the evaluation of such measures that have an action and an evaluation component.  I welcome the third principle of research. In the final function there is the question of public education.  I am of the view that there is a need for such education and for a greater public understanding of the nature, cause and extent of poverty in our society and how to overcome such poverty.</P>
    <P>I hope the Combat Poverty Agency, when set up, will see their function as a catalyst to enable the people to do something for themselves and in the process to realise that the more deprived <Col N="220" /> people are, the less opportunity they will have to do anything for themselves.  This means a shift of economic power so that power, economic and political, will go hand in hand with participation and that the institutions will co-operate with the people in the community to create the answers to the problem not just of combating poverty but of eliminating it from our society.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>We are all united in a determination, as Deputy Doyle has said, not just to combat poverty but to eliminate it from our society.  The difference arises between us in this issue as to whether the proposal being brought before the House now by the Government is the effective way of eliminating poverty.</P>
      <P>First, what we are witnessing now is a proposal from the Government to set up an agency which will be very preoccupied with combating the consequences of that Government's failure.  The most important issue which we must address is not just that of reacting to problems and to the poverty which is all too evident to us but, over and above that, to exploit the wealth that is in the nation, to ensure that the need for an agency of this kind will not be as evident as it appears to be at this stage.  Here there is a very definite difference of approach between this side of the House and that of the Government. What we are witnessing is a proposal to establish an agency which would have the best intentions, whose function would be to make suggestions as to how to cope across a range of areas which fall within the fundamental responsibility of Government.  We are asking an agency to deal with the trying circumstances in which the poor find themselves, while at the same time failing to acknowledge that the Government have the fundamental responsibility to deal with the causes of poverty and to ensure that those causes are eliminated from our society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is quite remarkable that the Government should give the agency such broad terms of reference as almost to bring them into the area of Government responsibility in economic areas.  Four <Col N="221" /> main functions are given to the agency under the Bill.  The first is to advise and make recommendations to the Minister on all aspects of economic and social planning in relation to poverty in the State.  I assume we all recognise that poverty exemplifies itself particularly in unemployment and its consequences. The Government are apparently transferring to this agency the responsibility to advise and make recommendations in relation to the problem of unemployment.  Another problem closely involved with poverty is inadequate housing and it would appear that this agency are to be asked to advise and make recommendations on that aspect of economic and social planning.  Alternatively, are they to be precluded from that which any social worker will confirm as a major characteristic of poverty?</P>
    <P>The second function of the agency is to advise and make recommendations on the initiation of measures aimed at overcoming poverty in the State and the evaluation of such measures.  I presume that if they are to initiate measures to overcome poverty the intention will be, as Deputy Doyle has said, to eliminate poverty in all its symptoms and unacceptable characteristics. If they succeed in that area they are properly moving into the area of social and economic planning and to that extent they would render themselves redundant if successful.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, the agency are to consider the examination of the nature, causes and extent of poverty and for that purpose to promote, commission and interpret research.  Does it take any great research to establish that the cause of poverty derives from the lack of adequate income, opportunity, employment, the failure to generate wealth from our own resources, personal or physical?  Nevertheless we are asking this agency as one of their functions to conduct an examination of the nature, causes and extent of poverty.  Are we seriously pretending that, in setting up an agency with these broad terms of reference, all of which would be commendable, these problems can be effectively tackled by an agency such as proposed by simply concentrating <Col N="222" /> on poverty as it all too obviously presents itself to us throughout the country? Reacting to the symptoms of poverty will not begin to solve the problem or to eliminate the causes.</P>
    <P>The final function to be allocated by the Government to this agency is the promotion of a greater public understanding of the nature, causes and extent of poverty in the State and the measures necessary to overcome such poverty.  I hope I will not be taken as being too critical if I suggest, as a number of social workers have done in the media, that one of the biggest problems is to promote an awareness in the Government themselves of the nature and extent of poverty, to secure a real, visible demonstration from this Government of their awareness of the crushing impact of poverty.  While one would generally have to welcome the laudable terms of reference given to this agency, one has to recognise that they are so general in this instance as to be meaningless in terms of an agency that can only cope with the consequences of the Government's failure to get at the causes of the problems the agency have been asked to address.</P>
    <P>In a whole series of sub-paragraphs the agency are asked to do a number of other things.  For instance, the agency are asked to evaluate, advise and make recommendations to the Minister in relation to policies and programmes of the State and of statutory and other bodies.  They are also asked to identify the possible new policies and programmes for the purpose of overcoming poverty.  The collection and dissemination of information on poverty and community development is another of their functions.  All this seems to imply that responsibility for those matters does not lie with the most fundamental combat poverty agency, namely, the Government of this nation at any and every time. These are the fundamental responsibilities of Government and they cannot abrogate their responsibility by setting up an agency of this kind and delegating to them the fundamental responsibility which they have as a Government.</P>
    <P>The irony of this legislation is that it is proposing to establish an agency to <Col N="223" /> deal with the consequences of the Government's own failures, which amounts to turning responsibility on its head.  To that extent the terms of reference are far too broad and vague.  I cannot imagine that anyone could disagree with any member of the agency who would say that according to the normal interpretation of their terms of reference they would make proposals to the Government across every area of economic activity in order to eliminate the causes of poverty.  The Government would probably tell them very quickly that they were interpreting the terms of reference far too broadly.  Before launching another new agency we must be clear and precise about their responsibilities.</P>
    <P>For some years there has been a substantial difference between the parties in this House.  Wherever there is an obvious need which must be tackled the Government propose to tackle the need by setting up an agency or a corporation to do the Government's job.  I have just indicated how this is one such agency. Another example is the NDC who have been set up to do a job which is fundamentally the responsibility of the Government.  The Government, as well as being a combat poverty agency should be the fundamental national development corporation.  It is the Government's role to ensure that our development potential is maximised.  Delegating that responsibility to another authority is a cop-out.  I am concerned that the consequences of this apparently commendable effort will be just another abrogation of fundamental Government responsibility. In many cases poverty is the direct result of Government policy and we are now asking a Government agency to cope with the consequences of Government failures and to make recommendations to deal with the crushing consequences of Government policy.  That is a new direction for any State agency.</P>
    <P>The most obvious cause of poverty is the high level of unemployment.  The unemployed are clearly suffering from poverty.  They do not need surveys outlining what it is like to suffer from poverty <Col N="224" /> and unemployment.  They are living with the reality of it.  The way to combat their poverty is to provide employment.  That is the most effective way to deal with it and then the State will not need an agency to make recommendations to cope with the consequences of poverty which are all too pervasive in society at the moment.</P>
    <P>The Government failure to deal with the employment issue speaks for itself.  I would ask the Taoiseach to desist from offending the unemployed by using the statistical jargon that the level of growth of unemployment is reducing in percentage terms.  Naturally if the percentage level were to increase at the same rate it would mean that employment was increasing even further than it is at present. Obviously 10 per cent of £100,000 is an extra 10,000 and on 200,000 is an extra 20,000, and so on.  Will the Taoiseach stop making the specious claim that the level of growth of unemployment is decreasing?  Using specious statistical presentations adds further to the frustration of the unemployed.</P>
    <P>The Government in their decisions have failed to combat poverty and in some areas have aggravated poverty.  The most obvious example, an example agreed with by Mr. Wille Birmingham of the organisation ALONE, is the decision to phase out food subsidies.  It has always been accepted that the people at the lowest levels subsist on bread, butter and milk and by abolishing the food subsidies on these items the Government are withdrawing support for the families most in need.  The crushing effect of this decision is immediately felt by the poor people.  The Government who are asking this agency to make the public aware of the reality of poverty might consider contacting the poor directly.  If the politicians called to some of the houses in our towns they would get the smell of poverty in every sense of the word.  Perhaps then they would realise the crushing effect of the Government decision to reduce subsidies while at the same time setting up an agency to advise the Government as to how to combat the consequences of poverty.  Was ever anything so contradictory or so offensive to the poor?  The <Col N="225" /> Government decision aggravates the problem and then an agency is asked to make recommendations on the consequences of it.</P>
    <P>Apart from food, the greatest needs of the poor are fuel, electricity and so on. In the last 20 years this is the first Government to benefit extraordinarily from the world economic climate.  There are falling oil prices, falling inflation rates and falling interests rates throughout the world.  Everything happening outside the country is favourable to our economy. However, in relation to a practical matter such as ESB bills, instead of having a reasonable delay in the reduction of bills, the public are told that some time in October ESB bills will be reduced.  Perhaps it is too much to expect that the poor will be using electricity in any event.</P>
    <P>The contradiction in that should be obvious.  We all welcome the major boost to the economy from outside but the Government choose to postpone the benefit of that development and not to pass it on to the poor.  However, the Government are acting in even a worse way than that because this year they are providing for old age and blind pensions a sum of £278 million or a 1.5 per cent increase on last year's figure of £273 million. They must be aware that at least 4,000 more people will qualify for those pensions this year.  Because of the various external factors the projections of the Government may be realised and we may experience an inflation rate of 4 per cent or even 3 per cent, but despite this the Government have increased by only 1.5 per cent the provision for old age and blind pensions.  What kind of miracle are they hoping to achieve?  Those of us who deal frequently with applicants for old age pensions know that the only way the Government can operate within these provisions is by applying the most stringent means tests possible in the matter of qualification for old age pensions.  This will mean that very many who in any other year would qualify for old age pensions will be told that their income is greater than the limit and therefore will not qualify.  Apart from the matter of fixing a limit there is the question of how <Col N="226" /> the income of an applicant is generally calculated.  As always there will be a degree of discretion and judgment on the part of officers of the Department in reaching their conclusions.</P>
    <P>Officials of the Department of Social Welfare, especially those who deal practically with these matters &mdash; pension officers and their assistants &mdash; have always shown a deep concern and a great readiness to help the aged poor particularly but because of the limitations being imposed on them and because generally of the scope of instructions being directed to them, the reality is that many people are either being disqualified or are being reduced in their entitlement this year. These are people who would otherwise have qualified for a full range of benefit. The explanation for that is that the Government are providing an additional £5 million only to cope with the growing number of people who will qualify.</P>
    <P>I could introduce any member of the Government to a number of old people who are poor but who are not in receipt of full old age pensions.  This leads to various kinds of problems for these people.  Is it not then somewhat contradictory for the Government deliberately to take a decision to provide only an extra £5 million in this instance and at the same time to set up an agency to advise them as to the realities of poverty and as to how the problem might be tackled?</P>
    <P>Another example is the imposition of service charges.  The Government decided to introduce a scheme whereby service charges would be imposed across the board in terms of users of local authority services.  I acknowledge that there are many who can afford to pay for these services but there are countless thousands who are not able to pay the charges in respect of water, sewerage and refuse collection services.  I know of many such people in my home town.  These people are upset and embittered, too, by reason of their being pressed for payments they cannot afford.  They will not be re-assured by the outcome of their representations to local representatives in the matter of the waiving of these charges and by public representatives making a big deal of a <Col N="227" /> successful outcome of the representations. These people should not have to come to the likes of us in an attempt to have lifted from their shoulders the burden of poverty imposed on them by the Government.</P>
    <P>Even those old age pensioners who, because of the age limit provision had the charges waived last year are receiving demands again this year for the charges. People who are now in their eighty-first year will have the task of proving again this year that they are no better off now than they were last year when they were in their eightieth year.  Is this not a nonsense? Any practical person should be able to make the kind of recommendations that the agency being discussed would be likely to make.  These are some examples of poverty so far as the old are concerned but these are the people the Government seem to have overlooked. Most of the matters the agency will be asked to address themselves to are matters that are the fundamental responsibility of Government.  I suggest that the agency would advise the Government first that they should not take any action that would add further to the problems of those who are already in the poverty category.  Secondly, the agency might advise the Government to try to ensure that opportunities are provided to enable people to avoid poverty and to become engaged in gainful and meaningful employment.</P>
    <P>Apart from the poverty that is manifest in terms of the unemployed, the old and the sick, there is poverty also in our various institutions, in such places as our hospitals and welfare homes.  We talk sometimes of the special care given to private patients compared with the care given to public patients.  Apparently private patients enjoy a higher level of accommodation than is available to public patients.  In this context I am not making any reference to the question of whether the treatment is better in the case of the private patient but his accommodation is better because he is paying for it whereas the public patient must <Col N="228" /> make do with what is available.  That is an unacceptable face of poverty.</P>
    <P>The Leas-Cheann Comhairle and I are well aware of the poverty that is experienced in a hospital in our home town.  People in an advanced state of illness are being treated on the corridors by dedicated professional staff who are frustrated at not being able to cope adequately with the needs of those people.  Last weekend I spoke with a person who was suffering from a terminal illness and whose family were gathered around in the corridor.  That is an appalling demonstration of poverty.  It is also an appalling demonstration of the failure of Government to provide for the alleviation of that kind of poverty.  The people who suffer will not be reassured by agencies of this kind no matter how well intentioned they might be and no matter how well qualified their members might be. The relatives of that person and many like them suffer terrible frustration and bitterness because of the way they are being treated.</P>
    <P>This year the Estimates provide for an increase of £1 million over last year's provision for the building, equipping and furnishing of hospitals and other health facilities.  Last year's provision was £57 million and this was increased to £58 million this year.  This represents an increase of a little over 1½ per cent.  Is it any wonder that we do not have adequate equipment to furnish our hospitals and adequate accommodation for the people we are supposed to be concerned about? Adequate funding should be provided for facilities of that kind.  We should be very careful not to frustrate the medical staff in those institutions to such an extent that their commitment and devotion to those under their care are undermined.  From my experience of visiting hospitals, particularly in my own constituency, I know that medical staff whom we know to be most dedicated and devoted people are so frustrated as to be embittered.  This is very sad.  The Government and the Minister imply that all is well and that all of these matters are being dealt with. This only aggravates the problem.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="229" /> Is there anybody here who can suggest that the fuel allowances operated by the health boards are adequate?  Can anybody in this House say he has had no occasion to take issue with the health boards when fuel allowances for the old, the sick and the unemployed were cut back?  Any Deputy who has not made representations to try to restore fuel allowances has not been in contact with the reality of the problems of the people he claims to represent.  The allocations to the health boards are not adequate to provide for those who need allowances. I have nothing but admiration for the officials of the health boards and their miraculous capacity to provide for the needs of the poor and the old, even within the limited resources available to them.</P>
    <P>We have all heard of social workers such as Willie Bermingham.  The greatest single problem for the old, particularly during the winter which is far from over, is the lack of adequate heating.  Many people suffer from hypothermia.  They are not aware of the cold until it is too late.  This happens because they have not adequate fuel or heating in their home. One way of combating poverty would be to provide adequate fuel allowances for those people.  The cost of treating those people in hospitals would also be reduced.  The hospitals cannot cope adequately with those people because of the problems of bed space and treatment. Until such time as we provide more than adequate expenditure for the old and the poor to give them basic heating in their own homes, we are acting in a contradictory fashion.  Some might say we are acting in a hypocritical fashion when we tell the country we are determined to combat poverty and at the same time we cut back the resources available to the health boards.  The same applies to disabled persons maintenance allowances and supplementary allowances available to the poor and the unemployed.</P>
    <P>This year I will press the Minister for Finance, as I pressed his predecessor unsuccessfully last year, to find a better way to deal more effectively with the problems of dependent old people.  This can be done by increasing the tax <Col N="230" /> allowances of people who look after dependent parents or grandparents in their own homes.  If we were to give them an extra £3,000 tax allowance it would mean an extra £1,000 net for every person taking care of his or her parents.  That would ensure that people would be taken care of in their own homes where they would be happiest.  It would also ensure that the cost to the State would be very much less than it is now.  Many families are obliged to transfer their aged parents or grandparents to health care institutions or geriatric hospitals.  It is cheaper to encourage people to look after their own relatives at home than to force them to transfer their relatives to overcrowed institutions.  I hope I will succeed, as we seem to have done in some respects already, in persuading this Minister to approach this problem in a more practical manner than his predecessor did last year.  The cost of a hospital bed is £100 per week which is the cheapest possible rate.</P>
    <P>How does that compare with the cost which the State would save itself by increasing a tax allowance?  The sum of £100 a week would come out at £5,000 per annum.  In the average case you would be talking £200 a week, which is £10,000 per annum.  I am suggesting to the Minister and to the Government and I will propose it in the Finance Bill, that they increase the tax allowance to even onefifth of that amount in net terms when you would get a better return both for the old and from the point of view of the State finances, if that were to be our fundamental responsibility.</P>
    <P>I presume that when the committee look at the causes or consequences of poverty, all of which fall within their remit, they will also mention a few other factors.  They must mention alcoholism, drugs and the unbearable marital tension which many people suffer from.  I am not saying that poverty is the exclusive cause of any of these problems but I am saying that that element in our community who are suffering from the burden of poverty are entitled to our special concern in these areas.  There may be some in middle class Dublin or anywhere else who have <Col N="231" /> marital problems but those problems do not derive from poverty.  They derive from other matters within their own control. I might say in passing that they do not have my sympathy at all to the same extent as those who have marital problems arising from the crushing burden of poverty with all its symptoms such as alcoholism and wife beating.</P>
    <P>We talk at great length about crime, lawlessness, alcoholism, drugs and all of the marital problems for which we are going to bring in proposals and meet the Bishops in relation to them while recognising at the same time that if we really wanted to alleviate the causes of those various problems we would do so best once again by actually providing adequate income and sustenance for the people who are, by and large, suffering from those symptoms of poverty.  How many wives have been subjected to wife beating because of a husband who has not been at work and who spends most of his day trying to pretend to himself that he is not suffering the consequences of the indignity of unemployment by adjourning to the local pub and chatting with his friends who are also in the same condition?  He can be a big man chatting to his friends in the pub as he does not have to face the constant complaints of an annoying wife &mdash; as some might say, the haranguing of the wife and kids.  He can come home afterwards when the wife suffers the consequences of the problems that, frankly, in the first instance are not the making of either of them.  It is time we realised that we have had these problems more in the last few years than we have had at any other time.</P>
    <P>One of the main causes for the growth of those crushing problems, and I include vandalism and all of the things we speak about here such as Garda problems, has been the growth of unemployment and the poverty associated with it.  Is it any coincidence, for instance, that most of the problems that an agency like this would be addressing itself to occur in the deprived areas of the city?  Deprived from the point of view of housing, employment and any kind of dignity.  They occur <Col N="232" /> mostly in those areas and we are going to ask this agency to make recommendations as to how we can deal with those problems.  I hope they will have the blunt honesty and a sense of anger and frustration to tell the Government the way to deal with them is to change their policies generally and provide adequate jobs, housing, dignity and opportunities as distinct from looking to an agency such as the Combat Poverty Agency to alleviate the consequences of the problems the Government have caused.</P>
    <P>Housing is also of central importance in this and no doubt when the agency come to making recommendations they will touch on it.  When we look at the tensions which are generated from the lack of employment we can see that tension eventually resulting in an actual breakdown of health.  I personally know and I am sure I am not the only Deputy in this House who knows many people whose health has broken down because of the lack of employment opportunities. I know of many people who are not just mentally but physically broken because they have been three to five years out of work.  That is the way to recognise what the consequences of poverty may be. Then we have to spend more money in providing for them in institutions and so on.  It is time that we recognised that the only way to provide for them in coping with problems of that nature is to provide dignity for them.</P>
    <P>I recently heard an eminent physician talking amongst a group of his professional colleagues express the opinion &mdash; I know of no other man who is as anti-tobacco and cigarette smoking as this man, as most physicians are at this point &mdash; that the most important thing to get across to the public is to avoid the pernicious tobacco habit.  That in itself will guarantee them better health and relieve congestion in hospitals.  Many of those who enter hospital are suffering from congestion due to cigarette related conditions. This particular physician expressed the view that not only is it a waste of time &mdash; he is very anti-tobacco in all its forms and habits &mdash; it is an offence to the poor to give them advice like that at this stage.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="233" /> It is an offence to the unemployed to tell them to give up smoking at this stage. You can tell a comfortable middle class person that he is better off without cigarettes and probably he will listen.  He will say to himself that probably he will be fitter and better equipped for his job. You try telling to some person who has been without a job for three to five years when either he or his wife are on unemployment assistance that the best thing he could do for his health is to give up the fags and the reaction you are most likely to get from him is that the reason he is smoking is that it is all he has left and he is going to stay with them for as long as he is around.  That is the reality and it adds to the problems of our health care.  Let us face it, until such time as we recognise those normal things that you need no agency to advise you on, we are not going to get at the basic causes of poverty which this agency is meant to combat.</P>
    <P>We are not just dealing with poverty of income in this sense, we are faced with a deeper problem, a poverty of ideas. The Government have a responsibility to promote the ideas and the climate for providing the dignity of work for people. As yet, even in a better world economic climate, there is no sign of it.  When every other country &mdash; everyone who has been outside the country in recent times will have to recognise this reality &mdash; is literally lifting with the new economic boom in the world at this stage, we are still talking about combating the consequences of poverty.  Are we so negative and so helpless in our approach that we cannot see that the greatest poverty we have at present is the poverty of hopelessness and of young people who see no opportunities for themselves and having to make a contribution in other countries because they cannot make here?</P>
    <P>Two or three weeks ago I visited the United States.  I slept for most of the journey.  When I got off at Kennedy airport I was appalled &mdash; let not the Taoiseach give us any other impression about the statistics of emigration &mdash; when I came to the immigration desk to find countless hundreds of our young people queueing up.  That was on one day alone.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="234" /> Young people are leaving every parish in the country every single day and, as long as this exodus continues, nothing will be done to provide for those who cannot help themselves &mdash; the old and the sick. If a spot check is carried out at Shannon Airport every day, we will get a real picture of the poverty of ideas that is being forced on us and we will see the drain on our greatest resource, our young people who are leaving because they feel a sense of hopelessness.  Every day we have young people emigrating to Australia and Canada.  All Deputies will admit that every weekend young people come to see them asking if they can get them to America, Australia, Canada or anywhere out of Ireland.  Until we tackle this problem, we will have no hope of providing for the poor and the unemployed.</P>
    <P>We overload the Department of Social Welfare and the Department of Health as well as the health boards and every other organisation while trying to cope with these very obvious problems.  We have a plethora of agencies and corporations but the Government do not have a specific plan.  It is time we told them to stop this nonsense because, as long as they pursue their present course, they will aggravate the problem they ae pretending to tackle.  Would it not be a good idea to start exploiting our wealth to the advantage of all, particularly the old and the sick?  If we generate enough activity in this area, we will be able to provide properly for them in their homes, in hospitals or institutions.  We will not see a Minister indulge in exercises like those we have seen over the last number of months when the Minister for Health closed a number of institutions, attempted in vain to justify those closures, and then attempted to change his mind while pretending he was not doing so.</P>
    <P>How about developing our land resources and having a proper land policy? What about developing a policy for the food industry, for fisheries and forestry in all their forms, for tourism and so on?  These are fantastic resources.  What about a real plan to combat poverty by exploiting this wealth about which we are <Col N="235" /> doing nothing?  What about a plan to combat poverty by educating our young people to apply their knowledge and skills in added value for jobs, as is done in every other country where they have managed to combat poverty successfully? Educating young people is the only way to combat poverty and to eliminate poverty.  Until we exploit the wealth of the nation we will always have the appalling evidence of grinding poverty and we will always have an excuse for bringing in an agency like this to advise us on the realities with which we should all be only too familiar at this stage.</P>
    <P>Only the Government have fundamental responsibility in this area.  They are the real combat poverty agency.  Only when they begin to address themselves to some of the problems they are delegating to this agency can we say that at last we are beginning not only to combat poverty but to eliminate it.</P>

      <P>Listening to Deputy O'Kennedy I almost fell into the trap of becoming depressed because his speech was well laced with the usual clichés which can be calculated not only to undermine the confidence of all the people, but to generate a greater amount of poverty than anything ever before experienced.  From a man with his experience and standing those old work clichés are not fit to be trotted out once again.</P>
      <P>He claimed that the Government are setting up this agency to alleviate these problems but he seems to have forgotten that a combat poverty institution was in operation some years ago.  I seem to recall that a Government of which he was a member felt it necessary to curtail the activities of that agency not because poverty had been eliminated but for other reasons, I think of a financial nature.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He also said it was wrong for the Taoiseach to indicate that the percentage of the level of increase in unemployment was decreasing.  Of course the percentage is decreasing but so are the numbers, which is more important.  In 1980-81 there was an unemployment increase in the region of 31,000.  It is well that the <Col N="236" /> numbers have decreased because, if they had not done so, the picture painted by Deputy O'Kennedy of depression, recession and deprivation would be a lot worse than even he could envisage, and he has taken poetic licence&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>If the Deputy is worried about some of the replies I am giving to the points he raised, that is his business.</P>
      <P>He also mentioned the removal of the food subsidies.  There has been a great deal of debate as to whether food subsidies are the best way to cater for the needs of the poorer sectors of the community. A number of people who have studied this subject in depth are firmly of the view that it is not.  Everybody in the country, not only those in need, who ate each day benefited from those subsidies and the experts felt that this was not the proper way to tackle this problem.</P>
      <P>I noticed during this debate that some Members seemed to claim a greater knowledge of the needs of the poor than others.  In some cases this is amusing, but in others it is not.  In my view, everyone elected to public office should be aware of the rudimentary needs of the community before going before the electorate. If they have not acquired this knowledge, after a few months in office, whether at local authority, health board or Oireachtas level, they will very quickly learn what the needs of the community are.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Kennedy also mentioned the trauma caused by service charges.  I thought it was generally accepted that waivers were readily available in all local authority areas.</P>

I reiterate that if the case is as stated I suggest that other measures be taken to alleviate the problem.  From my experience on a health board I would be very worried if that were genuine.  I am not suggesting for one moment, nor did I suggest, that Deputy O'Kennedy contrived the situation.  I said that if the hospital or institution was crowded to the extent that a patient had to be attended to in a corridor that institution was over-crowded.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>We need to look at the definition of poverty.  A number of speakers have expounded at length on that issue.  We have all heard about the one million poor and we talk about the one million poor quite regularly here in this House and elsewhere.  I often wonder whether we recognise fully the various definitions of poverty and how it affects people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First, there is poverty caused by social <Col N="239" /> deprivation.  There is perhaps, to a certain extent, class deprivation which creates a certain poverty of itself.  Then there is economic deprivation which stems from unemployment and other areas.  An area which other speakers have referred to is deprivation and poverty caused by lack of or inadequacy of housing.  Not nearly enough attention has been given to over-crowding in housing in our towns and cities and in various rural areas.  The feeling in some quarters is that that kind of deprivation applies only to the towns and cities, the urban areas.  Unfortunately, it applies equally to the rural areas.  I have first hand evidence of cases of families numbering 16 or 17 trying to exist in an ordinary three bedroomed local authority house.  Despite the fact that existing institutions and services have already provided those people with a house, obviously they have provided them with an inadequate house, and there is no way in which a reasonable degree of privacy, security or happiness could follow under such gross over-crowding. Such incidents are not isolated. They are quite common in every constituency. In some cases in rural constituencies they may apply to even a greater extent than in the urban areas by virtue of less concentration of social services in some of the more remote rural areas and consequently they may go undetected for some time.</P>
    <P>Deprivation and poverty result from lack of basic sanitary services in houses. Despite the fact that we have many schemes to assist which are operated by local authorities, health boards and local voluntary organisations, a great number of people throughout the country, large families, are living in over-crowded conditions and, more seriously, in houses that have not those basic sanitary requirements that should be available to every citizen and certainly to every family.  We have in operation quite a number of agencies who are there to help, to assist in many ways in such situations, but they do not necessarily always assist.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate for a number of reasons that the people concerned are in <Col N="240" /> many cases unable to penetrate what they see as the wall of bureaucracy which prohibits them from obtaining their rights in relation to many of these services.  I and many other Members have said in this House that it can well happen that there is a poverty which affects people who for one reason or another feel that they cannot penetrate that bureaucracy &mdash; for want of a better word &mdash; in order to achieve what they could achieve if they had a greater degree of knowledge of the operation of the systems.  I refer to the various housing and other agencies which the local authorities operate and to the health boards.  I think of supplementary welfare assistance and how it benefits the community.  I know that the experience of virtually every Member of this House is that people who have had a reasonably good standard of living and who through no fault of their own find themselves unemployed and with no means of subsistence find it difficult to approach these agencies and in some cases to get sufficient courage, having approached the agencies, to pursue their case.  We should try to get around that.</P>
    <P>The people who operate the various schemes are, by virtue of the large number of cases they have to deal with, always in danger of becoming conditioned by their environment.  They can become conditioned by virtue of the severity of the cases that come before them and as a result as time passes they are not as impressed by the seriousness of the problem as they might be in the initial stages of their employment.  For that reason it would be no harm at all to have available advice such as would come from the Combat Poverty Agency.  That agency have a role to play at present. Any agency who have not the statutory powers to direct &mdash; in other words have little or no teeth &mdash; will have a very limited success rate.  The very fact that such an agency exists should be sufficient to draw attention to the ever pressing needs of the people who are in need and the large volume of demand on existing services.</P>
    <P>Other speakers mentioned poverty and its effects on various parts of our society.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="241" /> Deputy O'Kennedy mentioned hospitals and hospital conditions.  Something should be done, as a matter of urgency, about conditions in our psychiatric and geriatric institutions.  They should not be left as they are.  Some effort should be made to improve the conditions under which the people in them have to live. Unfortunately, there is a tendency in this country to resist change.  Change should always be for the better and any change in those hospitals could only be for the better.</P>
    <P>Another area I would like to speak on and which was given very little recognition by the other side of the House is that the family income supplement introduced by the Government.  In addition to the supplementary welfare benefits, this is there to help those in the lower income bracket, those who would not have access to the basic finance to run their homes. There are many who will be sceptical about those schemes.  Nevertheless, they cost money and they are helping somebody.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ormonde</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>The voluntary agencies, such as the St. Vincent de Paul and Sister Stanislaus and the various other committees caring for the aged, have done a great deal of work.  These many voluntary bodies have the benefit of being closer to the ground and being in a better position to assess the impact of the present <Col N="242" /> economic climate on the society with which they deal than one would find in the case of the statutory institutions. They have been of tremendous assistance and hopefully will continue to carry on with their good work with some assistance from the State as has been the case in the past.</P>
      <P>In the case of social hardship there are times when one must examine the benefit of actual cash contributions.  There are cases where, because of alcoholism or drug abuse, a cash contribution to families may not solve the problem.  This is where the voluntary agencies have had greater effect and more success in dealing with situations than have the statutory bodies.  I would hope that under this Bill it will be possible for the Combat Poverty Agency to advise the statutory agencies to a greater extent in relation to how best to assist those who are in that category with these social problems.  These are the types of situation where cash contributions would not necessarily be put to the best use.  This area needs to be carefully looked at and, hopefully, will be looked at in the context of this Bill.</P>
      <P>I welcome the general thrust of this Bill.  I hope it will be successful and that the people for whom it is geared will get the benefits they are intended to get.  I hope also that the agencies that are in existence are advised by the Combat Poverty Agency in such a way as to make those statutory agencies more effective and more receptive to the needs of the community.  Those of us in public life have everyday experience of meeting people who have suffered from social or economic deprivation.  In some cases, despite the fact that the officers concerned operate on the ground on a day to day basis, those of us in public life are more inclined to be receptive to the please of the deprived than those in the agencies. I hope the Bill achieves its objectives and that the situation of those who are socially or economically deprived for one reason or another will be alleviated and eventually resolved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to make one final point about the picture painted by some speakers on the opposite side of the House of <Col N="243" /> doom and gloom and total and absolute depression and recession.  It is nothing new here that the economy does not always compare favourably with world or, indeed, European standards.  In fact, that has been the trend over a long number of years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>Not so long ago it was quite common to have a higher rate of unemployment, a higher interest rate, a higher inflation rate and a higher rate of everything except income to individual families than any other country in Europe.  That is not so very long ago and it was at a time when the Opposition party had full responsibility for it.  I hope they have not forgotten all that.</P>

      <P>At least now we have an opportunity to turn the corner and capitalise on the good Government we have had over the past few years.  Our society will at last have the benefit of capitalising on good management and as a result we will see, in the weeks and months ahead, a reduction in the number of people unemployed.  A fact that has not been mentioned is that this very day we have had a dramatic reduction in the price of coal which is a household necessity and which is an area which can be covered in relation to free fuel vouchers and so on.</P>

I represent a constituency which has a very high rate of unemployment and I am well aware of the extent of poverty.

We hear a lot about deprivation but in my constituency people are deprived of being able to get up in the morning to go to work.</P>
      <P>It is difficult to evaluate the extent of poverty.  I met a woman recently in my constituency, a widow, whose family are all unemployed.  None of them could get a job and it was not for lack of trying as they continually answered advertisements and travelled round to different companies but the answer was always the same.  They could not get a job.  The family are not selective and would take any kind of work.  This woman told me that her family are just surviving and that at times there is no food in the house. She said that the family had not eaten meat for a number of years.  This clearly indicates that people are severely deprived by not having enough food to exist on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government, by their policies, have created poverty.  Some people in my constituency were in permanent jobs for years with a weekly pay packet.  This was the case before the Government took office.  I refer particularly to Irish Shipping because many of my constituents were employed in that company for over 30 years.  In some cases a father had worked there all his life and his son had <Col N="245" /> joined him on leaving school.  The workers in that company got very little notice of the Government's decision to call in the liquidator and most of their families are now suffering from the effects of poverty.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil are proud of their record irrespective of what members of other parties say.  We achieved many things in combating poverty and when Deputy Haughey was Minister for Health he introduced many imaginative schemes in relation to social welfare and health such as free travel and electricity, retirement and invalidity pensions, death grants, the deserted wife's allowance and pay-related insurance schemes.  Deputy Haughey improved the diabolical fuel scheme then in existence where unfortunate old people had to queue for three or four hours for a bag of turf.  The present scheme was introduced by Deputy Haughey.  Fianna Fáil brought in the new maternity allowance scheme for women in employment which was of great benefit to women in the low income bracket. In 1980 Fianna Fáil introduced a double payment at Christmas for those on long term social welfare payments.  Fianna Fáil also introduced the choice of doctor and the general medical schemes and the refund of drugs scheme.  In 1980 and 1982 the Fianna Fáil budgets provided for an increase to those on social welfare at the rate of 25 per cent which was granted from the month of April and not, as is the case now, where the increase will not come into operation until the last week in July, even though increases are supposed to be in line with inflation.</P>
    <P>Many pensioners and those on social welfare complain that while they will not get the increase until July they will have to pay tax from 5 April.  The decision of the Government to introduce the retention tax is a retrograde step as far as old people are concerned.  For the first time in the history of the State old age pensioners will be taxed.  The Government have conned these people because last year, when the houses of old people were broken into, with the loss of life savings in many cases, they were advised by the Government not to keep money in the <Col N="246" /> house but to put it in the bank or post office.  Having advised old people to do that the Government then introduced a retention tax.  Many years ago the late Ernest Blythe took a shilling off the old age pensioner and that is still in the minds of the present generation.  I have no doubt that the retention tax will also be remembered for many years.</P>
    <P>Poverty can be identified among the old and unemployed.  Constituents have told me that when they are made redundant, by agreement with the company and trade unions they are granted their statutory redundancy, agreed lump sums, and they have no problem for about 15 months.  However, when they then apply for social welfare assistance, the Department of Social Welfare want to know what they did with their lump sum. I can recall one man who was employed by a company for 39 years making representations to me.  When he was made redundant he was paid the statutory amount with a lump sum of £5,000 and when his PRSI payments ran out he made an application for social welfare assistance but he ran into difficulties.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann calls on the Government to make immediate arrangements for Bord Gáis Éireann to take over the Dublin Gas Company in order to resolve the present crisis; to protect the substantial State investment and interests in the company and to ensure the future supply of natural gas to the Dublin area at reasonable prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In putting down the motion Fianna Fáil recognised the serious financial crisis that exists in Dublin Gas.  The House will recall that, as far back as last September, a consortium of banks who were funding <Col N="247" /> the development programme stopped that funding.  At that time the banks had put in £40 million of the £60 million they had committed to this project.  About the same time the Dublin Gas Company stopped paying Bord Gáis for gas supplies. The figure had reached between £12 million and £13 million.  I hope the Minister, when replying, will give details to the House of the amount owed to Bord Gáis.  That was bad enough but worse was to come.  In the last two weeks the Revenue Commissioners who had not been paid their taxes took out a judgment against the Dublin Gas Company in the High Court to recover on behalf of Irish taxpayers the money due.  I understand that the judgment was for a figure in the region of £2 million.  The Minister should tell the House if more money is due to the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>The crisis has been created by the indecision of the Minister and the Government. The position in the company has been known since last September.  It is crucial that I should say that, because in recent weeks we have been told that the crisis arose only last week or the week before.  I put it to the House that when payments to Bord Gáis for gas stopped last September and when the banks indicated they were no longer to fund the development programme at about the same time, it had to be abundantly clear to the Minister that serious problems existed.</P>
    <P>From the information I have it appears that many discussions took place since then between the company and Bord Gáis and between Bord Gáis and the Department.  I do not think the Minister can tell the House, or the public, that he was not aware of the crisis since last September.  We are all aware that Bord Gáis are a State enterprise and that the Minister has his own representatives on the board.  There is no way that he would be unaware of the crisis building up in the Dublin Gas Company.  He has his own directors and his own chairman on the board of the Dublin Gas Company. It is not logical to suggest that he, and <Col N="248" /> the Government, were not aware of the crisis since September.</P>
    <P>I am not in possession of all the facts in relation to the Dublin Gas Company and I want the Minister to give us an up to date assessment of how the major development programme went wrong. He should tell us the progress made in regard to the conversion programme.  I understand that 80 per cent of the programme has been completed but I am not in a position to verify that.  I hope the Minister will give details of that programme to the House.  It is significant that the banks who had put in £40 million of the £60 million committed to this project stopped funding it.  Why did they stop funding the programme last September? What were the indicators that prompted the move by the banks?</P>
    <P>We are all aware that the banks have been paid interest on their loans and that the financial institutions who put £10 million into the company for £10 million loan stock have also been receiving very substantial returns for their investment. From the calculations I have made it appears that their return on their investment in 1985-86 runs at approximately 20 per cent.  Most Members will be aware that the terms for that £10 million loan stock were tied to the sales of natural gas to Dublin Gas customers.  If the targets had been reached the return next year would be approximately 30 per cent.  That is the part of the deal I objected to strenuously when the Minister responsible, Deputy John Bruton, tried to convince the House, and the country, that he had done a marvellous deal for the Irish taxpayers.</P>
    <P>Let us look at the facts in regard to this.  Outside financial institutions were allowed to put in £10 million of loan stock on a preferential return basis.  Of that £10 million they were entitled to convert £5 million into ordinary stock if they so wished at whatever point they wanted. That in turn would have given them 25 per cent of the equity of Dublin Gas for an investment of £5 million and they were already getting a return on that money. I objected to that deal on the basis that for their £5 million they were getting 25 <Col N="249" /> per cent of the ordinary shareholding and voting shares in Dublin Gas while the State, for its huge investment, did not do as well.  Will the Minister tell the House how much of the State investment has been made?  Has it all been made?  Are we at the stage that £51 million, £54 million or £76 million has gone in?  The Minister should tell the House the position so that we can assess what has happened. For an investment of £10 million the financial institutions got a giveaway. I am at a loss to know why the Minister could not have done a similar deal for £5 million on behalf of the State.</P>
    <P>What has caused the crisis in Dublin Gas?  Were their targets not being reached?  Did the banks get cold feet? Was it a question of management not living up to expectations?  When one hears all the complaints floating around the city, or listens to consumer programmes, or Gay Byrne, one begins to wonder.  I have heard people say that when the gas man called three weeks ago he said he would return but he had not done so.  If that is the position three years later &mdash; I do not take everything I hear on the radio or read in the papers for granted &mdash; then one must point the finger at management.  They are not doing their job.  It is the function of management to run the business correctly.  Have management failed to reach their targets or was the crunch issue in relation to the price of gas to Dublin Gas so that they could remain competitive with other energy sources?</P>
    <P>What is the crux of the problem?  Only when we hear from the Minister what is the crux will we be able to carry out a real assessment of the true position.  Our motion has been tabled because the Revenue Commissioners have taken out a judgment for £2 million, because £12 million to £13 million are outstanding for unpaid natural gas supplies from Bord Gáis, in effect the taxpayer, and because the banks have refused since last September additional funding to the tune of £20 million.  We say to the Government:  the crisis has continued too long, the risks are too great, something must be done <Col N="250" /> now.  I cannot understand their dilly-dallying about this decision.  They have known the total picture over the last few months.  I should like to hear the Minister deny that he was unaware of it.  If the Government have been aware, why have they not taken a decision?  Is it a case of ideological hang-ups between the two parties in Government?  Is it a prolongation of the problems this deal created for this Government when Deputy Cluskey resigned on a point of principle at the time, or what is the real situation?</P>
    <P>The reality in relation to Dublin Gas, to the consumers who depend on gas for their cooking and heating, the industries that have switched over to it and the taxpayer is simply that the Government have placed the whole situation at risk by their indecision over the past couple of months.  One might well ask what is to stop any other creditor next week from going into the High Court and getting a judgment for money owed him.  I am sure there are plenty of such creditors around. Seeing the way the Government have handled the situation, what is to stop them joining the queue, saying, &ldquo;We will protect our money.  We will go into the High Court, get a judgment and have a receiver or liquidator appointed&rdquo;?  I might point out to the House that if a receiver or liquidator was appointed then the existing supply agreements would cease to exist.</P>
    <P>I have examined the possibility of a receiver or liquidator being appointed and that is the position that would obtain under the supply agreements reached between Bord Gáis and Dublin Gas.  As it appears to be a continuing situation what is to prevent a creditor having this company put into receivership or liquidation? What is there to prevent any smart speculator from picking up this company on the cheap?  One might then ask who will be the losers?  I am sure there are people in competitive areas of energy who might be only too delighted to see the whole thing collapse, pick up the company for half nothing and make a nice business out of it.  There are plenty of people around this city who would be only too delighted to pick it up on the <Col N="251" /> cheap.  This Government stand aside, perhaps through internal quarrels, points of principle, ideological hang-ups or whatever, while that risk remains. Apparently it will remain after tomorrow evening at the conclusion of this debate because the Government are not prepared to face reality and come to grips with the position.</P>
    <P>What happened the marvellous deal that the present Minister for Finance proclaimed to the country at large was the biggest to have taken place this century? What has happened the confidence and optimism he expressed?  We were told that the Government thoroughly examined the figures, called in experts, economists and so on.  The present Minister for Finance said he was confident that this would be a successful deal.  I could quote many times what he said about this deal.  Indeed, he was reported in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 12 December 1983 as saying that this project would make substantial profits for the taxpayer.  I should like to hear him intervene this evening and tell us what was the basis for those forecasts, explaining how he managed to conduct such a fine deal with financial institutions, not the banks in this case, for their £10 million loan stock.  That is the reality of the position facing Dublin Gas.  The taxpayer is at risk, as is State investment and the 150,000 consumers of gas.  As I have said, no existing supply agreements would exist on the day a receiver or liquidator was appointed.  What are the 150,000 captive customers supposed to do in those circumstances?</P>
    <P>That is why we have tabled this motion calling on the Government to make arrangements for Bord Gáis to step in, removing the risks involved to a large State investment, to consumers and taxpayers. I see it as the only mechanism by which control can be brought about.  I had examined the possibility of the appointment of an administrator.  However, the legislation passed in this House for the appointment of an administrator in the last two years would not apply to these circumstances because this is not <Col N="252" /> part of the insurance industry.  That legislation was introduced for a specific purpose. Neither am I aware of any other legislation which would provide for the appointment of an administrator.  If there is I should be glad to hear of it from the Minister.  The only means available to the Government is to use Bord Gáis, asking them to step in, take over control, removing the risks involved, holding the reins on an interim basis.</P>
    <P>That is not to say I would be totally happy with Bord Gáis or anything like it. Indeed, how could anybody stand up and say he was happy with the operations of Bord Gáis, especially when one views three-and-a-half years of inactivity with regard to another spur on the Cork to Dublin gas pipeline?  Yet they employ 160 to 170 people.  When one examines the number of customers and invoices that have to be sent out one wonders is another State empire being built.  I have no ideological hang-ups about who runs an enterprise as long as it is run efficiently. But I am always wary where a natural resource is being handled by a State company, with that number of employees &mdash; in my opinion not justified &mdash; because had they been active over the last three-and-a-half years then Limerick, Clonmel, Waterford, Kilkenny, Dundalk and Drogheda would have got gas.  Perhaps the accusing finger should not be pointed solely at Bord Gáis.  Perhaps they have been hindered by Government policy, by the indecision or ideological hang-ups existing between the Government parties.  There is a responsibility on this House to remove the grave risks obtaining in Dublin Gas.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will respond to all the questions I have put to him this evening.  Indeed, the Government amendment can be described only as &ldquo;Coalition sellotape&rdquo;.  That is all it is, keeping them together for another while while they dilly dally, cannot reach agreement or whatever.  The Government amendment says:</P>
    <P>Notes that the Government intends to bring to a conclusion as soon as <Col N="253" /> possible its consideration of the problems facing the Dublin Gas Company</P>
    <P>How does the Minister expect anybody to believe that, when the crisis has existed for so long, when everybody knew what the realities were, where Dublin Gas was heading?  Perhaps that is the way the Minister wanted the company to head.  If so, I should like to hear it from him this evening.  Whatever the reasons, they are in crisis and something must be done about it.  The Government amendment continues:</P>
    <P>... with a view to finding a solution for these problems, including the alternative of a State takeover of the Company if this is deemed to be the most appropriate means; and that the Government's objective is to protect the substantial State investment and interests in the Company and to ensure the future supply of natural gas to the Dublin area at reasonable prices.</P>
    <P>In the absence of the Government knowing where they are going how can they prevent all the risks I have enumerated here this evening?  What I have said could happen tomorrow, the day after or before the end of the week.</P>
    <P>Surely it is time the Government made up their minds in relation to it.  If it is a fact that the whole crisis has been brought about by the argument on a reduction in the price of natural gas, let us hear it and examine it here.  If the problem is deeper and more structured, we want to know it and to consider it.  We want to know what protection we can afford.  However, in the absence of proper data it is difficult for anyone here to make a rational judgment.</P>
    <P>We are into a whole new energy era in the world because of the collapse of oil prices.  I can understand the Department of Finance, which probably have their finger in this pie as well, trying to encourage the Minister for Energy to keep the price of natural gas up so that the Department of Finance can have the revenue they expected for the remainder of this year.  It is nice thought, but it will <Col N="254" /> not work because at the end of the day whoever sells natural gas in Ireland and in the Dublin area, whether it is private enterprise or State enterprise, cannot sell it if it is not related to oil prices.  That was the way the thing was set up in the first instance.</P>
    <P>Look at the situation in which that has placed Dublin Gas.  Apparently, An Bord Gáis and the Government agreed that Dublin Gas would take on large industrial consumers in the city, Guinness being one.  The contract between Dublin Gas and Guinness for a supply of natural gas is related to oil prices.  Does anybody here reasonably expect Guinness to continue to buy natural gas at high prices when they can switch back to what they were using before they were converted? It is not on in the world of today.  Do the Government seriously expect Dublin Gas to continue to supply gas at a low price to Guinness and suffer a loss, destroying the viability of the company in which there is such a large investment?  I cannot understand the kind of economic analyses being done.  It would be nice for the Government to sit back and say they will continue to get large amounts of revenue out of energy, gas, out of tax on the ESB, on diesel oil and all the rest of it, at a time when world oil prices are now lower than they were in 1973.</P>
    <P>Ireland paid dearly because of the two oil crises which destroyed our economy as well as many other western economies. We paid dearly when oil prices were on the way up.  When are we to get the benefit on the way down?  The Government must face the reality, and it is a bitter pill for any Government to swallow when they have to say they will have to do with less revenue.  But they are being compensated for it in many other ways. We have seen the drop in the US dollar <i>vis-á-vis</i> the púnt.  How much money is that saving the Government in the service of the national debt?  With fluctuating world currencies, what is the saving to the Government?  This economy cannot reap the benefit of low oil prices that bring with them lower inflation until the Government make up their minds that the benefits that flow from the crash in <Col N="255" /> oil prices will be left to sift through the economy in all aspects.  That does not stop with industry or commerce.  It goes down to the housewife.  It was an insult to Irish housewives to be offered a paltry reduction in ESB prices next September. We all recall ESB bills in the seventies and eighties, all the surcharges.  The ESB were very quick about putting on the surcharges, but when their cost structure collapses we are told we will have to wait until September for a derisory reduction of 4 per cent or 5 per cent.</P>
    <P>The world is being changed by the energy position and it will change this country as well if the Government allow it to happen.  This may well be part of the crux of the problem afflicting Dublin Gas.  Everybody seems to be getting paid at the moment except the taxpayers. There are great returns there for the national institutions, the banks are getting their money, but Bord Gáis are getting no money and the Revenue Commissioners have to go to court to try to retrieve theirs.  We seem to be totally bereft of ideas for the future as far as the Government are concerned.</P>
    <P>The amendment does not mean anything except that it probably reflects the Cabinet meeting today which, I understand, had to be postponed until 4.30 p.m.  Perhaps it will go on later tonight. That is no more than biding time, refusing to face up to the difficult decisions that have to be made.</P>
    <P>I asked earlier how much of this financial deal is in place.  The deal was for a total of £164 million, loans of £60 million from a consortium of banks and £10 million from other institutions and insurance companies, and £10 million in loan stock. I know that is in place &mdash; £40 million of the £60 million is right.  I do not know what is in place from the point of view of the Government.  Have Dublin Gas put in their total of £17 million of loans?  Have the rebates of £40 million been passed on and has the subsidy of £27 million been passed on?  Has the credit of £10 million been passed on as well?  How much of that money has been put in place?  It is a sizeable amount.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="256" /> The Government cannot put the taxpayers at risk for money which could be upset in the High Court at any time.  The people will charge them with that because they will always remember how they were treated by the Government in this case. They must have an assurance that natural gas will be kept on stream.  What has happened in regard to the Dublin Gas conversion programme to natural gas which I understand had been completed to the level of 80 per cent?  Will the Government recommend that the conversion programme be stopped?</P>
    <P>I issue a warning to the Minister that if this programme is stopped it will cost millions of pounds to start up again.  How far has that programme gone?  How much of an analysis has the Minister done and would he mind giving us the benefit of the analysis so that the people, the taxpayers, can pass a value judgment?  Is it true that early in January An Bord Gáis, having analysed all the presentations made to them by the banks and the companies concerned, accepted that a new price structure had to be arrived at?  If that is true, this is now 8 April and why the delay?  Do the Government not accept Bord Gáis's assessment of the critical situation?  Why have the Government allowed it to drag on for so long?  Even in February a series of meetings and representations took place, with the same negative result and the same happened in March.  It was not until the Revenue Commissioners moved with their motion for judgement against the company that people began to take the matter seriously.</P>
    <P>There is another serious matter to which I wish to refer the Minister, which is, why have not the Revenue Commissioners proceeded to recover their £2 million approximately from Dublin Gas?  We all know the very short time it takes the Revenue Commissioners to proceed, having got a judgement in the courts.  I want the Minister to confirm that neither he, nor the Minister for Finance, nor any Member of the Government, directly or indirectly, got on to the Revenue Commissioners and asked them to stay judgment, not to proceed.  Is it true that this <Col N="257" /> Government, by whatever means, stopped the Revenue Commissioners from taking the only course open to them on behalf of the taxpayers to recover the taxes due?  Is it not scandalous, if that is the position, about the number of small companies who have been put out of business over-night by the Revenue Commissioners? When it is as a result of Government ineptitude and indecision, the Government step in to protect their skin and the Revenue Commissioners stand off.  How long more will they stand off?  It is a reality of the commercial world of today that, as soon as anyone moves for a judgement against a company, that brings in all the wolves.</P>
    <P>Has comfort been given to many others to stay out?  What is the position in relation to the letter of comfort given to the banks that if things should go wrong there would be an immediate get together and re-adjustment of the price structure?  Has that taken place?  We were told that a hardship clause was included in the agreement which gave the banks that opportunity to ask the Minister to come back to the table, with Bord Gáis, to renegotiate and restructure.  Is that what is going on at the moment?  Will there be a price restructuring?  If that is to be one of the options examined by the Minister and the Government, we want to know the exact position in relation to the whole programme.  Has it been a success or failure up to now?  Has 80 per cent of the conversion programme been completed or not?</P>
    <P>Have the management been worthy of the great confidence and optimism expressed by the then Minister, Deputy John Bruton, when announcing to the country at large that this was a marvellous deal?  If they have not, what action do the Minister and the Government propose to take if they are travelling along the road of restructuring the price, in order not to be in the same situation in six months' or 12 months' time?</P>
    <P>It was an unusual feature of this agreement that the best brains in the country and economists from outside were brought around the Cabinet table to <Col N="258" /> explain matters.  Everybody was supposed to be behind this deal at the beginning, but perhaps that was not the situation.  Bord Gáis expressed very serious reservations in relation to some aspects.  I was ill at the time but at the first opportunity I pointed out that far from being the marvellous deal it was presented as, there were serious errors of commercial judgment.</P>
    <P>I would like the opportunity to put money into an operation which would guarantee me 20 or 30 per cent return and at the same time if the company turned out to be successful to be able to convert half the investment of £5 million into a 25 per cent ordinary stake in that company.  That was a lovely deal, but what was the necessity for it?  Where did it arrive from, suddenly at the last moment?  Were we looking after old pals? Certainly that deal was not present for a long time during the negotiations.  It would be interesting to see, as I intend to do, what institutions were enabled to participate in an extremely preferential deal done on behalf of the State and the taxpayers.  We got an assurance in this House that everybody was absolutely satisfied, that every "t" had been crossed and every "i" dotted.  We were told that this deal would not fail, that it would be a marvellous success.  As I said, the Minister, Deputy Bruton, on 12 December 1983 was reported in <i>The Irish Times</i> as saying that this project would make substantial profits for the taxpayer. Where did the analysis go wrong, or the operation?</P>
    <P>In a private company, if one is operating with one's own money out in the hard market place and one fails to deliver, there is only one road open.  I want the Minister to tell me tonight what options he is looking at.  I say that the appointment of an administrator is not possible under existing legislation and I ask him to deny that.  If one appointed a liquidator or receiver or if that were forced upon one by any creditor, as they are entitled to do tomorrow morning, the supply contract agreement in existence would cease at that moment and what projection would there be for ongoing <Col N="259" /> supplies of natural gas to 150,000 consumers? That is the reality as I understand it under the existing agreement. Where does the Minister propose to go from here?  I shall have other things to say about the restructuring of Bord Gáis. I am not absolutely happy with their performance. Perhaps it is Government policy that is stopping them.</P>
    <P>I have examined all the aspects and the Government would have to prevent the risk of loss of our total State investment against a speculator forcing a liquidation or receivership, taking the company on the cheap and leaving everybody high and dry and the Government would also have to protect the consumers in the event of anything like that happening. The only immediate option is for Bord Gáis to do this in the interim and let us move on from there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Energy (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after "Dáil Éireann" and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>"Notes that the Government intends to bring to a conclusion as soon as possible its consideration of the problems facing the Dublin Gas Company with a view to finding a solution for these problems, including the alternative of a State take over of the Company if this is deemed to be the most appropriate means; and that the Government's objective is to protect the substantial State investment and interests in the company and to ensure the future supply of natural gas to the Dublin area at reasonable prices"</P>
      <P>The Lord save us from the poacher turned gamekeeper.  I must say I listened to Deputy Reynolds and, in fairness, he outlined some of the complexities of the overall problem in relation to the Dublin Gas Company.  This is a motion which deals with a very serious policy issue.  I must comment on the nerve of Fianna Fáil in putting it down in the first place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I note with interest that Deputy Reynolds has not added his name to the <Col N="260" /> motion.  The absolute hostility and dismissal of a nationalisation or State take-over option when Fianna Fáil were in office is well recorded.  Whatever may be said about the consequences following the decisions taken by this Government in November 1983, the arrangements which ensued, were, from the State's viewpoint, far superior to those contemplated by Deputy Reynolds when he was in office as Minister for Energy in 1982. At that time, as well as presiding over an unseemly row in Dublin Gas, which after all is a public utility, whereby one set of private shareholders were striving to take control from another, the Fianna Fáil Government took a series of major decisions on Dublin Gas during an election campaign and interregnum period in the winter of 1982 which had the effect of undermining the State's negotiating position. The last of these decisions was taken in the morning before the new Government came into office.  The controls envisaged to protect the State's interest were minimal.  It was only when this Government assumed office that the complex detailed issues involved in the Dublin Gas project were examined carefully by Government eventually leading to some improvement in the State's position. This Government inherited the problems of Dublin Gas fashioned and structured in a particular way, and had to deal with the reality as they then found it.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I am totally sceptical about the Opposition's motion here tonight.  A feature of Irish life.  Political conversions may arise from conviction, from a change of circumstances or from passing opportunism. I would need a lot of convincing that Fianna Fáil have changed their views at all on this matter.</P>
    <P>I now turn to deal with the issues relating to the Dublin Gas project.</P>

      <P>The usual good manners from Deputy Burke.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Government decided to build the pipeline to Dublin they did so as part of natural energy policy and <Col N="261" /> strategy.  They did it also because natural gas is a premium fuel and should be used primarily for cooking, home and other heating, for special industrial uses and after that for general industrial use. Dublin is the biggest premium market.</P>
    <P>In Dublin the gas project could have been addressed in a simple way or a more ambitious way.  The simple way would be to reform the methane gas to town gas, put it through the system, do no conversion and little development.  Very cogent technical economic and safety reasons caused this simple approach to be ruled out.</P>
    <P>The more ambitious approach was to convert the city's gas appliances &mdash; a conversion project &mdash; cut out the cost and loss in reforming the natural gas, put a very much increased volume of gas through existing pipes, which would not take that volume of reformed gas, develop and expand the grid &mdash; the Development Programme &mdash; and end up with an eight-fold increase in sales by 1991.</P>
    <P>A financial package was negotiated by the company, part of which would come from the banks, part from the State and part from institutional investors and suppliers credit.  The State agreed that part of its contribution would be in grant from known as conversion rebates, to connect consumers appliances and this was to be put into the company by a rebate off the price per unit of gas.  Details of these amounts and of the financial package for development will be seen later on.</P>
    <P>The prime objective of the Dublin Gas project is to develop and maximise the premium market for natural gas in Ireland. ESB and NET provided the vital initial base-load that permitted the development of the Kinsale Field.  To maximise the long-term returns to the Exchequer and influence the balance of payments most positively, gas had to economically displace high cost imported fuels.  The place to achieve this was in Dublin, where the potential premium market was greatest.</P>
    <P>The key issues faced at the outset were the cost of building a pipeline to Dublin, the cost and feasibility of converting <Col N="262" /> Dublin to natural gas, the potential market for gas in Dublin and the investment needed to capture this market: the vehicle for distributing Kinsale gas in Dublin.</P>
    <P>A pipeline was built from Cork to Dublin in 1982.  The conversion of the city of Dublin is now more than 85 per cent completed.  This work has been a virtual 100 per cent Irish effort, employing the project management techniques and approach adopted on the Cork-Dublin pipeline.  The conversion of the city should be complete by July 1986, on time and some £2 million under budget.</P>
    <P>The potential market for gas in Dublin was separately estimated by various consultants. These estimates were all in broad agreement that some 150-160 million therms of this potential market could be captured by gas within a seven-year period.  Since 1982 Dublin Gas have tripled their sales from just under 20 million therms to over 60 million therms last year.  Currently, Dublin Gas are selling at a level corresponding to 90 million therms in 1986.  Last year some 2,650 new connections were made capturing a further 37 million therms of new business for gas.  The falling prices of competitive fuels and the relatively high price of gas have now largely halted the capture of new business.</P>
    <P>However, the main aim of developing the premium market has not been achieved to the extent necessary nor within the timescale envisaged originally, even though the price of gas to Dublin is adjusted according to a mechanism preferred by Dublin Gas itself.  Dublin Gas as it now stands is not viable.  The company cannot meet all its obligations or service its debt.  It has not met its marketing targets, is not providing its customers with the quality of service they seek, and has not made any significant in-road into reducing its heavy burden of overheads.</P>
    <P>The Dublin Gas project consists of four parts &mdash; conversion, development and marketing programmes and an associated financial package.  The aim of the conversion programme is to convert all gas appliances in the city to burn natural gas, thus cutting out reforming natural gas <Col N="263" /> into town gas and so providing a much greater energy delivery capacity from the existing gas distribution piping.  Natural gas contains twice as much energy per unit volume as town gas.  A total of 150,000 appliances have now been converted. The total expenditure on the programme to date is £47 million.</P>
    <P>The development programme connects up new areas and new customers in old and new areas.  This involves bringing gas to all the suburbs in the greater Dublin area, and to industrial estates around the city.</P>
    <P>The marketing programme is geared to achieving an eight-fold increase in the greater Dublin area.</P>
    <P>The financing of the Dublin Gas project is provided for by a combination of bank loans, State loans and rebates, suppliers credit, and certain loan stocks held by the banks and institutions.  Under the agreed financing plan the banks were to provide £60 million loan facilities which includes £6 million short term standby.  This is not a State guaranteed loan.  A sum of £5 million is provided by volume related loan stock and £5 million by index linked stock.  Most of these stocks are held by the banks and Irish institutions.  No new shareholder funds were advanced.  The State was to provide £17 million in loans.  A £40 million grant in price rebates for the conversion project and a £25.5 million grant in price rebates for the development project were also to be provided by the State.  Of these moneys £5 million is to be repaid in 1991. In addition, a conversion loan budgeted at £11.6 million will be payable.  The repayment of State loans does not commence until bank debt has been reduced to £26 million when subsequent debt repayments will be shared equally between the State and the banks.</P>
    <P>Further assistance was provided in the form of bulk credits which effectively guaranteed a margin to Dublin Gas for sales to current heavy fuel oil consumers and Dublin Gas were allowed to accelerate the conversion and development rebates payable provided the expenditure had taken place and provided that Bord <Col N="264" /> Gáis Éireann received a minimum amount of 17p per therm for gas.  Any amount paid in this form is known as an acelerated rebate.  A State guranteed £10 million is provided as suppliers credits by the Jones Group.</P>
    <P>The base price for gas to Dublin Gas Company was struck at 32p per therm as of 1 July 1982.  This base price was then related by a formula to Rotterdam oil prices and the anticipated mix of premium to non-premium sales.  It was agreed eventually that the oil prices used would be the average of the 12 months prior to each price adjustment date. Prices were adjusted on 1 January and 1 July each year.</P>
    <P>At the start of the contract the base price which was the gross contract price was set at 32p per therm, the conversion rebates at 10p per therm &mdash; 31.25 per cent &mdash; and the development rebate at 4p per therm &mdash; 12.5 per cent.  At that time the ESB paid 17p per therm and it was considered that the Dublin Gas Company should never pay less than that amount for their gas irrespective of whether the gross price went up or down.  Thus a clause was incorporated in the supply contract setting a minimum net price for gas at 17p per therm.  There was an assumption in the base case of a steady growth in the oil price, and a precipitate fall was not foreseen.</P>
    <P>Conversion and development grants are earned by the company by selling the volume of gas projected in the base case each year rebated by a fixed discount per therm until the total amount of grant provided for is drawn-down.  Meanwhile, the company continue to invest very considerable sums on carrying through both programmes and in particular the conversion programme.</P>
    <P>In return for the State's investment which I have outlined, certain rights have been granted to the State including 56 per cent of all distributable profits.  In addition, ultimately under the arrangements envisaged, 50 per cent of excess profits will go to the State by way of an increase in BGE's gas price to Dublin Gas.  I should point out that for this increased price to BGE, the Dublin Gas <Col N="265" /> Company would not be allowed a consequential retail price increase to consumers. The banks and institutional investors put up £10 million.  The State now has 29.9 per cent of the voting rights and has 25.01 per cent of the shares of the company with an entitlement to £20 million in dividends by 1992.  One-third of the directors are State appointees including the chairman for the initial two and a half year period.  Finally, the State has appointed a project co-ordinator in the company to oversee the conversion and development projects.</P>
    <P>This participation achieved by the Government is a substantial improvement on the package negotiated by their Fianna Fáil predecessors.  Under Fianna Fáil, the State would have received only 25 per cent of distributable profits up to 1988 and 50 per cent thereafter.  There was no provision for excess profits.  The State's voting rights were 25.01 per cent and the State would have had to pay to maintain its shares and voting rights in the event of a rights issue.  The State's shareholding and voting rights are now guaranteed without additional investment. The provisions re directors, chairman and project co-ordinator were non-existent.</P>
    <P>The Dublin Gas Company now face very serious problems.  In August 1985 the scheduled financial projection presented by Dublin Gas to the banks indicated an unattractive and uncertain future for the company.  In consequence, the company have not been allowed to draw-down any bank funds since then and a serious cash crisis has arisen.  BGE have not been paid for their gas for many months.  In addition, a large debt is due to the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>These problems have many causes among which is the impact of lower oil prices.  However, there is also a shortfall in the volume of sales and a deterioration in the mix of these sales with fewer premium sales being achieved than targeted.</P>
    <P>The cash problem has arisen because, as a result of lower levels of sales, the cash outlays on conversion by Dublin Gas are running well ahead of what is being earned in rebates by the company.  The <Col N="266" /> amount due to Dublin Gas would take nearly two years to earn by sales performance and so leaves Dublin Gas out of pocket by approximately £16 million of conversion rebates and £3 million of development rebates.  This problem will be further exacerbated by the fall in oil prices which has the effect of reducing the gross contract price and consequently the margin available above the 17p floor for bulk credits and rebates.  In addition, Dublin Gas have continued to spend significant moneys on the development programme.</P>
    <P>As well, competition in the market is increasing due to the rapid fall in the price of oil.  The reduction in the volume of sales has reduced the total margin. Finally, there is the very high element of overhead in the company contributing to the retail price of gas.  Failure to get this overhead trimmed drastically is a major contributory factor to the squeeze on margins.</P>
    <P>From an operational point of view, the conversion programme is on target and within budget.  Seventy-two of the 85 sectors have now been converted.  Since the banks withdrawal, financing of conversion in recent months has been met from the company's cash flow which has been boosted by non-payment of State debt and deferment of other major creditors.</P>
    <P>Support for the Dublin Gas project as agreed by Bord Gáis Éireann, the Department of Energy, Dublin Gas Company and their bankers and as approved by Government in November 1983, was based on a set of financial projections. These projections formed the basis for monitoring the project and were reviewed and updated on a quarterly basis thereafter.</P>
    <P>Serious developments since these projections were drawn up have been the failure by the company to met their original 1984 and 1985 sales targets.  This has delayed profitability and increased bank debt.  In the second half of 1985 oil prices began to fall following the end of the UK miners strike.  The problem was compounded by a weakening dollar; pressure to reduce gas prices mounted.  It was <Col N="267" /> against this background that Dublin Gas prepared their August 1985 review of their projections.  These were not acceptable to the parties involved and led to the banks' refusal to advance any further funds to the company.</P>
    <P>Consultations and discussions followed between Bord Gáis Éireann and Dublin Gas relating to adjusting the escalator and other issues.  However, these did not resolve all the projected difficulties.</P>
    <P>Subsequent projections run by Dublin Gas introduced further major new problems arising from significant revisions to forecast trends in external economic factors. A reduction by DGC in gas prices to remain competitive and meet sales targets and the company's ambition to maintain full conversion, development and other expenditures in accordance with the original programme further exacerbated the problem.</P>
    <P>Further meetings and discussions took place between BGE, officials of my Department and Dublin Gas with a view to resolving this matter.  Dublin Gas did not consider that any of the proposals made were adequate to meet their situation.</P>
    <P>Under the supply contract with BGE, Dublin Gas are entitled to claim hardship on the grounds that provisions of the agreement are causing hardship as a result of external factors outside the company's control.  In mid-December last Dublin Gas claimed that such hardship existed.  The agreement provides that the matter should be referred to BGE in the first instance and this was done.  No agreement could be reached between the parties.  In accordance with the contract provisions the matter was then referred to me in February of this year.</P>
    <P>Since that time all aspects of the complex situation have been examined in detail by my Department.  The matter will be discussed with my Cabinet colleagues and I am confident that a decision on the future of the company will be reached shortly.</P>
    <P>The Government will be reviewing all aspects of the project.  Conditions in <Col N="268" /> energy markets have altered dramatically over the last few months, and it is necessary to take account of these changes, as well as the structure and performance of the Dublin Gas Company.  Public funds have been and are being used on a large scale in the conversion and development programme.  It is necessary to ensure that the moneys are well spent, that the project is managed efficiently and that whatever changes are necessary are effectively carried through.  It is most important to take whatever measures are required to ensure that gas supplies continue to flow to consumers and that reasonable prices are charged.  Any ultimate rewards in a successful company must be related to the risks which the different parties have taken and the House will be well aware that it is my view that the State has taken virtually all of the risk to date.</P>
    <P>In this context the issue of the appropriate ownership structure for the company is of major relevance and the amendment proposed includes reference to the alternative of a State take-over of the company.  My view and the views of the Labour Party on issues related to natural gas distribution have been made clear in the past, for example in the case of Cork, Limerick and Clonmel, in the last two years.</P>
    <P>They are no different in the present case, especially in view of the circumstances prevailing.  As I have said I expect to be in a position this week, I hope, to bring forward a conclusion that will best protect the investment and interests of the people of this country and the consumers of natural gas in Dublin.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a depressing saga, one that has burst on us in recent weeks.  The horrific new cash crisis in Dublin Gas has taken all of us by surprise. Clearly, there are three options which the State and the people involved may consider.  First, there is the option of mounting a rescue package involving further bank or shareholder finance; the second option is to liquidate the company and close it down and the third option &mdash; the one being referred to in the motion <Col N="269" /> and in the amendment &mdash; is for Bord Gáis Éireann to take over Dublin Gas.</P>
      <P>We must consider the issue coldly. There are 1,200 full time jobs in Dublin Gas while there are between 125,000 and 150,000 consumers in the Dublin area. The supply of natural gas is spreading throughout the suburbs with the conversion programme going ahead.  It is clear that the State cannot continue throwing money at the company in an attempt to resolve the crisis in which they find themselves.  There seem to be various contradictory claims both from the company and from other sources.</P>
      <P>There are four major forces in this whole saga.  These are Dublin Gas; BGE, who have their own interests; the banks, who have a substantial investment in this area; and of course the Department of Energy.  About two years ago these four interests put together a financial package that amounted to approximately £173 million, depending on how one considers some of the figures.  That package was designed to give Dublin Gas what was referred to at the time as a new beginning. The idea was that the investment would have the effect of leaving behind the industrial relations nightmare in the company as well as an inefficient billing system, poor management and the apparent nil prospects of the company at the time.  The idea was to start a new company with cash from the banks and to launch forth on a new dawn of cheap natural gas involving a whole easy reach of new customers spread throughout the city and the county of Dublin.  We know now that it all went badly wrong and less than two years later there is a cash crisis in the company.  There continues to be a ridiculously inefficient billing system and some questionable management structures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The seeds of the crisis go back to April 1985 when the New Dublin Gas had talks with BGE about the price of gas from the board.  Dublin Gas demanded then that Bord Gáis restate the price of natural gas and relate it to oil prices.  It must be known widely that BGE pay Marathon an oil-related price so the request in that regard was nothing new.  As the Minister <Col N="270" /> must know now to his dismay, by September 1985 the new Dublin Gas financial targets had gone badly wrong.  This resulted in the banks freezing any advances above the figure of £60 million which had been agreed at the time.  If the deal was done at that time with the consortium of banks, did everyone not know that the oil price situation was reasonably high? If there were difficulties when oil and energy prices generally were at an all time high, there would not be much chance of success when they were low.  Dublin Gas would claim that their margins came under pressure as a result of the drop in oil prices, but the point I am making is relevant.  Bord Gáis were too slow in reducing the price of gas.  Therefore, New Dublin Gas would claim that they had to live off their creditors.  They ran up bills with the Revenue Commissioners, Bord Gáis Éireann and other creditors.  Dublin Gas claim that the profit squeeze led to a cash crisis.  If that is the case and if the projections were done at that time of high prices, why did they turn out to be wrong when the prices changed?  That is a central question which has not been answered properly by the Tánaiste.  New Dublin Gas have been staving off creditors for many months.  The Revenue Commissioners have already applied for a judgement in regard to the £2 million due to them.  The dramatic fall in oil prices quite clearly worried Dublin Gas. They were right to be worried about whether or not the consumers would stay with them, especially those consumers who had the dual oil-gas facilities.  They were also worried about the possibility of large customers &mdash; for example, Guinness &mdash; renegotiating the price of gas.</P>
    <P>Bord Gáis, on the other hand, make almost contradictory claims.  They claim that they responded quickly to the falling oil prices.  They say that price adjustments are first of all agreed with the customer at the customer's discretion according to a timetable and that this was done with New Dublin Gas.  They say that these adjustments take place every six months and that this also happened in the case of New Dublin Gas.  They point <Col N="271" /> out that an adjustment took place in January 1976 and that there was another adjustment in August 1976.  They claim, with some justification, that they acted as unofficial bankers to New Dublin Gas in what they would call a generous agreement, with Bord Gáis Éireann providing loan facilities of some £17 million spread over two moieties.  That agreement involved rolled up interest.  It was regarded at the time as a soft loan.  Added to that was a further £6 million of additional stand-by finance.</P>
    <P>Bord Gáis claim that all this was underpinned by generous price agreement and a supply of natural gas.  This allowed for further rebates of £42 million to New Dublin Gas.  Conversion costs over and above that figure were to be funded by a conversion loan, also to be provided by Bord Gáis Éireann.  Overall Bord Gáis would claim that that was not a particularly bad financial structuring.  The Dublin Gas Company had also drawn down some £40 million of the £60 million line of credit before the banks decided that enough was enough.  With all that assistance and support from Bord Gáis, the company have not been able to meet their financial projections, to break even or to reach the targets which they put before the country some time ago.  This question remains: why?  It has not been answered properly.  The area of manning, which is an old traditional difficulty, should be looked at.</P>
    <P>How did the Minister for Energy and the Department of Energy allow this situation to develop?  Why did the Minister for Energy back a reasonably unwilling Bord Gáis Éireann into a difficult relationship with New Dublin Gas?  Why, after all the Bord Gáis Éireann assistance, are New Dublin Gas still floundering? This is not a sudden crisis.  It is not in its causes, as has been portrayed, totally related to the oil situation.  It is more a financial restructuring difficulty. It was clear as far back as last January that this company were heading for major financial difficulties.  I wonder why no action was taken at that time to deal with it.  This company have over £130 million <Col N="272" /> of taxpayers' money.  If one were to put a valuation of it on the Stock Exchange at the time of that investment, one would have been talking about £1 million to £1.5 million.  There are three years of losses totalling approximately £20 million.</P>
    <P>In proposing this motion that Bord Gáis Éireann would take over Dublin Gas we are only taking account of the real situation as it is on the ground.  The State have a substantial equity stake in the company, substantial profit rights if that ever occurred and they are virtually financing the conversion programme. Overall they are intrinsically and largely involved in financing New Dublin Gas. All we are asking is that this Government should realise the situation as it is, which is that the State are so exposed and have so much taxpayers' money in New Dublin Gas, that it would be as well for Bord Gáis Éireann on behalf of the State to administer that company.  As Deputy Reynolds pointed out &mdash; and this is a real worry &mdash; if the Revenue Commissioners can get their hands on a judgement, any creditor in that company can go into the court in the next few days or weeks, get that judgment and bring that company down to their knees.  In those circumstances the motion before us is a sensible one and is not based on any ideological decision or hang-up.  It is based on a practical approach to much State investment and much taxpayer's money involved in the company already.</P>
    <P>I regret that we have got to this stage. It should never have arisen.  It is a second best solution.  In a properly run company with proper accountability and given the demand on our gas resources, there is no reason why we should not have had an efficient, capable and well-run company. I do not see any reason why, if the State must now move in as is proposed, we cannot have an efficient, capable and competently run company.  This is an indictment, first of all, of the original deal that was put together, of the Department of Energy and the Minister for Energy's management of the situation, and it is a second best approach to a very difficult problem.</P>
    <P>On this side of the House we do not <Col N="273" /> support the idea of the State rushing in to prop up any company that gets into difficulty.  Given the size of the taxpayers' investment to date, given the need to eliminate uncertainty which would shake industry, disrupt households and undermine confidence, given the need to protect a reasonably committed workforce and given the situation that exists in regard to the finances of that company, regrettably there seems to be only one solution to prevent a substantial financial scandal.  That is to adopt this resolution which Fianna Fáil put before the House. This situation has been boiling up for many months.  It is a pity that it has taken the Minister and the Department of Energy so long to recognise this situation and to be forced onto the floor of the House tonight to do something about it. We need an immediate and thorough investigation of the company by the Department of Energy and a report to this House as soon as possible.  We need an immediate moving in by Bord Gáis Éireann to take control of that company at least in the immediate future in order to stabilise the situation and to preserve employment and the investment of the taxpayer.  We need a coherent energy programme and policy from the Minister for Energy involving the use of our oil and gas and the various interrelationships between our sources of energy.  Most of all, we need proper and early accountability by companies in which the State has an investment.  I wonder have we learned anything from the past in that regard?</P>
    <P>I would like to pose a number of questions to the Minister for Energy and, indeed, to the Government.  Is the Minister aware and has he been aware for some time that this company has been operating in an untenable financial position for over five to six months and what action did he take during that period? Was he aware that a company in which the state had a substantial investment was operating on the basis of a hand to mouth cash flow arrangement, where debts due to the Revenue Commissioners and to Bord Gáis Éireann came to some £15 million?  Was he aware that was the situation for the past few months and what <Col N="274" /> did he and his Department do about it in that time?  Was he particularly aware of the sums due to the Revenue Commissioners by Dublin Gas?  Was that brought to his attention and what did he do about it at that time?</P>
    <P>I would like to pose this other question, not just to the Minister but to the Government, who have the ultimate responsibility for the management of the nation's affairs.  Can this Government explain to us why no lessons appear to have been learned from the Irish Shipping debacle, particularly in regard to accountability and proper procedures. Considering what happened with Irish Shipping Limited, PMPA and the ICI, why does it take a crisis for this Government to do something about the situation? Why must we drag the Government into the House to explain what everybody in the street knows about &mdash; the impending financial situations in a number of these companies?  I would like to ask that that question be given very serious consideration.  If we look back on the record of this House for the past 12 months it seems to have had a crisis in each case &mdash; Irish Shipping Limited, PMPA and ICI and the present situation with Dublin Gas &mdash; as the Government waited until we were facing a financial collapse and we had a crisis on our hands before they took any action.</P>
    <P>I will have to say tonight: are there any more companies out there in similar difficulties?  Will we have to wait until Fianna Fáil put down another motion to drag some member of the Government into this House to explain what is going on in another company, or will you go to your desks and responsibilities and see what difficulties are looming up, because I suspect there are many more out there if this one is on our desk tonight?  Why does it take a crisis for this Government to take any action?  Why does it not act in time, because this situation was known six, 12 and perhaps even 18 months ago? Why did it not act then instead of having been forced to take some action in the face of a motion from Fianna Fáil in this House tonight?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="275" /> I would also have to put the point that I do not honestly believe that this Government have properly thought out their options in regard to this energy situation. The absence of a coherent strategy for dealing with this crisis is reflected in the amendment which is before us tonight in that it allows the Department which have singularly failed to manage their own affairs and the energy affairs of this country to implement any solution that it so decides on, including a State take-over. By adopting this amendment tonight are we to entrust to that Department and the Minister, who, as I said, have singularly failed to manage the energy policy of this country, the decision-making power to sort out the great difficulties in Dublin Gas?  We should be talking about a situation where we should be discussing in this House a motion of no confidence in that Minister and Department, which have failed to get our oil programme off the ground &mdash; let me hasten to add that I do not have any oil shares &mdash; and who have contributed to the present crisis by prolonging the negotiations on gas prices since last August and before that time.  The Government are now asking us tonight in an amendment to this motion, with that history from that Department, to let the Minister consider the matter further and make whatever decision he thinks is possible or is in the right interests of the State.  I would say that this House would have to refuse the Minister that request in the amendment because of the fact that his Department have singularly failed to manage the energy requirements and policy of this country going back over many months.  We have been long promised an energy policy on a number of occasions in this House, a thought-out, coherent, written energy policy, throwing together the various resources available to the State.  We have been promised that energy policy for many months and there is still no sign of it.</P>

      <P>In my capacity on the all-party Joint Committee on State-sponsored Bodies we have been looking at the ESB and Bord Gáis and one thing comes clear time and time again in our discussions with the boards of those companies &mdash; this very afternoon we met with the board of the ESB when they again agreed and pointed out that there was a need for a written, coherent thought-out energy policy from the Government.  I would suggest that, if we had had that policy many months ago, and indeed some years ago when the Government came first to office, we would not be facing this difficulty in Dublin Gas, the mess we have in regard to the oil off our shores and the slowdown in negotiations in regard to the price of gas.  Overall, we would have had a situation in which our gas and oil resources would be better managed for the benefit of the people of this State.</P>
      <P>I should point out also in regard to Dublin Gas that the losses in 1983 came to £7.8 million, in 1984 they were almost £8 million and for the half year period in 1985 they were £2.4 million or so.  It is quite clear that the Department of Energy, over the past 12 months particularly, have been aware of the serious crisis in Dublin Gas.  It is also clear that the Department of Energy did little or nothing about that crisis throughout that period and no effort was put into designing and putting forward an energy policy.</P>

The House will further agree that officers based at Portlaoise prison, because of the nature of that prison, are at even greater risk than their colleagues in other institutions.  A tragic example of that risk was very sadly demonstrated two years ago by the shooting of a senior prison officer from Portlaoise prison in our capital city.  After a lot of agony and suffering that prison officer died.</P>
    <P>It is inevitable that Portlaoise prison officers are extremely conscious of their vulnerability in this very vital area of State security.  Their concern for the security and safety of their wives and families is even more understandable, because they too live in fear of reprisals from offenders and their associates and in the past there was evidence of such threats being made.</P>
    <P>What happened in Portlaoise in relation to the publication of the book of evidence represents an unprecedented breach of security which demands a full investigation with appropriate action being taken to ensure that never again will there be a repeat of such a despicable occurrence.  Apart from the effects of this incident on prison officers there is growing public disquiet that such an incident could happen.  It is even more disturbing to read in the national newspapers the conflicting views of people in two vital areas of national security as to who is to blame for this security breach.</P>
    <P>This is an intolerable situation and brings to a head weaknesses and breaches in the system which have been emerging with increasing frequency over the past couple of years.  Because of the conditions laid down about what I can say in this debate, I am aware that I cannot go in detail into some of these very vital areas, much as I would like to do.  I respect the Chair's ruling and I am grateful for the opportunity of raising the main problem this evening.</P>
    <P>Could any Member of this House, even in his wildest dreams, have envisaged a situation where the names, home <Col N="278" /> addresses and other personal details of no fewer than 30 officers at Portlaoise prison would be passed to the prisoners for whom they had responsibility?  If one read of such an incident in a wild west book it would make good reading but that it could happen in our top security prison is a staggering thought.  As a direct result of this incident the State provided an intelligence brief for these people which they could never have hoped to get through their own channels or investigations. The names, home addresses, the location of the wives and children of prison officers and other details in relation to the performance of these prison officers are now in the hands of those who should not have access to such vital information.  Because of my responsibility as a public representative I will restrain myself from going into further detail, but the Minister knows exactly what I mean when I say there is information on file and in the book of evidence dealing with the performance of prison officers which makes them very vulnerable.</P>
    <P>I had the pleasure of being with the Minister last week for the opening of a new prison officers' training complex in Portlaoise.  For the first time in his official capacity as Minister for Justice, Deputy Dukes had an opportunity of meeting senior personnel and representatives of the Prison Officers' Association.  I hope that very cordial meeting in Portlaoise will be the beginning of the end of the cold war that has existed for far too long between the prison officers and the Department and the Minister.  I appeal to the Minister to resume normal dialogue with these officers as quickly as possible because it is in the national interest that this should be done.</P>
    <P>It is pathetic to see people in two vital areas of State security publicly disagreeing as who is to blame for this incident.  I am not surprised about this because there can be no doubt that this is embarrassing not only for those concerned but also for the Minister and for Members of this House.  I am not advocating a witch hunt and neither, I hope, am I being sensational in what I am saying here tonight.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="279" /> The Minister owes it to the House to put the record straight and to state what action he proposes taking to prevent a recurrence of a similar incident.  What has happened has happened and he is now left with the problem of ensuring the safety and security of the officers affected by this incident and of their wives and their children.</P>
    <P>We read reports in the newspapers that the office of the DPP &mdash; I am not going to disobey your wishes in any way, Sir &mdash; is inadequately staffed to deal with the growing volume of work which must be dealt with in that office.</P>

      <P>If that is so &mdash; it is not the first time that we have heard and read reports in relation to inadequate staffing within the office of the DPP &mdash; the Minister and the Government must take the blame.  I expect the Minister to deal with the situation and to tell the House whether the office of the DPP is inadequately staffed, whether he has not the staff to enable him to deal with the very urgent matters that office has to deal with.  If we are talking about law and order, surely it must be obvious to the Minister and to every Member of this House that we must make vital, essential staff available to the key areas of operation, and one of the key areas of operation has to be the office of the DPP.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know from my local experience of the prison in Protlaoise that prison duty has created a strain and a great demand on Garda resources in the area.  The presence of a top security prison in Portlaoise has affected overall community policing in the two counties of Laois and Offaly. The gardaí based at Portlaoise prison and providing support staff for prison officers are doing a very demanding and difficult job and they too deserve to have this matter clarified once and for all, because speculation is rife in relation to who is to blame, who is responsible and how such <Col N="280" /> an event could happen.  I say to the Minister that much anxiety exists to ensure that it cannot happen again.</P>
    <P>I have written down a few relevant questions which arise more or less from what I have said and I hope that the Minister will have sufficient time to reply to them.  This incident relates to the attempted breakout from Portlaoise prison and the investigation which followed that event.  My first question to the Minister relates to the Garda authorities. They carried out an investigation into the escape at Portlaoise on 24 November. Did the Garda carry out a separate investigation into the security clearance of prison staff in the prison?  Much of what has happened could very well hinge around the answer to that question.  If the Garda carried out a separate investigation, why was the information taken from prison staff sent to the DPP?  The prison officers are entitled to know why it was necessary that this very confidential information which they gave in wholehearted co-operation with the Garda to help them to complete their files be sent to the DPP.  If the Garda did not carry out a separate investigation, why were the questions asked about the prison officers in the first instance?  Those questions related to their personal lives and that of their families.</P>
    <P>A further question is whether the Garda authorities were aware that such detailed information about the prison staff was included in the book of evidence. Again this question is very relevant to the debate here tonight.  Was it not known or considered by either the Garda authorities or the DPP that such detailed information on prison staff would place their lives and those of their families at risk from subversive attacks? It should have been known to anybody carrying out an investigation in this very sensitive area that the release and disclosure of that information and making it publicly available would put these men and their wives and families at serious risk.  The Minister owes it to the House to let us know who is responsible for having that information, which was extracted confidentially in the first <Col N="281" /> instance from prison officers with a great degree of co-operation on their part, included in the book of evidence.  Those officers were more than willing to assist and facilitate the Garda in their inquiries.</P>
    <P>Is the Minister satisfied that one State agency can take action by placing the safety of other State employees and their families in danger?  That is what has happened in this instance.  I hope the Minister will make some comment on that.</P>
    <P>As a result of this affair, what is the cost of the additional security now being provided to protect prison staff in the form of gardaí who have to remain at the prison 24 hours a day to provide security for some of these prison officers?  Weigh that additional cost against the cost of providing the staff needed in the office of the DPP which would result in ensuring that this kind of incident could not occur. I think we have our priorities mixed up in relation to the whole affair.</P>
    <P>Finally, I say to the Minister that morale at present in the prison service is extremely low.  Prison officers are worried and concerned.  The Minister must restore that morale.  He is capable of doing that.  I make a final appeal to him to do it rapidly because this is a vital area of national security.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Dukes) Alan Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Dukes)</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say to the House and to Deputy Hyland that I am extremely concerned about the situation that has emerged and to which he has referred.  I was extremely concerned about it the first moment it was brought to my attention, for many of the reasons Deputy Hyland has set out here tonight.  Prison officers have to carry out a job which carries a certain element of risk and, as Deputy Hyland points out, an additional element of risk is involved for prison officers serving in Portlaoise. It is part of the job.  It is quite right to be concerned about anything that adds unnecessarily to that risk.  I am most concerned that in this situation we are faced with circumstances which add, as it turns out, unnecessarily to that risk.  It is a matter which requires very careful scrutiny and evaluation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Coming first to the position of the <Col N="282" /> prison officers themselves.  I can fully understand their concerns in this situation. I want to take issue with Deputy Hyland over one point he made.  It may be because the Deputy got a little bit carried away with his oratory.  I want to make it very clear that we do not have a situation here, as Deputy Hyland alleges, where there have been increasingly frequent breaches of security in recent years.  That is not the situation we are facing here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>To put the record straight, I did not say that nor did I imply it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope that I misheard Deputy Hyland there, but I have written down as near as I can the words he actually used.  I want to make it clear that that is not the situation we are facing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>For the record, I was referring to the operations of the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions where in the past books of evidence have been published late.  I said it all in the context of the non-availability of staff in the office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is getting contentious about that.  But I do want to make it clear, not for the purpose of having a go at Deputy Hyland, that we are not facing a situation where there have been increasingly frequent breaches of security.  I want that to be clear.  What we have is a very real concern with the security of prison officers themselves.  A number of steps have been taken in the past in response to both the general situation of their job and in response to specific incidents.  Deputy Hyland mentioned one, the absolutely abhorrent shooting of a prison officer in Dublin. Another was an occasion when threats were made by a particular prisoners revenge group against prison officers.  A third was the situation following the attempted breakout from Portlaoise last November.  On each of those occasions the arrangements for the security of prison officers were further reviewed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="283" /> Each of these occasions was a very different kind of occasion.  There are a variety of situations that do not constitute any kind of pattern of breaches.  They are different situations.  But after each one of those incidents a further review was carried out of the security of each prison officer involved.</P>
    <P>To give an example of some of the measures that were taken on those occasions, I will just give some instances following the second last of the incidents I mentioned &mdash; the attempted breakout in 1985.  Following that incident arrangements were made to make available to prison officers interest-free loans so that they could install alarm devices in their homes.  In addition to that the Garda crime prevention staff made themselves available to prison officers so that they could advise them on measures they themselves could take in order to improve their own security.  In this particular case, when it came to light that the situation was as it is &mdash; a fact about which we are all rightly very concerned &mdash; we immediately took steps to ensure that any additional security necessary and feasible was made available to cover the situation of those prison officers.  I am sure that the House will understand that I do not intend to go into those measures because that would vitiate the very measures themselves.  But we have taken steps to improve the security cover for the prison officers involved.  For exactly the same reason that I do not intend to go into the detail of those measures I will not reply to the Deputy's question as to the extra cost of providing those security measures.  I am not going to go into that area at all except to assure Deputy Hyland and the House that we have taken all feasible steps to meet the situation as it has emerged.</P>
    <P>I also want to point out, without venturing into the forbidden territory that Deputy Hyland was so careful to skirt around, that the Director of Public Prosecutions has recently issued a set of very clear and specific guidelines to those who were involved in the preparation of books of evidence &mdash; people over whom I have <Col N="284" /> no control &mdash; to be followed in preparation of books of evidence and which, among other things, will ensure that this kind of incident will not happen again.</P>
    <P>I would like to correct one or two other impressions that might have been gained from remarks that Deputy Hyland made. The people who prepare books of evidence are not people who are involved in State security.  I want to get that point on the record.  The questions that Deputy Hyland raised are mostly concerned with the preparation of the books of evidence, and since it is not a matter over which I have direct control I do not intend to go into that area.  It will suffice to say that the instructions to which I have just referred were issued and should prevent a recurrence of this situation.  I do not accept any suggestion that there is a cold war going on between the prison officers and the Minister for Justice.  I am not engaged in a cold war with anyone.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Nor has there been anything like a cold war for quite some time. References to industrial relations in the prison service in those kind of terms are immoderate, to say the least.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister knows well what I am talking about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>They are most unhelpful, as are repeated assertions that morale is low.  Those of us in this House who deal with these problems, whether as Members of this House <i>simpliciter</i> or as office holders in Government, have an obligation to make sure that the language we use does not make progress any more difficult and does not contribute to undesirable situations coming about.  I do not accept either that it is proper to say that speculation is rife.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to conclude by saying that I fully appreciate the difficulties and the fears of the people involved in this situation who, as Deputy Hyland has pointed out, co-operated in the investigation of a very serious matter and who showed by their co-operation in that investigation that <Col N="285" /> they have a very high level of commitment to the job that they are called upon to do.  I am concerned to ensure that the protection that we can give those people and their families, following on the exercise of their own responsibilities, will be adequate and will match up to the requirements of the situation.  I can <Col N="286" /> assure the House that I will do anything that it is within my compass to do just that: to protect the people concerned and to ensure that there is not a recurrence of this kind of situation.</P>

In so far as State forestry is concerned, the plan aims at the establishment of plantations at an annual average rate of 7,500 hectares.  It is also Government policy actively to encourage private planting and to this end my Department undertake a wide range of measures aimed at promoting afforestation as an alternative land use.  These include implementation of two schemes which provide generous grants for planting; provision of a free technical advisory service; promotional work aimed at encouraging increased investment in forestry; liaison with farming organisations; planting demonstrations and on-going publicity through illustrated talks by Department staff, advertisements and articles in the media and participation in other agricultural shows.</P>

In my discussions with the Speaker of the House of Representatives and with Senator Kennedy and other members of both Houses of the United States Congress, I expressed my <Col N="46" /> Government's appreciation of the generous terms of the Bill adopted by the House on 11 March authorising, for these purposes, a direct cash contribution of $250 million over five years, and other assistance, to the international fund to be established under the Anglo-Irish Agreement. An identical Bill, introduced by Senator Kennedy, is now before the Senate.  The aid package is, therefore, still subject to the legislative process in the United States and its final shape and content remain to be determined.  The Bill passed by the House of Representatives and now before the Senate has no reference to the British-US Supplementary Extradition Treaty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. P. Barry)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the Secretary-General of the United Nations has been given the responsibility by the Security Council for the day-to-day administration of the force and the Secretary-General, in turn, has appointed a force commander who has responsibility for the operational deployment of the force.  I am in regular contact with the Secretary-General, either personally or through official channels, in connection with UNIFIL, and I am confident that the Secretary-General is fully aware that the safety of our contingent is of the highest importance to the Government. In addition, I have ensured that all the parties involved in the Lebanon fully understand the great importance we attach to the safety of UN troops.  Overall, I think that these efforts have been reasonably successful but given the extreme volatility of the region, which causes UNIFIL to be there in the first place, it will be understood that absolute security can never be taken for granted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the same time, at the UN and <Col N="53" /> though our diplomatic contacts, we have expressed our strong concerns at all incidents of harassment of, or attack on, our UNIFIL contingent.  We have made it clear that UNIFIL should be allowed to implement its mandate so that it can fully discharge the tasks with which it has been entrusted.</P>
    <P>The Government keep under constant review the safety of Irish troops serving in Lebanon.  Irish troops serving with UNIFIL maintain a high level of security precautions and constant efforts are made to ensure that this level of alertness is kept up.  Safety and security requirements receive a high priority in training undertaken by Defence Forces personnel in preparation for peacekeeping duties.</P>
    <P>The high level of training received by Irish troops serving in Lebanon contributes to their security.  Despite this the Government are concerned at any threat to their physical safety.  UNIFIL is faced with a difficult mission in seeking to maintain peace and stability in the Lebanon and potential dangers do exist.</P>
    <P>The Government view with grave concern the latest incident involving the shooting of an Irish soldier which took place on 23 March.  The shooting of Pte. Kevin Horan appears to have been the responsibility of a Muslim militia group. UNIFIL has experienced only sporadic difficulties with such groups in the past and UN officials do not believe that this latest incident was part of any concerted attempt to begin harassment of UNIFIL. I will, needless to say, be monitoring this situation very closely.  I am happy to report that Private Horan is making a good recovery.</P>

      <P>Since the balance of a new house grant was paid in respect of this house within the past ten years it is necessary for the purpose of determining the applicant's entitlement to a house improvement grant for an extension to establish whether overcrowding exists as, in accordance with the terms of the scheme, a waiting period of only five years applies in such cases. As this requires the carrying out of an inspection by the Department, the issue of a letter of approval would not have been appropriate in the circumstances. The necessary inspection will be arranged as soon as possible.  In addition the above new house grant disqualifies the applicant from being considered for a grant for necessary works to the fabric of the house for which he also applied.  However, he can renew his application for the latter grant and for the grant for an extension (if overcrowding does not exist) when the ten years from payment of the balance of the new house grant has elapsed in September next.</P>

      <P>The question of pollution controls on inshore waters is primarily a matter for the Minister for the Environment and the Minister for Communications.  Under section 4 of the Local Government (Water Pollution) Act, 1977, industrial effluent discharges to inshore waters must be licensed by the relevant local authority.  It is a matter for each local authority to determine the conditions to be attached to such licences and the monitoring arrangements required to ensure that these conditions are being met.  In normal circumstances local authorities consult with my Department and the regional fisheries boards in these matters.</P>

The White Paper also indicated that equivalent measures would be implemented by the Departments directly responsible for local authorities, health boards and non-commercial State-sponsored bodies within the Government's overall policy.</P>
      <P>Information on the availability of job opportunities in State and semi-State bodies, within the framework of the embargo, is a matter for the bodies concerned.</P>

      <P>The application which this organisation made to the Commission of the European Communities was in respect of a study which they proposed to carry out with a view to the formulation of a development programme for north Connacht and Donegal.  However, once the study was completed there would be pressure for implementation of the resulting programme, which would inevitably involve a contribution, either direct or indirect, from State funds.  The implementation of a programme for a particular limited geographical area such as north Connacht and Donegal would of course only be possible at the cost of diverting scarce Exchequer financial resources from other expenditure programmes and from other geographical areas which, of course, would not be slow to respond with programmes of a similar nature.  This diversion would lead to serious distortion in the pattern of public expenditure which must be based on national priorities determined by the Government.</P>

      <P>It is not possible to indicate precisely the amount of revenue which has accrued to the Exchequer from the VAT at point of entry system for VAT-registered persons which was introduced in 1982.  However, it is estimated by the Revenue Commissioners that it produced a gain of the order of £23 million in 1984 and a loss of the order of £16 million in 1985.  The estimated loss in 1985 resulted, in large part, from the significant drop in the value of imports which occurred towards the end of that year compared to the same period in 1984.</P>

      <P>The information sought regarding the total amount paid and the number of cases since the scheme commenced (in 1979) is being compiled and, when it is available, I will arrange to have it sent to the Deputy.</P>
      <P>The number of cases outstanding currently in respect of which payments are due is three which were determined in the courts in October 1982, May 1984 and September 1985, respectively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The scheme was brought into operation in 1967 in relation to habeas corpus proceedings.  In 1978 it was extended to other State side proceedings, and in 1979 it was further extended to adoption proceedings. The scheme provides that <Col N="95" /> where a party to such proceedings is unable to pay for legal representation in the High Court, the court, if it is satisfied that the case is a proper one for such a course, recommends that the State should pay the cost of representation. The State invariably accepts the recommendation.</P>
    <P>The costs and fees payable under the scheme are those which are payable under the Criminal Justice (Legal Aid) Regulations current at the time.  Thus, counsel under the scheme are paid the same fees as counsel for the adoption board or the State, as the case may be, and solicitors are paid the costs and expenses which they would receive in proceedings in the Central Criminal Court.  The scheme provides legal representation for persons who need it but could not afford to pay the usual charges, and it does so at a reasonable cost to the taxpayer while providing fair levels of remuneration for the solicitors and counsel concerned.  Revision of the scheme is not contemplated.</P>

This large allocation precluded the making of the usual grants to independent archaeologists but I am at present considering making some funds available for work on other sites in the current year.  I do not envisage that any workers will be made redundant.</P>

      <P>Where a medical certificate is required under the Social Welfare Acts, the certifying doctor may not accept money or other consideration in connection with the issue of a medical certificate and may not make it a condition of the issue of a certificate that the insured person should receive from him and pay for, any medical advice, treatment or medicine.  These prohibitions apply to all cases where insured persons seek a medical certificate under the Social Welfare Acts and therefore comprehend cases where the insured person does not have a medical card.</P>
      <P>In cases where an insured person who does not have a medical card seeks a medical certificate for purposes unconnected with the Social Welfare Acts, the question of fees payable by the patient is a matter for determination between doctor and patient as is normal in the case of private practice.  The Minister for Health has no function in the matter.</P>

      <Col N="98" /> Medical card holders are not liable to charges for services provided under the terms of the general medical services (&ldquo;choice of doctor&rdquo;) scheme.</P>

      <P>The construction of the new St. Oliver Plunkett Hospital in Dundalk is expected to be completed before the end of the current year.  The transfer of patients to the new hospital is scheduled to take place early in 1987.</P>
      <P>The staffing levels are presently under consideration with the North Eastern Health Board but it is expected that they will be similar to those in the existing hospital.  The present staffing level is as follows: Clerical-Administrative, 2; Nursing and Allied, 80; Paramedical, 1; Catering and Housekeeping, 2; Chiropody, 1; Hospital Total, 86.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There will be 152 beds in the new hospital and it is not expected that patient numbers will be significantly different from this figure during 1987 and 1988. The tender sum at the 10 June 1983 was £2.477 million.  The projected final account at current costs on the 14 March <Col N="103" /> 1986 was £3.1 million.  The increase in the projected final cost is mainly due to fluctuations in the cost of wages and materials. These figures are exclusive of design fees and furniture and fittings which are expected to bring the total cost to £4.3 million.</P>

      <P>The North Eastern Health Board has submitted a planning brief to my Department for a geriatric unit in Drogheda to replace the existing accommodation at St. Mary's Hospital.  However, the board's priority for capital developments in County Louth for geriatric patients was the replacement of the St. Oliver Plunkett Hospital in Dundalk. This development is now in the course of construction and will be ready to receive patients in early 1987.  Because of the limitations on capital funds consideration of a further development at Drogheda had to be postponed pending completion of this new geriatric hospital in Dundalk.</P>
      <P>The North Eastern Health Board has recently completed a report on geriatric facilities in general in its area and any further developments, such as a new unit in Drogheda, will have to be considered within the context of this report and in the context of current thinking in relation to geriatric facilities generally.  The current policy is that as many patients as possible should be catered for in the community and only those who cannot reasonably be cared for in the community setting should be admitted to a long stay institution.  The number of beds needed to care for geriatric patients will have to be reviewed in the light of these developments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond) Barry Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>Many pharmaceutical drugs currently being exported from this country are already authorised for sale and use on the Irish market.  However, I not think it would be appropriate to introduce legislation to prevent the export from this country of those pharmaceutical products whose sale and use in this country is not approved by my Department.  For example, may such products currently being exported would not be appropriate for sale or use in this country because of the specific conditions which they are designed to treat.</P>
      <P>However, while our product authorisation scheme does not apply to products manufactured in Ireland for sale only in other countries, the manufacture of all such products, whether for sale in this country or for export, is subject to a statutory licensing scheme.  All manufacturing plants are inspected at regular intervals in the course of which the requirements for good practices in the manufacture and quality control of drugs as recommended by WHO are applied as well as those of the Pharmaceutical Inspection Convention (EFTA).</P>
      <P>This country also fully participates in the WHO certification scheme on the quality of pharmaceutical products moving in international commerce.  This certification scheme was designed primarily to safeguard the interests of developing countries which lack adequate laboratory facilities for drug analysis.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond) Barry Desmond">

      <P>Expenditure on the prevention of harm caused by the misuse of drugs, smoking and alcohol from the Health and Social Welfare Votes in 1985, to the extent that such expenditure can be separately identified and quantified, is as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>1.  Drug abuse: £280,000 to the Coolmine Therapeutic Community for both treatment and preventive services. Coolmine is actively involved in prevention, particularly through education of parents; £44,000 by the Health Education Bureau for education about drug abuse; £30,000 to Trinity College for the diploma course in addiction studies.  This course provides specialised training for workers in direct contact with drug abusers and their families; £11,700 to the National Federation for Community Action on Drugs for the expansion and development of their current activities in the area of drug education; £10,000 to the Anna Liffey project which provides support for ex-addicts through group work and counselling; £5,000 to the <Col N="107" /> Dublin Diocesan Council PTAA, for their youth temperance programme; $5,000 to the United Nations Fund for Drug Abuse Control.  The principal aim of UNFDAC is to limit the supply of drugs to legitimate requirements by putting an end to illegal or uncontrolled production, processing and manufacture, making use of enforcement, crop substitution and other methods as appropriate.</P>
    <P>The work of the drug unit in Jervis Street includes an educational and preventive element.  It is not possible to quantify the amount of expenditure involved as it is included in the overall budget of the unit.</P>
    <P>2.  Smoking: £440,536 by the Health Education Bureau on measures to combat smoking;</P>
    <P>3.  Alcohol: £69,000 to the Irish National Council on Alcoholism for educative and preventive work on alcohol abuse. £2,000 by the Health Education Bureau on prevention of alcohol abuse.</P>
    <P>At present treatment services for persons with alcohol related problems are mainly based in psychiatric hospitals. The services are run by alcoholism counsellors who are also involved in educational and preventive work in the locality.

    <P>Health Education: The Health Education Bureau and the health boards provide health education services which are part of the campaign to prevent substance abuse but which cannot be separately costed.

      <P>In June 1985 an appeals officer assessed the means of the person concerned at £21.65 weekly, derived from the value of board and lodgings in her parents' home.

      <P>The social welfare officer recently completed his inquiries and reported that the person concerned had not fully disclosed his means.

      <P>The unemployment assistance claim of the person concerned was disallowed on the grounds that his means, derived from self-employment, and income from the letting of land, exceeded the statutory limit.  In accordance with the provisions of the legislation governing the unemployment assistance scheme, the income from self-employment of the person concerned, in the absence of other means for ascertaining it, was taken to be the income received during the year immediately preceding the date of calculation. This was deemed to be £5,200.  In addition the person concerned had, in 1985, an income of £725 from the letting of land.</P>
      <P>The income of the applicant was accordingly calculated at £5,925 per annum and as this exceeded the statutory limit, in his case in his claim was disallowed. He appealed against this disallowance on 25 March 1986 and arising from contentions made in support of his appeal his papers have been returned to the social welfare officer for further inquiries.  When these inquiries are completed his case will be submitted to an appeals officer for determination, at the earliest available opportunity.  The entitlement of the person concerned to unemployment assistance will be reviewed in the light of the appeals officer's decision.</P>

      <P>The purpose of the arrangements is to make it possible to unemployed persons to do voluntary work without affecting their unemployment payments.  However, in order to continue to be entitled to these payments a person must still be available for paid employment as this is a statutory condition and the Department must satisfy itself that this condition continues to be satisfied. The Department must also be satisfied that the work involved is, in fact, of a voluntary nature.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For these reasons, the Department needs to know in advance the nature of the voluntary work and it requires confirmation from the voluntary organisation concerned.  These arrangements are there to ensure that there will be no subsequent confusion or misunderstanding which might adversely affect the person's entitlement to unemployment payment. Hence the need to have these matters clarified in advance to avoid any possible interruption of payment which might <Col N="135" /> otherwise arise as a result of the Department's day-to-day control and regulation of claims in payment.</P>
    <P>The scheme is intended to be of benefit to unemployed persons by enabling them to retain or develop their skills or by providing them with the opportunity for preparing to re-enter the labour market. It should also be of considerable benefit to voluntary organisations and to the community generally.  The arrangements referred to represent the minimum requirements considered necessary to safeguard the interests of the claimants and to meet the Department's responsibility in administering the schemes of unemployment payments.</P>

      <P>The person concerned submitted a claim for contributory old age pension on 2 January 1985.  He reached old age pension age of 66 years on 15 April 1985.  One of the qualifying conditions for receipt of this pension requires a person to have a yearly average of at least 20 reckonable contributions over the period from the beginning of the 1953 contribution year or from his year of entry into insurance, whichever is the later, to the end of the last complete <Col N="140" /> contribution year before reaching pension age.  The Department's records show that the person concerned had a total of 552 reckonable contributions in the relevant period which, in his case, is from 5 January 1953 to 5 April 1985.  This is equal to a yearly average of only 17 and is not sufficient to qualify for a contributory old age pension under the Social Welfare Acts.</P>
      <P>He had entitlement to a <i>pro rata</i> pension under EC regulations, based on the number of his Irish contributions in proportion to his combined British and Irish total in the relevant period.  However, the <i>pro rata</i> pension was not paid to him as he qualified for a non-contributory old age pension at a higher weekly rate.  Following a recent investigation his means were re-assessed and based on this his non-contributory pension would be reduced from £33.10 to £18 per week. Since his current <i>pro rata</i> pension entitlement is £31.60 per week he has been asked to return his non-contributory pension book to the Department and when this is done a contributory old age pension book containing orders payable at the rate of £31.60 per week will be issued to the designated post office for collection by him.

      <P>The person concerned appealed against the means assessment of his unemployment assistance claim and an appeals officer, following an oral hearing of the case on 25 February 1986 assessed his means at £38.45 weekly, derived from self-employment as a cabinet maker.  In accordance with the provisions of the legislation governing the unemployment assistance scheme the income from self-employment of the person concerned, in the absence of other means for ascertaining it, was taken by a deciding officer to be the income received during the year immediately preceding the date of calculation. This was deemed to be £4,000.  The appeals officer however following the oral hearing of the case assessed his earnings at £2,000 per annum or £38.45 weekly.  He is, accordingly, entitled to unemployment assistance at £24.50 weekly, being the appropriate maximum rate payable in his case of £62.95 less means of £38.45.

    <P>The person concerned does not qualify for retirement pension under the Social Welfare Acts as he does not have the <Col N="154" /> required yearly average of at least 24 Irish contributions in the period from 5 January 1953 to 5 April 1985.  He has a total of only 139 such contributions during that period, giving a yearly average of four.  Neither will he qualify for old age contributory pension at age 66. A yearly average of at least 20 Irish contributions is required for this latter pension.</P>
    <P>Under EC regulations his British and Irish insurance records may be combined and if this would enable him to satisfy the required yearly average condition he would qualify for a <i>pro rata</i> pension from the Department.  The British authorities have been asked to supply details of his British insurance record and when this is received his entitlement to a <i>pro rata</i> pension will be determined.</P>

      <P>Entitlement to unemployment assistance is dependent on an applicant being the holder of a qualification certificate and to obtain a qualification certificate an applicant must satisfy certain conditions including an assessment of means.  The person concerned claimed unemployment assistance and her case was referred to a social welfare officer for investigation of her means.</P>
      <P>When the necessary inquiries, which were protracted, were completed she was assessed with means of £8.15 weekly, derived from the value of board and lodgings in her parents' home.  She is, accordingly, entitled to unemployment assistance at £23.60 weekly, being the appropriate maximum rate payable in her case of £31.75 less means of £8.15. Payment commenced on 11 March 1986 and all arrears due have been paid to her. Further weekly payments will continue to be made as they become due.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture the total number of gallons of flexi-milk available for distribution to farmers in 1985; the total number of farmers who qualify for flexi-milk; if he will give a breakdown of the different categories of farmers who qualify and the gallonage allocated to the creameries of Kerry Co-op, Ballyclough, Mitchelstown and Golden Vale; the number of farmers who qualify in each creamery area; the gallons allocated to each farmer in categories; if he will explain the supervisory role being adopted by his inspectorate in policing the allocation of quotas; the number of new entrants to milk production in each creamery area; the number of farmers who discontinued milk production; the number of quotas that have changed hands; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Deasy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The distribution of flexi-milk is only relevant in the case of co-operatives and other purchasers which exceed their quotas.  In the case of purchasers which do not exceed their quotas such distribution does not arise because none of their suppliers are liable for super levy.  The quantity of flexi-milk available for reallocation by purchasers which exceeded their quotas in 1984-85 was approximately 24 million gallons.  Figures for 1985-86 will not be available for some months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1984-85 two categories of producers qualified for priority in flexi-milk allocations. These were (i) producers who had invested heavily in milk production (particularly those in the &ldquo;rescue package&rdquo;) and (ii) new entrants to milk production in the period 1 January 1983 to 21 May 1984.  In the case of purchasers which exceeded their quotas the number of producers in category (i) was 714 and in category (ii) 572.  The amounts reallocated to farmers were dependent on the quantities available in the purchasing area and the quantities required by the special categories in that area.  As the <Col N="156" /> quota system is operated on a purchaser basis, details of the amounts allocated to each individual farmer are not collected. Officers of the Department are, however, empowered to examine purchasers' records to ensure that the guidelines laid down for flexi-milk reallocation together with the other provisions relating to the quota system as contained in the regulations are being observed.</P>
    <P>The Department do not have details of the number of producers who went out of milk production or of quotas that have changed hands.  The following table gives particulars of the numbers qualifying in categories (i) and (ii), as furnished by the co-operatives concerned:</P>

      <P>Government policy towards the expansion of the beef herd is based on the premise that the most effective measures are those which provide direct grants towards increasing the number of beef breeding animals.  Consequently since most of the beef herd is in less favoured areas the level of grant-aid in 1986 under the disadvantaged areas scheme is being raised this year from £32 to £70 per beef cow.  This increase which is subject to EC clearance, provides a worth-while incentive to increase the beef herd.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Registrar of Titles that the application, the details of which were supplied by the Deputy, was lodged in the Land Registry on 12 March 1984 and is at present under consideration.  It is an application for registration of title under section 49 of the Registration of Title Act, 1964.  Such applications are complex from a legal point of view and usually take about two years to complete at present.</P>
      <P>A similar application was originally lodged and recorded in the Land Registry under a different dealing number on 8 December 1980 and because queries were not replied to, despite repeated reminders, the application was treated as abandoned on 5 July 1983 and the applicant's solicitor so informed.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Registrar of Titles that at the end of February 1986 there was a total of 58,894 applications outstanding in the main categories of work in the Land Registry.  These categories are; applications for</P>
      <P>(a)  registration of title already registered,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b)  first registration including title acquired by possession (squatters' title), <Col N="164" /> (c)  registration of Land Commission vestings,</P>
    <P>(d)  copy maps,</P>
    <P>(e)  land certificates,</P>
    <P>(f)  copy folios and instruments, and</P>
    <P>(g)  vesting certificates under the ground rents purchase scheme.</P>
    <P>The bulk of the applications for registration of title &mdash; about 93 per cent &mdash; are in respect of land already registered (category (a)).  The average delay in finalising these cases at the end of February 1986 was 4.3 months.  Applications for first registration (category (b)), which tend to be complex from a legal point of view, usually take about two years to complete at present.  Applications for registration of Land Commission vestings (category (c)) are normally not as urgent since registration is effective from the date of vesting and in general are dealt with at present only as the need arises. Applications for copy maps, land certificates and copy folios and instruments (categories (d) to (f) inclusive) are finalised within three to seven working days on average.  The average delay at the end of February 1986 in dealing with applications under the ground rents purchase scheme was eight months in consent cases and seven years in arbitration cases (category (g)).</P>
    <P>A programme of computerisation of the Land Registry folios commenced in December 1982.  About 20 per cent of the registration work of the Registry is now being processed through computerisation. It is hoped that further progress on the programme will be made this year.</P>
    <P>Sixteen temporary clerical trainees were assigned recently to the Registry. Everything possible is being done to improve the services provided by the Land Registry but, necessarily, within the general staffing restraints aimed at keeping down public expenditure.</P>

      <P>On 6 February 1986 the Government, acting in accordance with the provisions of the conciliation and arbitration scheme for teachers, sought the approval of Dáil Éireann to implement the recommendation of the Teachers' Arbitration Board that the pay of teachers be increased by 10 per cent, subject to a modification of the recommendation on the phasing of the increase.  This proposal was approved by the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since then I had two meetings with representatives of the teacher unions at the which the pay dispute was discussed. <Col N="170" /> These meetings were held on 19 and 28 February 1986.  After the meeting of 28 February an agreed statement was issued to the effect that there had been an exchange of views on outstanding issues but that the parties had been unable to resolve their differences of opinion.</P>
    <P>On 1 April 1986 I announced that the Government were prepared to appoint a chairman of the Teachers' Arbitration Board.  The necessary steps to arrange for the appointment are now being taken. It was the Government's hope that the teacher unions would see this development as a gesture of goodwill.</P>
    <P>Finally, I wish to state that I am available for discussions with the unions at all times.  I am particularly anxious that the teacher unions should reconsider their declared intention not to volunteer for duties in connection with this year's certificate examinations.</P>

      <P>The running costs of national schools are assisted by my Department by means of a system of capitation grants, that is a grant per pupil enrolled on 30 September of the school year in question.  The capitation grant assistance is payable on the condition that a local contribution equivalent to at least 25 per cent of the State <Col N="172" /> capitation grant, must be lodged each year in a bank account in the name of the school.  As is laid down in the constitution of boards and rules of procedure &ldquo;The sum required to meet the local contribution shall be provided by the parish community or other appropriate analogous community or body from general funds at the disposal of such community or body and there shall be no levy on the parents of children attending the school&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that boards of management, in general, are familiar with the above rules and bring no undue pressure to bear on individual parents with regard to the making of financial contributions.</P>
      <P>The capitation grant has been increased annually since the Government came into office giving an overall increase in real terms since 1982.  In 1986 the rate has been increased by £2 to £24 per pupil. In addition, special funds have been provided to patrons to enable them to alleviate the financial difficulties of certain schools situated in disadvantaged areas. I do not accept that secondary schools in the free education schemes have to levy parents as suggested in the question.  The <i>per capita</i> grant to such schools stands at £140 since 1 January 1986.</P>

Should the employee in this case feel that she is entitled to a redundancy lump sum payment, she should, if she has not already done so, write to her former employer asking for payment.  If the employer does not accept that there is an entitlement, the employee may appeal to the Employment Appeals Tribunal.  If, on the other hand, the employer acknowledges the employee's entitlement through the issue of a redundancy certificate (Form RP 2) but fails or refuses to pay the lump sum, the employee should then apply to my Department for payment from the Redundancy and Employers' Involvency Fund.</P>
      <P>I will arrange to have the necessary forms forwarded to the Deputy for the convenience of the employee concerned.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Labour if he considers it appropriate that small construction firms obtain exemption from section 32 of the Industrial Relations Act, 1946, as amended in section 10 of the Industrial Relations Act, 1969, where their survival is at stake; if he will clarify whether this Labour Court agreement is a voluntary effect; and if he agrees that this could have a negative and detrimental effect on employment in such small firms especially those already paying full State social insurance and employers and public liability insurance.</P>

      <P>The agreement relating to the construction industry pensions assurance and sick pay <Col N="178" /> was registered by the Labour Court at the request of the Registered National Joint Industrial Council for the Construction Industry and it applies to all employers and workers engaged in the business specified in the agreement regardless of the size of the firm.  One of the main provisions of the agreement in question is that each worker affected shall receive from his employer the benefits of a pension scheme and a sick pay scheme which are no less favourable than those set out in the agreement.  Employers in the industry are therefore obliged to provide these benefits either under the construction industry federation scheme or under some other scheme.  This is a statutory requirement and section 10 of the Industrial Relations Act, 1969, provides for prosecution by the Minister for breaches of registered employment agreements by employers or employees.  There are no provisions in the Industrial Relations Acts, 1946 and 1969, to exempt employers or employees from compliance with the requirements of employment agreements once they are registered.  My Department has no evidence to suggest that employment in small firms in the construction industry is adversely affected by the requirement to implement the provisions of the pension and sick pay scheme in the construction industry Registered Employment Agreement.</P>

Precise statistics relating to the number of persons offered employment under the scheme with Cork County Council are not available.  It has, however, been estimated that 50 persons refused offers of employment with the county council in 1985.  Various reasons were given for refusing offers of employment by the county council.  The most common were the unsuitability of the type of work offered and the rate of remuneration for work on the scheme (that is, £70 for two and a half days' work per week) compared to the levels of unemployment assistance being received by potential participants.</P>

      <P>According to information furnished to my Department on his redundancy certificate, the person in question was entitled to a redundancy lump sum of £1,115 under the Redundancy Payments Acts, 1967-1984.

    <P>So far as redundancy payments to other former employees are concerned, my Department's records indicate that between 27 June 1980 and 30 January 1981, 33 employees of this company were made redundant, of whom 31 were paid their full statutory redundancy entitlements by their employer and two were underpaid.  The employer was advised to pay the balance due in each of the two cases.  A further 53 employees, excluding the person named, who were made redundant between 13 March and 1 May 1981 after the company went into liquidation, <Col N="182" /> were paid their full entitlements by my Department from the redundancy fund.  There are no further claims from former employees of the company for redundancy payments on hand in my Department.</P>
