      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies who are not interested in this debate and who wish to have a conversation should leave the House and have it some place else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 1 (a) reads:</P>
      <P>...wholly manufactured or produced in the customs territory of the Community without the addition of goods from countries or territories which are not part of the customs territory of the Community,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Minister expand on the meaning of &ldquo;customs territory&rdquo;?  There are states which make arrangements with the European Community and I would like if the Minister would give a list of the countries covered by the term &ldquo;customs territory&rdquo;. <Col N="3048" /> Is Algeria, where there are some arrangements with Turkey, included?  There are other arrangements with other groups of countries, so a list of the countries covered by the term &ldquo;customs territory&rdquo; would be appreciated.  It is important that the House should know exactly what areas are covered.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>The wording of these definitions follows the format used in Community legislation.  Community goods includes goods wholly manufactured or produced in the Community. However, under Community customs rules, Community goods also includes goods manufactured or produced in third countries, provided goods have been released for free circulation, which means that the relevant import formalities have been complied with and also the import charges.  As far as the Community customs rules are concerned, it is Community countries only.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>In other words, the term &ldquo;customs territory of the Community&rdquo; does not take in other areas &mdash; for instance, in Africa &mdash; which may have certain customs arrangements with a member of the Community?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>No, the customs territory of the Community is defined under EC law and basically it refers to member states.  Third countries are not members of the customs territory of the Community, but goods coming in after having paid the various duties and been released for free circulation&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>That refers to section 1 (b).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>Basically speaking, it refers simply to the Community countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will be aware that member states have an arrangement with other countries in various areas. Does this mean that third country agreements between members of the Community, and especially with the new <Col N="3049" /> applicants or new members of the Community, are not included?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>It means Community members.  Goods coming in can come in under various terms and once they are in the Community then they are classified as Community goods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>Does that mean that the existing Community arrangements with member states mean that third country goods can come in under those arrangements?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>This is dealing to a great extent with third countries.  The whole concept of the Free Ports Bill is dealing with goods coming in and going out and various arrangements are made within the Bill for this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the position within the Community territory of the new tax free zone being established on the mainland of Europe on the Belgian-Luxembourg border?  My understanding is that the type of legislation we are introducing is designed to help the peripheral regions of the Community to eliminate the disparities which exist.  I understand this new territory is being established there.  Can the Minister tell me what bearing this will have and if there can be trading between those two areas, or can there be a common operation? From a Community point of view it is stepping back very much when you see mainland Europe trying to introduce these tax free areas.  They are not helping the peripheral regions.  What effect will that have on the port we are talking about on the Cork scene?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of special concessions under this for peripheral areas.  They are very strictly governed by EC regulations.  The type of regulations being introduced here are in conformity with EC legislation.  There is nothing special that can be done in this area but we are operating very strictly within the legislation laid down by the EC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="3050" />
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not suggesting that there was anything for peripheral areas but the fact that it was referring to Ireland could help peripheral areas.  The question I was asking was: are the types of areas in mainland Europe I am referring to excluded?  The section says, &ldquo;wholly manufactured or produced in the customs territory of the Community&rdquo;.  Is this new zone within the customs territory of the Community or is it not if there are special concessions on tax free and duty free? Does that come within the customs territory outlined in the Bill?  I suggest it does not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as exports from the particular zone the Deputy is talking about into the rest of the Community are concerned, they are governed by a whole series of regulations which are the same as goods leaving the free port to be set up at Ringaskiddy, depending on what treatment has been given to them there and depending on whether they came for inward processing or for processing under customs control.  The position is that any movement of goods coming out of any other free port area and coming in to that free port area will be governed by the rules there.  If goods are brought into the free port area for re-export to third countries, then there will not be any duty, as such, on them.  If they are brought in with the possibility of some of them going into the Community area, they will be subject to the various rules applying as if they had come from third countries.</P>

      <P>On page 3, line 5 it states:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Non-Community goods&rdquo; means goods other than Community goods, including... goods which, while satisfying the conditions laid down for Community goods, are re-imported into the customs territory of the Community after having been exported from that territory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That makes clear enough reading in this kind of context where the purpose seems to be to confuse by terminology, but it is the bit I left out that I would like the Minister to comment on.  It states, <Col N="3051" />&ldquo;without prejudice to the agreements concluded by the Community with countries which are not member states of the Community for the purposes of the Community transit procedure&rdquo;.  I should like the Minister to comment on that because it relates back to the question I raised originally about customs territory.  What exactly does that mean?</P>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>The wording in the definition follows the format currently used in Community legislation.  Non-Community goods are essentially goods other than Community goods, as mentioned earlier by the Deputy.  The definition is complicated because it must also cover goods originally qualifying as Community goods which were exported from the Community and are now being re-imported.  Under Community customs rules such goods are <i>prima facie</i> treated as non-Community goods.  There is a further consideration also.  Community goods are frequently moved in transit through non-Community countries.  For example, in going from Germany to Italy through Switzerland such goods, notwithstanding the fact that they have left the Community and are returning to it, continue to be regarded as Community goods.  Goods produced in another third country free zone are not Community goods unless released for circulation.</P>

I should like the Minister to list some of the agreements without prejudice to the agreements concluded by the Community with countries which are not member states of the Community for the purpose of the Community transit procedure.  The Minister mentioned Switzerland.  Are there other countries which have such agreements with the EC either in the context of transit or otherwise?</P>

In this respect I would like to point out that, as the Deputies will be aware, there is a change in name and title of the Ministry for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism to Ministry for Industry and Commerce which is effective from today.  Therefore, a number of amendments of a technical nature will be necessary to the Bill.  These arise in sections 2, 3, 4 and 6.

      <P>On the substance of section 2 (1), during Second Stage the Minister said that of course it was an enabling Bill, which it is, and that no specific location for a free port was mentioned. Nevertheless, he said that the purpose was to enable a free port to be set up at Cork, and he went on to say that the land area to be enclosed in the free port had not been definitely decided on.  An area in the immediate vicinity of Ringaskiddy was mentioned.  Can the Minister say at this stage whether a firm decision has been made with regard to the enclosed area at Cork?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>The primary purpose of this subsection is to establish a free port at Ringaskiddy, County Cork, as Deputy Wilson said.  At this moment there are no plans to establish any other free ports. The initial area designated as a free port at Ringaskiddy itself will be comparatively small.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct.  The answer to what the Deputy asked in simple terms is &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  The fact is that Cork Harbour Commissioners have proposed the designation of a 30-acre site at Ringaskiddy, and this will be beside the car ferry and near the deep water berth which will be completed in 1986.  The commissioners have proposed that they should develop this site in conjunction with private interests.  Another possibility would be the provision and development of a site elsewhere in the Ringaskiddy area by private interests. The Deputies will be aware that Cork Harbour Commissioners have taken some initiative in this respect but no final decision has been made.  It will depend entirely on who runs the free port as to exactly where it will be.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Ringaskiddy has been mentioned on Second Stage, but in view of the representations made by the different Deputies from Wexford, including me, who spoke on Second Stage, have the Department considered Rosslare Harbour?  The development committee there were one of the first to put forward the concept of a free port for that area in view of the alarming unemployment in that county and the other areas that were pointed out on Second Stage.  Has the Minister given any consideration to Rosslare Harbour?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>As I stated on Second Stage, this is enabling legislation and when this gets on to the Statute Book it will be possible to have free ports in any area; but at this moment the only one under consideration is Ringaskiddy.  As I explained also, it will be very useful, without attempting to make any party point, to see what kind of experience we will have in Cork.  That will be generally accepted.  The Deputy may be aware that developments across the channel in the free ports designated there have not been as rapid or successful as had been anticipated. Therefore, we would be very wise to concentrate initially on Ringaskiddy and see what developments are there and what improvements can be done and how we can best utilise this new institution in that area.  We can learn an enormous amount.  As I understand it, the British have already learned from their free port areas that if they were doing things again, it might not be in precisely the same way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure that the Minister is aware that we have had a great deal of speculation about large industries being brought into the Ringaskiddy area. It is unrealistic to think that 30 acres would allow development of those industries. The impression is being given that very large industries will be coming on stream when Ringaskiddy is ready.  Can the Minister tell us if the 1,000 acres owned by the IDA is still under consideration by the Government or being designated as a free port as well as the 30 acres of the Cork Harbour Commissioners?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>We hope that there will be industries, as we hope will be happening again all around the country.  However, there is no limitation to the area of space which can be designated for a free port, and it can be in several areas.  The various parts of it need not be contiguous, and that is an important element in it.  There is provision for, if necessary, expanding the free port.  Once it is on the ground and it is found necessary to have extra acreage for a free port I hope that the experience of Cork will demand that it be expanded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed that the Minister has stated that Rosslare Harbour is not under consideration at present.  While I have regard to the problems in Cork and I wish success to Ringaskiddy, the problems of Wexford and other areas in relation to unemployment should have been considered.  The Minister might say that one free port must be a success before another can be set up, but I cannot understand why we cannot have two free ports nominated at present. Surely two up and running would not be too many whether they are successful or failures.  I am disappointed that Rosslare Harbour is not being considered with Ringaskiddy and that we cannot have two free ports at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>Ringaskiddy obviously is thought to have considerable potential and a great deal of work has been done in it.  Let me point out again that this is enabling legislation and once it is there, it is then a matter for other areas to put forward a good and compelling case in regard to the possibilities for their areas. Naturally, if it is seen that there are possibilities in the free port and that it is working well, then these will be considered.  It is not just Rosslare that has asked for it; so also has Greenore because of the special problems of the Border area.  It need not be confined to a sea port, it can be in any area.  There are a number of areas that feel that they could also benefit.  However, it would be very wise for us in this case, in what is a relatively new venture, to examine the success rate <Col N="3056" /> of Ringaskiddy &mdash; and I have no doubt it will be a success.  We have closely examined what has happened in Britain and there has been very little development in many of the British free port areas.  If Rosslare could be patient and learn from what happens in Ringaskiddy, advantages might be confirmed which are not at present in the enabling legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with one point that the Minister made and that is that the British situation has not been as encouraging as one would have thought at one time.  Nobody in this House would regard the enabling legislation setting up free ports, for example, that in Ringaskiddy, as solving all the ills of the Cork area &mdash; far from it.  However, any worthwhile contribution that it would make would be hopeful.</P>
      <P>One always likes to claim credit and my question in the House last week luckily resurrected this Bill and had the result of Committee and other Stages of the Bill being taken in the House this week, for which I am glad.  Second Stage was taken, I think, in November and the Bill seemed to be lying dormant until I raised the question.  As a Corkman, I am glad to take that credit.  I shall continue to press the Minister and want answers to some questions from him.  He has said that there will not yet be any designation of an area.  Have there been any ongoing discussions between his Department and the Cork Harbour Commissioners regarding the bringing to fruition of the designation of that area?  I hope the situation will not be that having left Second Stage of the Bill on the shelf for three months we will take Committee and remaining Stages and then start discussions on the making and implementing of regulations which would empower the harbour commissioners or some other body to develop the free port.  I want the Minister to tell the House what progress has been made in the intervening period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have some experience of difficulties between Departments causing undue and <Col N="3057" /> unnecessary delay.  It is normal in legislation that the Minister for Finance be included.  I have often complained about that because it means that the power base still lies in Merrion Street.  Eventually, it can be Merrion Street that will dictate what happens with regard to the regulations on the free port.  Involved are the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Industry and Commerce &mdash; or whatever he is called now, reshuffles happen so quickly that it might be a different title before the regulations are made.  This will cause undue delay.</P>
    <P>What discussions have taken place between the Minister's Department and the Department of Industry and Commerce and how near are they to reaching agreement?  What discussions have taken place with the Department of Finance and how near are we to reaching agreement on that?  This enabling legislation is basically the product of the task force set up in the late days of January and early February of 1984 to examine the serious job situation in Cork more than two years ago.  In May of that year they reported.  While we never saw a copy of that report, we know that it contained recommendations to set up a free port at Ringaskiddy.  Ringaskiddy free port is welcome and will probably be helpful but will not solve all the problems of that area.</P>
    <P>I am asking specific questions to avoid further delay.  I do not want matters to drag out for another two years before all the details are finalised.  Once this Bill goes through the House and is signed by the President, I hope that the regulations can then be made immediately, that discussions have reached the stage where everybody will know what regulations need to be made and that the finalising of the designated area in Cork can be proceeded with.  Otherwise we are talking of a delay of another year or so that we in Cork cannot afford.  I would like some reassurances and some indication of a timetable.  Can the Minister give an approximate date when he will designate Ringaskiddy as a free port?  Everybody can then go ahead and encourage industrial development there.</P>

      <P>Deputy Fitzgerald claims credit for getting Committee Stage of this Bill on to the floor of the House today. My attitude since going into politics has been and is that I do not care who claims credit for anything as long as there are good results.  Getting this enabling legislation through would be a good result, particularly for Cork but for any other areas that might be involved afterwards.</P>
      <P>There are discussions being held with the Cork Harbour Commissioners. Deputies will be aware that the commissioners have had submissions from parties interested in the project and there is a closing date for submissions of 21 March.  The commissioners are in consultation with the Department of Communications. I must say that they have been very active and have given an interesting outline of the possibilities of a free port at Cork.  I must congratulate them on their efforts so far in this respect.</P>
      <P>There are three parties involved, the Departments of Industry and Commerce, Finance and Communications and the case might be made that this legislation could equally be brought to the House by Industry and Commerce or by Finance. However, Communications is the moving Department in this case.  Following Second Stage debate here, the various points made by Deputy Wilson and others were conveyed to the Department of Finance and that Department is active in working out the regulations.  I can assure the Deputies that in regard to getting the regulation from the Department of Finance as soon as this Bill is through, there will be no difficulties.  Work is being done on the regulations.  It is not a question of waiting for the passage of the Bill. So far as we can, we shall be pressing forward with a view to getting all the regulations and concerns dealing with the free port in train as quickly as possible. The concept is a good one but I should like to see its value at this time.  As Deputy Fitzgerald said, it is not the answer to all the problems of Ringaskiddy or Cork, but it should be some help.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Other parts of the country will be looking on anxiously to see if this project <Col N="3059" /> produces good results and if they will be in a position to follow.  There should be no hold-up in the regulations once the Bill goes through.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 3, subsection (1), line 34, after &ldquo;Tourism&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and, with the consent of such person or persons who represent companies or local authorities participating in the control and management of each free port&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This will be inserted after the technical amendment proposed by the Minister. The House will recall that on Second Stage there were various references to <Col N="3061" /> the control and management of the free port.  There were two broad divisions here, those who advocated a total free market enterprise and those who suggested the involvement of the Government, the local authorities or the Cork Harbour Commissioners.</P>
    <P>We had a look at the evolution of the free port a idea in Britain where the Government, for ideological reasons, indicated that there would be no involvement by the State, that the free ports would be run privately for profit by private companies.  As one would expect, the most successful free port in the world is that at Miami which is privately owned. I wish my amendment to be taken in the context of that discussion on whether the control and management of this free port should be at local or national level.  I said on Second Stage that one of the free ports in Scotland had involvement of a local authority in control and management.</P>
    <P>My amendment wishes the insertion of &ldquo;and, with the consent of such person or persons who represent companies or local authorities participating in the control and management of each free port&rdquo;.  I inserted the word &ldquo;companies&rdquo; because in a sense the harbour commissioners are not a local authority in the accepted sense of the word.  I do not know if the Minister has any hang up about the ideology on this&mdash;some members of the Government would go for full blown private enterprise and others for State or local authority involvement.</P>
    <P>There has been criticism of over centralisation in the way we run our affairs. In that sense, the amendment would be beneficial.  There have been token suggestions that we should transfer back to local areas more responsibility for running the affairs of their regions.  One of the advantages of accepting the amendment would be that local experts would be there to give their advice and support in the control and management of the free port.  I urge the House to approve of the amendment and the Minister to accept it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>The section provides:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="3062" /> (1)  Each free port established under this Act shall be under the control and management of such person or persons as may be designated by order by the Minister with the consent of the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the section is to give the Minister control of the arrangements for the operating and management of the free port.  To make it necessary for the Minister to have the consent of the companies or local authorities participating in the management of each free port would dilute such control and would not be wise. The area outlined is very wide.  A free port might be controlled by a company and no doubt local authorities, harbour commissioners and such people would have strong representation on the company controlling the port.</P>
    <P>I appreciate what the Deputy is seeking to achieve.  I see the value of the points he is making so far as local participation and input are concerned and the value of that as distinct from remote control, but there will be ample scope in the various organisations which will develop first of all in Ringaskiddy and in any other free port to meet, broadly speaking, what the Deputy is seeking.  I am not in a position to accept the amendment but I think the fears expressed by the Deputy are unfounded and that much of what he wants to achieve can be achieved through the management structure.</P>

      <P>I support Deputy Wilson's amendment.  As it stands, section 3 leaves it completely in the hands of the Minister.  This would leave organisations in Cork such as the Cork Harbour Commissioners, the Cork County Council or Cork Corporation, if they were involved, completely powerless.  Deputy Wilson is right in saying these bodies should be mentioned in the Bill to ensure that they are entitled by law to representation in the management and control of the free port areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to support <Col N="3063" /> very strongly Deputy Wilson's amendment. It has been an age old custom in this House that on the Committee Stage of Bills, if reasonable and useful amendments are proposed from the Opposition side, serious consideration is given to them often, perhaps, against the advice of the Minister's advisers.  A decision must be taken by the Minister in the interests of the people.  I believe Deputy Wilson's amendment is essential to the efficient working of a free port authority. Assuming that in the port we are talking about Cork Harbour Commissioners will be the governing body or the authority, it would be preposterous to appoint people without their consent.  Cork Harbour Commissioners have been an excellent body of people over the years.  They have had chairmen drawn from many political persuasions, all excellent, committed, dedicated people within their terms of office.  The same can be said of all their staff.</P>
      <P>Whether there would be private interests in any free port structure, it is important that those people or the local authorities should be able to say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to the people being appointed.  If a Minister appoints people whom those bodies do not regard as suitable or acceptable it could damage or destroy the concept we are all trying to support.  For the most part we are talking about places outside Dublin.  All Governments over the years have been too protective of the greater Dublin scene.  I say that about our administration too, most of whom are drawn from the provinces but they seem to forget that.  We talk in Europe about the need for regional development, and it is very badly needed there where there is a whole bureaucratic central structure, but even within our own country we have the same problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If a free port is being established in Ringaskiddy it is to be the beacon or the light that we hope will burn brightly and which we can follow with Rosslare and Greenore and maybe in the future somewhere in the Minister's own constituency, but on the success or failure of Ringaskiddy will hang what happens for the <Col N="3064" /> future.  It would be unforgiveable for the Minister not to accept Deputy Wilson's amendment.  If the Minister does not accept the exact wording, he should accept the principle of the amendment. Whatever advice the Minister gets he will regret it if he does not accept that amendment or its principles.  He represents a constituency outside Dublin and he should attempt to start involving the regions.  It is imperative that he should accept this very wise amendment.  He should not be seen as another Minister establishing all the powers in Dublin for the Cork port, the Rosslare port, the Greenore port and so on.  There should be some say by the people directly responsible, by the people who are on the ground, far removed from the central authority in Dublin.  This amendment is in the interests of the provinces.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with what the Deputy said at the beginning of his contribution, that a reasonable amendment should always be considered and that the purpose of the discussion in the Dáil, particularly on Committee Stage, is to improve Bills as they go along.  Indeed, as a Dáil watcher for many years I always noticed that many things which appeared to be reasonable were not taken on board by the moving Minister.</P>
      <P>On this occasion there are difficulties and I do not think that this amendment should be incorporated in the Bill.  To begin with, any group of people can make a proposal and no doubt local authorities, harbour commissioners and so on will be involved in free ports.  Until such time as the Minister has given the control and management to a person or persons, there are no such people as the people who represent companies or local authorities participating in the control and management of each free port so it would be impossible to incorporate that amendment as tabled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The Cork Harbour Commissioners have a special interest in this legislation and in the formation of the authority to run the free port.  In a briefing letter they state that a formal <Col N="3065" /> application had been made to the Minister for Communications to permit the commissioners to advertise for prospective partners to form the free port company and that this consent was still awaited.  The fact that the commissioners are anxious to be in there in control and management and that they wanted to advertise for prospective partners would indicate a very strong interest at local level.  It indicates that they expect that at local level there will be other local authorities, whether Cork Corporation, as mentioned by Deputy Ahern, or Cork County Council.  There is even a possibility of the Industrial Development Authority having an interest in doing that, although that would be more centralised. I presume it would be the IDA at local level, with the local knowledge and expertise, that would be interested.  The local personnel could possibly be involved in the control and management because, as has been stated, the thrust should be for industrial development in the area of the manufacture of goods. That seems to be the hope for some kind of industrial revival in Cork after the disastrous experience of the last few years, for which we hold the Government responsible.</P>
      <P>If the Minister, a civilised person who would not abuse any power, reads subsection (1) carefully he will see that it give immense power to the Minister.  It states:</P>
      <P>Each free port established under this Act shall be under the control and management of such person or persons as may be designated by order by the Minister...</P>
      <P>That concentrates in the Minister's hands immense power.  In other words, if he says that a certain person should be appointed, then he is; and it does not matter what views or ideas for development&mdash;we should remember that control and management is essential for development&mdash;the people with the local expertise and knowledge have.  His <i>fiat</i> makes the decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While my amendment could not be called a radical one it is at least an attempt <Col N="3066" /> to dilute this excessive power in subsection (1).  I do not want this diluted for the sake of dilution.  My amendment has the positive aspect that the knowledge of people, the knowledge of management and of control in the context of Cork, as we are talking about Cork, should be available to make the free port a success. What is true of Cork could be true of Rosslare, as mentioned by Deputy Browne, of Greenore, as mentioned by Deputy Kirk, or any of the other areas spotlighted during the Second Stage debate.  I should like to point out the fact that the Government have not been found wanting in appointing their own supporters to various positions.  I do not wish to emphasise that too much or to be party political about it.  However, human nature being what it is, there is always the danger that if local knowledge and expertise in control and management is not brought to bear in some way on the appointment of control and management, then there will be something lacking and we will have less than the best control and management.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I regard Deputy Wilson's amendment as essential for the success&mdash;it would be wrong of me to use the word &ldquo;failure&rdquo; in this regard&mdash;of the Cork free port.  It is important that there should be the consent of the participants in the control of the board.  Understandably, I know Cork better than other areas and, perhaps, I know it better than some of the officials advising the Minister. Cork has gone through a very difficult time and one thing that must be admired about the people there is their resilience. Last year Cork celebrated its 800th anniversary and, following its success, an effort was made by a group of local people to establish what is now known as the Cork Enterprise Board.  Those people were anxious to maintain some of the momentum generated by the success of last year's celebrations.  The Government, very kindly, decided to give financial support to that board.  I am convinced that for a free port to be successful it is desirable that those appointed to manage or control that board should be appointed <Col N="3067" /> with the consent of the participating bodies or people.  If we continue to be governed from Merrion Street in Dublin the regions will continue to die.  We will then have Dublin growing and growing. That must be faced up to.</P>
      <P>Contrary to the advice being offered to the Minister, I must emphasise that the spirit of the amendment before the House will improve the management of the free port.  The Minister will not always be in charge of the Department; and I am not suggesting that he would dream of doing anything wrong in regard to appointments, but the temptation can often be great.  However, a Minister in the future may appoint people who are totally unacceptable and unsuitable and who will prove to be a millstone around the development of that free port.  That is the last thing we want to happen.  If such people can only be appointed with the consent of the participating bodies who are committed to the success of the venture then the person would never be unacceptable or unsuitable.  The person chosen in such a way would make worthwhile contributions to the venture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regardless of the advice the Minister may be receiving I assure him that there is a great need for what we are advocating. Even if the Minister does not like the wording, he should at least accept the spirit of the proposal.  I am not sure as to how technically that could be incorporated in the Bill but what Deputy Wilson proposes is essential to the success of the free ports.  From our experience we are all aware that those concerned mainly with the success of a venture are the people on the ground, those who know what they are talking about, who are experienced and those who have seen many Dublin-generated ventures fade and disappear.  The Minister should at least give the people of Cork the opportunity of deciding who should govern the new port authority.  By acting in this way the Minister will be doing himself a favour also, because it will be remembered that the civil servants did not try to strangle the venture by holding the reins.  I am appealing to the Minister to <Col N="3068" /> accept the advice from this side of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern" hpid="Mr. M. Ahern Mr. M. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I add my voice to what both Deputies Wilson and Fitzgerald have said.  Deputy Fitzgerald hit the nail on the head when he referred to control from the centre.  We have had examples of this in my area in the past number of years in factories and businesses.  The control emanated from the centre while the operations at ground level were all but ignored and eventually failed.</P>
      <P>We will have the same problems with free ports if all the decisions are to be in the hands of a central authority.  I accept that there will be consultations but if section 3 is enacted as it is the decisions will be taken by the Minister of the day without necessarily his having the consent of local authorities or of local representative bodies.  Without the goodwill of local authorities and other local interested bodies the chances of success of any venture are much less than if that goodwill is present.  If Deputy Wilson's amendment is not accepted there will be the danger that the legislation will dilute the goodwill in every area and will not give a proper chance for the free ports to begin and develop as they might.  Therefore, I am asking the Minister to reconsider his position and to accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>I have accepted already the spirit of what is being said.  A very good example of what is happening is that Cork Harbour Commissioners are trying to organise a package for the control and management of the free port.  I do not think the Deputies would object to those people having control but let us forget about Cork for the moment and consider a situation that could arise in any area where two rival organisations were seeking control of the operation with the Minister considering both bodies.  In such circumstances what the Deputies, by reason of the amendment, would be asking is that the Minister obtain the consent of such persons who represent companies or local authorities participating in the control and management of each free port.  I do not think <Col N="3069" /> that this would be possible.  There is a certain illogicality in the proposal.  I have no doubt that there will be liaison with the local authorities concerned in this matter.  They have a very important role to play but I would not wish to seek to influence what might happen in the Cork area.  I know that some local authorities are very interested in the free port development and they would have an important role to play in that regard.  Assuming that some body corporate would be in charge of the Cork free port when established, they would have their own structure there and would be running the port. I do not think there would be any great objection to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no lack of logic in the amendment.  In order to indicate that there might be a lack of logic, it was significant that the Minister took as a hypothesis that the Cork Harbour Commissioners would be involved in the control and management of the free port, but the wording in the Bill does not bestow that right on the Minister.  The provision is that each free port established under the legislation shall be under the control and management of such person or persons as may be designated by order of the Minister.  We are all aware of the colossal sums of money made by barristers in interpreting Acts of the Oireachtas.  The words in this Bill are the only words that count when it comes to the point that the Minister must name the persons who are to control and manage a free port.</P>
      <P>I wish to make a number of other points in favour of this amendment.  The Cork Harbour Commissioners have been mentioned fairly widely.  In their briefing they indicated that there may be a push to have local authority rates reduced by two-thirds during the first ten years after the setting up of the free port.  If that is so, the House can see the wisdom of my amendment in the context of Cork Corporation or Cork County Council being involved in the consent to the control and management structure set up by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="3070" /> In addition, the harbour commissioners mentioned at point 9 in their submission that other statutory authorities providing services to the free port be permitted at their discretion to provide similar reductions in the cost of their services.  It is easy to understand how important it would be to have a local input at that level.  If control and management is divorced from that kind of scene, it is less effective in persuading those who provide services to give favourable rates as happens elsewhere in the provision of those services.</P>
    <P>Another point that arises is the question of relocation.  If there is local involvement by way of consent in the control and management structuring there is less danger of relocation.  I indicated at Second Stage that in the dismal context of manufacturing industry, particularly in Cork, there is very little left to relocate. However, the point is that if there is local involvement at the control and management level there is less likelihood of relocation because there will be someone there to stand up and say, &ldquo;we cannot have that industry taken out of the area because to relocate it would affect very badly the economy of the area.  We intend fighting to have it maintained.&rdquo;  That would put an emphasis on the establishment of new green field industry in the free port area. All of these arguments tend to underline the wisdom of the amendment which I strongly urge the Minister to accept.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>I have run out of arguments and as the Leas-Cheann Comhairle says, it has been debated at some length now.  The new point made by Deputy Wilson was that there might be a danger of relocation of a free port and then the Minister would have to give <Col N="3071" /> his consent to the new area and if there were any relocations it would obviously be on economic grounds.  It is not realistic to suggest that the Minister's powers should be restricted in this way.  I am confident that there will be total liaision because the goodwill of the local authorities will be necessary for the success of free ports in many parts of the country. Despite the arguments advanced, the introduction of the amendment suggested would not improve the Bill in any way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept what the Minister has said about the diminution of powers.  This would strengthen the Minister's powers.  Central administration might regard it as a diminution of power because consent will now be required from the people on the ground.  The Minister's powers are increased and strengthened because the Minister would be far more powerful if he had the consent of the local interests designed to make a success of this project. There is no question of the Minister's powers being diminished because the involvement of the local people will make a greater success of this venture. The Minister's powers will be diminished if he does not accept the amendment because the local vital interests will not have a say.  Throughout Europe there is too much central government and the regions are being neglected.  Nobody has a greater interest in the regions than the people living there.  There is no question that Deputy Wilson's amendment will diminish the Minister's powers.  It will strengthen the Minister's powers because <Col N="3072" /> it will make the Minister's actions more effective, with the consent of the local people.  That is where strength lies; it is strength on the ground, not strength on paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>His constituency being where it is, the Minister knows that there is a very strong move to involve local people in important economic and social procedures.  This has come from a rise in sophistication at local level, in areas away from the metropolis.  Once, most of the expertise in economic and industrial matters was concentrated in the capital city. Now, with the provision of various educational facilities particularly in the technological field all around the country, the level of expertise has risen.  For that reason, if the Minister accepts this amendment he will be on the same wavelength as most of the people at European level and at local level including, for example, the former head of the Institute of Public Administration who asserted that we are falling down in not giving more of an input to local organisations, statutory or otherwise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have some doubt about section 3 (2) in that it gives what I regard as excessive powers to the Minister. Section 3 (2) states:</P>
      <P>The Minister may with the consent of the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism, by order amend or revoke an order made under this section.</P>
      <P>I should like the Minister to expand a little on section 3 (2) to indicate what specifically &ldquo;an order&rdquo; means.  Section 3 (1)  uses the phrase &ldquo;such person or persons as may be designated by order by the Minister...&rdquo;.  Does section 3 (2) give the Minister absolute power to sack the board of management, to put it in its starkest terms?</P>

    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this subsection is to enable the arrangements for the control and management of the free port to be revised or placed on a new footing should changed circumstances so require.  Section 2 provides for the designation of free port areas and once such an area is established it will continue to be a free port, with allowance for modification of its limits.  Section 3 deals with the operator-manager of the free port.  It is necessary to provide for revocation of orders where, for example, an operation might go into liquidation.  It goes without saying that it will not be feasible to have a free port without having an operator-manager. Accordingly if an order under section 3 is revoked it follows that a new order would have to come into effect immediately to ensure that a free port under section 2 could continue to function.</P>

If that is so and as the word &ldquo;order&rdquo; is used only in the context of control or <Col N="3076" /> management in section 3 (1), the Minister is getting too much unrestrained and undiluted power in section 3 (2).</P>

      <P>I see exactly what is worrying the Deputy.  If there were a reasonable amendment which would meet the situation it could perhaps be introduced in the Seanad where there would be more time for consideration, since it is proposed to take Report Stage here later today.  It is essential to have these powers because of various difficulties which can arise.  We would find ourselves in an extraordinarily difficult situation if these powers did not exist to meet difficulties caused by trading problems or otherwise. I do not believe in the concentration of power.  I am a great believer in the most democratic possible form of the exercise of power.  If an amendment comes forward I will consider it and see what might be done in that area.  Generally speaking, there is no great danger of power being exercised in an excessive or undesirable fashion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that the powers should be there but it is power without a brake on it which causes me unease.  For that reason I think there should be a court <Col N="3077" /> of appeal or some way of modifying that power which would have to exist as the Minister said.  I will speak to my colleagues in Seanad Éireann, who are interested in this particular area, with a view to introducing, as the Minister said when we are not constrained by time, an amendment to section 3 (2) in order to, in some way, put a brake on the authority given by the Minister in this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to continue where Deputy Wilson left off.  I would have far less concern about subsection (2) of this section if the Minister had accepted Deputy Wilson's amendment. That would have meant that this subsection, because of the type of people who would be appointed to the authority, would be people with local interest.  I do not know how the Minister can say that he is in favour of a great democratic process when he has already refused to accept Deputy Wilson's amendment which would have extended the power to Cork, Greenore, Rosslare, Shannon or anywhere else.</P>
      <P>With regard to subsection (1), I am very disappointed that the Minister, representing the north-western region, could not see his way to broaden the scope of the section because I believe section 3 is the kernel of whether or not the free port is a success.  I do not care what Minister is there, how good a Minister he is or what civil servants are there. Nobody can do as much for the region as the people of the region, the people who live and work in the region and whose dependants are growing up there.  We are going more and more towards central administration with strings coming out from Dublin all the time.  This morning is another example.  We appealed to the Minister to accept the amendment but he did not.  I hope, before the Bill goes to the Seanad, that the Minister will think about the necessity to improve that position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have been talking a lot about Ringaskiddy. Surely the people in Cork are best judges of who can run their port to the best possible extent, who can get the greatest value from it?  Why do we <Col N="3078" /> have to harness all the power, be it in Merrion Street, Kildare Street or anywhere else?  This has been happening for 60 years.  I have seen the light in that respect.  In our time we tried to push through a decentralisation programme.  I have no doubt there would be many vested interests who would agitate in relation to this but the regions are being neglected, particularly Cork, where we have suffered a severe setback in a region which was doing particularly well.  I am not blaming the Government for that setback. I know there are many reasons for it, such as the development of new technology, but we lost a lot of jobs in that area.  I do not know why the Minister has to introduce section 3 in this form, with subsection (1) taking control on a centralised basis and giving me and most of my constituents the impression that the administration do not know what happens beyond Newland's Cross.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanMcGahon" hpid="Mr. McGahon Mr. McGahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>I encourage the Minister to take heed of the Fianna Fáil recommendation. I believe this has been a well disciplined debate and the suggestions put forward are very well thought out.  I ask the Minister what would happen in the case of Greenore which I believe is an ideal vehicle for the creation of a free port particularly in the light of the success of the recent Anglo-Irish agreement?  I believe that Greenore, and Warrenpoint on the other side of Carlingford Lough, provide an ideal avenue for the creation of a free port in the international waters of Carlingford Lough.  What would happen in the event of that area being created a free port?  Would it be a shared authority?  Would the Minister have total powers?  I agree with what Deputy Gene Fitzgerald said about needing a decentralisation process.  I feel the local authorities should have more concern for their own regions.  They should play a prominent part rather than have power centralised in Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am anxious to find out what the Minister has in mind in this operation. Could he give us a typical example of what he would see as the ideal board he <Col N="3079" /> talks about and under what circumstances this power would be used to take people off the board or to change it around?  I agree with the points already made about the necessity to get some representation from people who have been democratically elected onto various authorities which would have some responsibility and influence in this area. I could see a situation developing where you might have people on a particular board with quite an amount of expertise and specialist qualifications but who would have very little tactical experience of dealing with people.  This is very essential on a board of this nature where complex issues as well as a variety of issues will arise for discussion and decision and people will be involved in making decisions which will affect a great many people in these areas.  It is essential in the boards to be established to control a free port that there is representation from the democratically elected people in the different areas, such as people involved in local authorities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but the section is very relevant to what has been said.  I would like to get some indication from the Minister about what he feels this board will be and why he needs subsection (2).</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the various points raised, any group or organisation, perhaps a local authority, can come forward and seek to be the people who will run a designated free port.  All considerations, economic and otherwise, will be taken into consideration by the Minister in allocating and designating the control and management to whoever is to get it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Fitzgerald does not seem to have very much confidence in the Cork Harbour Commissioners.  With the Minister's permission they are at the moment testing the market by inviting potential investors in the free port to submit proposals for a possible joint venture.  Cork County Council may very well <Col N="3080" /> be invited.  As I said on Second Stage, and as many Deputies also said, there is possible involvement.  Assuming some grouping of that nature, obviously the Cork Harbour Commissioners will have their control group for the free port.  I cannot see much wrong with that.</P>
    <P>As regards Greenore or any of the other ports put forward, various groupings would get together.  It might not be possible to get anyone unless the economic circumstances and the outlook for the activity were good, but assuming they were, you might have competition, you might have individuals, you might have to canvass the local authorities to involve themselves in some way, but then the Minister would have to make his decision as to which grouping or organisation would best run that to the economic advantage of the area.  There is no use having organisations who do not use the facility and advantages of a free port to maximum capacity.  Therefore, the fears on this are unfounded.</P>
    <P>I will have a look at the point raised by Deputy Wilson.  He or we may have some suggestions to make on it.  I am in sympathy with the general theme underlying his argument but I do not think it would be necessary in this case.  However, if I see an amendment that will improve the Bill I will naturally be glad to do that.</P>
    <P>Regarding the various orders made, these have to be placed, as in any legislation, before the House.  Then it is a matter for the House to decide on them within the designated period.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 4.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnJRyan" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle John J. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 2 in the name of Deputy Wilson.  Amendment No. 3 to section 7 is related.  By agreement amendments Nos. 2 and 3 can be debated together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In page 3, line 41, after &ldquo;manufacture.&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;If a licence is refused <Col N="3081" /> to any person, such person has the right of appeal to the High Court.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The House will have noticed the same motivation in putting down this amendment as motivated the putting down of amendment No. 1.  Again there is undiluted power, no safeguard in the power given to the Minister here.  The section provides that:</P>
    <P>The Minister may, after consultation with the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism, grant or refuse to grant to any person a licence authorising the carrying on within a free port of any trade, business or manufacture.</P>
    <P>That is too cool.  It is a simple &ldquo;grant or refuse&rdquo;; nothing else.  It is not in accordance with usual practice to give that kind of power to a Minister without having some restraint on him.  An interesting point is that management has been covered by section 3 (1) and (2) and do not seem to have any function here with regard to the granting or refusal of a licence to a person to carry on a business or manufacture.  Again, although in accordance with section 3 the Minister has put in place a management structure, nevertheless in section 4 what one would have thought might be a function of management, or if not at least one in which management should have a strong consultancy role, the Minister is simply arrogating to himself, that is the power to grant or refuse.  For that reason I urge strongly that this amendment be accepted.  We have section 4 (1) here and perhaps from a format point of view my amendment should be section 4 (2).  I urge the House to support this amendment or alternatively to ask the Minister to accept it.  It is a generally accepted democratic principle that there should be a right of appeal. Again, I go along with the Minister when he says that such powers should exist.  I can see that the Minister or management should be in a position to refuse a licence. Someone could come along with a ready, instant plan to make small atomic bombs or napalm, with plenty of people to argue <Col N="3082" /> that it would give employment and so on. I am picking those as extreme examples to indicate that I agree with the Minister, as he stated when discussing section 3, that the powers should be there.  My contention is that those powers should be diluted by putting in a provision that there should be an appeal to the High Court.</P>
    <P>I want to make it quite clear that I am not against the Minister having the power or the power resting in the board of management, which would seem to be just as appropriate, but the Minister's say-so should not be the final arbiter.  If the person feels that he or she has a grievance that person should be in a position to appeal in the High Court.  For that reason I urge the Minister to accept this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment in the name of Deputy Wilson asks that if a licence is refused to any person, such person has the right to appeal to the High Court.  That possibility exists already. The Minister's decision under this section to refuse a licence may be challenged in the High Court, as for example, not being in accordance with natural justice, or on similar grounds.  This position obtains generally in law as regards ministerial decisions.  That covers both the amendments. The same goes for the amendment to section 7 which seeks to substitute &ldquo;provided always that an appeal may be made in the High Court, or...&rdquo;  In both of these cases the person who might feel aggrieved can go to the High Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy pointed out, there is a need in this section for the Minister to have power to be responsible for deciding on applications for licences.  It would not be right if control over the type of applicants or businesses licensed to operate within the free port should rest elsewhere than with the Minister in view of the serious implications that exist for the Exchequer, the operations of the Revenue Commissioners and industrial location policy inherent in the licensing function. As mentioned by the Deputy and by many others during Second Stage, the intention of the free port concept is that it would <Col N="3083" /> generate extra economic activity rather than a transfer of that activity from some other part of the State to the free zone.</P>
    <P>To take all those things into consideration, it is necessary to have the power proposed in the Bill.  The same goes for section 7 which we will be coming to.  As I said already the right of referral of a decision to the High Court exists already.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not satisfied that people involved should have to rely on that broad philosophic area under which a case might lie from the point of view of natural justice.  My amendment wants a specific subsection if necessary, section 4 (2), numbering what is already in the Bill as subsection (1).  I want a statement to that effect.  The Minister said, rightly, that the right to appeal exists in natural justice.  If it is made more specific by statute, the person's rights will be strong. On the basis that the rights will be stronger as a result of incorporation in statute I urge this.  I ask the Minister whether he has in his brief examples of cases taken against a Minister on the basis of an infringement of natural justice and specifically if he has one in the area of industrial development, manufacturing and so on.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  We foreshadowed it in the brief to a certain extent, but not in detail.  I am assured that it is an unnecessary provision.  No similar provision is inserted in legislation conveying the right of a person who feels aggrieved to go to the High Court in the ordinary way.  I am assured that there are full rights there already and that this amendment could not strengthen the case when it comes to the High Court or strengthen the existing possibility of its going to the High Court.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister's statement that it is necessary to have power to grant or to refuse a licence to any person.  However, while I know that the present Minister and Minister of State would not abuse this power, an unscrupulous Minister who might be in control, because he did not like the political colour of the applicant, could find enough reasons to refuse to grant such a licence.  Under natural justice that person might be afraid to take the chance to go to the High Court, but if those rights were enshrined in the Bill he would be in a stronger position and less unwilling to take the chance, especially when one considers the exorbitant cost of legal fees. That is enough to deter any but the most well off.  It is essential that the right of appeal be enshrined in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanMcGahon" hpid="Mr. McGahon Mr. McGahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support Deputy Ahern's statement.  To give total power to the Minister could pave the way for political favouritism on the part of the Minister of the day.  That would be very undesirable.  We all saw the problems which were created some years before the institution of An Bord Pleanála where political chicanery or favouritism was wrongfully shown by the then Minister for the Environment in relation to planning. Many of that Minister's planning decisions are now showing up in an unfavourable light and things like that could recur.  This section would give too much room for political expectations from the Minister of the day.  I ask the Minister to re-examine this section with extreme caution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister does not have absolute power.  I understand that there is not in the general body of legislation a specific provision such as that being sought in Deputy Wilson's amendment. I know that we are criticised on occasion, particularly by Deputy Kelly, for following slavishly, precedents in other legislation and sometimes copying the precise wording.  I agree that we should not have to follow slavishly what is there already and, if I think we can improve this, we should do so.  However, I am told that <Col N="3085" /> this insertion would not improve on the situation an iota for the person who was refused a licence on grounds that he did no think valid or appropriate in his case. Under those circumstances Deputy Wilson's amendment would not make this better legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a certain lack of logic in the approach of the Minister in that he says that a person who is refused a licence or whose licence is revoked, as mentioned in section 7, could go to the High Court on the basis of natural justice. If that is so, why is he taking such a stand against this specific right being written into the Bill?  If it does not make any difference, according to the Minister's thesis and as far as the manufacturing citizen is concerned, why not have it specifically stated in aid of the citizen?  I am urging the Minister, with all the power I can muster, to accept my amendment. As he says, it does not materially affect the legal status of the person but it does help in that it indicates that, if the Minister refuses, there is another resort specifically stated in the Act available to an appellant.</P>
      <P>Deputy Ahern and Deputy McGahon both referred to the possibility of a Minister who refused a licence or revoked one already in existence being accused of exercising political judgment in such a refusal or revocation.  I am afraid that a climate of opinion has been created, not entirely due to the activities of politicians, in which that kind of accusation will be made even where there is not the slightest shred of evidence to support it. For that reason I again urge the Minister to accept this simple amendment to sections 4 and 7, and that it be specifically stated that there is an appeal to the High Court.  Leaving out the whole juridical philosophical area where natural justice begins to apply, it looks as if the Minister is taking to himself too much power and not giving the individual concerned the right of appeal.</P>

I agree with what he says about the perception that the public have regarding political favouritism.  I am very uneasy about it and I should like to see <Col N="3087" /> the Minister accepting the arguments from the other side so that people will have a reasonable means of appeal.  I am not happy with the system that gives total power to the Minister in a Bill of this nature.  I should prefer to see the establishment of a responsible authority emanating from the county in which the port is located.  That would be the most democratic method.</P>

      <P>All the Minister is relying on is precedent.  He is merely saying that this has been the practice in Bills of this kind.  Deputies McGahon and M. Ahern have said that is not a sufficient argument to justify rejecting the case we made.  As a reasonable person, the Minister should accept the logic of Deputy <Col N="3088" /> Wilson's argument which would give protection to the people involved.  If it became clear that all power was vested in the Minister, very few citizens would be prepared to take on the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, ask the Minister to accept the amendment.  If there is precedent, it may not have been correct down through the years because we have had favouritism and patronage which have not been in the interests of the country. It would be open to any Minister to say that out of three or four applicants one was a member of his party and he would accept that application.  Therefore, it would be in the best interests of the people who might want to become involved in free ports and who would have a role to play in their management that this amendment would be accepted.</P>

      <P>On the section, I will not delay the House because under section 7 much the same line as we have been pushing since we started consideration of the Committee Stage of the Bill comes up.  I just want to express my disappointment that the Minister did not see fit to accept the amendment because I think the time has come when the Members of this House will have to take cognisance of this tendency to concentrate power in the hands of Ministers.  I will have something more to say about that on section 7.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The attention of the House, even if we cannot effect anything should be called to the terms of subsection (1) which states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister may, after consultation with the Minister for Finance and the <Col N="3091" /> Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism, attach to a licence such conditions as he thinks proper, including conditions in regard to the date, fixed by the Minister after consultation with the licensee, on or before which the licensee shall begin to carry on within a free port the trade, business or manufacture authorised by the licence.</P>
    <P>I am anxious to indicate to the House the exact words in the Bill &mdash; it is the exact words that will count &mdash; which are to the effect that the Minister may attach to a licence such conditions as he thinks proper.  Again, there is this arrogation of power.  Subsection (2) states:</P>
    <P>A licensee who does not comply with a condition attached to the licence shall, in addition to any other penalty to which he may be liable, be guilty of an offence under this section and shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding £500.</P>
    <P>Again, the power is displayed without any safeguards.  I will not make any further comment on this section because section 7 is very much in the heart of that matter again.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision in subsection (1) enables the Minister to attach conditions to a licence.  The provision concerning a date by which a business must commence is designed very much to avoid any licensee leaving a licence in effect unused due to his failure to commence the operations envisaged.  The power as outlined in the section is very necessary in that case.  Other conditions could be attached to a licence at the request of the Revenue Commissioners to regulate the proper Customs documentation and procedure within a free port and might require a particular licensee to meet requirements in that regard deriving from the nature of his business.  Deputy Wilson has reiterated his concern about the concentration of power but for the good running of the free ports this type of power is necessary and I have the utmost confidence that it will be carried out very fairly.</P>

      <Col N="3092" /> Question put and agreed to.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 7.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnJRyan" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle John J. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>We have already debated amendment No. 3 that arises on this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 4, subsection (1) (a), line 20, to delete &ldquo;or&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;provided always that an appeal may be made to the High Court, or&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I want to make a further comment on this amendment which I regard as very important on the same basis as the appeal already made not merely by me but by my colleagues Deputies Ahern, Browne and McGahon.  I want to concentrate the attention of the House on the wording in the Bill which is to the effect that the Minister may at his discretion revoke a licence if he is satisfied that there has been a breach of the conditions attached to the licence or the licensee is convicted of an offence against the Customs Acts. I agree that powers should exist, whether exercised by the Minister or the management of a free port is a matter for separate debate, but the Bill states that the Minister may at his discretion revoke a licence if he is satisfied that there has been a breach of the condition attached to the licence.  As a management structure is catered for in section 3 (1) it is quite possible that the management should be given a say with regard to whether a breach of a condition has taken place.  The Minister should be asked to take into account views other than his own with regard to whether a breach of a condition has taken place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsection (1) (b) states that the Minister may revoke a licence if the licensee is convicted of an offence against the Customs Acts.  That is a bald general statement.  Those of us who live in Border areas will know &mdash; if Greenore was designated a free port it would be particularly significant for that area &mdash; that there are very minor Customs offences.  Does the Minister mean that if a person is caught <Col N="3093" /> with a can of Harp in excess of the limit, or a small consignment, that his licence to manufacture could be revoked?  The Minister has power at any time to vary the conditions attached to a licence. Admittedly, the people who put the heads of the Bill together realised they were going a little too far and in subsection (3) of this section inserted a bit of a gesture towards the philosophy I have been putting before the House all day. That subsection states:</P>
    <P>Before revoking a licence, the Minister shall give not less than twenty-one days' notice of his intention to the licensee and shall consider any representations made to him by the licensee.</P>
    <P>Again, the Minister is the final court of appeal.  I appeal to the Minister to accept that there should be a possibility of an appeal to the High Court.  It would do a great deal for the Bill.  It will be very positive in its indication to a citizen of what his rights are prescinding from what the Minister said about the natural justice area of our legal system.  It will also lift the slur from the Minister's shoulders, a slur which people are all too willing to cast on a politician, very often with little grounds for doing so.  I urge the Minister to accept my amendment and allow an appeal to the High Court from the Minister's unaided decision to be put in place.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanMcGahon" hpid="Mr. McGahon Mr. McGahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with much of what Deputy Wilson has said.  I must express my apprehension at the total power given to a Minister in these circumstances. Clause (b) states that the Minister may revoke a licence if the licensee is convicted of an offence against the Customs Acts and that provision is likely to rear its head every day if Greenore is declared a free port, as I hope it will be. Like Deputy Wilson I would be fearful of the consequences for a manufacturer in the area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Communications (Mr. J. Mitchell)</NameTxt>
      <P>Apart from the nominal shares held by directors of the company, all shares in the B &amp; I are held by the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>I have been informed by the B &amp; I that under an arrangement entered into in 1979, more than 80 per cent of the company's employees have an interest totalling approximately 4 per cent of its capital value, in the M.V. <i>Tipperary</i>.  The amount invested by the employees amounted to approximately £400,000 on which interest is being paid by the company over a ten year period to 1989.  At the end of the period the capital sum will be repaid in full by the B &amp; I.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that the employees of the B &amp; I have shown their loyalty and solidarity in relation to the company, by way of the investment in the company of £400,000, would the Minister say whether he is satisified that the suspension of the B &amp; I operation in the southern corridor has let those workers down?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>That a separate question. However, as the Deputy will be aware, we are engaged in an exercise to <Col N="3095" /> try to save the B &amp; I and to protect the maximum number of jobs.  Any steps that might be taken would be with those objectives in view but in order to bring about the desired result some services may have to be discontinued and there will be some job losses.  Nobody can be more unhappy than I about the possibility of job losses but in this case such losses would seem to be unavoidable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the fact that the workers have indicated their solidarity and their confidence in respect of the company not be an extra spur to the Minister to ascertain whether developments elsewhere if necessary should be promoted so that the possible potentially redundant work force could be maintained in employment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be wrong of me to raise unjustified expectations such as those implied by the question.  However, I am a firm advocate of worker participation and of worker shareholdings. There has not been much development on those lines so far in this country but the idea is one that is well worth pursuing.  Many of the semi-State companies could benefit greatly by the sale of shares to the workforce.  There are some who might object to that on the basis that we would be alienating State property, for instance, but that would not be my view.  We need more of that kind of development in Irish companies in general and not only in the semi-State sector.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>I disagree with that reply on the basis that I was part of a deputation to the Minister of State seeking to have <Col N="3096" /> the broadcasting hours extended in respect of Cork Local Radio.  Consequently, I am not at all satisfied with the reply.  It is unacceptable to me.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>In the light of my question and also of the unsatisfactory reply from the Minister, would he not agree that serious consideration should be given to extending the station's hours of broadcasting? That station has served the community well in its limited time of three hour's broadcasting.  Is the Minister aware that the last extension in the hours of broadcasting was granted to the station by Deputy Wilson in 1982 when he was in charge of the Department?  I am asking the Minister to assure the House and also Cork Local Radio that he will consider seriously an extension of their hours of broadcasting?</P>

      <P>Like Deputy Lyons, he is also a fine gentlemen but that does not alter the facts of the subject under discussion.  Deputy Lyons seems to be objecting to the reply which was that no formal proposal has been put to me in the matter.  That is the position.  There have been all sorts of suggestions down through the years relating to all aspects of local radio but there has been no formal proposal in relation to the extension of the broadcasting hours of Cork Local Radio.  In the context of the development of local radio policy, a development on which I hope to make some progress in the coming weeks, I trust that the provisions in respect of Cork will be included in that consideration.  Despite what Deputy Lyons says, the reply I gave was correct.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>We are rather surprised at the reply.  I was under the impression, as was my colleague, Deputy Lyons, from <Col N="3097" /> sources within Cork radio and RTE, that an application had been made to the Minister.  I appeal at this stage to RTE to make a formal application to the Minister for an extension of hours.  Will the Minister indicate that he agrees to an extension of the hours of Cork radio?  Is the Minister aware that Cork Local Radio are competing with ERI which is an illegal radio station in the Cork region?  Does the Minister not find it inconsistent that as Minister he would not be favourable towards extending the hours of a legal radio station which is competing with an illegal station there?  It is inconsistent that the Minister would not make arrangements for an extension of the hours of Cork radio.  I compliment Cork Local Radio on their activities in providing a fine broadcasting service.</P>

As the House is aware, we have run into some difficulties on the Second Stage of the Local Radio Bill.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Communications the reason he granted a £5 licence increase to RTE and the number of licence holders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two elements in the increase of £5 in the television licence fee.  An increase of £3 was granted to compensate for the effects of inflation since the last increase came into effect on 1 November 1984.  The additional increase of £2 is a once off increase to finance a performance improvement-cost reduction programme in RTE as recommended in the report of the consultancy examination of RTE carried out last year.  The number of licence holders at the end of December 1985 was 755,095.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that the non-collection of licence fees is a cause of grave concern and that if all the people who have televisions paid the appropriate licence fees this increase would not be necessary?  Will the Minister assure the House that he will make arrangements for the full collection of all licence fees due which would prevent a further increase in the licence fees?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>There is some truth in what the Deputy says.  The estimated evasion is at an unacceptable level, although there has been a considerable improvement in the past year.  I urge that that improvement be maintained in the <Col N="3099" /> future.  There is a difficulty in that one aspect of evasion is that many people who own colour television sets are holding licences for black and white televisions, which are £18 cheaper.  The difference in the cost of the licence for a black and white television and a colour television should be phased out.  That would involve increasing the cost of a black and white television licence by more than that for a colour television and well meaning people would scream about awful discrimination against the poor.  Many people who own black and white televisions could be termed poor, but it should be noted that people such as old age pensioners who live alone have free television licences, so it would not affect the worst off people.  This is a problem and if we try to close the gap it will have social implications which might be unacceptable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. D. Gallagher Mr. D. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Communications if he will outline the proposed development of Raidio na Gaeltachta, the number of hours now broadcasting; and the range of the overall network.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>RTE have been given <Col N="3101" /> approval to increase the hours of broadcasting on Raidio na Gaeltachta to allow broadcasting to commence at 8 a.m. each weekday morning instead of 11 a.m. at present, thereby increasing maximum approved broadcasting hours on Raidio na Gaeltachta to 2,980 per annum plus 150 hours special transmissions per annum.  I understand that RTE intend to implement this extension on Easter Monday 31 March 1986.  The programming of Raidio na Gaeltachta is a matter for the RTE Authority.</P>
      <P>Raidio na Gaeltachta is broadcast nationwide on VHF and on medium wave from local low power transmitters in Connemara, Kerry and Donegal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. D. Gallagher Mr. D. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister say if Raidio na Gaeltachta have any further plans to expand their existing service? I am talking about more studios and so on, throughout the Gaeltacht.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>That is really another question.  The position of Raidio na Gaeltachta will be very much enhanced in the proposed expansion of broadcasting which is inevitable here.  Perhaps the renaming of Raidio na Gaeltachta to Radio 3 would be more appropriate. Many people interested in Irish language broadcasts have the impression that because the station is called Raidio na Gaeltachta it is only a local Gaeltacht radio service, whereas it is a national service.  I should like to see it develop more comprehensively as a national service. If that line were adopted it follows that in due course there would have to be extra studio facilities in different parts of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. D. Gallagher Mr. D. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that in my county there have been complaints during the years because of the lack of proper reception?  The area concerned also lacks the services of the other Gaeltachtaí in the matter of having people on the ground for Raidio na Gaeltachta programmes.  As Mayo is the third largest Gaeltacht and in view of the nature of the Gaeltacht itself in that it is scattered from Tourmakeady on the <Col N="3102" /> Galway border to Carratigue in the north of the county, there is a need to have a serviced studio in Mayo.  We have been looking for this over a period without success.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot go into that kind of detail because it is not appropriate for me to do so.  However, I am anxious that there would be adequate reception in respect of Raidio na Gaeltachta not only in all the Gaeltachtaí but also throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>We are delighted at the increase in the broadcasting hours of Raidio na Gaeltachta.  Has the Minister considered allowing commercials on Raidio na Gaeltachta as Gaeilge?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot recall that question having been put to me.  Of course I would consider it if it were put to me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Communications if he will make a statement on the current position regarding the MV <i>Irish Spruce</i> at Marseilles; if he will say if the vessel is under arrest; and if it is intended to sell it off.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Communications the cost to date of the maintenance of the <i>Irish Spruce</i> at Marseilles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take questions Nos. 5 and 27 together.  The <i>Irish Spruce</i> was never owned by Irish Shipping Limited; it was leased by the company from the owners, Jura Shipping Limited, and lease payments were guaranteed by the Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present position is that action has been taken in the Hong Kong and Marseilles courts by the holders of the ship's mortgage, Orient Leasing, on behalf of the financing syndicate, against Jura Shipping Limited.  These proceedings have resulted in a court judgment awarded to Orient Leasing.  I understand <Col N="3103" /> that this judgment will shortly lead to an arrest of the vessel, following which the vessel will be sold through the French courts.  The Minister for Finance will in due course discharge the liabilities arising from the guarantees he gave of the lease of the vessel to Irish Shipping Limited.</P>
    <P>I understand that the Irish crew of the vessel will be repatriated very shortly. The cost of the care and maintenance of the <i>Irish Spruce</i> while it has been berthed at Marseilles has been approximately £30,000 per week.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been a number of arrests on the ship since liquidation and as each one arose it has been dealt with.  The position is that the owners of the ship now have orders from the Marseilles and Hong Kong High Courts to take over the ship for the purpose of sale. I understand that is now progressing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>If the ship has not been under continuous arrest since November 1984, why was it not brought to its home port rather than left in Marseilles?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy does not seem to understand that we do not own this ship and never owned it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not owned by us. Incidentally, I have gone to the trouble of finding out that information and have given it out of courtesy to the House.  I am no longer responsible for this as it is now in the hands of the liquidator and the creditors.  I am giving the House the information it has been possible to get. We do not own the ship.  In relation to the matter of a home port, I wish to point out that there is no home port.  There is only one estuary in Ireland to which the ship could have gone in any event&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is engaging in semantics when he talks about a home port.  I am talking about the port that is home for the crew members who have been left out there for this time.  I want to clarify from the Minister when the lease ceased.  Is it still under lease to the liquidator of Irish Shipping? What has he done to endeavour to <Col N="3105" /> bring the ship home or to encourage the liquidator to allow the crew to bring the ship home and to deal with the matter from a port in Ireland, whether it be called a home port or anything else?  Why was that not done?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to repeat for the information of the House that the ship was not ours in the first place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>It was under lease.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Were not the crew Irish people?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the terms of the original lease, in the event of liquidation all bets were off.  This is what happened and the ship reverted to the full ownership and control of the owners. Because that happened in the circumstances of liquidation and because there are quite a number of creditors of Irish Shipping who could slap summonses or arrest the ship time and time again at any port to which it might travel there was no sense in moving the ship, even if it could have been moved from Marseilles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister was a member of the crew would he not see sense in bringing it home to Ireland?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The crew probably know more about merchant shipping law than Deputy Mac Giolla.  If there had been any attempt to move the ship it is almost certain there would have been further arrests.  Even if the ship could have been moved there would have been further arrests at the next port.  That is one of the great difficulties with regard to the Irish fleet and why the present course is now being pursued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that Jura Shipping was a company of Irish Shipping?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>No.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>It was a company of Irish Shipping established in order to get a <Col N="3106" /> lease from the owners.  Consequently there must be some hold on the ship from the point of view of the Irish taxpayers. In pursuit of what Deputy Mac Giolla said, I should like to know why the <i>Irish Spruce</i> could not have sailed out of Marseilles since there has been a reported French legal opinion that it could have done so without let or hindrance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not responsible for impressions or reports.  I just want to tell the Deputy and the House that the interests of Ireland, and as far as possible the crew, have been uppermost in our minds when dealing with this matter.  The least disadvantageous course had been pursued.  It is a matter of great regret to me that the <i>Irish Spruce</i> has not been able to remain in the Irish fleet.  However, this was outside our hands.  The matter has been decided by the courts in Hong Kong and Marseilles and the ship will be sold under orders of those courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister stated that the Minister for Finance would discharge his responsibilities or his liabilities in respect of the ship.  How much?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Wilson should be more familiar with this than I am because much of the detail of this matter was worked out during his term of office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>In his time and before that&mdash;in other words, before my time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Finance did not come into it at all until comparatively recently.  What are the liabilities the Minister for Finance has in regard to the <i>Irish Spruce</i> as mentioned in the Minister's reply?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>There is another question on that matter but I can answer the Deputy now.  The Irish Shipping liability for the <i>Irish Spruce</i> was approximately a quarter, which amounts to about £9 million.  That is the additional liability in respect of the <i>Irish Spruce</i> which the <Col N="3107" /> Minister for Finance will have to discharge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister saying that the Minister for Finance will have discharged fully his responsibilities in the next few days, if the procedure outlined takes place, by the payment of £9 million?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The discharging of the liabilities of Irish Shipping is not a matter for me and I suggest the Deputy should table his question to the Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Question No. 6.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>As you know, I have tabled this as a priority question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very important since we have 23 citizens in Marseilles digging in to try to get their rights, which they thought were guaranteed by the Irish Government.  Does the Minister think he has any responsibility to those 23 members of the crew of the <i>Irish Spruce,</i> seeing that the owner company, the leasing company and the liquidator seem to have abjured their responsibility in the matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not for me to defend the people who have just been attacked by Deputy Wilson.  As I understand it, the liquidator has met his obligations fully and is prepared to do so.  I do not see any problem about that.  Since the liquidation I have very little responsibility specifically in relation to Irish Shipping, of a legal nature at any rate.  Under general merchant shipping law I do have a certain function in the event, for instance, of sailors being stranded abroad but, contrary to repeatedly mistaken press reports, that has never happened. There is adequate provision in law to deal with the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All the crews concerned were taken <Col N="3108" /> home quite promptly and looked after very well.  In this case there has been a change over of crew every so often since the liquidation.  The full wages, salaries and allowances have been paid to the crews of the <i>Irish Spruce</i>.  They have had home leave and they will be repatriated to the State by the liquidator.  Should that fail, I will resort to my powers under merchant shipping legislation.  Whatever about my legal responsibilities, I have grave personal concern for the plight of all the people in Irish Shipping and I am heartbroken&mdash;it is not too light a word to use&mdash;that I have not been able to do more to help those people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the report that the crew have been given until noon tomorrow to get off the ship and pull down the Irish flag?  Who has the right to ask them to pull down the Irish flag without their being satisfied that their legally due moneys will be paid to them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>As the protector of the good name of Irish Shipping, would the Minister not see some role for himself in that situation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite another question but I understand that the orders of the French courts are being carried out.  A member of the Irish Embassy in Paris has been sent to Marseilles in order to ensure that all possible steps are taken to deal with any problems that arise.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the liquidator has gone out.  Is the Minister aware of the purpose of the liquidator's visit and is the liquidator the person to negotiate with the staff in regard to their claims?  Is that one of the purposes of his visit?  Will the Minister say what the final cost to the taxpayer will be when the lease is bought out, less whatever money was <Col N="3109" /> received for the ship?  What will be the eventual balance the taxpayer will have to pay to finish with the <i>Irish Spruce</i>?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>My Question No. 27 asked the Minister the cost to date of the maintenance of the <i>Irish Spruce</i> at Marseilles. The Minister says it is costing £30,000 per week, but that is not really a reply to my question as to the cost to date.  Deputy Mac Giolla has pointed out that a figure of £34,000 was mentioned in a previous reply.  What is the cost to date to the State?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not too hard to work it out approximately but it is difficult to give a precise figure because it is affected by exchange rates and by whatever final settlement is made with the crew.  It is very difficult to give an absolutely precise figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>

      <P>The Road Transport Bill, 1985, which was passed by Seanad Éireann on 3 July 1985, and which I expect will be taken in this House during the current session, contains the proposals for the future of the road haulage industry.  The Bill provides for the liberalisation of the industry in two phases over two years thus completing a process initiated under the Road Transport Act, 1971.</P>
      <P>In the first phase carriers' licences, unrestricted as to the area of operation, the type of goods to be carried and the number of vehicles to be operated, will be granted on application to existing licensees and to operators in the exempted areas who hold current road freight certificates.  Two years after the introduction of the first phase similar licences will be granted to all applicants who satisfy the EC requirements on access to the profession of road haulage operator, namely, good repute, sound financial standing and professional competence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not appreciate that the delay since this Bill was in the Seanad has led to frightful uncertainty and a limbo-like situation which has stifled investment and left those in the haulage industry in grave doubt as to their future?  Does he appreciate that unless there is a very stringent entrance examination or procedure covering new entrants to the business, liberalisation could well lead to a free-for-all and attract &ldquo;cowboys&rdquo;, leading to even greater chaos in the industry than exists at present?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very anxious to proceed with this legislation and I have had many representations about it from people in the industry.  One of the concerns of the legal road haulage industry has been the question of enforcement.  I have been examining that whole question to see if we could get some sort of cohesion into the enforcement area.  The Deputy might be surprised to know the number of different agencies which have responsibility for different aspects of enforcement.  There are the Garda and the Revenue Commissioners in relation to diesel offences.  The Department of Industry and Commerce and the Department of the Environment are concerned with road insurance.  The instance, the fitness of vehicles, markings etc. and, of course, tax and driving licences. The Department of Labour are concerned with dangerous substances and my Department are involved with tachographs. There is very little enforcement for any of those agencies.  I feel there is a very strong case for some sort of multipurpose inspectorate or agency to coordinate those matters and enforce them. I do not consider this only in relation to the road haulage industry but also the road passenger industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that no matter what reasons the Minister gives, and the difficulties that arise, the delay in the whole industry has led to frightful uncertainty?  I am sure last week the Minister experienced something in relation to the Cabinet, his own position and everybody else's position so he should have a greater appreciation. Can the Minister tell us if the legislation will be introduced and passed in this session?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I make Deputy Power an offer.  If we can get agreement between the Whips the Road Transport Bill will be in the Dáil next week.  I have been asking our Chief Whip for many weeks to try to get it on to the Order Paper, but there is a huge legislative <Col N="3112" /> programme as the Deputy knows.  I hope his intervention will help me to get it on to the Order Paper of the Dáil for next week.  It has been through the Seanad as the Deputy knows.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that as well as enforcement, which I agree with him is of paramount importance, the hauliers are also particularly worried about owner account transport and the impact over-liberalisation in that area might have on the professional licensed legal hauliers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I know the Irish Road Haulage Association have apprehensions about the legislation but they are almost the only interest group who have.  Business in general is very much in favour of the liberalisation of road haulage.  Moreover, and I have said this to the Irish Road Haulage Association on several occasions, I consider their apprehensions are misplaced.  All previous steps towards liberalisation have been of help to the legal road haulage industry.  I believe this final step will be of great help to the legal road haulage industry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an all inclusive figure.  To be more precise, the figure would be about £48.5 million at the moment but that is subject to change depending on exchange rates and other factors.  It might be a little lower than that at this stage.  That is all inclusive. It includes all costs associated with the liquidation and the guarantees of the Minister for Finance for Irish Shipping.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The total guarantees by the Minister for Finance are clear.  The liquidator's costs are fixed by the court which appointed him and they will fall to be paid out of the total guarantees made by the Minister for Finance but will not alter those sums, to any significant extent at any rate.  The guarantees in respect of Irish Shipping borrowings which the Minister for Finance is called upon to meet will be about £36 million.  The Irish Shipping share of the <i>Irish Spruce</i> costs will be of the order of £9 million and the costs in relation to the <i>Irish Spruce</i> will be of the order of £2.5 million, giving a total of under £50 million.  I should say that the current estimate of the cost of <Col N="3118" /> not liquidating and going ahead at this stage would have been about £220 million.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>If I had notice of that question I would try to get the information for the Deputy.  I have not got that information here.  The costs I have mentioned, around £48 million, are the total cost to the Minister for Finance of the liquidation of Irish Shipping.  This compares with the current Estimate of about £220 million had we continued.  I want to elaborate on this because I have had to listen to RTE for several days and to read in the newspapers about all sorts of fictional figures being thrown in as if they were fact by people who are very emotionally involved.  I want to give the facts of the matter here so that there is no misunderstanding.  At the time of the liquidation, and assuming certain projections as to tramp shipping rates, we estimated a total cost, if we had continued, of something just over £200 million.</P>

      <P>These are the facts of the matter.  I am sure Deputy Wilson is not disputing the veracity of what I am saying.  Since then tramp shipping rates have deteriorated, as I will show in another question coming up.  Because of that deterioration the present estimated cost would be of the order of close to £220 million.  The House will see that the decision we took was unavoidable.  No other decision was possible.  It would have cost the taxpayer something of the order of another £170 million to keep going.</P>

In pursuance of the questions which I was asking the Minister in relation to the employees of Irish Shipping, this was what I had in mind when I was asking about the liquidator who has gone out today to Marseilles.  Is it the liquidator's job to deal with the matter of payments due to the employees?  Is that the reason why the Minister does not include it in his estimated cost?  Would the amount paid to the 252 employees of Irish Shipping Limited eventually be included in the liquidator's cost?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>In a liquidation, a liquidator is responsible for seeing to it that the provisions of law in relation to employees are met, in other words as far as statutory redundancy payments are concerned and salary due to those people and pay in respect of leave and other <Col N="3120" /> entitlements under the law.  In addition, in this case the liquidator has been acting as an agent because the staff of the <i>Irish Spruce</i> were kept on for the past year and three months.  Under those circumstances he was asked not to make these people redundant, but to retain them in employment.  The best administrative way of doing this was for him to continue to pay them and be reimbursed.  That forms part of the guarantees of the Minister for Finance.  They are part of the £48 million to £50 million about which I was talking.</P>

      <P>It is not possible to say at this stage what the cost of the project will be as it will depend on a variety of factors which have yet to be determined such as the configuration of the satellite network, the number of satellites to be launched, insurance costs <Col N="3121" /> etc.  It is clearly a several hundred million pound project.  Likewise, the Government share in the project has not yet been finalised and negotiations on this matter are continuing.</P>
      <P>Apart from informal discussions with my counterparts in the Spanish and Portuguese Governments, the answer to the last part of the question is no.</P>

      <P>The answer in relation to the total cost should be given by the Minister at this stage.  Would he inform the House if he has signed the contract with the Atlantic Satellite Company for the launching of the direct broadcasting satellite?  In relation to the other part of the question, has he entered into discussions with the British Government on a possible joint venture launching under the umbrella of the Atlantic Satellite Company, Stafford's company.</P>

      <P>I cannot give a cost for a project the details of which are not yet known and which are still being discussed.  We have not given a contract to the Atlantic Satellite Company.  We have entered into a commitment to seek to negotiate a contract and those negotiations are going on at the moment.  I personally have had no discussions with the British Government.  It would be fair to say that there has been an exchange of views at official level between officials of the British Department of Trade and Industry and other relevant Departments and on our part the officials of my Department.  There has just been an exchange of views, no proposal, no negotiations, no suggestions.</P>

We will start off with a very strong prejudice in favour of a European satellite, all other things being equal.  Of course, if the American offer was a better one&mdash;and that is a derisory thought&mdash; we would have to take it.

The proposals are at present being considered by the Government who have not yet made a decision in the matter.  In the circumstances, it would not be appropriate for me to discuss the substance of the proposals.</P>
      <P>Since the company's statutorily authorised share capital of £58 million has been fully taken up, the provision of further State equity for the B &amp; I would require amending legislation.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister agree that their new structure, as elaborated on by the new chairman and chief executive of B &amp; I, depends on the provision of £43 million, neatly costed, and would he agree, seeing that the southern corridor arrangement seems to have been put in place, although two ships are being used in place of the jumbo which they could not find, that it is a matter of some urgency that the Minister should clarify for the House and the country the Government's position in regard to the £43 million?  Would he state specifically if it has been considered by the Government, even though they have not made a decision on it?  Would he state when he thinks a decision will be made on this, as it is a vital matter for the future of the company?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy may take it that a decision will be made in the very near future by the Government.  A Bill to give effect to the decision to make some investment in B &amp; I should come before the House quickly.  As I said in my original reply, I do not wish to be drawn into a discussion on the substance of B &amp; I's proposals.  It is clear, however, that the company are in urgent need of a drastic overhaul because of their financial position.  It is my hope that the reorganisation will achieve a bright future for B &amp; I and for as big as possible a proportion of their staff.  I want to protect the maximum number of jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been proposals by the board; it is possible to consider variations of those proposals, and I am looking at <Col N="3127" /> variations at the moment.  I hope the Government will be able to come to a conclusion in the very near future on my thoughts in the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I right in thinking that included in the £43 million is an amount of equity for which the Minister will have to come to the House with a Bill?  If I am right, would the Minister state how much of the purported investment of £43 million is not by way of equity?  Could he give an idea of the areas that amount is expected to cover?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been well publicised that the board are looking for investment of £43 million by way of equity or grants.  They have asked for £43 million of equity.  About half of that is in respect of previous losses because of dissipation of equity by the accumulation of losses during the years.  The other half is in respect of restructuring the company. There are two major parts and there may be two different ways of dealing with it.</P>

      <P>As I have said, I do not want to be drawn into a detailed discussion until a decision has been taken by the Government.  The total package put up by the board includes all of the restructuring costs.  The plight in which B &amp; I find themselves highlights the awful way in which the State dealt with State companies over the years.  I do not blame any Government.  For years we dealt with State companies in an awful way.  For instance, there was no accountant in my Department until I came to office yet we were dealing with the biggest companies with the largest number of employees in the country.  There were no questions being asked, no formalised relationships, no budgets against which performance could be judged.  There was frequent day-to-day interference.  We have changed that.  B &amp; I are the last of the series of companies that I have set out to reform. <Col N="3128" /> I hope the decision the Government will come to will set B &amp; I on the road to a brighter future.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>My concern is that if a person were to be injured in a road accident and were to <Col N="3161" /> develop some complications later on as a result of the accident which had not been provided for in any settlement, a health board might charge that person, as they would be entitled to do under this legislation. I know there is a discretion for health boards to waive charges.  Nevertheless I fear that it would be possible, if health boards were to find themselves short of revenue, that they might pursue somebody, or charge him, for services rendered or maintenance in a hospital on the basis that the services were provided to deal with a complication of accidental injuries.</P>

      <P>The amendment covers one of the reservations I have concerning this Bill, that is, the whole question of how far the health board can go in claiming charges from a patient.  It strikes me that it is possible that treatment arising from a road accident could go on for many years after an accident occurred and after compensation had been paid.  Is it the intention that, once the board assesses a patient as being liable to pay for hospital care or outpatient care, that will stand until such time as they consider that the compensation has been totally spent or paid out?  The part of the Bill to which this amendment <Col N="3162" /> refers would appear to give the power to a board that, regardless of when the care may be provided, once it is necessitated by a road accident the board will have a right to claim from the person concerned. That is one of the concerns I have in relation to the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>The problem we see with the &ldquo;will be provided&rdquo; aspect of this is that these charges can only be estimated.  One may ask whether the recipient will be asked to pass to his health board whatever moneys he is awarded to cover the services he will require in the future to treat his injuries. If that is the case, what will become of the moneys if the anticipated need does not materialise, or if the individual dies without availing of the services which he had indicated would be required?  Will the health board be entitled to be heard in court and to be involved in out of court settlement consultations and, if not, what redress will be open to a health board in a case where a claimant has understated his claim in respect of medical expenses?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond) Barry Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have examined carefully the proposed deletion of the words &ldquo;or will be&rdquo; from section 2(1)(b) and I have come to the conclusion that the effect of this would be to deprive health boards of the right to charge for services in respect of an injury subsequent to the person receiving compensation or damages.  We must always bear in mind that we are talking about specific instances where compensation and damages are adjudicated on and the right of the health board to recover a degree of moneys.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to Deputy O'Hanlon's amendment one could take a typical case where a person is permanently incapacitated by an injury received in a road traffic accident.  Naturally that person receives treatment prior to his claim being assessed by the courts.  At the time of assessment he is receiving treatment on a permanently incapacitated basis and he expects to continue to receive treatment subsequent to the grant of compensation. The special damages would <Col N="3163" /> include compensation for past treatment and would also allow for whatever treatment might be foreseen in the future. That would be the normal method of assessment of compensation.  If we were to delete the words as proposed by Deputy O'Hanlon we might finish up in a situation where health boards would be excluded from charging for future treatment even though the damages awarded took account of the cost of such treatment.</P>
    <P>Another very important aspect of this Bill is where a court awards compensation and where, in the opinion of the health board, the damages are not sufficient for the ongoing and the future treatment of the person concerned, or where the damages have been so reduced in the heel of the hunt, after a long period of years.  As we know, it can take up to five years, or more to get settlement.  Health boards, in those circumstances, have discretion under the Bill to waive the whole or part of the charges.  I submit to my colleagues that the Bill as framed meets the wishes of Deputies and that the House would be wise not to press the amendment unduly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the difficulty outlined by the Minister.  He gave an example of a person who was permanently incapacitated as a result of injury. I believe that such a person would be covered by subsection 2(1)(b) which states:</P>
      <P>In-patient services or out-patient services have been, are being ...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am suggesting that we delete &ldquo;will be&rdquo; and that, at that point, they are being provided and that the court could equally decide to grant an award for the treatment that would be necessary.  Let us take an alternate example of, say, somebody who suffers a whiplash injury to the neck. There is a court settlement in perhaps two years' time and the person is not having any serious trouble with his neck then but in five or six years time he may well have developed arthritis in the neck <Col N="3164" /> with serious neurological complications in the arms.  The health board at that stage might charge a person for the service it was necessary to provide because it was legitimately the result of an accident that person had been involved in five or six years previously.  We want to guard against health boards doing that.</P>
    <P>The Minister pointed out that in awarding damages, courts take into consideration the cost of care and attention particularly where a person has been incapacitated.  Where it is possible to measure the extent of that incapacitation the courts award damages, but there are many other aspects to awards of courts and it is not always possible to say how much of the award relates to the need for treatment in the future.  Indeed, in the case that gave rise to this legislation, Cooke versus Walsh, damages were awarded under eight different headings: hospital expenses to the date of the trial, hospital expenses for 12 months after the trial, the cost of alteration to the father's house to suit the needs of the child, the loss of expectation of life, future loss of wages, cost of future care, general damages to the date of the trial and general damages in the future.  We want to ensure that if a person receives an award health boards will not charge that person, if he or she is entitled to the service otherwise, if he or she has not received damages to cover the cost of treatment in the future.  In many instances, including the one I have outlined, it is not possible to foresee the consequences of a road accident or the injuries a person might suffer.</P>

      <P>I listened carefully to what the Minister said and I do not think he replied to the point I raised.  To what extent will a board have the right to claim charges against a person who may require services, whether in hospital or as an outpatient, in the future?  Is it the case that a board will be entitled to claim until such time as they consider that an adequate sum, or no sum, remains of the compensation received by the injured person?  It seems to me that the board's <Col N="3165" /> right to claim for future care is not dependent on the court, or any other body, deciding that compensation includes an amount of hospital or outpatient care. There are cases where claims are settled on a global figure.</P>
      <P>In the case of compensation claims settled by the Motor Insurance Bureau, <i>ex gratia</i> payments or lump sums are made, but they are not broken down on a percentage basis for hospital care and so on.  A person who sustains a head injury and is detained in hospital overnight may legally have a claim for compensation for such an injury but may not pursue it because he or she may consider the injury to be slight but in the future it may be more serious.  To what extent will a health board have a claim against such a person?</P>

      <P>My general response is to refer Members to section 2(2).  It is of critical importance that there is within the Bill a power to enable a health board to waive the whole or part of the charge levied under subsection (1).  The discretion is quite deliberately left to health boards who will have to have regard to the amount of damages received and to any reduction in the damages awarded by virtue of contributory negligence, an aspect that is of importance.  The provisions are necessary and entirely reasonable in order to obviate any hardship on the individual arising out of an insufficient or a reduced award by the courts. It protects the Minister of the day against the very charge which preoccupies Deputy De Rossa, that we are singling out persons injured in a road accident for unfair or invidious discrimination.  The services can still be provided free of charge or at a reduced charge, depending on the circumstances of the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The health board will also take into account cases where an injured party is awarded damages but does not have any hope of collecting them.  It is of considerable importance to bear in mind that, where damages are assessed in court and where the cost of the treatment is built into the amount of the award, it is manifestly unfair that health boards which <Col N="3166" /> must provide services do not have any prospect of recouping from that award the very substantial amount of money involved.  Frequently a lifetime of total care is involved for the person concerned. Where money is paid out by an insurance company or where there are out of court settlements, a health board should be entitled to their fair share of such an award in certain circumstances.</P>
    <P>The fears Deputies may have in regard to the Bill are unnecessary.  Putting this in a very broad sense I should like to state that the fact that this problem has not been remedied for five or six years has meant that the health system has lost the best part of £20 million.  That amount of money has gone to individuals by way of compensation for damages and treatment which was provided by the health boards. The provision is an effort to remedy that. We are revising the system and, by and large, I have not met any substantial arguments in opposition to the broad thrust of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">

      <P>My difficulty is that the Bill gives health boards discretion in that they may waive the whole or part of the charge, according to section 2(2) (a). However, it is not stated that the health board will waive such a charge in the event of a person not being awarded damages that would take into account the cost of any future and unforeseen illness. Can the Minister give some assurance that the health board would not charge a person in respect of a complication that would manifest itself four or five years after the accident and where a case had been settled without the injured party not being awarded compensation to cover the cost of future treatment?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonalOrmonde" hpid="Dr. Ormonde Dr. Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps at the outset we were a little remiss in not congratulating the Minister for having held out against all the attempts to transfer him. I should like to rectify that omission now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred to the £20 million that has been lost to the health boards since the Cooke v. Walsh case. As a member of a health board I can assure the Minister that we were equally <Col N="3167" /> distressed about this especially as the Minister made no attempt to compensate the health boards for that loss.</P>
    <P>In this Bill we are missing a golden opportunity to sort out a number of problems. As I said on Second Stage, it can be argued that in this country a person injured in a road accident has an incentive not to avail fully of all the available rehabilitation services which, I might add, are among the best in Europe.  The greater the recovery from an accident the less the injured party will receive by way of compensation.  Therefore, there is an argument for deferring calculations of compensation until such time as the injured party has availed fully of whatever rehabilitation programme has been recommended for him following medical and vocational assessment.  As I said previously, this is not a matter for the Minister but it would benefit motor insurance financially to fund rehabilitation programmes in the case of road accidents.  In this way they would be ensuring greater recovery and, consequently, less in payouts.</P>

      <P>The point made by Deputy Ormonde is very reasonable but it is outside the remit of this Bill.  One would have great difficulty in enlarging the scope of the Bill into the area mentioned by the Deputy but I should hope that in future legislation we would grapple with the problem in question.  I would be reluctant to make it mandatory on the health boards to provide a waiver.  This is an enabling provision and I might find myself in considerable difficulty with the parliamentary draftsman if I were to include a mandatory &ldquo;will&rdquo; as distinct from &ldquo;may&rdquo; at this stage.</P>

      <P>I apologise to the Minister if I seem to be niggling at something which may be obvious to him but there is the question of the extent to which any health board will have the right to pursue a person for money from compensation acquired in an out of court settlement and which may not include <Col N="3168" /> specific amounts for hospital or out-patient care.  There is also the question of cases where there are <i>ex gratia</i> payments, especially from the Motor Insurance Bureau.  I had experience of one case in which a young man lost his leg in a hit and run road accident and consequently liability could not be pinned on any individual with the result that the bureau are making an <i>ex gratia</i> payment of some small amount, in the region of £3,000 to £4,000, but the board concerned are insisting that limbs will not be provided unless they are given a commitment that if the compensation includes payment for limbs the person concerned will pay the money over to the board.  The bureau insist that they will not make a payment setting out what that payment is for.  That is the difficulty in which that person finds himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I would make the broad point that legislation of this nature will mean that in future when claims are made, the plaintiff will know without question that the health board have statutory power to recoup their expenditure in the case.  The insurance companies will be aware of that position, too, and also where people are settling out of court they will know the prospects facing them. That would apply even in respect of <i>ex gratia</i> payments.  An effort would be made to make provision within the framework of a settlement for the prospective health board or hospital charges. I will endeavour to issue guidelines to the health boards and to the hospitals regarding charges.  It would be impossible to specify charges in a Bill or indeed to provide for various specific regulations because these vary with the type of injury, with the type of hospital treatment required and so on.  However, we will make an effort in that direction in a sensitive way and in consultation with those agencies.  By and large, though if the settlement is minimal and if the contribution by the bureau is purely token, the health board will have no option but to forego their claim because a person cannot be discriminated against in an obvious way.  That is the area that was <Col N="3169" /> challenged in the Supreme Court on the grounds that there was discrimination against persons injured in road accidents and that that discrimination was unconstitutional.</P>
      <P>We are changing that situation but we cannot make it retrospective.  We can create a new situation even where there is very little by way of compensation and the health board have no hope of recouping money.  The prospect is there, though, for the recovery of some moneys.  The yearly cost to the health boards in this area of £4 million represents a lot of money.  The hospitals and the health boards are entitled to a recoupment of that kind of money.</P>

      <P>I would expect the health boards not to be slow in bringing forward their claims on the basis that they had spent a great deal of money.  They will be making that case very emphatically to the plaintiffs.  The expenditure in these cases would be fairly well established and the courts would regard the sum put forward as a definite sum within the framework of a settlement.  Such considerations as loss of earnings and degree of contributory negligence are very much more subjective in terms of a settlement. We are dealing with a difficult area but bearing in mind that the Bill must remain within the interpretation of the Constitution it is fair and reasonable and will bring to an end this particular anomaly.</P>

      <P>I might not disagree with a health board's right to seek recoupment from moneys awarded in court but <Col N="3170" /> my concern would be that if, say, someone were awarded £50,000 in lieu of wages and at a future date they developed some unforeseen complication, there is nothing in the Bill which would prevent the health board from charging for services out of that £50,000.  I am concerned about that.</P>
      <P>In relation to constitutionality, the constitutionality of the legislation was never tested because in the Cooke v. Walsh case it was decided that it was <i>ultra vires</i> for the health board to charge the person concerned and the court did not get as far as trying the constitutionality of it.  My main concern is that the health boards could charge a person out of an award that was given by the court for some other reason, not to cater for some complication that arose many years later. If the Minister could give some assurance on that, that would satisfy us.</P>

      <P>The Minister said he would issue guidelines to the health boards for implementing this Act.  Would the Minister require the boards to give notice of a person's right to seek a waiver in demands going out to persons who have been treated as a result of road accidents?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Where a person has a serious injury he would be notified that it is the wish of the health board that he should recover the cost of that treatment by way of damages as a charge within the framework of damages and he would be billed by the health board for his hospitalisation. That bill would be presented by his solicitor as part of the special damages claim by him when claiming for the loss of his car, his employment, his earnings and his hospitalisation.  The health boards are capable of making that kind of information available to a plaintiff.  As part of the settlement the judge would make that bill part of the overall total paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If a plaintiff could prove that he got £20,000 exclusively for loss of wages, the health board would have great difficulty in claiming any part of that for health charges and the judge might regard the <Col N="3171" /> charge submitted by the hospital concerned as being grossly excessive.  A person might have totally exhausted his VHI and still opt to spend another four or five months in a private ward and as part of his judgement, a judge might compensate the person for payments in relation to a public ward but require the plaintiff to pay the rest out of his total damages.  That is the kind of framework we are talking about.  That is why it will be necessary for the Department of Health and the Minister of the day to issue guidelines to health boards to ensure that this applies in a fair and reasonable manner and that there is not a major trawl by the health boards of those kind of settlements in an inequitable way.  That will not happen.  As health boards have pointed out time and time again in cases where substantial damages are paid and implicit within those damages is the requirement to pay for the cost of treatment for injuries sustained, not a penny is paid to the hospital by the person concerned, or his legal representative, for anything up to two or three years treatment.  I sympathise with the health boards in that framework.  I am quite prepared to receive suggestions from Deputies in relation to guidelines as applied to health boards so that within the Department of Health we can frame our guidelines in a sensitive way within the framework of the Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Where major accidents involving major claims occur the solicitors on both sides will normally ensure the best for their clients, but it is not uncommon for people involved in relatively minor accidents to be detained overnight or over a weekend in hospital for observation and, where no claim is involved to be billed by the hospital. Unless he is very well informed the person who receives that bill will assume that he must pay it.  This is why I ask if it is not possible to include in whatever guidelines are issued to the health boards that a specific statement be included with such bills to the effect that persons are entitled to seek a waiver of the charges <Col N="3172" /> being applied in certain cases.  They will then have the option to get legal advice or apply for a waiver of the charge. People will at least be made aware of their rights in that situation.  This would not necessarily occur in major cases where there is serious injury, but in cases where due to ignorance a person might feel obliged to pay a bill which he need not pay at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>We are anxious that in advising their clients all legal representatives would notify them of the prospect of the health board having an entitlement to charge and that, as such, the prospect of including that charge in a claim would be obvious early on where any claim for damages or personal injury was being prepared.  In terms of minor issues if it was virtually a nuisance charge, I do not think a health board will demand payment from individuals for relatively small amounts of money such as in cases where people go into a casualty unit for a few hours and receive treatment and where there might not be a subsequent claim.  Nowadays usually by the time the medical and legal professions are finished with a case involving personal injury, it tends to assume substantial proportions and, where people feel that the other side is fully insured, they invariably demand the full pound of flesh.  I do not see why in those circumstances a health board should not have a prospect of recoupment of some of this money.</P>
      <P>I will certainly bear in mind what the Deputy said in relation to a person's prospect of a waiver.  That should be known, but not to the extent that the lawyers will turn around on a mutual settlement and say we are putting nothing in there now and that would prevent the health board from claiming.  We have to establish the right of the health board to claim this money and it would be up to the plaintiff then to argue as to why a health board charge was not put into his damages. The purpose of the Bill could be totally nullified if there was that kind of mutual collusion between the two parties.</P>

      <P>I will take the case of a person involved in a minor accident where there is no injury caused other than perhaps shock and who has to remain in hospital for one or two nights.  That person receives a bill for £300 from the health board and this can have one of two effects.  Either he goes immediately to a solicitor to initiate the whole process of claiming, perhaps against his mother or father who was driving the car, or else he is frightened into paying the bill.  Where a health board claim charges from a person who has received care as a result of a motor accident, notification should be given that in certain circumstances a waiver is possible.  The person concerned could then get further information from the board on the grounds on which a waiver might be granted.  This could mean that people would not be driven into the hands of solicitors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important to bear in mind that the recovery by the health board of any moneys is after compensation or damages have been paid. The Deputy seems to envisage a situation where a health board would force a person down the road towards claiming compensation.  At the moment ordinary out-patient, casualty and emergency services are free for those in the categories who are free entitled to the services.  I do not see that kind of preoccupation as envisaged by the Deputy on the part of <Col N="3174" /> the health boards.  They know they will not get any money from anybody for any service until compensation is paid.  They would be very reluctant to force a person to the point where he might or might not win a case.  The board would have great difficulty in sustaining the charge against the person concerned if he was reluctant to proceed and could not recover the money.  We are talking about a restrospective clawback by the health boards. In the guidelines I shall issue to the health boards I shall clarify those issues so far as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister quite rightly has said that actual payment follows compensation, but the actual sending out of the bill does not wait until all the procedures in court or otherwise have been completed.  The likelihood is that the hospital will send out a bill to the person after a week or two.  I am persisting in this because I have had experience of a number of people who suffered minor injuries and who were not interested in pursuing claims either against insurance companies or relatives.  These people got bills from hospitals and they were frightened at the prospect of having to pay them.  The result was that they went to solicitors to find out what were their rights in the matter.  Because of the nature of funding of hospitals and the various shortfalls under which the boards have to operate, people will be driven into issuing as many bills and claiming as much money as possible.  It is only reasonable that, where hospitals or health boards issue bills to people in respect of care following motor accidents, the people concerned should at least be notified that there is a possibility of a waiver in certain circumstances.  I will leave it at that.  The Minister knows my views on the manner and I hope he will follow it up.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>On Second Stage I <Col N="3175" /> raised the point which Deputy De Rossa has mentioned but in a different way.  If people are involved in minor injuries and stay in hospital for one or two nights they may be presented with a bill for £200 or £300.  Many of them are forced unnecessarily into litigation because they do not realise they are entitled to a waiver. Secondly, somebody may advise them that having received an account they should take the matter to a solicitor and thus they find themselves, against their wishes, involved in litigation.</P>
      <P>On Second Stage I suggested that some way might be found whereby the insurance companies would accept responsibiity for payment of these accounts where a person was insured, without admission of major liability for future claims.  That would be in the interest of the person injured and of the insurance company because they would not become involved in expensive litigation.  Even though at the end of the day the settlement may be small, as the Minister has pointed out litigation could be very expensive.  I suggest that the umbrella insurance company could come to an agreement with the health boards with regard to people who may be detained in hospital overnight for a minor injury.  Some way should be found where by they would not find themselves in a position where they had to go to litigation in order to have their small account waived.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many people who do not realise that if they do not press for litigation their account will be waived automatically if they are otherwise entitled to the service by virtue of a medical card or not.  I would ask the Minister if something could be done along those lines.  It is important to keep the cost of claims as low as possible.  The Minister rightly points out that the health boards lost £20 million over the years as a result of this Supreme Court case but that £20 million was taxpayers' money.  It might come from a more specific group, namely, motorists, who already find themselves hard pressed as a result of the various charges involved in motoring nowadays. It is all taxpayers' money.  While here <Col N="3176" /> we are primarily concerned with health legislation and charges to health boards, nevertheless as responsible representatives we must keep an eye on other areas where taxpayers are involved.  Would the Minister see any way in which the insurance companies might accept responsibility for minor accidents where there is no need for major litigation to decide on a settlement but where a person does not want damages but simply wants to have the account paid?</P>
    <P>Is the Minister satisfied that the legislation will stand up constitutionally?  A number of people outside the House have stated that it discriminates against the motorist, while public liability and employers' liability are not included.  It is claimed that for this reason it may well be found to be unconstitutional.  In the Cooke <i>versus</i> Walsh case the constitutionality was never tested, while it was an issue before the court, because the court decided that the regulations were null and void and it was <i>ultra vires</i> for the Minister to allow the health board to charge.  They did not go any further than that point in the court and so the constitutionality was never tested.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister could explain section 2 (2) (b) which contains a technical provision enabling the courts to disregard the discretion of the health board to waive charges in determining the amount of damages to be assessed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>When we were originally drafting this Bill I was acutely aware that there was a Supreme Court judgment in that regard and I can assure the Deputy that the Attorney General was very much aware of it as well.  Fairly comprehensive advice was received before proceeding with the Bill.  We are now satisfied that the constitutionality of the Bill does stand up.  Regarding the issue of bills, it should be possible for the health board in issuing guidelines to ask individual clients to notify the health board if they intend to go ahead and claim compensation or damages in relation to injuries sustained in a road accident.  The account is kept frozen until the compensation is settled.  If, on the other hand, a <Col N="3177" /> person receives a minor bill and writes back saying that he or she does not propose to pursue a claim for damages, that in effect is the end of the matter because a person's eligibility comes into play at that stage.  It should be possible to ensure that people are not alarmed when, after being involved in a road accident, they receive an account from a health board some months later for treatment given.</P>
      <P>Regarding section 2 (2) (b), this provides technical cover where such power to waive a charge cannot be taken into account in proceedings for determination of the amount of damages.  Without this cover it is possible that a court could award a lesser amount of damages knowing that the charges can be waived or reduced.  It is a technical cover within the Bill.</P>

Technically all services provided in the State are provided through the agency of the health boards in their respective areas under the Health Act, even though we directly fund a number of voluntary hospitals.

      <P>I have one further point concerning the consultants and I would ask the Minister not to cry &ldquo;vested interest&rdquo;. Will the consultants be entitled under this Act to charge a patient whose income at the time of receiving his injury did not leave him liable to pay his consultant fees for ordinary hospital treatment? If it is so intended will these charges be included in the health board's claim and paid by the health board to the consultants?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>We are basically <Col N="3179" /> dealing with hospital charges as such.  It may be that consultants under a general claim would be claiming through the hospital account but, by and large, the consultants are not particularly claimants under this Act.  It is the health boards who would be claiming for services provided by them.  If, for example, a private patient is involved, obviously that person is precluded under this.  A consultant providing services to a person would have to make an entirely separate claim, because such consultants are outside the ambit of the health board claim.  I am quite sure they will be well able to look after themselves in those accident cases.</P>

      <P>Where a person receives in-patient consultant services as a normal part of the hospital treatment that is part of the charge that would be presented. If, on the other hand, he goes in as a private patient arising out of a road accident that would be excluded.  I have no doubt that would be part of the damages sought.  The normal bill that would come would be one which would be submitted by a voluntary hospital through a health board itemising charges as the person's accident charge.  If he is placed in a private room with a private consultant that is a different matter.  That would be a separate matter altogether.</P>

      <P>In relation to subsection (2) (b) how would that operate in the two situations?  It says:  &ldquo;In proceedings brought by a person...&rdquo; Do I take that to mean in court proceedings only, or does it exclude where solicitors or insurance companies are negotiating between each other outside the court? Does it refer only to court proceedings? How practical does the Minister see it? <Col N="3180" /> Is this a statement that a judge or a jury, in deciding compensation, are instructed that they must ignore the fact that, if compensation is reduced or if damages are of a certain level, hospital charges may not be claimed and they must ignore the possibility of a waiver?  How will it operate in court proceedings?  If it refers exclusively to court proceedings how does the Minister propose to cope with the situation where in private negotiations outside of court a settlement is made specifically with a view to avoid paying the health board for the hospital charges incurred as a result of an injury?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">

      <P>Where people have a liability and where a health board feel there is any collusion between the parties, particularly where there might be a reluctance on either side to admit liability or the extent of culpability, the health board are not precluded from pressing ahead with the charge and insisting that it be paid.  Generally the settlement between the parties is made within the framework of the court case.  I hold the view that the Act as framed enables the health board to press ahead and ask a person: &ldquo;Is it a private settlement?  How much did you obtain?&rdquo;  If the person says: &ldquo;I only got paid my wages and for the loss of my car and compensation for my wife who was with me and was tragically killed&rdquo; and the health board then say: &ldquo;We spent £70,000 keeping you alive for five months.  Did you not claim?&rdquo; and the person then says: &ldquo;No, I did not&rdquo;, the health board would take a dim view of that in terms of being effectively deprived of moneys which they would seek.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The legal representative of the health board, in contact with the plaintiff's solicitors would make it quite clear that they expected at least some recoupment of the massive public expenditure involved in the case itself.  The legal officers of health boards, who are very experienced people, would make sure that the health board did not finish up before the court. They are very concerned in relation to their general approach, and rightly so, being public agencies.  They would handle a case like that with considerable firmness <Col N="3181" /> and would ensure that reasonable payment was made.</P>

      <P>I said that the Minister brought the case right back to the point of my amendment.  He stated that if a person was awarded damages, say, for loss of wages, loss of a wife in an accident and loss of a car, and did not claim damages for future treatment, the health board would take a very poor view and presumably would press for treatment in these circumstances.  This would be unreasonable to the victim of such an accident, because the victim is very much at the mercy of legal advice and presumably there would be some legal advice as to why he or she did not press for charges for future treatment for health.  What worries me about this legislation is that persons who get an award for, say, the loss of a car, the loss of wages or the tragic loss of a relative, will find themselves paying out that money for future treatment and particularly treatment of unforeseen complications that might arise as a result of the accident.  I want to be assured that that would not be the case because generally it is not the victim who makes the decision to press for damages for the cost of medical treatment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I can well appreciate the point the Deputy makes.  As we know, in the overwhelming majority of cases the victim would initiate the proceedings for damages, but a health board have to issue a charge in such road accident cases, otherwise they will not establish for the plaintiff the amount of money he should look for in terms of damages. That is why the health board must have that enabling power of establishing the cost.  We know that everybody in the country is unaware of the magnitude of such costs until presented with the reality of what it costs to keep a person in an acute hospital even for one week.  That is why it is essential that we have the Bill up and running.  If there are any defects in the Bill in the lifetime of the Dáil after working it in now &mdash; I hope it will apply pretty well immediately in terms of 1986 &mdash; I will be only too willing to come back to the House and amend it further to <Col N="3183" /> tighten it up or, if it has excessive ridigity in it, I will be only too willing to entertain amendments subsequently, but I would like to get the CEOs, their programme managers at local level and their legal officers involved in administering this Bill as quickly as possible.  Road accidents nowadays consume a great deal of health care and hospital maintenance and treatment.</P>

      <P>It seems that the net effect of this will be in relation to the waivers.  People will be driven into the hands of solicitors unless they are advised of their rights to a waiver.  It may even drive people further to the point where court proceedings would be initiated in order to establish the level of their culpability or otherwise in the accident.  This Bill may well be a recipe for increasing the whole range of cases that come before our courts.  While I said at the beginning that I do not agree with the direction in which this Bill is going in relation to recouping the costs of hospital services in some cases, it could be approached from a different direction.  Even within itself it has section 2 (2) (b) which defeats effectively the purpose of what it sets out to do.  It is, so to speak, providing the escape hatch in many cases where proceedings are not initiated, where settlements are made not just out of court but simply by agreement as a result of a claim.  I have no statistics on the matter but there must be at least as many minor claims against insurance companies as there are claims for major injuries.  On the basis of the Bill as it stands it is quite feasible for an insurance company to say, &ldquo;You got a whiplash in that accident and there was minor damage to the car.  We will give you £5,000 and you will sign a form saying that we are not liable for any future medical costs as a result&rdquo;.  In those circumstances the person as a result of a whiplash injury could be attending hospital for physiotherapy and attending consultants of one kind or another for years afterwards.  It seems that here is an escape hatch for the insurance companies, whom we are told the Bill is <Col N="3184" /> brought in to catch, for the costs of the motor accidents.</P>
      <P>The Minister says that in cases where the medical costs are not adequately claimed by the victim of the accident the board will take a dim view of that and, therefore, their option to apply a waiver would not be as generous as it might be. Then the board must judge whether the person did not claim the medical expenses past, present and future, out of ignorance or out of collusion with the insurance company.  Then you are into an area which will lead to all sorts of claims, counterclaims and queues at Deputies' advice centres all over the country and people complaining about how the boards are treating them regarding their hospital benefits in relation to motor accidents. I do not know how the Minister can overcome that.</P>
      <P>I do not agree with the Bill in general, not because of its approach, but I think we have reached a point in discussing it where it seems as a result of section 2 (2) (b) to defeat its purpose.  Certainly in many cases that will be settled by agreement and without proceedings of any kind being initiated.</P>

      <P>Let me make one brief point.  In our general guidelines to the health boards we will endeavour to make quite clear to the boards the type of claims which we feel the boards should follow through by way of claim and recoupment of moneys from compensation and damages received.  We must leave it effectively in that framework and we will see how the Bill will operate, but we must recover in a reasonable manner, with a waiver provision, charges in respect of persons who have received or are entitled to receive damages or compensation for injuries caused in a road traffic accident.</P>

      <P>I want to come back to a point raised by Deputy Ormonde.  The Minister announced by press release when the Bill was circulated that the effect of the proposed legislation would be to restore the position which obtained prior to the Supreme Court judgement. <Col N="3185" /> From what he said to Deputy Ormonde it appears that, whereas formerly consultants in hospitals were entitled to make a charge for treatment provided for accident victims, and damages were awarded in court for this purpose in successful litigation, under the new legislation this will not be the case.  There is a departure from what obtained prior to the Supreme Court judgment.  Is it correct that where a person goes to hospital other than as a private patient, in other words, where a person is taken in as an accident case or as a public patient, whereas formerly the consultant was entitled to charge in the event of damages being awarded, this will not be the case under the new legislation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I make a broad point and one about which I have been very careful in terms of the eligibility of persons for health services.  Under the Health Services Regulations, 1971, eligibility for services was withdrawn from persons receiving treatment for injuries received in a road traffic accident where they received, or were entitled to receive, damages from some other person.  The net effect of this Bill is that we will make charges for services in those circumstances and so avoid the withdrawal of eligibility.  That is the critical differential in this case.  It is a good basis for a revision of the legislation.</P>

      <P>I have a question in relation to subsection (2). This mentions the phrase &ldquo;without prejudice to Part III of the statute of limitations&rdquo;.  Could the Minister explain precisely what that means?  Does it mean that the statute of limitations will not apply to claims made by the board, regardless of how long it may take for a case to go through court or be settled, which could take six to ten years, depending on its complexity?  I think the statute of limitations is six years <Col N="3186" /> at present.  Does it mean that claims by the board will have no limit and will not be ruled out of order as a result of the statute of limitations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>In effect, it means that the clawback by the health board accrues only from the date on which damages or compensation are paid by the person liable.  The retrospective aspect is precluded from this Bill.  The statute of limitations does not come into force in relation to the Bill because of the Supreme Court decision.  That subsection is necessary in this Bill because we must take account of the length of time which elapses before many of these cases are decided and the consequent possible application of the statute of limitations to them.  That subsection is very fair and equitable to everybody.  The claim from the health board does not start until compensation is actually paid.</P>

      <P>We need to reawaken the interest of all concerned in this Bill which is still of the same importance as when we spoke about it on the last occasion.  It will involve us in very considerable change in the whole area of company law.  We will certainly need, in our consideration on Committee Stage, to gauge our contributions so as to provide the proper balance between the users of accounts and the need to avoid any very severe burdens on small industry, in particular.  We hear much talk, from interested parties and in the House also as to the importance of small industries to the country.</P>
      <P>An accumulation of paperwork scares off small businessmen and entrepreneurs, and it might be fair to say it has served as a disincentive to small enterprises in the past.  We must be careful that by our actions here we will not put further workloads on small companies who do not have the administrative organisation, the trained personnel or office plant necessary to deal with the accumulation of data being sought from them by this legislation.</P>

Creditors find it necessary <Col N="3188" /> to obtain information.  We must remember that many creditors are small companies themselves and in the past they have found it difficult to get information on the status and the financing of companies. We must have a proper balance between the amount of information to be disclosed by companies and the need of creditors for information.  We must also stress the need for secrecy and confidentiality. That has always been the hallmark of company law and we must do everything to protect it in future.</P>

It would have been better to have a Bill like this referred to a select committee where it could be dealt with across the table than to try to debate it in Committee here.  I understand from section 1 that all companies will be included, with certain exemptions and exceptions.  That would mean that dormant companies would be subject to the sections of the Bill.  A company could be set up, trade for a few years and then the directors might decide to phase it down or out, though maintaining the status of a limited company.  They would be caught under this Bill.  There must be thousands of such companies on file in the Companies Registration Office which were not required to prepare accounts but under this Bill they will have to submit accounts.</P>
      <P>Before going very far in this section one would need to have a copy of the 1963 Companies Act.

      <P>&ldquo;(a) a company not trading for the acquisition of gain by the members,&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>We will have to question the Minister of State very closely on this. The Minister stated that the Bill would not apply to a company not trading for profit.  Can the Minister tell us the reason for this rather strange collection of words in the first amendment?  It says the section will not now apply to companies &ldquo;not trading for the acquisition of gain by the members.&rdquo; Perhaps he is seeking exemption for genuine charitable companies who do not distribute money to their members and might not wish to do so. The amendment seeks to substitute a strange form of wording for a version which appeared to be straightforward, which referred simply to companies that were not trading for profit.  I may have a suspicious mind in such matters, and I ask the Minister if he is leaving the way open for a different interpretation from what one would apply to the original wording.  Is the Minister trying to confine <Col N="3190" /> the provision to certain types of companies? If so, he might indicate what they are.</P>
      <P>Does this apply to interest income from companies which would not be trading but might be utilising investments in another way?  We would like to know the reason why the Minister is attempting to alter the wording of the section in this way.  Is he genuinely trying to narrow the field of companies that will not be covered by the Bill? If that is the case, he should say so now.  Another subsection in the Bill covers companies engaged in work for charitable purposes only.  We must be very careful when we are dealing with this type of section, which is a very important one.  We must remember that information is a very valuable company resource and it should be protected except in unusual circumstances which should be clearly defined in law.</P>
      <P>We must not allow a situation to develop where all information is disclosed, because that could be detrimental to employment prospects and further business development.  We all know there are predators around in all areas of life but business predators are certainly not uncommon and they must not be facilitated by anything we do here.  I would go for minimum disclosures and the maximum exemptions of the Fourth Directive to be put into law here.  That is the best way to serve the business community in the long term, considering the fact that we are an open economy entirely dependent upon foreign investment for our larger job creation opportunities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is suggested that we might give the breakdown of individual markets and classes of business.  This is very serious and deep information which was not heretofore available to the general public and to all and sundry.  Whatever, about the general public finding use for this kind of information, I am sure that business predators will be very anxious to get their hands on this kind of classified information and we must be careful to do everything that is in the best long term interests of our business community and our economy. The kind of information being sought in the scope of this Bill will be of <Col N="3191" /> interest to more than the general public. It will be of great interest to business competitors both internally and internationally. Nobody will thank us for enacting something here if it results in loss of employment.</P>

      <P>I do not wish to get into contention with the Deputy.  We are not on section 2.  We are on amendment No.1.  I do not wish to enter into a wider discussion on the question of confidentiality, on the question of divulging information either nationally or internationally.  Amendment No. 1 is a clarifying amendment.  It clarifies the original section 2 (1) (a).  We want to make it quite clear that the essential criterion for qualification for exemption will be the fact that the members of the company cannot gain from the company's activity.  That is the central reason for a grant of exemption.  This provision excludes companies not trading for profit from the scope of this Bill.  Such companies are specifically excluded from Chapter 2, Article 58 of the Treaty of Rome which forms the basis of the EC's harmonisation efforts in the area of company law and are not, therefore, within the scope of Article 54 (3) G of the Treaty upon which the Fourth Directive is based.  The decision to exclude such companies from the scope of the Bill reflects a recognition of <Col N="3192" /> the special nature of non-profit making companies and the fact that the role of such bodies does not justify their being subjected to the stringent accounting requirements being applied to public and private limited companies generally.</P>
      <P>I should say for the information of Deputies that the vast majority of non-profit making companies covered by the provisions of this subsection are public limited companies.  Therefore, they are already obliged to file their accounts.  This position will not change under this Bill. All that will happen is that such concerns need not follow the detailed accounting and other rules being laid down here for ordinary commercial concerns.  I wish to assure Deputy Flynn that there is nothing sinister in the amendment.  It is merely a clarifying amendment which I think should be welcomed by the House.</P>

      <P>I would not share Deputy Flynn's fears that disclosure would lead to unemployment.  I think it is the lack of disclosure that is already leading to closures and unemployment on a vast scale.  I wish to raise a question in regard to the word &ldquo;trading&rdquo;.  Does this amendment not confine this to trading companies rather than including investing companies or companies involved in services? What is the legal meaning of the word &ldquo;trading&rdquo;.  If companies are &ldquo;acquiring gain by the members&rdquo; but are not trading companies are they not covered?</P>

      <P>The companies we are exempting are not trading in the commercial sense.  They are not trading either goods or services.  We are talking here, for instance, about Alcoholics Anonymous, Chambers of Commerce, the Dublin Grand Opera Society.  These are three types of companies which will be entitled to exemption.  They are not trading companies in the sense of commercial trading.  These are special exemptions.</P>

      <P>We are dealing here with companies incorporated under company law, not under the Acts governing friendly societies or co-operatives.  They are mutual companies that are covered by different Acts.  They are not the subject of this directive or the Bill before us. I should like to tell Deputy Mac Giolla that I am trying to improve the definition of the exempted companies.  The words, &ldquo;a company not trading for the acquisition of gain by the members&rdquo;, are quite clear and suitable.  The company structures mentioned by Deputy McCreevy are not included in the Companies Acts and, therefore, the Fourth Directive, and the Bill before us, do not apply to them.</P>

      <P>It is a flaw in the Bill that some of those bodies are not subjected to some form of registration here. I accept that the Minister said that the type of companies that will be covered by the amendment will be chambers of commerce, societies and groups like Alcoholics Anonymous, but I am not clear as to the purpose of the amendment. The phrase, &ldquo;a company not trading for profit&rdquo;, I presume was in the <Col N="3194" /> original Bill while the Minister's amendment refers to a company not trading for the acquisition of gain by the members. In setting up a limited company it would not be impossible to draw up its objectives in the memorandum and articles of association in such a way that the company would not be trading for the acquisition of gain by the members of the company.  The company could be trading but for the gain of others who might not necessarily be members of the company. In my view there are loopholes in the new definition that did not exist in the original legislation.  I do not understand why the phrase, &ldquo;a company not trading for the acquisition of gain by the members&rdquo;, is included or what it is supposed to mean I accept what the Minister said it was intended to do but I wonder if it will achieve that aim.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister indicate which article in the directive specified the scope of the legislation? Is there any reference in the Fourth Directive to the scope of the legislation? The Minister mentioned that the company should not be trading in goods or services but I should like to point out that a company may be trading in money.  Would the Minister regard money as &ldquo;goods&rdquo; or &ldquo;services&rdquo;?  If I had a private family company and I was not trading in goods or services but making investments and so on with cash and gaining income from that would it be necessary for such a company to disclose its activities or will it be exempt as long as it satisfies the criteria of section 8?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems that the Minister intends changing the whole thrust and meaning of the section.  Changing the word &ldquo;profit&rdquo; to &ldquo;gain&rdquo; has a significance. Some companies may have a gain but not necessarily a profit in the generally understood meaning of that word.  The Minister proposes to change what was a <Col N="3195" /> comparatively easily understood sentence to a convoluted phrase about the acquisition of gain.  The new phrase will change the tone of the section.  I do not think it is necessary to include the words &ldquo;by the members&rdquo; except if the Minister is trying to restrict the scope for exemption that might otherwise exist in the Bill.  Will the Minister explain this provision further?</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is somewhat confused.  Article 58 of the Treaty of Rome grants such exclusions and, therefore, there is no need for specific reference to such exemptions in the directive. Article 1 of the directive specifies the companies to which the directive shall apply.  The amendment rather than being restrictive is clarifying.  I should like to bring to the attention of the Deputy the fact that the words used in company law here, in particular in the Companies Act, 1963, sections 24 and 377, are somewhat similar.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Deputy's query about a family company I should like to point out that most dealings are done in cash.  Charities operate on the basis of cash.  We are not going back to a barter society.  The Deputy is trying to convey that the family company he has in mind in one way or another, whether in dealing in goods or services, investments with cash or cash flow, is for the benefit of the members of the company.  We are clarifying the exemptions by using terminology used in the 1963 Act.  This is being done to avoid any difficulty that might arise at a later date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>It appears from the Fourth Directive that we are concerned with Article 54 (3) (g) of the Treaty of Rome. Article 1 dealt with the scope and, as far as Ireland is concerned, it is stated that it will concern itself with public companies limited by shares or by guarantee and private companies limited by shares or guarantee.  This section expands on that and because of that we must know precisely the companies that are or are not covered.  The companies that are more important than any others are those that <Col N="3196" /> will have exemptions granted to them. They are the ones that accountancy firms and others involved in the preparation of accounts will have difficulty with unless the provision before us is made crystal clear.  The original wording seemed to be adequate in that it conveyed that companies not trading for profit, whether goods or services, would be exempt.  The Minister now finds it necessary to restrict that further by including the phrase &ldquo;a company not trading for the acquisition of gain by the members&rdquo;.  I find it difficult to understand why the parliamentary draftsman went to the trouble of altering what seemed to be a reasonably simple definition of scope and came up with a rather strange collection of words that is somewhat convoluted in its content.</P>
      <P>Finally I should like to ask the Minister if we may take it that companies, private or otherwise and irrespective of size or makeup, not trading in goods or services or in money transactions or whatever, will be exempt from the scope of this legislation so long as they satisfy the criteria?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is correct since he has included those last few words.  Bartering is now a substantial element of international trade and can involve substantial profits. Exemption is based on Article 58 which is the general governing article for Chapter 2 while Article 54 to which the Deputy refers is the source of this directive.</P>
      <P>The original wording was &ldquo;a company not trading for profit&rdquo;.  It might very well be that a company not trading for profit could make a profit which would not be distributed to the members.  We are being precise in allowing the exemption and in using the phrase, &ldquo;a company not trading for the acquisition of gain by the members&rdquo;.  That phrase has much greater authority than the original and is definitive in terms which will satisfy the Treaty of Rome and which will be suitable for the operation of this Bill.</P>

      <P>We have spent a lot of time on this and I cannot understand Deputy Flynn's problem.  Surely he knows that though a company may not be making a profit, that they may be making a loss, the members could be acquiring gains continuously, particularly during a time of recession.  The Deputy must be aware of companies that are operating in this way.  The current wording is much clearer than the phrase &ldquo;trading for profit&rdquo; and makes it obvious to everyone as to what is meant.</P>

      <P>I am at a loss to understand the Minister's amendment.  I am wondering whether it may be possibly a loophole that would enable companies to escape the liabilities intended for them, restricted as they are within the terms of the Bill.  This amendment excludes a company &ldquo;not trading for the acquisition of gain by the members&rdquo; but no company set out to acquire gain in the first instance, at least not for their members.  They acquire gains for the company.  There may be a company who decide to put their gains into reserves or there may be companies who have not paid dividends for a very long time, perhaps not at any time during up to 40 years in existence. Such a company might argue that they did not have to make the disclosure because they were not trading for the acquisition of gain by the members. The primary purpose of a trading company is to acquire gain for the company and the disposition of those companies might be not to distribute the gain to the members. In a very major trading company there could be a clause in their constitution to the effect that the profits would have to be reinvested or accumulated for an indefinite period.  Such a company might escape the liabilities under this Bill.  May we be informed as to what exactly is behind the amendment and what categories it is intended to exclude from the original wording?</P>

      <P>I fail to recognise the thrust of Deputy Taylor's argument.  A company is formed by members for the purpose of gain by those members. Whether in pursuit of that objective the company accumulates and retains the profits until the next generation or the generation after that is irrelevant.  The exemptions I am seeking are defined clearly in the amendment, that is, that the company is not trading for the acquisition of gain by members.  Therefore, I am being precise in what I say.</P>

      <P>The words, &ldquo;surplus&rdquo; or &ldquo;profit&rdquo; are regarded as gain in any accounts certified by an accountant.  I cannot escape some form of wording to denote profit.  The wording we are using is specific in that none of the members of the company can gain from the moneys generated by the company so far as the exemption is concerned.  Deputy Taylor was not here when I gave as examples such organisations as chambers of commerce, the DGOS, the Wexford Grand Opera Society, Alcoholics Anonymous and so on.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I might highlight the point by putting my problem to the Minister in the form of a question.  What would be the position in the case of a company who included in their memorandum of association a clause prohibiting them from making a distribution from their profits to their members? This would be by way of a straight prohibition in the memorandum of association in such wording as, &ldquo;this company may not make a distribution of their profits to the members&rdquo;.  In that sort of situation the company would say they were excluded, that they were obviously not trading for the acquisition of gain by the members because the memorandum of association <Col N="3199" /> prohibits the redistribution of any profit to the members.  Can the Minister say whether such a company would be excluded from the provisions of this Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer is that a company as defined by Deputy Taylor would not be exempted from the provisions of the Bill.  This is because, irrespective of the prohibition on profits to members, in the event of the liquidation of a company, for instance, there would be a gain to the members on the distribution of the assets of the company.  In the period of life of the company the accumulative profits or surpluses would mean that the shares would be worth more on an ongoing basis so there would be gain for members both on an ongoing basis and on the basis of a liquidation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>It would not be beyond the ability of a good solicitor or barrister to set up a company in a way which would ensure that in its objectives and articles it would not be trading for the acquisition of profits by the members.  As the Minister would know, in the setting up of a company the memorandum of association sets out the broad objectives of that company.  It would not be beyond the minds of many people to so devise the memorandum of a company as to exclude the possibility of the profits or gains ever being distributed to the members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I follow the Minister's point that in the event of a company acquiring a gain and then going into liquidation the gain would accrue to the members and that in that way the provisions of the Bill would apply to them, but if the company are successful that will not happen.  The use of the phrase, &ldquo;a company not trading for the acquisition of gain by the members&rdquo; is a very narrow definition.  We could argue about this all night.  Deputy Mervyn Taylor backs my point that it would be possible to define the memorandum and objectives of the company in such a way that there would not be a gain by the members.  They may be able to get directors fees etc., but it could be worded in such a way that it would not be possible <Col N="3200" /> to get exemption under this Bill.  The new wording is looser than the old wording and I do not see the point of this amendment. That wording would be open to interpretation by the courts in the long term but what I have described might be the case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The members can make a gain even though the company are not making a profit over a period.  There may be an increase in the value of the assets. I do not accept what the Deputy says.  It is up to the registrar of companies to decide whether a company is a bona fide exempted company.  Most of these companies are public companies who must publish their accounts and if the registrar of companies feels that the activities of the company are not exempted activities he may take action at law to have the matter determined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the point being made by the Minister.  It is a debateable point.  One could argue that a court, if it came to deciding whether a company that had a prohibition such as I have described would be looked upon as trading for the benefit of members for the possibility of a liquidation at some far distant point, may hold one way or the other on that. Likewise, so far as the value of the shares is concerned.  I doubt but it is arguable, whether the Minister's amendment would encompass the suggestion where he would gain by an increase or reduction in the value of the shares.  That need not necessarily be clearly defined.  In formulating this Bill why can we not have it beyond doubt?  We do not have to engage in argument or debates as we are making the law, so why not make it so clear as to be beyond doubt rather than leaving it to lawyers and accountants to debate it later, at considerable cost?  Now is the time to make it clear.  It should not be beyond our wit to find a suitable wording to put the matter beyond doubt.</P>

      <P>That does not absolve me from coming into the House and putting down a Bill in a format which I have been advised is the correct format for the Bill.  Every company will have a memorandum and articles of association and it should be clearly defined in them that, they will not be trading for the acquisition of gain for members no matter what wording is used.  It is on the basis of that, that a company will operate and that a company will be exempted.  It will also be on the basis of the reading of the memorandum and articles that the registrar of companies will ultimately allow a company to be exempted or will challenge an exemption in court.</P>

      <P>The Minister should not be cross with us.  We are not trying to be negative.  When a Minister seeks to alter what he has originally published and makes it more difficult to understand, it is natural for Members to seek to find the basic reason for the alteration.  As originally drafted, everybody understood &ldquo;trading&rdquo; simply to mean doing business for profit and it was easy to interpret it. A company not trading for the acquisition of gain, even if it had &ldquo;for the members&rdquo; would intimate that the gain was being made by the trading company for the benefit of its members.  If one were to take a literal view of the words it could mean a company not trading by the members.  It is very rare that the members would be actually carrying out the trading for the company.  The company would be carrying out business on behalf of its members.  The actual wording of the text is open to different interpretations depending on where one lays the emphasis. My original objection stands good. This is an unusual collection of words framed in a peculiar way.  The word &ldquo;by&rdquo; as against &ldquo;for&rdquo; definitely has a distinct difference of interpretation when one places the emphasis on &ldquo;by the members&rdquo; or &ldquo;for the members&rdquo;. &ldquo;By the members&rdquo; signifies that business is <Col N="3202" /> being carried on by the individuals, the members of the company, but in normal understanding of trading it is always understood that a company carries on business for the purpose of making profits and gain for the benefit of the members. It is certainly for the members, if the articles of association permit that when they are being drawn up.  At least, this amendment has confused the original interpretation that could have been put on the published text.  With that in mind, it is worth the Minister giving us a commitment to refer this back to the draftsman to see if the understanding we have put on it could be applied to it, which would end up in very serious expensive litigation on behalf of individuals hereafter. We will not be thanked by the business community if we leave them in that difficulty.</P>

      <P>I greatly appreciate what the Minister intends to do.  However, this definition is particularly loose and it should be made clear here rather than having it contested in the courts at a later date.  We know what the Minister intends.  Perhaps the draftsman could come up with a better definition.  However, this definition is open to different interpretations.  The Minister's amendment says &ldquo;for the acquisition of gain by the members&rdquo;.  I can conceive of a situation where it might not be the members of the company who would benefit.  The members of the company are the shareholders but they are not necessarily the directors of the company. There are various schemes where the members of a company might not benefit as they might not be intended to benefit. A devious man could draw up a limited company, have certain members such as myself and perhaps Deputy Flynn and Deputy Taylor who are all the time pumping money into this company and it would not be the members who would be gaining and the company might not necessarily trade either.  One could think of a whole lot of situations which would prove this definition to be particularly loose.  It is a very narrow definition.  Will the parliamentary draftsman look at the <Col N="3203" /> wording again for Report Stage?  We all know what the Minister intends to do and we accept that without any equivocation but perhaps it could be tightened up.  If it cannot I will accept the advice available to the Minister.</P>

      <P>I will have another look at the matter.  I am satisfied that as drafted the amendment clarifies matters. I should like to draw the attention of Members to section 24 of the Companies Act, 1963, which refers to limited company formed for promoting commerce, art, science, religion, charity or any other useful object and that intends to apply its profits, if any, or other income, in promoting its objectives.  Under the original wording in section 2 (1) (a) such a company could not be exempt even though that is our wish.  It is to clarify the means of exempting the company that, on advice, I have changed the wording to, &ldquo;a company not trading for the acquisition of gain by the members&rdquo;.  It strengthens the point, not weakens it. However, in view of what has been said by speakers I will look at the matter again.</P>

An investment company is formed with the memorandum and articles of association restricting it to investing and prohibiting it from trading.  The question arises; what does it invest in?  It invests in a subsidiary, in a trading company, and thereby the company gains the benefits of exclusion from the provisions of this Bill.  Should we not take cognisance of this fact?</P>

      <P>There will be no restriction once they are satisfied that it is for charitable purposes.  There are a certain number of entities under the old 1963 Act which have carried on business for many years for charitable purposes, although they have no share capital.  The distinct impression is being given that this is to be terminated or reduced in scope.  There has to be a reason.  Is it suggested that perhaps these companies are not now carrying on business for the purpose for which they were originally granted the order, namely, for charitable purposes? That would have a great bearing on the standing of these charities and would also imping on the question under Article 44 of the Constitution which guaranteed them exemption in these matters as long as they carried on their business in accordance with the laws and canons of their religion.  This is a reference in the Minister's Second Stage speech which needs to be clarified.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 4, lines 26 and 27, and in page 5, lines 1 to 14, to delete subsection (2).</P>
      <P>The terms of this Bill exclude almost all financial institutions such as banks, trustee savings banks, hire purchase companies etc.  These financial institutions form a major part of our companies and account for a major part of our workforce. The top 30 financial companies employ 34,000 people.  That is a very sizeable amount of the workforce and they form a sizeable part of our economy. The only reason for their exclusion is that they are not included in the EC directive. The Minister has taken the attitude that we cannot do anything on our own initiative but only what we are directed to do by the EC.  This directive is years old and we should have adhered to it at least five years ago.</P>
      <P>The only reason the financial institutions were not included in the directive was that a separate directive was being formulated for financial institutions since they are such an important part of economic life.  Even more information would be required from them than from ordinary trading companies.  They are in fact the very institutions which hold a grip on the economy and decide the future of other companies as well.  During the past few years they have been pulling the carpet from under other companies.  Last year 440 companies went to the wall, mostly because they were in the grip of financial institutions who pulled the ground from under them and their workforce. There should be even more restrictions on these companies in regard to the furnishing of relevant information. Everyone is afraid to touch the banks&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>What we are talking about here is the disclosure of information. The Minister's attitude is that since he is not being forced by the EC to do something, he should not do it.  I do not accept that.  A number of banks have gone bust during the past decase, as have a number of hire purchase companies. The ICI is a major company which only last year would have gone to the wall but for Government intervention with AIB. Deputies, the public and the workforce, the people entitled to information, still do not know what happened.</P>
      <P>The PMPA and the PMPS are other examples.  The people who had invested money in the PMPS still do not have information as to what happened to their money.  People want full information in regard to their accounts.  It is their money and does not belong to the banks or the directors or the people at the top, yet they are not entitled to information as to what is being done with it, the companies in which it is invested or whether it has been thrown away.  The people employed in these companies and the investors, all the people involved, are entitled to the fullest disclosure of information.  At least they should be entitled to the minimum amount of information which this Bill is asking any company to produce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment seeks the deletion of the first exemption but, as I pointed out on Second Stage, when all the exemptions are taken into account we will be left with only about 100 companies who will be affected out of a total of perhaps 75,000 companies.  Deputy Flynn does not have to worry in the slightest or hold up the passage of this Bill because it will be totally ineffective if it is passed in the form in which it has been presented to us.  This is the first exemption I am asking the House to delete from the Bill. <Col N="3211" /> This is the exemption in relation to financial institutions.  They are excluded without giving any adequate reason.  The Bill states:</P>
    <P>(a) a company that is the holder of a licence under the Central Bank Act, 1971,</P>
    <P>(b) a company that is a trustee savings bank certified under the Trustee Savings Banks Acts, 1863 to 1965,</P>
    <P>(c) a company engaged solely in the making of hire-purchase agreements ...and credit-sale agreements...</P>
    <P>Surely everybody wants to know what is happening in relation to hire purchase? Every home in the country is glued to the ground with all sorts of hire purchase agreements and credit sale agreements. The section further states:</P>
    <P>(d) a company engaged in the business of accepting deposits or other repayable funds or granting credit for its own account.</P>
    <P>There is no explanation why all these are excluded.  As I understand it, the only reason they are excluded is that the Minister is not forced to include them but he is not forced to exclude them.  I ask him to look again at this wide exemption and, unless he has particular reasons for exempting particular areas, whether banks or hire purchase companies, apart from those not being excluded in the EC directive, I consider that subsection (2) should be deleted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>There used to be a theory years ago that financial institutions such as banks, insurance companies and so on were the blue chips of the stock market world, that they were sacroscant and were comparable almost with investing in Government stocks, that they were absolutely safe and nothing ever went wrong with the financial institutions and the insurance companies.  That was the historical context in which these financial institutions, banks and so on, got this specialised treatment they have had over <Col N="3212" /> the years so far as disclosure was concerned. Perhaps that applied in Victorian times, because I do not believe banks went broke then.  The hard fact is that they do now, and they have been causing trouble not only to their investors, their shareholders and depositors, but also to casual members of the public who have been unfortunate enough to have to deal with them.</P>
      <P>We have seen cases where it is the unfortunate taxpayer at the end of the day who gets caught now and has to carry the tab, as Deputy Mac Giolla has pointed out.  We have seen what has happened in relation to the ICI, the PMPA, the PMPS and so on.  The old historical reason for giving this special exclusion from disclosure to most of these institutions has gone through experience.  I believe we should recognise the fact that there has been substantial change.  For the life of me, to exclude hire purchase companies is something I cannot understand. What is so special that a hire purchase company has to be excluded from the disclosure provisions that apply to every other trading company?  Many of them are not of the highest standards. Hire purchase transactions can involve all sorts of things.  They can involve relatively small household durables or they can involve very substantial transactions in complex machinery.  Some hire purchase transactions could run to a cost of £50,000 and £100,000 in relation to a machine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When a person, a firm, or a trading company who are giving employment do a deal with a hire purchase company they are entitled to know who they are dealing with and what is the financial strength of that hire purchase company.  If anything goes wrong, or if it turns out that the goods, the machine or whatever they have bought are defective, or if the hire purchase company go broke those people will be left in an appalling situation and abandoned without any remedy or comeback. The answer normally given to somebody who finds himself in that situation is that it is his own fault for dealing with a dubious company of that nature, that he did not check it out properly to <Col N="3213" /> find out the strength of the firm he was proposing to deal with.  When the exclusion is given here the Minister is prohibiting him and denying him the possibility of finding out that information which normal business prudence requires him to do, to check out what is the strength of that firm or financial institution he proposes to do his business with.  He is entitled to know the strength of the particular business institution.  It is potentially dangerous and potentially serious for employment in many of these companies if they cannot find out who they are proposing to do their business with.  It is a serious matter so far as the taxpayer is concerned because the experience seems to be, in many cases if not all, that when these financial institutions go it sends reverberations through the financial system of the country and at the end of it all the taxpayer has to pick up the tab.</P>
    <P>The same is the case in relation to deposit institutions where people put their savings on deposit.  We know what happened to the many unfortunate people such as the small savers who put all their money into the PMPS.  Are savers henceforth in financial institutions to be denied the possibility of finding out if they will have to suffer what those unfortunate people suffered with the PMPS?  Those things should be open.</P>
    <P>I take the point that small savers would not have the knowledge or expertise to go along and examine the accounts anyway to advise themselves on the strength of where they were going to deposit their hard earned savings.  Nevertheless, there are financial media, newspapers and people who do those things for them, examine those situations and write about them in newspapers, periodicals and so on so that intending savers can have the benefit of an examination of their accounts.  It would be a great mistake if we got caught on the old historical base that just because there was this traditional aura about banks and the insurance companies being something very special and exempted them.  To say that that situation has gone on unchanged over the decades is not correct.  There have been very real and very serious <Col N="3214" /> changes in those institutions as the years have gone by to the cost of all taxpayers, not to talk about the cost to people investing there, or people involved in trading with those institutions.</P>
    <P>We have a new position now.  We had unfortunate experiences in the recent past.  We should learn from that and not get carried along on the old historical base.  We should take cognisance of the new position which applies and bring in our legislation to take cognisance of that. Whatever one says about banks, hire purchase companies and companies dealing with credit sales that require no licensing and no checking out of any special nature, as I understand it, and give them an exemption, I cannot see what there is about them which warrants that kind of special treatment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree generally with what Deputy Mac Giolla and Deputy Taylor have been saying in relation to banks and the aura in relation to them which we should get away from.  From my reading of the section and of the amendment put forward by Deputy Mac Giolla I believe we are talking at cross-purposes. As I understand it, Deputy Mac Giolla's amendment proposes to delete sections 2 and 3 of the Bill.  Section 2 does not exempt banking companies, hire purchase companies or any other such companies from publishing information under this Bill.  All that section 2 does is to provide that they do not have technical accounting requirements.  I think we have been at cross-purposes for the past while, but I understand that the effect of section 2 will be only the non-application of a number of sections.  Sections 3 to 6, 8 to 12, 17 to 19 and 23 of this Bill will not apply to banks, trustee savings banks, hire purchase companies etc., but all other provisions in this Bill will apply to these types of companies. Therefore, for the first time ever private banking companies will have to publish their accounts.  I understand exactly what Deputy Mac Giolla and Deputy Taylor have said, but this section will have an effect opposite to what is not there at <Col N="3215" /> present.  At present private banking companies etc. do not have to publish their accounts.  They will have to do so now, and the effect of this section is to exempt them from certain technical accounting measures which would not necessarily apply in the case of banks etc.</P>

      <P>In certain ways normal banking accounts and certain insurance companies' accounts are not done in the same format as that of a fellow running a factory down in County Kildare.  They are laid out in a certain format provided for under various Acts, but section 2 will provide that private banking companies will have to publish their accounts for the first time ever.  They have not had to do so up to now.</P>
      <P>I have certain things to say about the section in general, but Deputy Mac Giolla's amendment would make it impossible in accountancy to do certain things.  I understand that in any event there will be a future directive regarding the format of banks' and insurance companies' accounts.  The section is only exempting these companies from particular accounting requirements which would not apply to them in any event.  I do not think that the amendment should be accepted in that regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>While we can all understand Deputy Mac Giolla's anxiety, it is typical of him.  He has these ideological hang-ups which he trots out here at every available opportunity is so far as banks and so on are concerned.  I do not know why he has such a grudge against the banks and financial institutions.  I like to think that they have served the community well over the years.  The banks never took on board the limitation of disclosure that was available to them under the 1963 Act; in fact, they discarded that very substantially over the years and in the last five years they published the most exhaustive detailed accounts for the general public.  I cannot see what Deputy <Col N="3216" /> Mac Giolla is getting all steamed up about.</P>
      <P>I would like to take the opportunity of asking the Minister whether he can clarify once and for all that these institutions, banks and insurance companies are liable to publish their accounts and that separate directives will emanate from the EC which will cover these institutions in particular and that before too long we will all be back in here with very extended, detailed legislation covering these institutions on their own?  If that is the case it should be put quite clearly.  As I understand it, over a number of years we have been treated twice a year to the most detailed summaries of the banking position in the public press.  They have been very generous in the amount of information they have given to the public at large about their investments and deposits. I ask the Minister if the formats are designed for application to company disclosure as outlined in the Schedule to this Bill?  Would they be suitable to the information on such entities as financial institutions?  I suggest that they are not and that this should be stated clearly.</P>
      <P>This perhaps is one reason why separate directives will be necessary to deal with banks and institutions.  I am not seeking to do the Minister's job for him, but I understand that under existing company law and in particular under the principal Act of 1963, these institutions file accounts with the Companies Registration Office, but it would be very difficult for them to follow the formats as laid down in this directive.  They are not obliged to follow specific technical accountancy practices and presentation measures which are being applied to other companies under this legislation.  I have no difficulty in accepting that the time will come in the near future when the matter will be dealt with in so far as these other institutions are concerned. I cannot support Deputy Mac Giolla's amendment.</P>

      <P>I want to clear up a few points in regard to insurance companies. I spent most of my young days with a very eminent insurance company.  Under <Col N="3217" /> the present law and regulations the Minister has very far reaching powers in regard to these.  They must produce audited accounts.  The Minister can investigate them or order an investigation under the present Act.</P>
      <P>Far be it from me to defend any bank because I would be on a loser if I tried to do so anyway, but we must get the thing right and put it into proper perspective. What would the position have been if the AIB had not taken control of the Insurance Corporation of Ireland in 1983? They had only a small share at that time and they could easily have walked away, and maybe it would have been left to another group of individuals.  What then would have been the position of the Government of the day?  We all know what the position would have been.  You might have sung then that the blue book would be brought into operation in the insurance companies in a most detailed form.  We would have found ourselves in some opposition then.</P>
      <P>We and the taxpayers have been fortunate so far &mdash; I must say that &mdash; that the AIB were in a position to pump millions of pounds to rescue that corporation and put them on a proper footing.  We must point out very clearly that insurance companies, all of them, operating in this country under licence now, can be investigated periodically or whenever the Department of Industry and Commerce feel that that should be done.  It is their job to monitor and to see that accounts are brought up-to-date.  After a long debate here some time ago in regard to the ICI we on this side of the House spelled out that more personnel should be brought into the Department to monitor insurance companies to see that their accounts and so on are in order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to deal with the subject of the hire purchase companies which was brought up by Deputy Mac Giolla.  We must remember that new tractors, cars and machinery which are purchased are under warranty.  This is necessary under the Trading Act.  Everybody knows also the credentials of the hire purchase companies operating here.  They are very choosy as to who they take as customers. <Col N="3218" /> They take no duds, but the cream.  Let there be no doubt about that.  They also produce accounts.</P>
    <P>In the final analysis, our banks give very detailed information.  We are very glad of that because they hold the money of the people and the people are entitled to know about them.  I am glad that we are now getting that information.  I want to clear a few matters with regard to the insurance market in which I worked for, a great number of years.  If there was laxity &mdash; and I say if &mdash; it was probably because the companies were not monitored more closely and the supervisory authorities in the Department were not in a position to examine the matter fully. It was in the underwriting departments that these companies fell down.  I am telling the facts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposed amendments amount to the deletion of subsections (2) and (3) of section 2.  They provide basically that the detailed accounting roles in the Bill will not apply to banks, certain financial institutions and insurers.  There are good reasons for these exclusions.  The rules in the Bill are not designed for application to banks and insurers.  Separate directives are being discussed at Council level dealing with <Col N="3219" /> the accounts of these institutions which are designed specifically to be applied to such bodies.  I am opposing the proposed amendments for these reasons.  I should add quite specifically for the information of the House that Article 2 of the directive specifies:</P>
      <P>Pending subsequent co-ordination, the Member States need not apply the provisions of this Directive to banks and other financial institutions or to insurance companies.</P>
      <P>Let me first deal with insurance companies. Those companies which hold authorisations, whether in the non-life or life sectors, are subject to severe scrutiny by my Department.  They are obliged to submit annual returns to my Department and these are subsequently published in the blue book.  Without getting into an argument on the question of supervision&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnJRyan" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle John J. Ryan">

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash; the question of the filing of information in respect of life and non-life insurance companies is quite comprehensive and quite specific.  In relation to other financial institutions, in particular section 7 of this Bill will require the publication of accounts through filing with the Companies Registration Office but in the case of banks and other financial institutions it simply provides that the accounts in question shall be those required under the Companies Act, 1963, as supplemented by certain provisions of this Bill.</P>
      <P>The other provisions are in section 13 which calls for a review of business and specific data to be given in the directive's report; section 14 which calls for the disclosure of particulars of acquisitions by a company of its own shares; section 15 which calls for an auditor's statement of a consistency between the directors' report and the company's account; and section 16 which requires the disclosure of particulars of holdings in subsidiary and associated companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="3220" /> In relation to public financial institutions, that is, financial companies which are public limited companies, these must comply with the Companies Acts as of now.  What has happened is that the private companies which deal in the financial sector are now being brought within the scope of the Companies Act. They must file an annual return to the banks under the Companies Act, 1963. So we are making progress in this matter. I reject the arguments of Deputy Mac Giolla.  The measures in the Bill are reasonable.  They provide for substantial information to be supplied in the Companies Office.  As I have said, the directive specifies that this matter should be further considered in the context of co-ordination.</P>

Deputy Flynn made his ideological position very clear on Second Stage and in his opening remarks on section 1 of this Bill.  He made his own ideological hangups very clear.  They are in direct opposition on a companies Bill which is specifically designed, from the EC's point of view, in particular, for the workers in these companies.

      <NameTxt>Mrs. E. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>In the course of this short debate we will hear numerous arguments in favour of and against the provision of divorce law in Ireland. Tonight, I have only to look at the Order Paper to see one reason for divorce legislation: directly following this debate the House will begin to debate the Domicile and Recognition of Foreign Divorces Bill, 1985.  That Bill will be before the House to clear up one of the many anomalies caused by the absence of divorce legislation here.  It points once again to the legal tangle in which many families, and particularly women, find themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That brings me to the main theme of my contribution, which is how divorce <Col N="3223" /> relates to women in particular.  One of the main arguments consistently advanced against the introduction of divorce is that it represents a threat to women.  We are constantly told that women would suffer directly from the introduction of divorce.  The status of the family, of which women are the centre because of their caring role for children, would be undermined, we are told. Women, we have been told, would run a higher risk of desertion by erring husbands who would have the convenient facility of divorce at their disposal.  We are told that divorce would heighten the risk of increased poverty and insecurity for women and for their children.</P>
    <P>Basic to that argument is the notion that woman is the compliant spouse, woman's natural condition being seen as an emotional, sectional and financial dependant of her husband.  That attitude seeks to exploit the vulnerability of women in society, where equality in all its aspects remains more an aspiration than a reality.  It is an attitude that conveniently ignores the fact that marital breakdown occurs and that women already suffer its worst effects because of the absence of a coherent legal framework within which legal, financial and property issues may be resolved.  It is a kind of attitude that assumes that if the State battens down the hatches by a complete prohibition on the availability of divorce, that prohibition in itself will underline the stability of the marriage relationship and act as a deterrent to spouses who might otherwise be tempted to stray.</P>
    <P>Marital breakdown has caused serious problems in Ireland, entailing untold, undocumented suffering by women. Because of legal anomalies, such as the law relating to domicile, the absence of a mechanism in the State to dissolve marriages has left countless numbers of women in a legal limbo.  There are instances of women being divorced abroad by their husbands but being unaware that their marriages had been dissolved for years after the event.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="3224" /> To say that the introduction of divorce would increase the rate of desertion is to ignore the steady rise in the numbers of desertions in the past ten years.  About 15,000 Irishwomen have applied for the deserted wife's allowance or benefit since the introduction of the scheme.  In 1984 there were 7,790 women receiving this support, 70 per cent of whom had children. The statistics available do not measure fully the extent of desertion because women under 40 years of age without children do not qualify for the allowance, and also because eligibility for the allowance is subject to a very rigid means test.</P>
    <P>This argument ignores the sad reality for many women in Ireland.  There is undocumented suffering by women in marriage.  Those deserted are by no means the worst off.  In many cases, desertion is a merciful end to years of terror, punishment and misery.  As a woman public representative for more than 20 years I have had the confidence of women in my constituency and outside it and I have been shown all the marks of terrifying, brutal marriages &mdash; bruises, black eyes, broken fingers, burn marks.  I have seen children in total terror, marked for life.  I would judge that there are children who have been marked for life in what I would call the more civilised cases, where the fathers and mothers had not spoken to each other for years.</P>
    <P>This is what the State is now being urged to continue to batten down the hatches on.  While battening down those hatches we conveniently turn a blind eye to all the Irish style solutions to which people have to resort, such as divorces by husbands who have domicile abroad while up to now a wife is supposed to have domicile with her husband.  The wife is left to cope with her children back in Ireland though she is supposed to be wherever the husband is.  He gets a divorce.  We ignore Mexican divorces, Haitian divorces, the Puerto Rican divorces &mdash; they may be few, but they are there &mdash; the deed poll changing of names, Catholic Church annulments and subsequent Catholic Church second weddings. These second marriages come to notice <Col N="3225" /> only if the couples of such marriages subsequently want to adopt children and they find that they cannot because they are not legally married.</P>
    <P>As a party, Labour feel very strongly about this, and it is because we feel so strongly that we have introduced this Bill. All the remedies I have referred to we conveniently ignore, as we have ignored the views of the minority Churches with one exception, the Latter Day Saints, who are against the constitutional ban on divorce though, as a matter of internal discipline they may be against divorce itself.  However, they are opposed to the constitutional ban.  We have been told the Taoiseach requires further consultation. Nobody, certainly not us, is arguing against consultation at any time, but as the mover of the Bill emphasised last evening, consultation can take place side by side with the progress of the Bill through the Oireachtas.  Therefore, the need for consultation is not a valid excuse for voting against the Bill.  We will allow all the time that is needed for consultation but time is running out, it is not a plentiful commodity in the lifetime of this Government.</P>
    <P>This subject has had a tediously long history in this Parliament.  I moved a motion in 1980 seeking the establishment of an all-party Oireachtas committee to deal with the questions of support for marriage and marriage breakdown. About that time Deputy Noel Browne introduced a Bill and we had another some time later from the Workers' Party. We had an all-party report in 1967.  We may not agree totally with what that recommended but it was there and it dealt with the subject.  We had the recent all-party committee and we had Deputy Michael O'Leary's Bill.  All the attempts to effect change in this area failed for one reason or another, but they brought the matter of marriage breakdown to the notice of Dáil and Seanad Éireann and to the notice of the people of Ireland over a long period.  One measure was played off against another.  We were always waiting for something.  In the final analysis, no Government ever cared enough to <Col N="3226" /> have the courage to grasp the nettle of marriage breakdown.</P>
    <P>I would ask the House not to repeat the old pattern on this Bill.  Let us grasp the issue once and for all because time is not on our side now.  I submit that all the arguments for and against the dissolution of marriage were weighted up and set down very carefully and explicitly, in so far as it is possible to do so, in the report of the Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown.  The committee recommended that a referendum be held.  They recommended a referendum on a positive format, replacing Article 41.3.2 of the Constitution with a provision specifically authorising the Oireachtas to legislate for the dissolution of marriage.</P>
    <P>The report stressed that the provision should place a duty on the State to protect the family and the institution of marriage. It stressed, too, that in the event of a referendum being approved by the people, there should not be divorce on demand and it stressed that the safeguard of the State's interest in fostering and protecting marriage and the family should be built into whatever provision would be substituted.  It stressed that proper provision should be made for dependent spouses and children.</P>
    <P>The committee gave very close and detailed consideration to over 700 submissions from interested parties and groups and heard much oral evidence over the period of 18 months so, while consultation can go on, one has to say that a great deal of consultation has already taken place.  The time has come to proceed with this Bill on Second Stage and to engage in whatever consultation may be necessary during the latter stages of the measures.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party's approach to this issue is not new.  The fact that we sought an all-party committee in 1980 proves that.  At each annual conference, each meeting, each occasion for debate, we have presented this as an item of great importance.  We are not negative.  We do not see this in isolation.  We are concerned with protecting marriage but we <Col N="3227" /> are concerned too with providing a release for those whose marriages have failed beyond reprieve.</P>
    <P>We were the first to speak of services aimed at reconciliation and protecting marriage.  We were also the first to speak about properly structured family courts. We know, as everybody must know, that some marriages are beyond redemption. Some marriages are either non-existent in so far as the parties are separated, or they are sheer hell for one or both parties if they persist in their marriage.  We know that extramarital, stable relationships have been set up.  We know they are commonplace.  I do not think there is any Deputy or any person in the country who does not know of a case or many cases of marriage breakdown.  We hope that many marriages, with the services we are talking about, can be redeemed and put on a sound footing again, but we know there are others for whom the only solution is termination of marriage.</P>
    <P>It is because of our concern for those people and our understanding of the hell in which they live on earth that we move this Bill.  We know there are children who are placed outside the full protection of the law because of ambivalence in this area.  Our first consideration must be for children and for their welfare.  We are told by those who oppose this Bill that we must be concerned about the effect of divorce on children.  I would ask people who make that case to identify for me the difference between the effects of divorce on children and the effects of nullity on children, on the effects of separation on children.  In the day-to-day life of a child I cannot see what difference one makes that the other does not make.</P>
    <P>My own contention is that a bad marriage, a marriage where violence is a regular feature, where parents are either fighting or not speaking to each other, has a much more detrimental effect on a child than any form of separation.  Nothing is worse than constant turmoil and there are many hundreds and perhaps thousands of children in this State living in those conditions.  I have met children who have been afraid to go to bed <Col N="3228" /> because of a drunken father or perhaps worse still a father who is not drunk but who is a bully.  Those children have to live in those conditions and we sit here and turn a blind eye to that problem in our society as we have done year after year in this House.  All these remedies are less detrimental to any child than the insistence that a child should live in a home where there is violence and where all the agencies of the State are precluded because it happens inside the door of a family home.</P>
    <P>There is a clear majority of the population in favour of some change now.  It very much depends on how questions are put to the population.  While the Irish people would not in present circumstances or perhaps in any circumstances approve of freely available divorce, the vast majority of them realise that we have reached the stage where some steps must be taken.  Consultations with the Churches can proceed while we are debating this Bill.  We are all aware of the stance of the Catholic Church on this issue but there are many things which the Catholic Church, of which I am a member, has held to be morally wrong but which it has never suggested should be prohibited by the State.  This issue comes into that category.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Taoiseach, and members of all parties, to support our Bill when a vote is taken on it next week. We will be amenable to holding consultations with any party after the Dáil has passed the Second Stage of the Bill.  The committee system now operated by the Dáil is an ideal method for such consultations. The Labour Party have introduced this Bill because for years we have been interested in this subject.  That interest arose from our concern for people and the problems and worries that affect them.  There is no doubt that poverty, bad housing and poor education lead to difficulties in marriages.  I am not saying that broken marriages exist exclusively among deprived people but remedies to broken marriages are more difficult to find for such people.  Those who are better equipped financially find it easier to find a solution to such problems.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="3229" /> I appeal for support for our Bill on behalf of the many people who are living in misery.  There has been stalling on this issue since I was first elected to this House.  Successive Governments have failed to grasp this nettle.  Deputies should be heartened by the fact that there is more public support for a change in the law in regard to divorce.  We must take cognisance of the views of the public. Support has grown for a change in the law because the general public are more aware of the problem.  We should not allow the problem to get any worse.  We should play our part in trying to bring peace and happiness and a reason for living to those who are caught in this trap. I appeal for support for our measure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. D. Andrews Mr. D. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank Deputy Desmond for a compassionate contribution on a very serious social problem that affects the country and will continue to do so until we in our collective wisdom in the House decide to resolve it. I have already made a contribution in the debate on the report of the Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown and, in the circumstances, it is not my intention to take up too much of the time of the House on the subject once more.  I have been a Member of the House for a long time and, as Deputy Desmond said, on a number of occasions during those years the subject has raised its head but more so in the recent past.  That is as it should be.  The House should be concerned about this serious social problem. When issues like this are brought before the House, as they should be, I see it as my function to express a point of view. There is no doubt that this can be described as a controversial issue.  If I am seen to engage in controversy those who do not agree with my view will have a tremendous remedy at the next general election. If they do not support my point of view they can vote against me but in the meantime I have an obligation as a Deputy to lead and not to be led on this issue.  All Members have a similar obligation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Pressure groups are entitled to express <Col N="3230" /> their views to Deputies and, having considered those views, Deputies should make up their minds.  However, Deputies should not be put under personal pressure by lobby groups.  Such groups have a legitimate role to play in a democracy and I do not see anything wrong with that but when the lobbying becomes hysterical, aggressive and less than democratic it is dangerous.  Fianna Fáil are not opposed to the holding of a referendum on this issue and that is the correct position for the party to adopt.  Divorce is final and before it becomes a reality every possible effort should be made by the State and the Churches to bring about reconciliation between the parties.  I want to emphasise the role of the Churches and the State here.  The offers of the country should be opened to those organisations that help marriage reconciliation.  The Churches should also receive financial help because some of their groups engage in marriage reconciliation work.</P>
    <P>The real victims when a marriage is breaking down are the children.  The family have no part in the court proceedings but up to that time they are very much involved emotionally.  We have all heard horrible stories of the young victims of rows between two adults who cannot stand the sight of one another.  I do not and will not support legislation which proposes quickie divorces.  All the conciliation machinery must be used no matter how difficult it is for the parties concerned.  However, if a marriage has irretrievably broken down the reasonable and proper step is divorce.  I do not suggest instant divorces and I cannot offer instant solutions.  On this side of the House we are offering concern and sympathy. Help should be directed towards bringing about a resolution of serious problems that arise between consenting adults.</P>
    <P>I have great sympathy for the views expressed by Deputies Eileen Desmond and Taylor on this issue but I do not have any sympathy for the Bill which I consider to be defective in its wording.  I have sympathy with its intent but not with its wording.  Last evening Deputy Woods <Col N="3231" /> dealt clearly and in detail with the objections to be found in the wording of this Labour Bill.  I have no wish to enter into a contentious area but what appears to be happening in this case is that once more the Government are not governing and are allowing the Labour rump to carry the Bill.  This is another example of how tragic Coalition Governments have been in the history of this State.  We have a Taoiseach who consults the Churches when it suits him to consult them but who fails to consult them when that course suits him.  In a strange sort of way this could be regarded as some kind of consistency. It is somewhat like announcing the closure of various hospitals and an educational establishment and then announcing that there would be consultations about those closures.  Of course the Churches have a legitimate role in the whole area of divorce.  Their opinions and their views must be considered and taken into account in any well run democracy. Fianna Fáil support a referendum to remove the constitutional ban on divorce.  Personally I, too, support the removal of that ban.  Consequently, when a referendum is before the people I will be voting to have that ban removed. There can be no equivocation in relation to my position on this subject.  I have said that before; I am saying it again, and, if necessary, I will repeat it.</P>
    <P>When the wording for a referendum is resolved after what I consider to be a little piece of cod-acting by the group of people representing themselves to be our Government and when the question is put to the people I will give my constituents the solemn undertaking that they will have the benefit of my total silence during the run up to referendum day.  My view is to let the people decide.  In the meantime let the political parties have their say in the House.  Let us have the views of all those Deputies who feel they have a contribution to make on this subject but let us stop the name calling. If there are Deputies who do not wish to make a contribution, so be it.  That is their democratic right, too.  We must not think any the less of them.  If there are <Col N="3232" /> some whose views on this subject are different from mine I will respect those points of view.  That is the sort of attitude that will make the debate great.</P>
    <P>When we agree to let the people decide we can express our views here but when the campaign begins, the political parties should stand back.  If other organisations, the Churches or any other, wish to become involved in the referendum campaign that is their democratic right but as politicians we have a duty, after the campaign begins, to say as little as possible. My view is that silence, too, can help causes on occasion.  It can also help democracy.  During the pro-life referendum we witnessed a very unfortunate public confrontation that was much to the detriment of the solutions that were being sought and which did not do politicians or politics any good.  Some of the organisations, both in the pro-and anticamps, did not do their case any good either.</P>
    <P>In the manner in which they are dealing with this subject the Government on this occasion as on other occasions have lost the moral authority reposed in them by the people to rule.  The Government should take the decent line and, in Japanese style, fall collectively on the sword. They were elected to govern but it is a sad day for the country when there is a two party condition, and I use the word &ldquo;condition&rdquo; advisedly, because it is a condition of democratic illness, who cannot agree between them and when there is the kind of sordid nonsense we are witnessing this evening, and which can only be a tragedy for the cause that is espoused. The Fine Gael faction of the Coalition are saying that they will not support the other faction of the Government.</P>
    <P>This Labour Party Bill does not propose protection for children.  It provides for a token gesture, as Deputy Woods said, towards those who are referred to as interested dependants.  That is not a protection for children but it is towards that area that our minds should be directed in the first instance.  In divorce cases the warring parties, and I use that term with respect, are consenting adults but the suffers in that battle are the <Col N="3233" /> children concerned.  There is no worthwhile protection for children in this Bill. However, I expect that the family law lawyers will deal with that question when making their contributions.</P>
    <P>On the question of the role of Church and State, I made my position clear when I made my contributions to the committee on marriage breakdown.  I have no difficulty personally so far as this question is concerned.  I was brought up in the old fashioned, radical, republican tradition where the &ldquo;Tonite&rdquo; kind of republicanism was abroad.  That is still my position.  I lived in a part of the community where my neighbours included Catholics, Protestants and people without any religion.  I was taught to respect all of them.  The Churches have a legitimate and unchallengeable right to express their points of view on any subject that arises in the State but, equally, as a representative in this House, I have my rights and I must express what I consider to be in the interest of all the people.  I am a Catholic and a practising one and I make no apology for that but I must take account of other denominations, of the views of Protestants, Jews, Seventh Day Adventists or any other group.  That is where I see the distinction between the role of the Churches and the role of the State.  I will not be intimidated by my religious beliefs nor will I allow those beliefs to allow me intimidate others. That is what we should be about in a pure democratic republic.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the fact that this Bill is before the House though I regret that it is not a Government Bill.  I regret also that this has led to a different approach being taken on the part of each of the Government parties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As other speakers have said this evening, the issue before us has been raised in many instances and in many different ways not only in the lifetime of this Dáil but of preceeding Dáils.  To some extent this Dáil has taken the matter a great deal more seriously than any of its predecessors. We have had a committee on marital breakdown.  That joint committee examined extensively the entire area of <Col N="3234" /> marriage and marital breakdown during a period of about 18 months until they reported at the beginning of April 1985. The committee reported within a time schedule.  They indicated that people on all sides of the House took the view that what was involved was an urgent social problem that had to be confronted.  That committee may not have achieved everything some of us would have wished them to achieve but they undertook the most comprehensive examination of our matrimonial laws since the foundation of the State.  A natural progression from the publication of the report was a debate here and also in the Seanad during which the merits or otherwise of the report were discussed.  About 35 Members of this House contributed to the debate.  These were Deputies from all sides though it should be said that Members on some sides were more reluctant to contribute than were others.  The debate concluded in January and all that could be said has been said not merely on the issue of divorce but on the issue of what comprehensive law reform is required generally to deal with our marital laws.</P>
    <P>What is now required is legislative action in this House.  It is the tradition in this House that legislative action is normally forthcoming from the Government of the day.  It is also part and parcel of the rules of this House that individual Deputies or parties through Private Members' Bills can introduce necessary legislation.  This Bill is following a fairly natural sequence of events following the report of the Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown which recommended that a referendum be held on the divorce issue, and following a comprehensive debate in this House and in the Seanad on that report in which the majority of Deputies and Senators from different perspectives all accepted the view that there should be a referendum on the divorce issue.</P>
    <P>Some expressed that view on the basis of acknowledging that divorce was necessary to meet a major social problem. Others said a referendum was necessary to find out the public view although they were opposed to divorce, and others took <Col N="3235" /> a neutral view, simply that the people had a right to be consulted.  The people have a right to be consulted on this issue. This House should not abdicate its role to pilot through a referendum Bill and pass on that role to a series of successive opinion polls, none of which can have any legislative effect or any real reforming effect.</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods said last night that there was something unusual or extraordinary about the procedure which we are now operating.  If Deputy Woods was as proficient a constitutional lawyer as he pretended to be yesterday evening in his contribution he would be aware that Articles 46 and 47 of the Constitution refer to the sovereign right of our people to amend the Constitution by way of referendum. Indeed, there have been two referenda during the lifetime of this Government on two totally disparate issues.  When &mdash; according to the recent opinion poll &mdash; 77 per cent of our people favour the provision of divorce in limited circumstances and divorce remains constitutionally prohibited, we as a Legislature have a duty to extend to the people the opportunity to bring about constitutional reform.  Our people have a right to be consulted by the legislators to ascertain whether they favour such constitutional reform.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting that the provision of divorce or holding a referendum is the solution to all the problems in this area. Anybody who suggests that is talking nonsense.  One of the things lost sight of during the controversy surrounding the report was that the report recommended the most comprehensive overhaul of our family law system ever suggested in the history of the State.  That report set out a series of legal reforms and social and administrative changes which sought to copperfasten and protect marriages, to provide support for marriages which were at risk.  It also sought to update the legal mechanisms available to deal with the consequences of marital breakdown in a wide variety of areas from dealing with the problems of the courts granting decrees of separation, to dealing with <Col N="3236" /> the anomalies that arise in barring order procedures and to dealing in greater detail than does our current law with providing additional protection for children who are caught up in the tragedy of marital breakdown.</P>
    <P>Listening to the contributions made by both Deputy Woods and Deputy Andrews one would think that none of these issues is currently dealt with in our law.  Custody disputes arise in courts throughout the length and breadth of the country on a daily basis in circumstances in which marriages have broken down. Judges are adjudicating on what should be done in the interests of the welfare of the children to provide them with protection and to ensure that proper provision is made for their custody and care, and that proper supports are available to them.  To someone who works on a daily basis with people who suffer the tragedy of marital breakdown and someone who is probably more familiar than any other Member of this House with court procedures, it is nauseating to hear the political claptrap talked in this House about protecting the welfare of children when Members of this House, and in particular successive Fianna Fáil Governments, have been totally unconcerned with that issue and seem blissfully and ignorantly unaware of the manner in which we are dealing with issues relating to children at present.</P>
    <P>Whether or not we have divorce is irrelevant in this area because we have thousands of children caught up in situations of marital breakdown where parents are separating and where courts are adjudicating on the future of those children.  The presence or absence of divorce will not change that.  We have in our community tens of thousands of people who are the casualties of broken marriages.  Their plight demands a response from this House, not just in the area of providing divorce.</P>
    <P>During the course of the debate in the Dáil on the report of the committee I proposed that a special task force should be established within the Civil Service to draft comprehensive legislation to implement the totality of the recommendations <Col N="3237" /> of the committee.  Nothing has been done about that.  The slow nature of legislative reform and the years it takes to draft simple reforming legislation in this House, never fail to amaze me.</P>
    <P>The need to provide comprehensive legislation to deal with all the issues which fall short of divorce does not mean that we can leave aside the necessity to hold a referendum.  The report of the Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown recognises that we have a gigantic problem in marital breakdown.  It does not add to the credibility of Members of this House to argue statistically as to whether we are talking about 30,000, 40,000, 50,000 or 60,000 adults affected by the problem.  There are different statistics. From seeing this at first hand, from seeing the numbers of court cases being held in private, it is my view that the statistic of 70,000 people being caught in the tragedy of marital breakdown, which is sometimes castigated, is not a wild exaggeration, but a conservative statistic. When finally a census is held in which a question is asked about the numbers of people who are separated spouses, we will discover that a great deal more than 70,000 are affected.  I do not care whether it is 40,000, 50,000 or 70,000 in the context of this argument.  If it was 10,000, 12,000 or 20,000, we in this House have a duty to seek to ameliorate the plight of those people who are the casualties of marriage breakdown.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note the different weight given by politicians within the Oireachtas to different aspects of marriage problems.  Some people suggest that, if it affects only 20,000 or 30,000 people, it is not a problem that demands our attention but that if it affected 70,000 or 80,000 it might be such a problem.  Is it not curious that in 1972 the then Fianna Fáil Government, when the late Erskine Childers was Minister for Health, passed the 1972 Marriages Act one major provision of which was to provide retrospective recognition to a couple of hundred marriages of Irish people celebrated in Lourdes.  It was one of the happy holiday periods in Irish politics in the mid-sixties. The Sunday papers specialised in running <Col N="3238" /> pictures of the aeroplane on the tarmac. with the local hero waving to the hordes while climbing up to his plane.  The local TD would go off to Lourdes with his intended loved one and a plane packed with parishioners from his constituency, accompanied by the local priest.  After a few days celebration, the local priest would conduct a marriage and they would all return to the plane and fly back to Dublin.  Everybody would get great publicity. Then many of them discovered that in order to be validly married at Lourdes it was necessary to go through a civil ceremony and not only were the marriages not recognised in Lourdes but they were not recognised in Ireland either.  As this was a major social problem affecting at least 200 people, who could have resolved their difficulties simply by going through another ceremony here, the 1972 Act provided for the retrospective recognition of marriages at Lourdes &mdash; an issue of major national concern and of tremendous importance.  If this House thought fit to pass legislation to deal with that matter, how can Members expect to be taken seriously if they are unwilling to face up to the position obtaining for up to 50,000 adults whom our law pretends are married but who have ceased to be married in reality?</P>
    <P>Divorce does only one thing.  It extends the right of re-marriage to those whose marriages have collapsed totally.  To those who argue we should not have divorce, I ask what social advantage arises in preventing a 28-year old battered wife or a 30-year old deserted husband from re-marrying when there is no prospect of their ever again living with the person they first married?  I fail to see where the social advantage, the justice, the compassion and the humanity lies in continuing to tolerate such a situation.</P>
    <P>When a spouse is permanently departed from the marital home, what right have we as a society to deny the possibility of future marital happiness to the deserted spouse left residing in the family home?  No one here would suggest that a widow or widower should be prevented from re-marrying.  Indeed, if someone here suggested such a thing <Col N="3239" /> there would be a reaction of outrage.  We would have hordes of people protesting outside this House that everyone inside had gone stark, raving mad.  What is not always understood by those Members who do not regularly come across the problem of marital breakdown in their work &mdash; although they occasionally come across it in their clinics or in their own families &mdash; is that the grief experienced by the casualties of a broken marriage is no different in many cases from the grief experienced by people who suffer the bereavement of a spouse.  The irony is that casualties of broken marriages not only suffer grief but their experience is greatly exacerbated by the fact that they experience rejection.  That feeling is also exacerbated by the legal provisions which deny them the future possibility of entering into marriage in a socially acceptable and constitutional framework.  This debate is not about the merits of demerits of divorce.  What it is about is whether we should extend to the electorate the entitlement to express their views.  I say, what right have we to deny them such entitlement on an issue of such major social importance?</P>
    <P>Nobody yet has welcomed the new Minister for Justice to his new post.  I do so now and I have no doubt he will distinguish himself in office.  However, he has been put in an unfortunate position. The Taoiseach's approach is that this is not the right time to hold a referendum and different reasons have been given.  It has been suggested it is not the right time because it may not succeed.  I am not a prophet and I do not know if it will succeed.  However, I do not think there will ever be a right time in which anyone can guarantee it will succeed.</P>
    <P>The purpose of a referendum is not to get a major reaction from the people. The purpose is to obtain their views and to give them an opportunity to express them in the context of an issue regarded as important enough to go to them for a decision, and I hope in the context of an informed debate.  Some 77 per cent of the people have said that in certain circumstances they believe divorce is desirable. <Col N="3240" /> Usually those circumstances are where the spouse is deserted, battered or has been left because the other person has established a relationship with a third party.  That percentage has varied and at times it has been as low as 70 per cent. However, the fact that 77 per cent of the people have given their views merits our allowing the issue to go to the electorate.</P>
    <P>Nobody here is suggesting that divorce should be generally available, or possibly compulsory.  Everyone is talking about making divorce available in circumstances where a marriage has irretrievably and completely collapsed, where there is no possibility that the marriage can remain viable and where it is not reasonable to expect spouses to continue to live together.  In many instances they have ceased to live together.  There is no question of anything other than the provision of divorce in certain circumstances. Even when the general question is asked, a majority of people are in favour of a change in the Constitution.  I am not a prophet and I do not know what would be the result.  However, because of the extent of the social problem we have a duty to give people an opportunity to express their views.</P>
    <P>I can understand the reason the Taoiseach has taken the approach he has adopted and I would not in any circumstances be personally critical of him.  He has adopted the approach of proposing further discussions with the Churches because he realises there is a problem and there is a need to tackle it.  He has a desire to do what he sees is possible to minimise bitterness and division that could arise in what undoubtedly would be an emotional referendum campaign.  I wish him well in that task but I do not believe that carrying out such consultations creates a problem here for the House to pass the Bill on Second Stage. Even if this Bill is passed this side of Easter it will not go any further.  There must be a Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Some Members have said that the wording of the Bill is not perfect and I would also take issue with some of the wording.  However, some of the criticisms of Deputy Woods and Deputy <Col N="3241" /> O'Malley have been grossly inaccurate and have no substance in law.  They do not deserve to be taken seriously.  For example, Deputy O'Malley suggested last night that if this measure were passed we could never again in the future recognise foreign decrees of divorce.  That is total nonsense.  The Bill has nothing to do with that matter.</P>
    <P>The measure is not perfect but it is a Bill capable of amendment.  It provides a vehicle to enable a referendum to be held, which could be processed here while the Taoiseach completes his discussions. I do not believe it would be seen in any way as pre-empting those discussions because at the end of the day, irrespective of the groups consulted, it is the Members of this House who must make the decision. It might, indeed, be helpful for discussions to be held while we debate this issue in the House in a way which does not create religious bitterness or division.  One is not mutually exclusive of the other.  The difficulty with the approach being adopted now in the context of these discussions is that there is no assurance that these discussions can be completed in any particular timescale. The difficulty with discussions of this nature is that they can be ongoing.  There is no guarantee or assurance that, during the lifetime of this Dáil, this issue will go to the people unless this Bill is passed through this House.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice, speaking last night, said the issue should be postponed pending the completion of these discussions. The Taoiseach hopes these discussions will be concluded in March and I accept entirely his genuineness and his motivation, but I am not sure whether he can control the discussions to ensure that they will be concluded in March.  If we complete this Second Stage debate successfully, I see no problem in Committee Stage not taking place until March has passed, with a view to providing any amendments necessary to this measure in the context of the Committee Stage debate and in the light of any discussions with the Churches.</P>
    <P>Leaving aside the constitutional issues, <Col N="3242" /> I ask the Minister to ensure that something of substance is done to bring before this House the legislation required to implement all the other aspects of the committee's report, none of which is controversial and all of which have agreement from all sides.  Their implementation would be widely welcomed, but to date the only gesture in the direction of implementing these recommendations is the announcement by the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach that in three or four months' time we will start running a pilot mediation service for a period of three years, funded to the enormous amount of £75,000, which will just about recruit two counsellors, provide for a building and presumably a secretary. I do not see this as a serious attempt to implement the recommendations made by this committee.  That service will be swamped within weeks of opening.</P>
    <P>For many of those who joined Fine Gael between 1977 and 1981 and for some of those who stood in three successive elections for Fine Gael, seeking election to this House in 1981 and twice in 1982, and for some of us who were fortunate enough to be elected on each of those occasions, and for many who voted for Fine Gael in those elections, I believe the response of the Fine Gael Party to this Bill will be seen as the litmus test of our personal commitment and the commitment of my party to constitutional social reform.  I personally believe &mdash; and I say this fully aware of the political predicament in which I find myself &mdash; that unless a significant number of members of the Fine Gael Parliamentary Party support this Bill in the lobbies on a Second Stage vote, irreparable and permanent damage will be done to the Fine Gael Party and to the credibility of the party's commitment to social and constitutional reform.</P>
    <P>I listened with interest to Deputy Woods last night reciting the family Articles of the Constitution.  I found Deputy Woods' performance more nauseating than usual.  The total indifference to the family in marital breakdown which is truly the position of the Fianna Fáil Party <Col N="3243" /> was so clearly exposed by the failure of members of that party fully and properly to contribute to the debate on the report of the Oireachtas joint committee.</P>
    <P>Deputy David Andrews says his party are doing the right thing in not opposing a referendum.  Deputy Andrews regularly comes into this House and expresses all the right sentiments.  I have not yet seen him vote in accordance with those sentiments. If he is in favour of a referendum he should vote in favour of this Bill.  It is as simple as that.  The Fianna Fáil Party are paralysed by indecision, playing political ping-pong with the lives of those whose marriages have collapsed.  At least the approach the Taoiseach is taking is based, I have no doubt, on a genuine wish to resolve some of the problems associated with this issue, although unfortunately I do not believe that outside this House his approach will be seen that way by a great many people.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil Party are sitting gloriously on the fence, looking in two directions at the same time, hoping to offend no one and do nothing to assist anyone. They sit there pontificating about the importance of the family.  A more nauseating performance is very difficult to imagine.</P>
    <P>I do not think the wording of this proposal is perfect.  Aspects need to be tidied up to ensure that a clear and concise proposition goes to the people.  What needs to be tidied up is no more than the normal type of difficulty which arises on Committee Stage of any important measure. I do not see any major difficulty.  I do not think it is beyond the intellectual capacity of Members of the Oireachtas to frame appropriate amendments to make this measure properly workable and presentable to the people.  Those people who do not support this measure because they suggest it is improperly drafted are merely looking for an easy excuse to get out of voting in favour of it.</P>
    <P>When we take a vote on this Bill next Wednesday the Whip will not apply in my party.  Within the Fine Gael Parliamentary Party there are a great many Deputies who believe we should face up <Col N="3244" /> to this issue.  Among Fine Gael people at branch level and those who voted for Fine Gael in successive elections, there is a wish that this issue be faced up to and that a referendum be held.  I hope the media are wrong in predicting that this Bill will fail.  I hope we will take it through Second Stage and, in the absence of a Government measure providing for a referendum, that this Bill will be processed fully through both Houses of the Oireachtas to extend to the people the right they have to make a decision in a referendum pursuant to Articles 46 and 47 of our Constitution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>Having spoken already for over three quarters of an hour in the debate on the report of the committee, there is obviously not much which I did not include in that contribution.  Having listened to the debate over the past two days there are a number of points that could very usefully be made.  I must comment on the complete and utter lack of interest in the House in relation to this debate proper.  This is one of the most important, if not the most important piece of legislation to have come before the House during my three years as a Member.  The total apathy and lack of interest in the debate is terrible, to say the least.  There is a reluctance on the part of the Opposition to become involved in the debate.  Many costs were incurred in relation to the report on this subject and all parties participated freely in its compilation. Now we find that there is a reluctance to have speakers participating in this debate.  It is being avoided like an Irish plague.  People do not want even to be seen in the House when the matter is being debated.</P>
      <P>In general this outlines the attitude towards the whole question of divorce and social reform.  It would seem that if a person appears on the same platform where the subject is being discussed he or she might be tainted with the same terrible affliction as the Labour Party are regarded as having because they want to carry out social reform which both Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael have very skilfully avoided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="3245" /> I listened with great interest last night to Deputy Michael Woods, the spokesman on behalf of the Opposition.  Other than the attempted castigation of the Labour Party and the Fine Gael Party for not being able to bring in an agreed Bill, he made no contribution to the subject matter.  I have the highest respect for Deputy Woods; I can understand the position he is faced with, because he could not very well agree with the terms of the Labour Party Bill, but at the same time he could not actually disagree with the concept of introducing divorce by Government legislation.  The Labour Party are very much a part of Government. Perhaps they are numerically the smallest party but that does not leave us an unequal partner in relation to the type of legislation which will go, or has gone, through the House.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party must take credit for any social legislation that has gone through the House during the last three years.  My colleague, the Minister for Health, has introduced quite a number of Bills and will be introducing further Bills which we hope will fulfil the expectancy of the Labour Party when we entered into Coalition three years ago. During Question Time I asked the Taoiseach a supplementary question.  I do not want to be too critical of him as he is not here but I will not accept the excuse of consulting with the Churches for not supporting the Labour Party Bill.  My colleague, Deputy Mervyn Taylor, introduced this Bill during the last session of the Dáil and there was more than adequate time in which the Taoiseach could have written a simple letter and invited the Church leaders in to discuss this subject with him.</P>
    <P>I believe Deputy Cluskey put it in its proper perspective last night.  Whilst consultation is necessary and welcome as far as the Labour Party are concerned, the views of all the Churches in relation to divorce are well known publicly, nationally and internationally.  I do not believe we will ever solve the problem of the 70,000 people who are living in misery as a result of marriage breakdown throughout the country if we are to consult and <Col N="3246" /> get agreement from all the various organisations within the State who have very strong views on this very important subject of divorce.  It would not be possible to frame a Bill which would be acceptable to all the different interests and pressure groups.  Therefore, it must rest with the Members of Dáil Éireann to frame the necessary Bill which will put this very bad situation right.</P>
    <P>During the past two weeks I asked a question in relation to deserted wife's allowance and in relation to single parents or unmarried mothers.  The situation is that at the end of 1985 the State paid out over £31 million in taxpayer's money to deserted wives.  I believe many of those deserted wives are not deserted wives in the true sense of the law and in the true sense of the regulations of the Department of Social Welfare.  I could produce positive proof of many claims for deserted wife's allowance which are not in effect according to the regulations. I respectfully suggest that deserted wife's allowances are being paid to women when their husbands are living at the other end of the street.  I suggest that many hundreds of deserted wives are being paid this allowance when they know very well where their husbands are. That is not a criticism of the system.  That is the system as we find it, which forces people to be deserted in order to qualify for the allowances.  I believe the reason why this is now being done on a large scale is that we have not proper courts to deal with the subject of separation and we have not proper courts to deal with the question of what happens to children after marriages break down, after couples separate and after the husbands go down the street and live in flats and then the women put in an application and get the deserted wife's allowance for themselves and their children while their husbands are having a good laugh at the whole thing; they do not pay any maintenance or honour the judgments of the courts which apply maintenance orders of £40 or £60 a week.  Why should they do that when the State provides for their wives and children a deserted wife's <Col N="3247" /> allowance simply because we have not proper law in operation?</P>
    <P>I believe the same thing is in operation in relation to unmarried mothers.  It is simpler not to get married than to get married.  There is no longer a real incentive to get married in Ireland.  We have only to look at the startling increase in the amount of money provided, £19 million paid out in 1985 in unmarried mother's, single parent's allowances and benefits and contrast that with what was happening in the country ten years ago in relation to single parent's allowances and benefits and deserted wife's allowances and we will very quickly come to the conclusion that there is a great need for change in the law.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting that the Bill introduced by Deputy Taylor on behalf of the Labour Party will give a solution to all the problems we now face in relation to this subject.  I am, however, suggesting that we have had the guts to bring forward a Bill, however unpopular it may be in some sectors, which will allow for a national debate, for a local debate, for a debate amongst the community at large in order that every sector of the community can give their views and can be informed.</P>
    <P>We went into Government with Fine Gael.  We supported the Fine Gael Party many times and I as a backbencher of the Labour Party trotted up through the Tá lobby against my will on many an occasion when I would have preferred to have gone the other way, supporting legislation which was part and parcel of the policy of Fine Gael.  I know that many of my colleagues acted similarly and I know that the reverse is the case, that Bills put through, particularly in the social field, were supported by Fine Gael when they might have liked to vote against them.  That is what Coalition is all about.  That is why I fail to see why we cannot get the support of our colleagues in Government for this important Bill.  Surely it is not unreasonable to allow it to go through to the next Stage at least, as Deputy Shatter said.  If Fianna Fáil or if the Progressive Democrats, as outlined <Col N="3248" /> by the leader of that party, propose amendments to the Bill in the hope of perhaps meeting their aspirations or strengthening the Bill in whatever way they see fit, then if such amendments are put forward and are reasonable, if we are satisfied that they will meet our policy and our points of view and if they would strengthen the Bill, then they can be considered reasonably, but that is not what is happening.</P>
    <P>This House is running away from its constitutional responsibility and handing it over to all sorts of pressure groups. That is not what the national Parliament was meant to be, and there is no place in the community any longer for those of us who wish to shy away from our responsibilities. Our responsibility is to govern, and never in the history of this State was there a time more suited to governing. The whole social fabric of this country is falling apart because successive Governments, in particular the Fianna Fáil Party who have been the party longest in government in this State, have put very little, if any, good social legislation on the Statute Book, and certainly no effective social legislation of any value has been put on the Statute Book.  That is why we have today this constant running away and finding reasons why we should not legislate, constantly asking people for their opinions and then when we get the collective opinions we have not the guts to make the decision.</P>
    <P>We are putting this Bill up to the other two main political parties in this Dáil next week, and I hazard a guess that if it is voted down, then if those unfortunate 70,000 families are in a desperate situation now, 140,000 families will be in the same situation or worse ten years from now when many of us will not be here in this House to discuss the same subject again and again and run away from it.</P>
    <P>I was very pleased and proud to be part of the Labour Party who introduced this Bill and I was proud of its introduction by my colleague, Deputy Taylor, our Chief Whip, who knows the law.  He is a trained barrister and solicitor.  Other people in this House at this very moment are also trained in the administration of the law <Col N="3249" /> and they and every Deputy, male and female, know the problems created by broken marriages.  They meet them in their clinics every week.  They know the housing problems they create.  They know the problems created for children. They know the problems created in trying to get payments for unfortunate women when husbands just disappeared, and yet they are prepared to run away from those problems when it comes to correcting them.  Why are they doing that?  They are doing it for a few miserable votes.  The people will not thank us for that.</P>
    <P>I would prefer to go out of this House feeling that I have been a part of a Dáil that has legislated on behalf of all the people, not on behalf of all Christians, not on behalf of any one sector of the community, but on behalf of the people who collectively sent us here to represent them.  I say again to our colleagues in Fine Gael that before this Dáil finishes we will have to go up those stairs and support them on the introduction of legislation that we will not want.  I tell them that if we are to have any faith and certainly any respect for the idea of Coalition, then it can only be on the basis that we respect each other's views and that we have to take the bad medicine with the good.</P>

      <P>I welcome a second opportunity to make a contribution in this debate on marriage breakdown and this divorce Bill.  As in the debate before Christmas, it was very difficult to get Members around the House, especially from the far side, to speak on the Bill. I make no apology for referring to the contributions from that side and in particular the way the Members there are scurrying from their responsibilities.  I listened, as everybody else did, to the spokesman on behalf of Fianna Fáil last night saying that they would not be opposed to holding a referendum on divorce but this would have to be done following a Bill sponsored by the Government as a whole, that they would give constructive consideration to any mature and complete proposals and that as a party &mdash; which I presume means that there would <Col N="3250" /> be no free vote &mdash; they would take a responsible and caring decision &mdash; I suppose such as they are taking now on this. They complained that the wording of the Bill before us is vague, inadequate and uncertain.  Does that mean they would vote against it because of that?</P>
      <P>For taking this brave initiative the Labour Party are accused of cynical backroom tactics.  This is the contribution made by the party who claim to be the biggest party in the country.  Their spokesman said further that this Bill has not the support of the Government.  If it had the support of the Government, would Fianna Fáil back it?  Their statements seem contradictory.  Just who is using cynical backroom tactics and when will this hypocrisy which was evident here month after month for the past three years be recognised finally by the people? I am tempted to say that the conscience cry of Fianna Fáil should be not &ldquo;Arise and follow Charlie&rdquo; but &ldquo;Home, Charlie, and do not spare the Whip&rdquo;.</P>

In a study on the British backbencher Peter Richards said that, while politicians understand the need to restrict controversy in the interest of their party, the internal strains within the party are severe and when these become too powerful to be restrained by pleas for unity some form of eruption must follow. We have seen that over there with the departure of those people who could not stand the strain.  The attitude of Fianna Fáil towards this Bill and most social legislation requiring them to make a stand is: &ldquo;Damn your principles and stick to your party&rdquo;.  That may be sound tactical advice but not infrequently it fails to appease rebellious spirits.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>It gives me great satisfaction this evening to bring this legislation before the Dáil.  I can say without fear of contradiction that no other single issue has been for so many years the cause of women's resentment, of women's outrage, and justifiably so.  No other issue of women's rights has been the subject of so many submissions, so many appeals to successive Governments, or has been a talking point at women's conferences and seminars and at political lobbying.  It has been regarded as the most explicit statement that Irish women are appendages and chattels of their husbands.  This status is now being laid to rest.  Women have had to wait too long to have this matter resolved. Tonight we are seeing the dismantling of this ugly concept of the dependent domicile of married women.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The basic purpose of the Bill is simple. It is to amend the law relating to domicile <Col N="3252" /> by abolishing what is called the domicile of dependency of married women.  That is a reference to the discriminatory rule under which the domicile of a married woman is deemed to be the same as that of her husband.  This Bill would enable her to have an independent domicile.</P>
    <P>The Bill also proposes to make changes in the rules relating to the domicile of minor children and the recognition of foreign divorces.  These are, in the main, consequential on the change in the law as to the domicile of a married woman. As I will explain later, once the domicile of dependency of married women is abolished, some change must be made in the rules of recognition of foreign divorces. That is why the question of recognition of foreign divorces is dealt with in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Domicile is a legal concept that comes into play only in certain cases, all of these being cases which have a foreign element. For most people, the concept of domicile is an irrelevance, even if they are involved in some legal dispute.  In the great majority of cases that come before the Irish courts, there is no foreign element and the court simply applies the ordinary internal Irish law.  For example, the question whether a person is guilty of an offence, or is liable to pay damages for negligence, if he or she is involved in a road accident in Dublin depends solely on Irish law, irrespective of where he or she comes from or whether he or she is an Irish citizen or not.  But if, for example, a man, an Irish citizen married to an Englishwoman, leaves his wife and goes to live in Ruritania, gets a divorce from his wife and marries a Ruritanian woman, the question of domicile could be important. For instance, if he dies leaving property in Ireland to his second wife, the Irish courts may have to decide whether his Ruritanian divorce and remarriage and his will should be recognised as valid in Irish law, to say nothing of the liability of his estate to taxation in Ireland.  Part of the importance of domicile is that for some purposes, especially those of family law, the Irish court, when it has to decide these questions, has to apply the law of <Col N="3253" /> the country in which the person concerned was domiciled at the material time.</P>
    <P>I should add that, although it is generally true in the common law countries, of which we are one, that questions of this kind are decided according to the law of the domicile of the person concerned, in many other countries the test used is that of nationality and not domicile.  Moreover, yet another test, habitual residence, is being increasingly used as the connecting factor in specific areas of the law, especially in accordance with recent international agreements.</P>
    <P>As a general proposition, a person is regarded by the law as domiciled in the country in which he has his permanent home.  At birth a person acquires a domicile of origin, usually that of his father. That domicile of origin remains unless and until he acquires a domicile of choice in another country by going to reside in that country with the intention of residing there for the indefinite future.  If he subsequently ceases to reside in that country without acquiring a domicile of choice in another country, his domicile of origin revives.  These rules, however, do not apply in relation to married women.  A married woman is deemed to have the domicile of her husband.  For convenience, I have made those statements at this point without qualification, but it should be understood that there may well be a question mark, to put it no stronger, as to whether such a rule, or at all events some applications of it, can have survived the enactment of the Constitution.  That issue has not been tested.</P>
    <P>The concept of domicile has been criticised in a number of respects.  The central importance of intention in establishing domicile has been said to make for difficulty and uncertainty.  The revival of the domicile of origin can in certain circumstances produce strange results.  However, the feature which has been most criticised in recent years is the rule that denies to a married woman the ability to determine by her own intentions and actions where her domicile should be. The present rule in relation to married women means that even if the couple are <Col N="3254" /> separated and even if the wife has never lived in her husband's country of domicile &mdash; which may be different from the country in which the couple have been married and have lived together before separating &mdash; and even if she has no intention of ever living in her husband's country of domicile, she will be fixed with a domicile in that country.  In these circumstances she can find that important legal questions affecting her fall to be regulated by the laws of a country which is totally foreign to her.</P>
    <P>It is unnecessary to labour the point that the rule is clearly discriminatory.  It may have been appropriate in other times, in other social conditions, which I doubt.  But few, I think, would argue that it is a rule that should remain part of our law.</P>
    <P>As I have already said, the basic purpose of the Bill is to abolish the domicile of dependency of married women.  That is achieved by section 1.  Under that provision a married woman will have an independent domicile which will be ascertained by reference to the same factors as apply to other persons generally.</P>
    <P>The enactment of this section will have significance in relation to a number of international conventions.  There are a number of these conventions which prohibit discrimination between men and women in respect of various matters, including domicile.  Among these agreements are the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of all forms of Discrimination against Women, the United Nations Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Seventh Protocol to the European Convention on Human Rights.  Our existing law on domicile has been one obstacle in the way of ratification of these agreements.  This Bill when enacted will remove that obstacle.</P>
    <P>The other provisions in the Bill dealing with domicile are, broadly speaking, consequential on the main provision in section 1.</P>
    <P>Section 2 provides that the Bill will not have retrospective effect.  In other words, any question arising in future as to what domicile a woman had at any given time before the commencement of the Act will <Col N="3255" /> be decided according to the law in force at that given time.  That is as it should be, since it is impossible to know what injustice might arise from any attempt to change people's domiciles retrospectively. On the other hand, if it is necessary to determine what domicile a woman has at any time after the commencement of the Act, the matter will, under section 3, be determined as if the legislation had always been in force.  This means that if the domicile of a woman who is married at the time the Act comes into force falls to be determined in relation to any date in the future, the new rule contained in the Bill will be applied in considering her history and circumstances without reference to any concept of dependency of domicile.  Put in another way, her domicile will be determined as if there never had been a domicile of dependency.</P>
    <P>Section 4 is necessary because the present rule in relation to the domicile of minor children of a married couple is that the child takes the domicile of its father. The section provides new rules for the situation where the spouses are living apart.  If the child has its home with its mother and has no home with its father, the child will take the domicile of its mother.  If the child ceases to have its home with its mother, it will continue to have her domicile unless and until it has a home with its father.  If the mother is dead, the domicile of the child will be the domicile she had at the time of her death if at that time the child had that domicile by reason of having or having had its home with its mother as I have just mentioned and if it has not since had a home with its father.</P>
    <P>Where the spouses are living together, the child will continue to have the domicile of its father.  Since normally both spouses who are living together will have the same domicile, this is not of great practical significance.  Ideally, we would no doubt like to have a new rule that wholly abandoned the existing one but there are practical difficulties.  It would be difficult to devise a rule which could operate satisfactorily in all the different circumstances that could be envisaged.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="3256" /> Circumstances could arise in which there would be no logical way of deciding whether the child should have the domicile of one parent rather than the other and the result would be that the child would have to be assigned the domicile of one parent on an arbitrary basis or else assigned a domicile separate from either of its parents on whom it is dependent and that would be undesirable.  None of these solutions is wholly satisfactory and the Bill, therefore, proceeds on the basis of preserving the <i>status quo</i> in this very limited area, unless and until some better solution suggests itself.</P>
    <P>Section 5 deals with the recognition of foreign divorces.  In the main, the section is consequential on the change made in section 1.  I would like to explain why it is necessary in this Bill to deal with foreign divorces.</P>
    <P>Briefly, the reason is this.  At present domicile is a central factor in the law relating to recognition of foreign divorces. The present law, as interpreted by the courts, is that a divorce obtained in a foreign country will be recognised if both spouses were domiciled in that country at the date of institution of the foreign proceedings.  The existing rule does not, and has had no occasion to, take account of the possibility that husband and wife would have different domiciles.  Because, under existing law, a married woman has the same domicile as her husband, the rule means that a divorce is recognised in Irish law if it was granted in the country where the husband was domiciled at the date of the institution of the proceedings. That, at all events, is the effect of the rule as commonly stated, but it is right to mention that in the course of a judgment given by him in the Supreme Court, Mr. Justice Walsh remarked that it is possible &ldquo;that some day (the rule) may be challenged on constitutional grounds in a case in which the wife had never physically left her domicile or origin while her deserting husband may have established a domicile in another jurisdiction&rdquo;.  However, at present and pending any such challenge the law has operated on the basis that the spouses have a common domicile in all <Col N="3257" /> circumstances, and clearly the Bill must proceed on that basis.</P>
    <P>In the absence of specific legislative provision setting out new rules for recognition of foreign divorces, there would be no way, short of expensive and perhaps long drawn out litigation, of establishing how an existing rule linked to the concept of a single domicile for the two parties would be applied or adapted in circumstances where husband and wife had separate domiciles, as they may have once the legislation is in force.  On one view, a foreign divorce would be recognised here only where both spouses were domiciled in the foreign country.  On another view, a lacuna would be left in the law because the present rule, being based on the concept of a common domicile for both parties, could not be regarded as having any application to a situation where that was no longer the case.  It is to deal with that problem that the provision in subsection (1) of section 5 is proposed.  Subsection (1) provides that in future a divorce will be recognised if it was granted in the country where either spouse was domiciled.  By virtue of subsection (7) the relevant date will be that of the institution of the divorce proceedings.</P>
    <P>I would like to stress that, once the domicile of dependency of married women is abolished, some change either increasing or decreasing the grounds of recognition is inevitable in the rules of recognition of foreign divorces.  It is simply not possible to preserve the <i>status quo.</i></P>
    <P>At first glance it might appear that subsection (1) will greatly increase the incidence of recognition of foreign divorces. Inevitably there will be some increase, but the increase, I would suggest, will not in fact be great.  First, domicile is not something that is casually changed.  A person does not become domiciled in another country merely by moving there for a short period.  To acquire a new domicile, he or she will need, on or after going to the other country, to have the intention to make that country his or her permanent home in the sense of intending to reside there for the <Col N="3258" /> indefinite future.  A court here would have to be satisfied to that effect if the issue arose.</P>
    <P>Divorces which are obtained on the strength merely of a brief period of residence in another country are not recognised under existing Irish law and will not be recognised under the Bill when enacted.  The strength of domicile as a connecting factor means, in practical terms, that a person hitherto domiciled here must virtually have severed his or her connection with this country before a divorce will be recognised here, and where that happens it seems right that the divorce validly obtained under the laws of the foreign country should be recognised here.</P>
    <P>Subsection (4) of section 5 states what may already be part of our existing law. There is a question whether the existing rule that a divorce is recognised here if it is granted in the country of domicile of the spouses is complemented by a further rule.  This is a rule laid down in 1906 in the English case of <i>Armitage v. A.G.</i> to the effect that a divorce will also be recognised if, while not granted in the country of the common domicile, it would be recognised by the law of that country.  The <i>rationale</i> of the rule is that if a change in the status of the spouses has been accepted in the country where they are domiciled it should be accepted in all other countries.  The reason why a doubt may exist as to whether this rule is part of our law is simply because the specific point has never come before our courts for decision.  Subsection (4) applies such a rule only to cases where neither spouse is domiciled in the State.  The practical effect of this will be small.</P>
    <P>Subsection (3) of section 5 is a special provision relating to neighbouring jurisdictions and takes account of a particular feature of British law.  The jurisdictions mentioned in that subsection are different &ldquo;countries&rdquo; for the purpose of private international law, but under British law a divorce obtained in any of them is automatically recognised in all the other jurisdictions mentioned.  It seems right to provide, as subsection (3) does, that such a divorce will also be recognised here so <Col N="3259" /> long as one of the spouses is domiciled in any one of these jurisdictions.  If, for example, the spouses were domiciled in, say, England, and a divorce were obtained in Scotland, that divorce is of course recognised automatically in England and it would be artificial to refuse recognition here.  A secondary but valid reason for recognising it here is that, as between Scotland and England, for example, it would be artificial to require our courts to decide whether the spouses were domiciled in the one rather than the other.</P>
    <P>At this point I want to apologise for a slip in paragraph 13 of the explanatory memorandum.  In the third last line &ldquo;that subsection&rdquo; should read &ldquo;subsection (3)&rdquo;, the subsection listing the British territories.</P>
    <P>There are a number of states which comprise within them different territories with different systems of law in relation to divorce and where the territories do not automatically recognise each other's divorces.  In relation to such countries which in matters of divorce have different systems applying in the different units, each such unit will be treated as a separate country as a result of subsection (2). This reflects the ordinary rule of private international law which treats a territorial unit with its own system of law as a separate country.  As a result of subsection (2) the different states of the USA will each be regarded as a separate country.  A divorce obtained in one state of the United States will be recognised under subsection (1) if one of the spouses was domiciled in that state and it will be recognised under subsection (4) if, while not granted in that state, the divorce would be recognised in the state or states in which the spouses were domiciled. Divorces granted in one of the United States are not automatically recognised throughout the other states.</P>
    <P>Canada and Australia are composite states which have the same law in relation to divorce applying throughout all the constituent territorial units.  Because of that, the different territorial units will not be treated as separate countries under <Col N="3260" /> subsection (2).  Accordingly, a divorce obtained in any part of Canada or Australia by a spouse domiciled in any other part will be recognised.</P>
    <P>I should mention two other provisions of section 5.  Subsection (5) provides that the new rules for recognition will apply to divorces granted after the commencement of the Act.  It would be clearly undesirable to make the new rules retrospective because the result would be to change a person's matrimonial status retrospectively.  Subsection (6) is a saving for the power of the Irish courts to refuse on grounds unrelated to domicile to recognise a foreign divorce.  For example, the court may refuse recognition if a spouse is divorced without having been given notice of the proceedings.</P>
    <P>In regard to the matters covered by the Bill, Deputies will be aware that the Law Reform Commission have published two relevant reports.  In their report on Domicile and Habitual Residence as Connecting Factors in the conflict of Laws they recommended that habitual residence should replace domicile as a general connecting factor.  In their report on Recognition of Foreign Divorces and Legal Separations they proposed wide-ranging changes in the rules relating to recognition of foreign divorces based mainly on the concept of habitual residence as a connecting factor.</P>
    <P>As I have mentioned already, the basic purpose of the present Bill is to get rid of the discriminatory rule under which a married woman is deemed to have the same domicile as her husband.  As I have explained also, the Bill deals with the rules of recognition of foreign divorces only because some change in those rules is inevitable once the domicile of dependency is abolished.  In fact the changes made in this area are in the main minimum changes needed to enable that desirable change in the law of domicile to be effected.</P>
    <P>The former Minister for Justice, Deputy Noonan, has already explained to the House on another occasion that, in the Government's view, the time is not ripe for any wide-ranging review of the rules of recognition of foreign divorces.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="3261" /> The question to what extent we should recognise foreign divorces is one which has an obvious link with internal policy in regard to divorce.  The whole policy of the law in this matter is at present undergoing debate and we cannot say what the outcome of that debate will be, if only because a change is possible only if the people so decide.  In that context it seems to the Government inappropriate to embark on changes in the rules of recognition beyond those changes that it is necessary to make in order to achieve the main purpose of this Bill.  Any decision to change from domicile to habitual residence as the test for recognition of foreign divorces would mean that our rules of recognition would have to be recast to take account of habitual residence, and since that concept is different in very important respects from domicile, we would have to embark on a complete rethinking of our attitude to recognition. As I have indicated the Government do not consider that the present time is opportune for such an exercise.</P>
    <P>I would, therefore, emphasise very strongly that the proposals in the Bill do not mean that the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission have either been forgotten or been rejected.  Because of the other circumstances I have mentioned, the Government regard them as matters that should be left aside for the moment.  The matters covered in their reports will be taken up later.</P>
    <P>I commend this Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">

      <P>The Domicile Bill is coming before the House today because the Government have been put under pressure for reform in this area by the Fianna Fáil Party.  Fianna Fáil, fully aware of the blatant discrimination which exists against women in the present law, published a Bill on 3 December last which proposed to abolish the concept of &ldquo;domicile&rdquo; and replace it with &ldquo;habitual residence&rdquo; thereby giving a woman an independent status.  This Bill was very well received and was widely appreciated particularly by groups who promote the right of women to full independence, and equality of treatment under the law.  The <Col N="3262" /> Government responded immediately, adopted the basic concepts in the Fianna Fáil Bill, and published them one week later on 10 December, in their own Domicile and Recognition of Foreign Divorces Bill.  Although the Government's proposals are less comprehensive than the Bill which we earlier introduced, nevertheless we welcome this important step which will give a woman a legal domicile independent of her husband.</P>
      <P>I would like to take the opportunity to thank our Fianna Fáil Women's Consultative Committee, who highlighted the urgent need for this legislation, and our voluntary legal back-up advisory team for their assistance in putting our original proposals before the House.  Deputy Mary O'Rourke was very active in this area.</P>
      <P>We brought forward a Bill which was very comprehensive.  We followed, in so far as we could, the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission having debated and discussed them and put forward a comprehensive Bill.  As the Minister said, the former Minister, Deputy Noonan, has explained to the House that the time is not right for any wide ranging review of the rules on recognition of foreign divorces.  The Government took a short cut and did not undertake this wide ranging review which, all would agree, is necessary and desirable at this time.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Domicile&rdquo; is an artificial legal concept, but it is of considerable importance in a number of areas of law.  It constitutes a &ldquo;connecting factor&rdquo; or link between a person and a legal system that will apply to him or her in a specific context.  It determines the &ldquo;personal law&rdquo; of the individual and determines which legal system is to be applied in his or her case as regards: (1) validity of marriage; (2) matrimonial causes (including jurisdiction in and recognition of foreign divorces, legal separations, nullity decrees); (3) legitimacy, legitimation and adoption; (4) succession to moveable property; (5) taxation, and (6) all questions concerning the personal status of the individual.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are several types of domicile: first, there is the domicile of origin. <Col N="3263" /> Every person acquires at birth a domicile of origin.  If a person is legitimate, he or she acquires the domicile of the father and otherwise that of the mother; second, there is domicile of choice.  Every male and unmarried female of full age is free to acquire a new domicile of choice in substitution for their existing domicile; third, there is domicile of dependency. This form of domicile arises in a number of ways, the best known of which is the dependent domicile of the wife.  This means that when a woman marries, she automatically loses her existing domicile and acquires a domicile of dependency which is that of her husband.  Even if both domiciles are the same, and her domicile is therefore not changed by her marriage, she is henceforth treated as having a domicile by dependency on her husband rather than by reason of the basis that is origin or choice &mdash; on which she previously had it.</P>
    <P>A domicile of dependency also exists in the cases of unmarried minors.  An unmarried minor cannot alter his or her domicile of origin of his or her own volition. However, if the parent from whom the minor acquired the domicile of origin changes his or her domicile then the minor's domicile also changes accordingly.  Mentally disordered persons also have domiciles of dependency, and are incapable of changing their domicile of their own volition.</P>
    <P>In basic terms, the domicile of a person is the country where that person intends to reside permanently and takes up residence. It is a highly artificial concept as it is determined exclusively by reference to the intentions of the person regardless of how unrealistic those intentions might be.  The factual aspects of the person's life are merely taken into account in order to establish the person's intentions.  Thus, family history, where he or she resides, career or business activities, social interests and history are not treated as significant in themselves, but are merely regarded as an indication of intentions.</P>
    <P>The present law has been criticised on many grounds.  It is because of its artificial <Col N="3264" /> nature that domicile often involves expensive and protracted litigation.  It is also a complicated concept not readily understood by the public.</P>
    <P>The dependent domicile of the married woman was once described by an English judge as &ldquo;the last barbarous relic of a wife's servitude&rdquo;.  Apart from the blatant denial of equality involved, the present situation can result in serious practical problems for married women.  For example, a foreign divorce is recognised here only if it was obtained in the country of domicile of the husband.  This means that if an Irish husband deserts his wife, goes to live in England where he can readily obtain a divorce, establishes an English domicile and then divorces his wife, that divorce will be recognised here whether or not the wife was even consulted.  Such a wife would lose her right to maintenance and succession.  If, however, that husband retained his Irish domicile and obtained a divorce in England based on his residence there, then the divorce would not be recognised here even if the wife had consented.  In this latter case, the wife, under Irish law, would continue to retain the domicile of the husband, even if she never saw him again, and she would be regarded as incapable of acquiring a domicile of her own choice.</P>
    <P>It should also be noted that, as a consequence of this basic discrimination, the domicile of the children of a married couple is always that of the father.  This is the case where a wife and child are deserted by the husband before the child is even born.  It remains the case even though a wife and children might never have visited, let alone resided in, the country of domicile of the husband.</P>
    <P>Other aspects of the present law are also undesirable.  For example, there is no logical basis for the rule that the domicile of origin is revived upon losing domicile of choice without acquiring another one.  A person who had abandoned his or her domicile of choice without acquiring another domicile of choice might well intend never to return to the country of the domicile of origin and yet that domicile would revive in such circumstances.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="3265" /> Finally, most western countries have abandoned domicile as a connecting factor and this is reflected in various international conventions.  This was the approach adopted in the Fianna Fáil Bill published earlier this year entitled Conflict of Laws Reform Bill, 1985.</P>
    <P>On 17 September 1981, the Law Reform Commission produced a working paper entitled, &ldquo;Domicile and Habitual Residence as Connecting Factors in the Conflict of Laws&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In that paper, the commission produced a detailed examination of the basis for selecting the appropriate legal system to apply to any case where more than one such system could be applicable.  The commission suggested that &ldquo;domicile&rdquo; be replaced in Irish law by &ldquo;habitual residence&rdquo;. Having invited submissions from interested parties, the commission repeated this view in its final report on the subject which was transmitted to the Government on 14 December 1983.</P>
    <P>In selecting &ldquo;habitual residence&rdquo; as the test to replace &ldquo;domicile&rdquo;, the commission had considered, but decided against using &ldquo;nationality&rdquo; as the new test.  In doing so, we feel that the commission was correct.  It is true that a person's nationality is usually easy to establish, but there are several arguments against nationality as the appropriate test.  Specifically, a person will always have a real connection with the place where he or she intends to indefinitely reside or habitually reside.  A person might not have any real connection with the country of his nationality.  Furthermore, a person can only have one domicile or, by definition, habitually reside in only one country, but could have dual nationality.</P>
    <P>In addition, the concept of nationality does not take account of federal structures and would not be sufficiently particular to deal with the cases of nationals of political entities comprising several states with different legal systems, the United States of America being an obvious example.  We also feel that the commission was correct in its decision to select &ldquo;habitual residence&rdquo; as the appropriate test.  It is the concept adopted by <Col N="3266" /> most international conventions.  It is worth nothing that &ldquo;habitual residence&rdquo; has already been adopted as a connecting factor in Irish legislation, in a limited way, in Part VIII of the Succession Act, 1965.</P>
    <P>The main difference between the approach adopted in the Fianna Fáil Bill and that now proposed by the Minister is that the Minister has opted for rather limited reforms or, in effect, tinkering with an inherently flawed system.  The Minister opted for this approach on two grounds &mdash; first, the former Minister&mdash; the Minister of State expanded on this&mdash; said that the adopting of the concept of habitual residence could have some taxation implications.  Second, he claimed that, in the light of possible new constitutional arrangements governing our internal law on divorce, it is, in effect, premature to opt now for the comprehensive reform envisaged in the Fianna Fáil proposals.  That approach was repeated again tonight by the Minister of State who said that the former Minister for Justice, Deputy Michael Noonan, had already explained to the House on the occasion when our Bill was dealt with in Private Members' time that in the Government's view the time was not ripe for any wide-ranging review of the rules of recognition of foreign divorces.  She added:</P>
    <P>The question is what extent we should recognise foreign divorces is one which has an obvious link with internal policy in regard to divorce. The whole policy of the law in this matter is at present undergoing debate and we cannot say what the outcome of that debate will be, if only because a change is possible only if the people so decide.</P>
    <P>That is to suggest that the whole matter will be seriously tied up in the discussions the Taoiseach is about to have with the Churches in relation to a referendum on the question of divorce here.  We contend that this matter could be dealt with independently and any rearranging necessary could be carried out by adopting the concept of habitual residence and making <Col N="3267" /> the arrangements suggested by the Law Reform Commission.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Minister's first objection it is clear that whether he changes to &ldquo;habitual residence&rdquo; or &ldquo;independent domicile&rdquo;, there will be consequential taxation effects.  For example, under the current law if an American girl marries an Irishman and resides in Ireland she acquires his domicile.  Consequently, all her income and gains abroad are due to be taxed in Ireland.  By giving her an independent domicile she acquires the independent status in taxation terms of <i>feme sole</i> and will be taxed in Ireland. only on remittances received in Ireland. This may be quite advantageous from her point of view because, instead of being taxed in Ireland on her total income from abroad, she would be taxed here only on those remittances that are sent home to Ireland.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister would appreciate the full tax implications of either of these proposals and would be in a position to make recommendations about the proper treatment of these matters.  Could it have been that the Minister produced a rushed Bill in the hope of distracting the attention of the public from Fianna Fáil's initiative in this important area of law affecting the status of women?  I speak here about the previous Minister having brought forward this Bill.</P>
    <P>There are other indications that this Bill was rushed.  The provision in section 4(1)(a) which purports to define the domicile of a minor by reference to his home renders very difficult the ascertainment of a minor's domicile where that minor lives part time with the father and part time with the mother.</P>
    <P>The inclusion of the words, &ldquo;and has no home with his father&rdquo; exacerbates the difficulty in ascertaining the domicile of a minor in these circumstances.  The most extraordinary feature of section 4 is that it would appear to make no provision for the situation where a minor lives with his father rather than with his mother and where the two are living apart.  The Minister said tonight that the child would continue to derive domicile from the <Col N="3268" /> father in such circumstances.  One would have thought that this would be an essential provision in a Bill which purports to give the mother an independent domicile.</P>
    <P>There are other provisions in the Bill about which questions will have to be raised.  Suffice it to say that the Bill was assembled hastily by the Minister's predecessor to meet his political need to save face in the light of Fianna Fáil's initiative. However, these defects in the Bill can be dealt with more effectively on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the other main implication of the reform proposed in this Bill. The most significant implication is that his reform will necessitate changes with regard to the basis on which foreign divorces are recognised under Irish law. As of now, the domicile of dependency of a married woman, a concept which this Bill seeks to abolish, ensures that both spouses are always domiciled in the same country and, as that dual domicile is the only basis on which foreign divorces have been recognised up to now, the fact that a wife is now to be capable of having a domicile independent from the domicile of her husband means that new criteria for the recognition under Irish law of foreign divorces are required.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State agreed with this point.  The Minister has set out new criteria governing the recognition of foreign divorces.  He opted for a system in which a divorce will be recognised if granted in a country where either spouse is domiciled. I wonder whether he has considered all the implications of such a course.  Is it not the case that a married woman living in Ireland who has has been deserted by her husband who then acquires a domicile of choice in England and who can obtain a divorce there which will be recognised here under the new rule will be left in the same situation as she would be in under the current legal rules?  Again, we will pursue this matter further on Committee Stage.  The Minister of State has indicated that this will be the case.</P>
    <P>The Minister was very sensitive about this area.  In section 5 we find that in relation to the recognition of foreign <Col N="3269" /> divorces he sets out these new rules.  Subsection (1) of that section reads:</P>
    <P>For the rule of law that a divorce is recognised if granted in a country where both spouses are domiciled. there is hereby substituted a rule that a divorce shall be recognised if granted in the country where either spouse is domiciled.</P>
    <P>The Bill spells out clearly that divorce shall be recognised if granted in the country in which either spouse is domiciled. The provision in our Bill, that is, the Conflict of Laws Reform Bill, 1985, is set out at subsection (1) of section 11 which reads:</P>
    <P>The validity of a foreign decree where one or both of the spouses was at the material time an Irish citizen and the spouses last habitually resided together in the State will only be recognised after the commencement of this Act if:&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) both spouses were at the material time habitually resident in the State in which the decree was granted or...</P>
    <P>That is a very clear protection and safeguard particularly for the wife in these circumstances.  The provision continues:</P>
    <P>(b)  one of the spouses was at the material time habitually resident in the country in which the decree was granted and:</P>
    <P>(i) the other spouse submitted to jurisdiction of the court or tribunal which granted the decree and:</P>
    <P>(ii) the decree was not obtained for the purpose of evading the laws in force at the material time in the state of the habitual residence of the spouse referred to in subparagraph (i) of this paragraph.</P>
    <P>There is a very distinct change between the two.  While the Government have run away from the concept of habitual <Col N="3270" /> residence they have left a very open situation in section 5 of this Bill.  That is the one the Minister of State was sensitive about when speaking here.  She said that at first glance it might appear that subsection (1) will greatly increase the incidence of recognition of foreign divorces, that inevitably there will be some increase but that that increase will not be great.  That is a matter of conjecture, but it indicates an area in which the Government are concerned about their own Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister was then at pains to suggest that domicile is something that is not casually changed, that a person does not become domiciled in another country merely by reason of moving there for a short time.</P>
    <P>The Minister went on to talk about the intentions involved.  We know that it will not be difficult for someone to go across the water and have a divorce recognised there.  In our Bill we are providing certain protections particularly in such situations as the desertion of wives with husbands going to Britain or elsewhere and obtaining divorces.  The protections included in our Bill were for very good reasons.  They would provide the requirement that in such cases the other spouse had to submit to the jurisdiction of the court.  In other words, the other spouse would have to agree to the divorce.</P>
    <P>This is a very important difference between these two Bills.  We will want to take this matter up at greater length on Committee Stage but we will wait to see if the Minister puts down any amendments to try to overcome the weakness in this Bill.  If not, we will put down amendments to tighten up the Bill.  While we proposed that there should be a change in the domicile, that domicile should be independent, and we support the Government in pursuing that line, we are concerned that there should be some safeguards in this area.  It seems that the Minister is concerned to some extent with the possible outcome in this area from this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister opted for the system in which a divorce would be recognised if granted in a country where either spouse is domiciled.  Has the Minister considered <Col N="3271" /> all the implications of such a course?  Is it not the case that a married woman living in Ireland who has been deserted by her husband and who then acquires a domicile of choice in England can obtain a divorce there which will be recognised here under the new rule thus leaving the deserted wife in the same situation as she would be in under current laws?  We will pursue that further on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Under Fianna Fáil's proposed legislation, in such cases where the wife will have her own habitual residence still in Ireland, she can if she wishes submit to the jurisdiction of the British court and accept the divorce, or she may refuse to accept it and will then continue to be treated as a married woman under Irish law.  We left the option with the woman or the spouse who remained here.  We would like to see more time given to this question and to hear the Minister's views on it.</P>
    <P>The Minister made much of the reasons for not adopting habitual residence as the criterion.  We do not agree with that.  What the Minister has had to say tonight, although it will be carefully considered, does not deflect us from our view that the concept of habitual residence is the preferable concept.  The Minister of State listed taxation and consequential changes as being the reasons for not adopting this concept.  We would not regard these as reasonable objections. If the Government were just trying to introduce a Bill soon after the Opposition had processed a Private Members Bill through the House, I can understand that the simplest thing is to select a specific feature for the Bill and leave out the features that are more complicated. But I do not understand the rationale behind the statement that taxation laws will be too complex and would act as a barrier to changing to the concept of habitual residence along the lines recommended by the Law Reform Commission, whom I must commend for their excellent work in this and in other areas.</P>
    <P>It is a pity that the Government are so slow in dealing with reports of the Law <Col N="3272" /> Reform Commission.  The Government could without much trouble bring a great number of Law Reform Commission reports before the House and produce reforming legislation based on those reports to give the impression that they are doing great work in law reform when a great deal of the homework has already been done by the Law Reform Commission even to the extent of preparing draft legislation to make it easy for the Government.</P>
    <P>I do not accept the taxation laws as an argument, nor do I accept the excuse that it is not an appropriate time to deal with this matter.  Any provisions that need to be made can be made and can be adapted if the situation changes.  It is strange that the Minister has avoided the extra work necessary to introduce the concept of habitual residence and include it in the legislation.</P>
    <P>I would urge the Minister to reconsider the wisdom of attempting to breathe new life into the moribund concept of domicile by pursuing these proposals.  Would it not be preferable if the Minister looked to the more widely accepted concept of habitual residence to find a solution to the problems we propose to tackle here tonight?  I have my doubts about the motive of the Government in introducing this legislation tonight when the Labour Party motion is before the House, especially when the Minister for Justice was dealing in the House with a Bill on Garda complaints procedure, a Bill which has not been into the House for nearly a month at this stage, although it is very important in relation to the Criminal Justice Act.</P>
    <P>Whatever the circumstances, we welcome this Bill.  We will consider Second Stage constructively and will put amendments on Committee Stage so that we will come out with the most appropriate Bill.  If it is desirable and possible to change the concept of habitual residence, we will explore that concept on Committee Stage along with other matters which I have raised which are more appropriate to a Committee Stage debate.  Other than the amendments <Col N="3273" /> which we will seek, we have pleasure in supporting the measure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the support of Deputy Woods for this Bill.  He made the point that we are not taking as wide-ranging a view as is possible.  What we are discussing is relevant to another interminable debate, namely, legislation on divorce.  We cannot deal with a matter such as habitual residence or the independence of domicile in other jurisdictions without accepting that it hinges on the kind of divorce legislation we may have here and the recognition we give to divorces obtained outside the country.  We must be realistic and honest about that.</P>
      <P>It goes without saying that I welcome the Bill.  It will have implications but this applies to every Bill.  It has seemed a remarkably long time before we got to the point of introducing legislation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>The point is that all sides of the House welcome this Bill and I hope they will ensure that it goes through. What really matters for women is that the legislation goes through and is implemented. I am very glad that the Opposition are active with regard to reform of the law.  I pointed out before, and I repeat it here, that legislative reform is not the monopoly of one party.  I encourage all parties to support not only this Bill but also other social measures, particularly the matter we are debating now and to which I have related this Bill.  I refer to the clearing up of many complications in our laws dealing with marriage and domicile and also our recognition of foreign divorces.  I urge all parties to reach a consensus and to put a positive referendum before the people to introduce our own divorce legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We seem to have been working on these matters for a long time.  Many women in various organisations have striven for a long time to have this barbaric relic of dependency removed from the Statute Book.  What we are doing here is a step forward.  The Minister has stated <Col N="3274" /> that it is unnecessary to labour the point that the rule is clearly discriminatory. The situation was downright crazy.  A man could leave the country and even though his wife remained here she would be deemed to have moved to that other country.  That has been a source of great danger to many women.  It was difficult logically even to begin to explain such an anomaly.  The Minister stated that it may have been appropriate in other times and in other social conditions but I reject it as having been appropriate at any time. It may have been traditional; that is part of the historic conditions under which women have laboured but it was never appropriate or acceptable.</P>
    <P>Section 4 deals with the domicile of minor children of a marriage.  At the moment a child takes the domicile of its father, the dependency of the child being emphasised here.  I welcome the fact that there will be new rules where spouses are living apart.  If a child has its home with the mother and not with the father, it is only right and proper that the child should take the domicile of the mother. Where spouses are living together and the child lives with both parents he or she will have the domicile of the father.  I take the point the Minister has made that in such a case the <i>status quo</i> is upheld. However, if we are working positively towards the recognition of the independence of the mother and with the responsibility she takes for her child as a minor &mdash; very often being more responsible and showing more care than the father &mdash; I wonder if perhaps we should uphold the <i>status quo?</i>  I suggest some affirmative action be used here, if the legal people could recognise such a structure. I suggest that where the spouses live together the child might take the domicile of the mother.</P>
    <P>The law is in need of change in respect of the dependency of mothers and children on fathers.  Much legal importance has attached to property and to the father being recognised as the keeper of that property, thus being invested with more power and authority.  Because of the importance played by a woman in the upbringing of her child, consideration <Col N="3275" /> might be given to not upholding the <i>status quo.</i></P>
    <P>The Minister has pointed out why this legislation took so long to be drafted, namely, that it gives rise to many complications. This developed also with regard to the acceptance and full implementation of the proposals of the Law Reform Commission.  The Minister quoted the point made by Deputy Noonan when he was Minister for Justice, namely, that the decision to change from domicile to habitual residence as the test for recognition of foreign divorces means that our rules of recognition would have to be recast to take account of habitual residence. She stated that since that concept is different in important respects from domicile we would have to embark on a complete rethinking of our attitude to recognition.  We are trying to cope with the recognition of foreign divorces in different jurisdictions and the legislation needed in order not to discriminate in any way against a spouse.</P>
    <P>We cannot give as full, as complete, as wide and as simple an acceptance to the whole area of habitual residence until we clear up the dreadful legislative minefield in our own country.  We do not have legislation which recognises Irish divorce, in its real sense.  We are, in effect, part of a contradiction in so far as constitutionally we say that we do not recognise the dissolubility of marriage, or divorce, yet on the other hand we have to endeavour to bring in legislation such as this which shows that in reality we have to recognise foreign divorces.  Until we have an opportunity to recognise our own divorce legislation many of the complications will remain, in spite of the greatest goodwill on everybody's part.  I would like to think that this debate would be considered in the context of the wider and deeper debate on the need for a referendum on divorce.  It would be my hope that all sides of the House would welcome a decision to hold a referendum in the same way as they welcome this Bill.</P>
    <P>Much of what I wanted to say is now redundant because at last we have got independent domicile for married <Col N="3276" /> women.  Those of us here tonight spoke at length on this topic previously and unlike some speakers we are too modest and too kind to repeat ourselves.  I would, however, mention certain areas which are related to the Bill before us and the area of protection and independence of married women.  This is tied in with certain legislation which is still being drafted.  The Minister rightly makes reference to the fact that this legislation will place us in a better position and enable us to ratify the UN Convention for the elimination of all discrimination against women.  All of us welcomed the signing of this Convention at the end of 1985 and we will continue to support the Minister on all the other legislation related to that. We will have no reservations placed on the total ratification of the Convention.</P>
    <P>There are some other matters which we hope to debate in this House as soon as possible.  There is the whole question of the status of children and illegitimacy, the rights of succession accorded to them and their mothers.  There is also the proposal to deal with the property of married people, property which is of immense importance to women.  A married woman often gives up her economic independence, to her great detriment if she finds herself contesting either the property in the home or the home itself.  The true position of the woman in the home will not be acknowledged until that proposal becomes law.  I know it is not necessary to make this point to the Minister, or to Deputy O'Rourke who played such a part in having these issues raised within her own party.</P>
    <P>Another outstanding matter is the bestowing of equality of citizenship.  An Irishman who marries a non-Irish citizen can bestow that entitlement on her.  However; an Irish woman who marries a non-Irish man cannot obtain citizenship for him.  This is one of the outdated and discriminatory practices derived from the view that within marriage a woman can not confer the same sense of importance, citizenship or legal rights upon her husband as he can confer on her.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that in the recent budget women were guaranteed equal <Col N="3277" /> treatment in terms of social security, beginning this year although it should have been implemented and acted upon months ago.  The least we can expect when discriminatory practices are abolished is that the reforms should be implemented as soon as possible.  We can never make up for the years passed.</P>

      <P>Of course the Leas-Cheann Comhairle is welcome to our debate.  It is a very fine reflection on the women of the House that we are here and though we are in small numbers we are very representative of women concerned about this issue.  I have never been in the House before when women comprised the membership on the benches and by their presence showed their real interest in the legislation before the House.  I wish there were people here to comment on it and note it.  Like Deputy Barnes and Dean Swift, I am modest in my proposals.  I spoke before Christmas when our own Bill, the Conflict of Laws Reform Bill, 1985, was introduced to the House by the Leader of my party.  I also decline to repeat myself at great length. During that debate the Minister who is here with us tonight and our spokesman on law reform and justice were both indisposed and could not speak.  The views they expressed tonight were fresh and innovative and precisely their own.  This brought a welcome freshness to the debate for those of us who had participated at an earlier date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I note that a tranquil tenor has crept into the debate since the men left the House.  I have to put on the record again that we introduced our Bill in December because we have a voluntary legal back-up group who are looking into the whole area of whatever legal discriminations exist against women.  We also have a very <Col N="3278" /> active women's consultative group whose role is to co-ordinate with the law reform group and liaise constantly with them and with the front bench of the parliamentary party.  So far this has been working very successfully.  We sorted ourselves out last June and identified the law of dependent domicile as archaic and barbaric in its connotation and wider implications of an attitude of servitude regarding married women.  Secondly, we felt that the exploration into it was done already by the Law Reform Commission who went into it at great depth and had produced proposals which they put forward as the basis for legislation.  We were very pleased to think that many of those proposals were ones which could be adopted, and easily adapted, if necessary, for implementation.</P>
    <P>That formed the basis of our proposals to our law reform group on the need for this legislation.  We did not see any need to highlight the necessity for it because that was so obvious.  When all our groups submitted the legislation to Deputy Haughey as Leader of our party he very readily agreed that it should take the form of legislation and be introduced in the House in Private Members' time.  I regret that that Bill was not accepted by the former Minister for Justice and the Government parties and was put to a vote and dismissed by the Government parties.  I was disappointed because many of the Government Deputies who spoke on that Bill in early December, in particular Deputy Barnes and Deputy David Molony, welcomed our initiative.</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods indicated tonight that he envisages that while we as a party find there are flaws in this Bill we will be putting forward amendments to it.  We hope that with good will some of our amendments, particularly those of great importance, will be accepted by the Government.  We hope a composite Bill will emerge with the best elements of our Bill and this Bill in it which will lead to a Bill of great benefit.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the element of dependency, which was so barbarous and archaic, is to be removed.  I believe all <Col N="3279" /> sides will agree with this.  It is quite amazing that a simple measure &mdash; though when we go into it, is not as simple as it appears, because it has complex ramifications for its implementation which could have been tackled by any Government to abolish the blatant and open discriminatory approach to married women &mdash; should have been left for so long on the shelves and should not have been tackled.  I take the point made by Deputy Barnes that perhaps an element of an affirmative type of action could be introduced into it.</P>
    <P>When the Oireachtas all-party women's committee was first set up I remember that Senator Michael Higgins said that all legislative action either under scrutiny at the moment or for future approach should be studied to see if it could be tackled in an affirmative way with regard to women and that it should be approached in that fashion.  That is perhaps something we could return to again.</P>
    <P>I have one gripe in regard to our Bill and the Bill we are now discussing.  I do not say it in any way of confrontation because I do not consider it is a Bill which should be approached in that fashion.  I say quite genuinely that the Bill submitted by the Minister in one very clear respect will leave a married woman in a worse off position than if our Bill had been accepted.  Our Bill gave the protection of option to the woman.  A man or a woman could submit to the option of the foreign divorce or they could not.  The Minister's Bill does not allow for that option.  That is discriminatory in that it limits the choices and options available to a spouse.  It will mostly be women who will be affected.  I believe that will have far reaching implications for succession and property rights for a woman.  If she chose not to submit to the foreign divorce her succession and property rights were assured under Irish law.  That is a very important fact and will have to be taken on board by the Minister.</P>
    <P>That is the major flow I find in the Bill but it is a very serious and dangerous one. I am afraid that by everybody sharing a common interest in removing what is an <Col N="3280" /> archaic terminology, that of dependent domicile, by this Bill we are putting an additional yoke on a woman from which she cannot escape because she will not have any choice, whether she wishes to or not.  Perhaps we will draft an amendment which can be looked at.  This Bill is not as simple &mdash; the Minister referred to it&mdash; as it appears to be when one goes into it. As Deputy Barnes said, it opens up to all of us a much wider contemplation and reflection of the whole issue of divorce and how it affects women.</P>
    <P>The Minister said she is content, for the moment at least, to leave that issue because the State is not ready to deal with it.  Would it not have been better to have gone into the implications of what she is now proposing as set out in her speech?  Is it not a recognition of the implication of a much easier obtainable type of foreign divorce than heretofore, even though she said that she does not think the likelihood of this will be great, numerically speaking?  I believe that once it becomes apparent what could be achieved through this legislation, and as more and more legal people, and consequently, their clients, tumble to it, that numerically the number of people who wish to avail of it will increase dramatically.  That is something we should watch out for.</P>
    <P>The main issue of contention between our Bill and the Minister's Bill is that the latter may seem to provide &ldquo;liberalisation&rdquo; for women's cause when really it will be prohibitive of their legal, community, property and succession rights because whether they like it or not they will be forced to submit to the divorce obtained in another land.  They have not got the right of choice.  It is a serious implication and I ask the Minister to look at it carefully.  If that were to be amended then not much would be at issue here.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barnes referred to other Bills which need to be considered and addressed very seriously.  One concerns community property.  We have looked at this peripherally and we intend to go into it more deeply.  The Minister knows that it has huge implications and will have to be teased out at great length.  The French <Col N="3281" /> model and the way the French have handled it appear to be very civilised.  I do not know if we can copy them or how we will deal with it, but we need to get into that issue straight away.</P>
    <P>It is necessary to update the Rape Act of 1981 and maternity legislation needs amendment.  I have identified the need for amendment in employment and maternity legislation.  Deputy Barnes and I are members of an all-party Oireachtas committee on women's rights and we met for two hours this afternoon and uncovered massive areas of discrimination against women which I am sure will be the subject of much discussion and debate in the weeks ahead.</P>

      <P>The Oireachtas.  That area will be the subject of legislation which we can recommend to the Minister from our all-party committee.  I welcome in both Bills the removal of the element of dependency which was old fashioned, strident and terribly hostile to women.  I wish that the concept of habitual residence had been adopted in the Minister's Bill.  I emphasise to her and, through her to her Government, that the main issue, the one I have highlighted, the removal of choice for a woman, cannot be seen as feminism at its best.  I submit that that must be reviewed in the light of the very dangerous implications which it would have for the property and succession rights of women.</P>

      <P>Like other speakers I welcome this Bill, but I pose the question, is it any wonder that a number of these issues are referred to and pigeon-holed as women's issues?  This is not a women's issue any more than are many other issues that are debated in this House, and that is why we have to be slightly facetious in <Col N="3282" /> welcoming you, Sir, into the Chair as a male&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and Deputy Hyland who has very kindly joined us and the two male members of the press up there. It is interesting to note that most members of the press here are male.  This is not a women's issue.  It is an issue of discrimination against a section of our population who happen to be women.  It is an issue that concerns you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, Deputy Hyland, all the people who fill the benches here, all the trendy people who fill the PDP benches who came in here last night and lectured us about not having the courage to deal with issues of social conscience matters.  Where are they tonight?  Out getting new members perhaps to win support for their non-policy party.  Where are the trendy members of the left from the Labour Party and where are the male members of my party who are to come in to speak on this Bill and to support a measure that is long overdue in this House?</P>
      <P>I am trying to show why women have been more angered as the years have gone by at having issues that deal with them pigeon-holed into a certain area.  I welcome the arrival of Deputy Durkan. I think he was supposed to speak ahead of me but obviously he got tied up.  He is very welcome indeed and I continue to welcome other male and female Members who come in here, and let us get away from counting heads.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I do not want to call for a quorum.  If they were interested they would be here.  For far too long we have seen women suffering the indignity of being treated no differently from a suitcase that goes with a man to his new domicile.  That is how we are being labelled. We have to take the domicile of a man because he goes to live in Timbuktu, Nevada or wherever.  He takes us along <Col N="3283" /> with him as if we were his suitcase because we are domiciled where he goes. Up to this we had no say in the matter. It did not matter whether we wanted to be domiciled, in Nevada, San Francisco, other exotic places, or Liverpool or wherever he decided to set up his domicile. We would be treated no differently from the suitcase he carried with him.  I welcome the Bill because no longer are women by their very sex being relegated to the same status as a suitcase the man brings with him when he is taking up his new domicile.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill also because it is a continuation of a long line of innovative and renovating measures this Government have introduced into this House. Not all of them are yet passed but I think most of them will be passed in the next year or two, certainly before we go out of this term of office and we will continue with the reforming programme when we are returned here in 1987.  Granted some of these things were done when Fianna Fáil were in power.  I will list some of them.  We had the removal of the concept of criminal conversation which was even more barbaric than the concept we are trying to remove in this legislation.  Only recently we managed to get rid of further discrimination in our social welfare code and Deputy Barnes and Deputy O'Rourke have referred to this.  As yet we have not seen that new legislation implemented because of union and strike threat problems.  We have seen the publishing of the citizenship Bill which in a strange way gets rid of discrimination that in ways would be considered antimale rather than pro-female, but it meant that the woman was not given the right to bestow her citizenship on her spouse, whereas the male could bestow with great largesse his citizenship on his foreign wife if she came to live here.  That Bill has been published and we hope to see it enacted soon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In October 1985 the Minister for Labour, Deputy Quinn, introduced new regulations dealing with the Garda and the prison service to get rid of some of the discrimination that existed there against <Col N="3284" /> female members entering those services. More recently and at long last we have seen the golfing unions getting rid of a clause that underlined the male dominance in the golf clubs and was blatantly discriminatory against women.  The clubs would take their money but would not allow them to participate in the running of the clubs because they were nice, little, feeble women who would not know about important things like that.  Through pressure and the right actions the Golfing Union of Ireland have seen the light of day and have removed that embargo. That is not finished yet because the clubs and their constitutions will have to allow full membership to women.  At least it is a recognition that we are unique in our own way.  We have been blessed with intelligence.  We can make mistakes as men can.  We can do marvellous things as men can.  The removal of a number of these concepts from our legislation will help to widen people's recognition that we are not so bad, we can be good, bad, brilliant and stupid.  That is why I welcome section 1 and the whole idea of recognising our uniqueness in the same way as men's uniqueness has been recognised down through the years on our Statute Book.</P>
    <P>As the Minister said, not many women will be affected.  This Bill will not revolutionise much or be talked about in the highways and byways.  It is the concept, the principle, that is incorrect, discriminatory, barbaric in all that it intends and means that has been wrong.  Whether it affects ten people, 100 or only one person this year, it is wrong and I welcome the fact that we are now getting rid of it.</P>
    <P>Following on the Law Reform Commission's Report, LRC 7 of 1983, the Fianna Fáil Party decided to follow the advice given in the report and go for the habitual residence.  I can understand why they did so.  The commission appears fairly divided, when one reads between the lines, as to the benefits of choosing habitual residence or domicile.  In their report, on page 7, they spell out the concept of habitual residence and some drawbacks as follows:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="3285" /> It may be difficult to determine where a person has his habitual residence if he is constantly on the move and has no real or continuing connection with any of the countries through which he passes.</P>
    <P>The report further says:</P>
    <P>The degree of importance that is to be given to intention as a factor in determining whether a person's residence is &ldquo;habitual&rdquo; may be a matter of debate and uncertainty in particular cases.  While the question of intention in the case of domicile may be give rise to difficulty, there is at least some reasonable degree of judicial consensus as to the strength of the intention that must be established: with habitual residence such consensus has yet to be attained.</P>
    <P>In page 13 of the report it is stated:</P>
    <P>The Commission has re-examined in detail the question whether it would be better to reform the law of domicile or replace it as a connecting factor by habitual residence.  <i>After much consideration, it has come to the view that on balance the better course is to replace domicile by habitual residence.</i></P>
    <P>On reading through that report, one gets a distinct impression that it took a great deal of consideration and that the balance was only barely tipped on the side of habitual residence.  I can see why. habitual residence is easy to claim; domicile is not.  The danger with habitual residence is that a man could set up an habitual residence in a country very quickly with far less intention of staying there.  He could be there purely and simply to get a divorce and move on perhaps to wherever his newly found partner might be, or whatever the case might be.  If we are using the concept of habitual residence and extending it to cover both spouses there is a danger in what we are doing here, that it would become too easy for people to get divorces which would be recognised in this country.  The idea of domicile is a strengthening point in the Bill.  Schools of thought are divided and you will meet <Col N="3286" /> a lawyer one day who will come down on the side of domicile and another lawyer the next day who will come down on the side of habitual residence.  On balance, however, the Minister has decided on the concept which I think will give more protection.</P>
    <P>I want to deal briefly with section 4 with regard to minors.  Is there some specific reason for the Bill not actually giving the age of the minor?  Are we talking about 16 years as recommended in the report, or 18 or 21 years?  I assume it would be either 16 or 18 years.  Is flexibility excluded from the Bill lest there might be a very mature 16 years old or a not so mature 17 or 18 year old?  I should like the Minister to deal with that aspect on Committee Stage.  It could be teased out a little more.  That section is a little nebulous.</P>
    <P>I have a few other questions in regard to the domicile of minors.  The Minister may have covered the point in her speech but I am not sure of the situation.  It says in the Bill that if the parents are separated the domicile will be the domicile of the mother.  What happens if custody has been granted to the father?  Are these the complications which the Minister mentions? Perhaps we could get a little more information on Committee Stage.  How will it be handled and will the courts have wide flexibility on this Bill to enable them to decide?  If the father has custody it would be nonsense to insist that the child should have the domicile of the mother.</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods and Deputy O'Rourke made great play &mdash; and rightly so &mdash; with the fact that this Bill seems to be weaker than theirs because of the fact that the spouse does not have to be told about the other partner taking divorce action. Deputy Woods referred to section 5 which says that with the independent domicile to be established, &ldquo;there is hereby substituted a rule that a divorce should be recognised if granted in the country where either spouse is domiciled.&rdquo; The explanatory memorandum states:</P>
    <P>Subsection (6) provides that the section shall not affect any ground on <Col N="3287" /> which the Irish courts may refuse to recognise a foreign divorce apart from the ground that the requirements as to the domicile of a party are not satisfied. In particular, the subsection will enable the courts to continue to withhold recognition if a spouse has not been given adequate notice of the divorce proceedings.</P>
    <P>I must say in criticism of the Bill that the explanatory memorandum is clearer than the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The spouse would have to go to court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>We need the explanatory language of the memorandum to be put into the Bill because subsection (6) only says:</P>
      <P>Nothing in this section shall affect a ground on which a court may refuse to recognise a divorce, other than such a ground related to the question whether a spouse is domiciled in a particular country, or whether the divorce is recognised in a country where a spouse is domiciled.</P>
      <P>I do not know why it has not continued on to say:</P>
      <P>... And will enable the courts to continue to withhold recognition...</P>
      <P>and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The spouse would have to go to court to prove it.  Heretofore she would not have to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy O'Rourke.  I would welcome some further strengthening of the Bill in this area. There is a danger that women will find themselves still at the receiving end of extreme problems if there is this total freedom of spouses to obtain a divorce without having to notify the relevant party in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Law Reform Commission's Report LRC 10, which is the report on recognition of foreign divorces and legal <Col N="3288" /> separation, is not strong enough.  The chapter, Proposals for Reform, says that the legislation should include a provision giving the court a broad discretion as to whether to accept as proof the findings and inferences, whether of law or fact, of the foreign court where the respondent has not appeared in foreign proceedings.</P>
    <P>We should look at that area a little further.  Perhaps I am not getting the point because I am not a lawyer or a parliamentary draftsman.  Perhaps the wording is as strong as it needs to be. Having started my speech by criticising the fact that we were being pigeonedholed by having only female contributors to this debate, I want to give an opportunity to Deputy Hyland and Deputy Durkan, if they have time before 10.30 p.m., to put a few words on the record on this issue which is a human rights issue, a matter of dignity for a section of our population.  This is not because they are women but because they have been discriminated against because they are women.</P>
    <P>This Bill is another link in an impressive list of legislation which this Government have either implemented or are about to implement.  In the spirit of this debate I welcome the fact that at long last there is undoubtedly, with the presence of people like Deputy O'Rourke and Deputy Hyland, a recognition on the other side of the House that these are issues that must be tackled and which cannot be pushed to one side on the basis that perhaps they are not favourable with the electorate.  These are issues of justice and right and I am very pleased that we are having this debate in the House in a spirit of unity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am proud to share the floor of the House in this very important debate with those eloquent ladies who, true to form, have spoken with their usual conviction, sincerity and concern. Deputy Owen is right when she says that domicile and the problem of domicile is one not only for women, that it is a problem with which all of us here should be seriously concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For that reason we welcome very much <Col N="3289" /> the publication of this Bill.  We were disappointed that the Government decided for obvious political reasons to oppose the Fianna Fáil Private Members' Bill. However, we are grateful that our pioneering efforts in this area have resulted in this Bill coming before the House and in a relatively short period of time from the publication of our Bill.</P>
    <P>Our efforts to bring about reform in this area must be recognised by all sides of the House.  One of the disappointing aspects of this administration has been their failure, after almost four years in office, to bring about much needed law reform.  I listened with attention to Deputy Bell who, like the other Deputies from the Government side, spoke with sincerity and conviction in relation to the Bill that was debated here earlier today. But Deputy Bell fell into the usual trap of trying to find a scapegoat and he found that scapegoat by referring to the failure of Fianna Fáil to legislate effectively in this social area.  I am not making a political point to the good ladies on the far side of the House.</P>

      <P>After almost four years in Government the time has long past when Members on the other side should have stopped blaming Fianna Fáil.  Perhaps Deputy Durkan, a man for whom I have a great deal of regard and who I expect will be the next speaker, will outline for us the areas of social reform for which this Government have been responsible since coming into office.  We have not yet seen much of the reform that was promised and which we were told was needed so urgently.  If it were not for the efforts of the women's committee within the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party and the concern they expressed, concern which was shared by the male members of our party, and if it had not been also for the initiative they took in this very important area which had been reflected for a long number of years, we <Col N="3290" /> would not be debating this very important piece of legislation at this time.</P>

      <P>I have no desire to enter into any kind of hassle with the ladies opposite.  All three of them have been very vocal in expressing their concern, both inside and outside the House, in relation to the need to bring about the kind of reform we are debating here this evening.  I am sure that they in turn would be generous enough to acknowledge that the women Deputies on this side of the House, led by Deputy O'Rourke, have also expressed and shared the same level of concern.  I am not being unfair when I state categorically that if it were not for the efforts and the initiative and the commitment of the Members on this side of the House this area of law reform would continue to be neglected.  The Government must be in their final year in office yet there was no indication that they intended taking any initiative in this area until after our Bill was published.  There would have been no opportunity for the three lady Deputies opposite, including the Minister of State, to debate that matter about which they have expressed such justifiable concern.  It is for that reason that I regret that a Government who came into office with such a flurry of promises and who built up such high expectations among our people have failed so miserably to bring in reform in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from the subject matter we are discussing now, there is a wide area which is in urgent need of examination and reform.  Generally law reform does not require any great capital input on the part of the Government.  It does not put any <Col N="3291" /> financial strain on Government resources, a factor that is put forward so often as the excuse for Government inaction in so many other areas.  On the other hand, Government action in this vital area, or inaction as is the case in this instance, is a cardinal symptom of their insensitivity to the changing social and economic scenes, especially in an area where there is discrimination and victimisation because of laws which have not been amended and updated to meet the changes in society.</P>
    <P>In the context particularly of our membership of the EC it is a reflection on the Government and on the House generally that we have not been able to keep our national law abreast of reforms in other countries.  There is no more obvious or urgent area than the area this Bill deals with.  This is an area that affects the very foundation of society, the family and the individual members as they suffer and are discriminated against because of the inadequacies of existing legislation.</P>

Shíl mise ag an am go mbeadh an t-airgead caite ar bhóithre ina raibh níos mós ná teach amháin suite.

      <P>Would Deputy McGinley listen, because it will be severe?  I want to raise the matter of these alarming details in company with my colleagues from Donegal County Council in relation to the selection of roads in the Donegal Gaeltacht in November 1985. At that time I was not aware that these roads lead to people's houses.  It is not necessary for me to indicate the type of roads they were.  On 17 December I questioned this in the Dáil.  When I had raised the matter earlier, dúirt tusa go raibh eargóint ag baint leis.  I asked if you felt or if the Minister felt that the roads were selected in a fair and impartial manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I contend they were not selected in a fair and impartial manner and that there <Col N="3293" /> are no precedents under any Government, whether Fianna Fáil or Coalition, back to 1977, for this type of selection.  I believe that Roinn na Gaeltachta funds were disbursed to the advantage of people who would not qualify for the ordinary traditional local improvement schemes.  The criteria is a road that must be of benefit to agricultural production, and benefit two or more parcels of land owned by or occupied by different persons who serve the public.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister what comparison there is between the criterion used to repair these roads and the traditional criterion for LIS roads.  It is generally known that the criterion used for Gaeltachta grants is that they should comply with LIS conditions, that the grants should be used to repair roads to two or more houses servicing two or more families, with an agricultural input.  More important, these grants were to help to repair roads which could not be repaired out of county council funds, non-county roads, amenity roads, roads to beaches, bog roads to turbary plots.  At the moment people in Donegal cannot get into their bogs, yet here we find money being provided to repair roads to individual houses.</P>
    <P>I do not entirely blame the Minister, though the buck must stop with him because it is his responsibility.  However, in fairness to him he was advised, and I believe heads should roll as far as officials and public representatives are concerned. I believe they deceived the Minister when they advised him to carry out repairs to these roads.</P>

      <P>We should look back on the history of these roads.  I want to point out the facts.  When Fianna Fáil were in office, roads were repaired which served 20 families who needed proper entry to their bogs.  There is such a road in Fanad serving two families; roads in Sruthán and Machaire Cloghar serving four families; there were roads in The Rosses, Gweedore, Cloughaneely, in <Col N="3294" /> Donegal Gaeltacht Láir, in Glencolmcille. All of these roads serve more than one family.</P>
      <P>In this instance the money was not spent equitably.  I hate to have to come to Dublin to point out that the money was spent within a five mile radius of Deputy McGinley's home.  Down through the years the money was spent in a much fairer and impartial manner. Was the Minister aware, when he accepted the selection of roads, that the system was being abused?  I believe he was not.  His officials should have visited these roads and considered the estimate made by Donegal County Council.  Such an estimate was not obtained.  Somebody in the Department or a public representative locally must have decided, because there was no communication with Donegal County Council&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Minister can defend them if there is any defence to be made.  I will withdraw any remark which would reflect on them.  In 1984 there was an allocation of £5,000 to Donegal County Council in respect of Arranmore Island when roads could not be repaired by the county council and £6,000 for Gaeltacht roads.  That money was carried over until the following year.  The normal practice is that the officials of Roinn na Gaeltachta examine the roads, look for estimates from Donegal County Council, come back to the Department and the Minister selects the roads concerned.  I accuse Roinn na Gaeltachta of not requesting an estimate from Donegal County Council and I accuse public representatives who went to the executive engineer's office in Dungloe, by-passing the county council offices in Lifford, obtained estimates, took them back to Dublin and selected them in Dublin, ignoring Donegal County Council.  I asked at the time how these roads were selected, by whom they were selected, <Col N="3295" /> whether estimates were obtained from the county council and whether officials viewed these roads and at any time obtained the necessary estimates.  The Minister must answer these questions if not tonight then at the first available opportunity.</P>
      <P>It is not necessary to state in this House the condition of the roads in general in County Donegal.  I believe we have the worst roads in Europe.  The roads in the Sahara are better than the county roads in Donegal.  It is extremely difficult to explain to the public in the Gaeltacht regions how a Government Department could provide funds for these roads when that money could have been spent maybe not on county roads but it could have been spent on Arranmore Island, on Tory Island where they provided money in the past.  It could have been spent to repair a bridge which was the subject of a TV news item some time ago, a bridge that collapsed, and the Minister told us at the time that he regretted he was unable to assist because it did not have a high enough priority.  The same goes for Arranmore Island, for the road to a pier at Kincasslagh.  On 11 February 1985 I asked the Minister by way of letter if he would make available funds to repair this road.  The Minister told me in February:</P>
      <P>Ní raibh airgead ar fáil ag mo Roinnse anuraidh chun freastal ar na bóithre agus is oth liom nach raibh tosaíocht sách ard ag na bóithre sin&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Bhí buntáiste mór ag baint leis an scéim seo.  Chuir sí bóithre maithe ar fáil do mhuintir na Gaeltachta, chuir sé bóithre portaigh ar fáil dóibh agus tugadh chuid maith airgid le saol muintir na Gaeltachta a fheabhsú agus le bóithre ceart a thabhairt dóibh le dul go dtí a gcuid tithe agus le freastal orthu ar gach bealach.</P>
      <P>De réir mar a thuigimse an scéim, is é an nós a bhí ann go n-ainmneofaí bóithre i nGaeltachtaí agus go ndéanfadh oifigeach de Roinn na Gaeltachta ar an chomhairle chontae meastachán a chur isteach ag an Roinn faoin chaiteachas ar na bóithre sin agus go ndéanfadh an Roinn ansin cinneadh ar cén chaoi a gcaithfí an t-airgead.  Má shíl an Roinn go raibh an caitheachas ro-ard i gcás bóithre ar bith, bhuel níor chaith siad an t-airgead ar na bóithre sin, ach, de ghnáth, is é an rud a bhí i gceist gur caitheadh an t-airgead i gcaoi go raibh freastal á dhéanamh ar mhuintir na Gaeltachta i gcoitinne.  De réir an eolais atá faighte agus ar tugadh cuid mhaith poiblíochta dó níor chaith Roinn na Gaeltachta leis an scéim sin mar a caitheadh leis san am atá thart.  Tá daoine a fuair bóithrín go dtí a gcuid tithe, daoine a raibh postanna maithe acu, daoine a raibh tithe breátha acu agus ní shílimse má tá an phoiblíocht a cuireadh ar fáil ceart ní shílim go dtiocfadh leis an Aire nó an Roinn a bheith sásta faoin gcaoi in ar caitheadh an t-airgead seo agus sílim go raibh sé de cheart ag an Teachta Gallagher teacht isteach anseo agus an rud seo a chur os comhair na Dála agus an mhí-shástacht atáorainne maidir leis an gcaoi in ar caitheadh an t-airgead seo a phlé anseo.</P>

Tá mise freagrach agus sin sin agus glacaim freagracht iomlán as.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tá cuid de na ráitis a cuireadh amach bréagach, mí-chruinn go deimhin agus bréagach in áiteanna agus dúirt an Teachta Paddy Gallagher gurb é an rud a chuir seisean ar bís ná gur caitheadh an t-airgead ar fad no an chuid is mó dhe i bhfoisceacht cúig mhíle de theach an Teachta McGinley.  Ní shin é an t-eolas atá agamsa agus luaigh sé go raibh bóithre ar oiléan agus nár caitheadh airgead orthu.  Caitheadh £5,000 ar bhóthar ar Arainn Mhór agus chaith an chomhairle chontae £5,000 ann chomh maith ag an am gcéanna agus is cosúil go raibh sé ag teastáil go géar.  Caitheadh thart ar £5,000 taobh amuigh de pharóiste Ghaoth Dobhair chomh maith ar bhóithre áise, ar thithe agus áiteanna eile. Táimid ag caint anseo ar iomlán de £16,000 go £18,000 chomh fada agus is eol dom, agus caitheadh a trian de sin i nGaoth Dóbhair.  Ceann de na deacrachtaí atá againn, tá mí-thuiscint anseo agus rinne an Teachta Paddy Gallagher tagairt dó, go ndúirt sé nár chomhlíonadh na <Col N="3300" /> rialacha.  An tuiscint a bhí aige siúd ar na rialacha ná go raibh na rialacha cosúil le rialacha LIS.  Seo é an mí-thuiscint, mar níl siad cosúil.  B'fheidir &mdash; agus tá mé sásta breathnú air seo &mdash; go mb'fhearr rialacha dochta, daingne a leagan síos cosúil le rialacha an LIS agus nach mbeadh aon mhí-thuiscint ann faoi seo as seo amach agus má cheapann na Teachtaí thall ansin agus Teachtaí an Tí seo go mba cheart é sin a dhéanamh ta mise sásta breathnú air sin.  Is é an mí-thuiscint atá ann nach bhfuil na rialacha a bhaineann leis an scéim seo atá againn cosúil leis an scéim sin.  Níl siad chomh docht, cuir i gcás, leis na rialacha a bhaineann le LIS, agus ba mhaith liom a rá chomh maith nach nglacaim leis go ndearna oifigigh na Roinne neamairt san obair a bhí idir lámha acu.</P>
    <P>Dúirt an Teachta Paddy Gallagher, gur cheap sé nach raibh meastacháin faite againn.  Dúirt sé ar láimh amháin nach raibh agus ar an láimh eile go bhfuaireamar meastacháin ach nach bhfuaireamar iad ar an mbealach ceart.  Ba mhaith liom mar Aire a chur in iúl dó go bhfuil mise sásta seasamh anseo agus a rá nach ligfinn pingin rua amháin amach as an Roinn gan meastachán a fháil, ar an gcéad dul síos, agus ansin scéal a fháil ar ais go raibh an obair críochnaithe de réir cibé rialacha atá leagtha síos ag na daoine a thug an meastachán isteach an chéad lá.  Anois tig leat a ghlacadh uaim go bhfuil ansin cóip agamsa de na meastacháin, de chuile phíosa oibre a bhí idir lámha, go bhfuil ansin chomh maith scéal ar ais go raibh an obair críochnaithe agus is ar an mbun sin a íocadh an t-airgead.</P>
    <P>Maidir le imní a bheith ar dhaoine a tarraingíodh isteach sa scéal seo go poiblí, daoine a ainmníodh, pictiúirí ar na páipéir, ní theastaíonn ó aon duine go dtarraingeofaí iad isteach i rudaí mar seo, gnáth-dhaoine, daoine próbháideacha. Ní ceart go ndéanfaí amhlaidh ach rinneadh é agus ní dóigh liom gur ceart dóibh aon náire nó imní a bheith orthu, mar ní orthu siúd atá an locht gur tarraingíodh isteach san rud seo iad.  Is é an rud atá á rá agam go bhfuil an scéim ann, go mb'fhéidir gur ceart é a leasú agus, mar <Col N="3301" /> adeirim, sa chás seo ní raibh rialacha an LIS i bhfeidhm.</P>
    <P>Déarfainnse, agus bhí mise im chomhairleoir contae chomh maith agus bhain mé úsáid as an scéim LIS le mo linn agus ó thaobh na polaitíochta de fiú amháin agus gan dul thar an leibhéal sin, ó thaobh na bpolaiteoirí féin de, iad go bhfuil airgead le caitheamh acu faoi, cuir i gcás, an LIS, tá sé i bhfad níos fearr agus i bhfad níos fiúntaí agus i bhfad níos ciallmhaire freastal ar leath-dhosaen teach ná freastal ar theach amháin má chuireann tú do shuimeanna le chéile.  Sin é an rud ciallmhar a dhéanamh.</P>
    <P>Ach tá obair déanta anseo mar atá a fhios ag Teachtaí.  Ní ligeann Airí airgead amach as a Roinn gan rudaí faoi leith a bheith comhlíonta.  Anois, ma chuirtear ceist ormsa an ndeachaigh mise síos agus go bhfaca mé céard a bhí ar siúl, ní dheachaigh agus ni dóigh liom go mbeadh aon duine ag súil go ndéanfainn sin agus ní bheadh gach aon duine ag súil go ndéanfadh aon duine eile é ach oiread ach comhlíonadh na rialacha maidir le meastacháin, maidir le scéala.  Tig leat m'fhocal a ghlacadh mar Aire nó gan é a ghlacadh.  Is féidir leis an Teachta bheith sásta go raibh meastacháin agam ón chomhairle chontae, ó innealtóir na comhairle chontae.  Tig leat glacadh uaim nach n-insím bréaga agus má tá ag cur i mo leith go bhfuil mé ag insint bréaga abair é.</P>

      <P>Any report of defects found in an aircraft is a matter for concern. Following recent examinations which revealed cracks in stringers and frames of some Boeing 747 aircraft, the US Federal Aviation Authority directed that inspections of all B747s with more than 10,000 flights be carried out to ensure that there were no cracks in these aircraft.  Aer Lingus, in compliance with the directive, have carried out inspections of their B747s and I am very glad to say that no cracks have been found.  Continuing examination of these aircraft is being undertaken by Aer Lingus.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin North-West)</i> asked the Minister for Communications his proposals for common rules for international transport in the EC and for measures ensuring the freedom of national carriers to offer their services in other member states.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Minister for Communications (Mr. J. Mitchell) Jim Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Communications (Mr. J. Mitchell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the question is intended to relate to the particular area of road freight transport.  I should explain that under Article 75 of the Treaty of Rome, it is the function of the EC Commission to make proposals in relation to the matters referred to in the question.  Adoption of such proposals, either as submitted or in amended form, is a matter for the Council, after completion of the necessary consultations with the Economic and Social Committee and the European Parliament.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Various common rules have already been adopted in the field of international road freight transport covering, <i>inter alia,</i> authorisations permitting road haulage <Col N="3131" /> between the various member states, weights and dimensions of certain categories of vehicles, drivers' hours and admission to the profession of road haulage operator.  Major progress was achieved during the Irish Presidency in 1984.</P>
    <P>The Council of Transport Ministers at its meeting on 14 November 1985 agreed on a policy approach aimed at creating a free market in transport without quantitative restrictions by 1992 at the latest; increases in the quotas of transport authorisations during the transitional period; and the elimination of distortion of competition.  Detailed proposals will need to be brought forward by the Commission with a view to achievement of these targets.  Ireland favours the removal of quantitative restrictions on international road haulage between member states, subject to qualitative controls.</P>
    <P>As regards the question of operations totally within a member state by nonresident carriers, article 75 of the Rome Treaty requires that conditions be laid down under which such operations may be carried out.  Proposals recently submitted by the Commission in this regard are being examined at working group level and it is as yet too early to say what the outcome of this examination may be.</P>

      <P>The pricing of sea and air travel between Ireland and Europe is primarily a matter for the commercial judgment of the shipping and airline companies, who must have regard not only to the consumer interest but also to the need to maintain service viability.  In the specific area of sea travel, I have no statutory function in regulating sea transport costs, although I maintain a non-statutory monitoring role in relation to B and I's fares and rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as air travel is concerned, the Deputy will be aware that since coming into office I have taken a though line on proposals for increases.  On a number of occasions, I have found it necessary to turn down applications for increases on <Col N="3135" /> the grounds that they were too high, often I might add in situations where the regulatory authority at the other end of the route gave its approval for the full increase.  I will continue to take a critical approach with a view to ensuring that the lowest possible air fares are available to the public, consistent with the need to maintain in the national interest an adequate network of viable year-round air services.  I would also mention that I recently gave approval in principle for the inauguration of a low priced air service between Luton and Dublin.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Communications the number of persons carried by DART during the past 12 months; the number required for the service, after interest charges, to break even; and if he will further comment on his plans for the development of the service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Communications (Mr. J. Mitchell)</NameTxt>
      <P>Córas Iompair Éireann have advised me that a total of 12.2 million passengers were carried on DART &mdash;the electrified rail line from Howth to Bray &mdash; in the year 1985 and that, on peak days, DART is now carrying about 50,000 passengers as compared with about 44,000 a year ago.  Córas Iompair Éireann have projected an operational break even position for DART in 1988 on the basis of carrying about 100,000 passengers per day &mdash; that is after taking depreciation into account but excluding the interest charges on the capital expenditure which the Exchequer is bearing.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, Córas Iompair Éireann began the first phase of the DART feeder bus services on 2 February 1986.  No doubt the board will be quickly developing these services and increasing train frequencies where possible so as to further increase the growing numbers of DART passengers.</P>
      <P>I have no plans for the extension of DART to other areas such as areas to the west of Dublin city.  Any proposals for such extension would have to be considered in the first instance by the Dublin Transport Authority, under the establishing legislation which now awaits Dáil Committee and remaining Stages.  Given the traditional low-density residential development which prevails in the Dublin area, and the enormous expenditure that would be involved in the development of rail-based options (some hundreds of millions of pounds), it is inevitable that all possible options &mdash; including bus-based options &mdash; must be considered by the Authority.</P>

      <P>In Tallaght the IDA have collaborated with a variety of locally organised representative groups to establish an enterprise centre in the former Telectron factory.  Half of this factory has been purchased by IDA and modified to provide 17 factory units, ranging in size from 500 square feet to 3,400 square feet, which are being promoted for suitable projects.  In Clondalkin four factory units, ranging in size from 3,500 square feet to 4,200 square feet, are available for suitable industrial projects.</P>

    <P>&nbsp;(i)  The amounts shown in column (4) relate to improvement works on county roads used mainly for agriculture works or forestry and which qualify for assistance under the EC Western Package.</P>
    <P>&nbsp;(ii)  The block grant supplements the provision made from local authorities' own resources for the improvement, maintenance and management of non-national main roads, for improvement works on county roads, and for the implementation of traffic management measures.  The manner in which the block grant is spent is largely a matter for the local authority.</P>
    <P>(iii)  A breakdown of grant payments is not available for the years prior to 1978.</P>
    <P>(iv)  In the period 1982 to 1984, there was a high level of investment in two major schemes on the N2, at Castleshane and Donaghmoyne.  The overall grant allocation for 1986 represents an increase of 10 per cent relative to payments in 1985.</P>

A breakdown of this figure on a county basis is not readily available and its compilation would not be practicable without seriously affecting the day-to-day work of the section.  Given that eligibility for grants and the approved costs of works have to be determined following inspections, it is not possible to give the projected cost of the applications received.  As the scheme has only been in operation for a relatively short period, neither is it possible to give an accurate assessment of the average length of time for the processing in full of applications.</P>
      <P>It is necessary for each applicant for a grant to furnish, in making his application, the tax numbers of the contractor who is to carry out the work and, on completion of the works, certain other particulars for the purposes of confirming the bona fide of the contractor with the Revenue Commissioners.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for <Col N="3143" /> the Environment if he is aware of the very serious difficulties facing road hauliers in the timber industry arising from the limitation of axle weight and if he will introduce new regulations with a view to increasing the pay load of timber hauliers who will not be able to continue in operation under present regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Boland) Minister for the Environment (Mr. Boland)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>No representations on this subject have been made to my Department by, or on behalf of, road hauliers in the timber industry.  I am, however, aware of the views of road hauliers generally on the question of increases in the weight limits.  In 1983, regulations were made providing for a very significant increase in the maximum permissible gross vehicle weight from 32 tons to 38 tonnes (37.4 tons) for a five or six axle articulated truck or road train, subject to certain minimum spacings between the axles of the combined vehicles involved.  This involved an estimated increase in pay loads of over four tonnes or about 20 per cent.  In accordance with the First EEC Directive of December 1984 on the weights and dimensions of certain goods vehicles, the maximum permissible gross vehicle weight limit in Ireland will be further increased to 40 tonnes, after a transitional period required to strengthen road pavements and bridges.  The length of the transitional period will be determined by the European Community by the end of February 1987.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The directive is designed to harmonise competitive conditions for road hauliers engaged in international traffic and to promote the free movement of goods vehicles throughout the EC.  Also in 1983, the maximum permissible weight on the sole driving axle of a combined <Col N="3144" /> vehicle was increased from ten tons to 10.5 tonnes (10.3 tons).  The corresponding limit for a non-driving axle was left unchanged at 10.17 tonnes (ten tons). The question of further increasing the maximum permissible driving axle limit has been under consideration at EC level for some time.</P>
    <P>The strengthening of roads and bridges to carry heavier goods vehicles, will take up to about ten years.  Provisions has been made in the 1985 road plan for extra expenditure involved.  Maximum permissible gross or axle weights cannot be increased generally until the necessary road works have been carried out.  It is, however, open to road hauliers wishing to carry loads in excess of the present legal limits to apply for a permit from the roads authority responsible for the roads over which the loads will be carried.  Such permits may be granted under section 13 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961, and may be subject to limitations, restriction and conditions, including conditions as to compensation by hauliers for damage to public roads which may arise from the use of the vehicles to which the permits relate.</P>

Upon examination of this case health board officials considered that a medical card would be more appropriate in view of the particular nature of the case involved. Accordingly, a doctor's acceptance form was forwarded to the person concerned on 6 February 1986 and the completed form was received by the board on 13 February 1986.  A medical card for the person concerned is currently being processed and will be issued in the near <Col N="3148" /> future.

      <P>Following investigation of the unemployment assistance claim of the person concerned he was assessed with means of £36.88 weekly derived from the value of capital and from the beneficial occupation of a half share of a holding. In assessing the value of capital to an applicant for unemployment assistance purposes the weekly value is calculated by taking 5 per cent of the first £400 and 10 per cent of the balance.  The sum so calculated is divided by 52 and this figure is deemed to be the weekly value of the capital.  The person concerned was treated as having capital amounting to £5,881.86.  The value of this capital was accordingly calculated at £568.18 per annum or £10.93 weekly.  The net yearly value of the holding was calculated at £2,700 and as the applicant was deemed to enjoy beneficial occupation of a half share, he was assessed with means of £1,350 yearly or £25.95 weekly from that source.  The applicant's total means, therefore, were calculated at £1,918.18 yearly, or £36.88 weekly.  Accordingly, his claim for unemployment assistance was disallowed on the grounds that his means exceeded the maximum rate of unemployment assistance payable to him.  He appealed against the disallowance and arising from contentions made by him in support of his appeal the papers were returned to the social welfare officer for further inquires.  When these inquiries are completed his case will be referred to an appeals officer for determination of means and his entitlement to unemployment assistance will be <Col N="3149" /> reviewed in the light of the outcome of the appeal.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed a retirement pension on 1 September 1985. One of the conditions for receipt of retirement pension under the Social Welfare Acts requires the claimant to have a yearly average of at least 24 reckonable contributions over the period from 5 January 1953 or from his year of entry into insurance, whichever is the later, to the end of the last complete contribution year before reaching the pension age.  He has no record of insurance under the Social Welfare Acts and does not, therefore, qualify for a retirement pension from the Department.  Neither did he qualify for an old age contributory pension on reaching age 66 on 14 October 1985.  A yearly average of at least 20 over a similar period is required for this latter pension.  His British contributions could only be taken into account to qualify him for a <i>pro rata</i> retirement or old age contributory pension under EC regulations if he had a record of Irish insurance since 5 January 1953.  He stated on the claim form that he is in receipt of a pension from the British Department of Health and Social Security.</P>

      <P>The person concerned is in receipt of a retirement pension at the rate of £49.05 per week.  This is the rate appropriate to her yearly average of 32 reckonable contributions over the period from the beginning of the 1965 contribution year to 5 April 1984.  She had a total of 616 reckonable contributions in this <Col N="3150" /> period.  A yearly average of at least 48 reckonable contributions is required to qualify for the pension at the maximum rate which is £51.40 per week at present. Her employment since 1980 was insurable at the reduced rate applicable to permanent and pensionable public servants. These contributions do not include any element of cover for retirement pension or old age contributory pension and are not reckonable for either pension.</P>

He made a further application for unemployment benefit on 14 May 1985 and following inquiries to establish what efforts he had made to secure employment his claim was again disallowed on the grounds that he was not available for work.

      <P>Entitlement to unemployment assistance is dependent on an applicant being the holder of a qualification certificate, and to obtain a qualification certificate an applicant must satisfy certain conditions, including an assessment of means.  The person concerned applied for unemployment assistance on 22 November 1985 and the papers were referred to a social welfare officer for investigation of his means.  Following the completion of inquiries, the person concerned was assessed with means of £11.65 weekly derived mainly from the value of board and lodging on his parents' holding. He is, accordingly, entitled to unemployment assistance at £20.10 weekly being the maximum rate payable in his case of £31.75 less means of £11.65.  Arrangements have been made with his local office to pay a current week and any arrears due this week, and further weekly payments will continue to be made as they become due.</P>

      <P>Entitlement to unemployment benefit is subject to the condition that a person must be available for work.  The person concerned, who was last employed on 24 January 1986, claimed unemployment benefit on 28 January 1986.  Inquiries are necessary to establish whether she fulfils the condition of being available for employment.  These inquiries, which are continuing, will be completed as soon as possible and her entitlement to unemployment benefit will be considered in the light of the outcome.</P>

Offenders have been prosecuted on a number of occasions under these regulations.  Also, the Registration of Potato Growers and Potato Packers Act, 1984, has the objective of improving further the quality and presentation of domestic potato production.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>It would not be in accordance with normal practice or appropriate for me to provide detailed information about the way in which a Garda investigation was carried out.  Some information as to how <Col N="3159" /> the Garda were proceeding in their inquiries in this case was provided by my predecessor in reply to the Deputy's question on the subject on 26 January 1984, but what was then at issue was information designed to help any potential complainants who might wish to contact the Garda.  In general terms, however, I can confirm that Garda inquiries extended over quite a wide area and that persons who were believed to be in a position to supply useful information and who were willing to do so were interviewed and invited to make statements.</P>
    <P>I might add that the nature of complaints of this kind is such that investigations are not necessarily finalised at any particular point and the Garda are always willing to examine any new evidence that may be made available to them.  It is therefore open to the Deputy or to anybody who has any statement &mdash; or any further statement &mdash; to give to the Garda to do so even at this stage.</P>
