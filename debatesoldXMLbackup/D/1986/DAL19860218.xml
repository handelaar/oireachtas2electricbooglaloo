      <P>asked the Taoiseach if it is his intention to hold discussions with representatives of the Churches regarding the possibility of removing the constitutional ban on divorce and introducing divorce legislation; when any such discussions are likely to be held; the purpose of any such discussions; if he intends to consult with any other groups or organisations on this matter; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have written to the principal Churches, namely, the Roman Catholic, Church of Ireland, Presbyterian, Methodist, the Jewish Congregation and the Society of Friends, proposing consultations during March on action to be taken on the range of matters arising from the report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown. It is my intention, following these consultations, to bring proposals to Government.  The necessity for such consultations is, I believe, self-evident in view of the role of Churches in the solemnisation of marriage.  The question <Col N="2790" /> of meeting organisations who do not have this function does not arise.  All such organisations have already had the opportunity of presenting their views to the joint committee on the issues covered by their terms of reference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach not agree that the opportunity already afforded the Churches, which was taken up by a number of them including the Presbyterian Church of Ireland and the Church of Ireland, was an adequate form of consultation, and that he should now proceed to legislate on the issue of divorce?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree.  Various bodies, including some of the Churches, made submissions to the committee.  The all-party committee have now produced a report which made recommendations. A number of these recommendations impinge directly on the question of marriage and others relate to it.  The implementation of these recommendations requires consultation with the Churches which are responsible for the solemnisation of marriage in 99 per cent of cases in this country.  Such issues as the minimum age of marriage, the possible desirability of providing for a minimal period of notice before marriage, the enforcement of the law in relation to bigamy and possible changes in the laws relating to marriage and possible remarriage in cases where a marriage has irretrievably broken down directly affect Churches which have the responsibility for solemnising a marriage in 99 per cent of cases. It would be quite improper to proceed to change the law in which the Churches are directly involved under the existing common and statutory law without seeking their views on these matters.  There are other matters on which their views could be usefully sought, such as counselling of married couples with matrimonial difficulties, the legal grounds for separation <i>a mensa et thoro,</i> and other matters which may be of indirect interest and where the views of the Churches would be useful before proceeding to <Col N="2791" /> make decisions involving the implementation of the recommendations in the report.</P>

      <P>For the benefit of the Members I would point out that the sound amplification system is not working and perhaps Members would bear that in mind.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Have either the Taoiseach or the Government placed a timescale on the completion of consultations about which he spoke?  The Taoiseach referred to a request to the Churches to meet him in March.  Could the Taoiseach say whether or not he expects these consultations to be completed in March and what timescale he than proposes for proceeding with legislation arising from those consultations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope to have these consultations during March with a view to reaching conclusions with regard to the implementation of recommendations in the report and to start the process of bringing the proposals to Government as soon as possible after that.  That is the clear purpose and intent of the procedures set out.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that the views of the Labour Party have been known for a considerable time, would the Taoiseach agree that he has had sufficient time to consult with the Churches in order to afford himself and his party an opportunity to support the Labour Party Bill next week?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I sought advice in respect of the matters to be raised and the issues involved and on receipt of that advice I wrote to the Churches.  The procedure of examining the report and seeking advice on the relevant issues and approaching the Churches promptly to seek their views is the correct procedure in a matter that intimately links Church and State.  I make a clear distinction <Col N="2792" /> between a matter of this kind in which Church and State are so closely involved in the same action of solemnising a marriage and other areas in which the Churches may have views which they wish to give but where it would not be necessarily appropriate for the Government to seek their views before acting in a certain way.</P>

Mar thoradh ar na hiarrachtaí sin, bhí 1,937 nduine fostaithe go lánaimseartha ar 31 Nollaig 1984 i dtionscail sa chontae a fuair cúnamh ó Ghaeltarra Éireann/ón Udarás i gcomparáid le 1,508 ar 31 Nollaig 1980.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Tá mé cinnte dá mbeadh deontais níos mó le fáil sa Ghaeltacht go meallfaí níos mó daoine isteach chun tionscail a chur ar bun.  Is ceist airgid í sin.  Ní dóigh liom gur féidir linn é sin a dhéanamh ar an bpointe seo.  Ba mhaith liom a rá go bhfuil fostaíocht árd sa Ghaeltacht, níos áirde ná in áiteanna eile. Bhí ardú ar fhostaíocht sa Ghaeltacht ó 1,058 go 1,937 i rith treimhse ceithre bliana.</P>

Tá árdú tagaithe ar líon na ndaoine sa Ghaeltacht le cúpla bliain.  Tá an ráta fostaíochta ard i gcomparáid le áiteanna eile.  Tá fadhb ann le réiteach. Caithfhidh an tÚdarás cloí leis an obair agus feabhas a chur ar an scéal agus beidh tacaíocht le fáil uaimse agus ón Roinn.</P>

Rud eile dhe, an nglacann sé go bhfuil gearradh siar ar dheontais chun seirbhísí a chur ar fáil le blianta beaga anuas?

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Tá a fhios agam go bhfuil ardú ar an méid a bhí le fáil.  Bhí tráth ann nuair nach raibh seirbhísí le fáil sa Ghaeltacht.  Is é an polasaí a bhí ag an Roinn agus ag Gaeltarra Éireann nach bhféadfaí deontais a chur ar fáil go dtí go mbeadh na seirbhísí ar fáil.  Tá mé ag breathnú ar an chaoi is fearr le deontais a chaitheamh ar sheirbhísí atá ar ceal sa Ghaeltacht agus go bhfuil gá leo.</P>

Bhí ardú ar fhostaíocht sa Ghaeltacht le tréimhse bliana nuair a bhí cúlú ar fhostaíocht go ginearálta sa tír.  Tá méadú suntasach le feiceáil trí iarrachtaí an Údaráis cé go bhfuil a lán deacrachtaí mar atá a fhios ag an Teachta maidir le fostaíocht sa Ghaeltacht.  Tá méadú mar sin féin ó 1984 <Col N="2797" /> go 1985 de 200; Ó 1982 go 1983 tá méadú de 85.  Sin net figiúirí mar adearfá.  Ní dóigh liom gur féidir a rá nach bhfuil dul chun cinn á dhéanamh maidir le fostaíocht. Glacaim go bhfuil daoine óga oilte ann agus go bhfuil sár-oideachas acu ach táimíd anois ag breathnú ar rudaí cosúil le achmhainní nádúrtha agus, tá an-dul chun cinn déanta le déanaí maidir le feirmeoireacht éisc agus tá áit do chéimithe ollscoile go bhfuil cáilíocht faoi leith acu.</P>

      <P>Má tá suim ar bith ag an Rialtas seo in athbheocaint na Gaeilge nach ceart go dtabharfadh siad gach cuidiú do mhná tí na Gaeltachta chun cuidiú leis seo?  An nglacann an tAire leis nach bhfuil brabach ar bith á dheánamh ag mná tí na Gaeltachta ag deireadh an tSamhraidh?  Is é an t-aon bhrabach atá acu go bhfuil a fhios acu go bhfuil na daoine óga seo ag foghlaim na Gaeilge agus go bhfuil siad ag cuidiú le h-athbheocaint na Gaeilge?</P>

      <P>Ardaíodh an deontas do na mná tí i 1984 20 faoin gcéad nuair a bhí an ráta boilscithe níos lú ná leath de sin.  Ní féidir a rá nach bhfuilimid ag coinneáil suas leis an ráta boilscithe.  Má bhreathnaítear ar na figiúirí tá na mná tí ag fáil chúnaimh agus níl siad ag brath air seo amháin.  Mar atá a fhios ag an Teachta, níl anseo ach cuid bheag den teacht isteach a fhaigheann siad ó fhoghlaimeoirí na Gaeilge.  Tá údaráis na gcoláistí ag bailiú airgid ó thuismitheoirí na bpáistí seo agus cuirtear cuid de seo chuig na mná tí chomh maith.  Agus le eolas a thabhairt don Teach maidir le hardú íocaíochtaí &mdash; i 1976 bhí £794,000 do na mná tí agus i 1985 bhí £1,110,601 agus tá sin níos mó ná 25 faoin gcéad, agus maidir le h-uimhir na ndaltaí a bhí i gceist is ionann í agus an ráta céanna &mdash; 16,400 i gcomparáid le 16,900.  Is breá liom é sin a rá mar mura mbeadh na mná tí ann ní bheadh na cúrsaí ann agus ní bheadh foghlaimeoirí Gaeilge ann ach oiread, agus tá súil agam go bhfuil rud éigin acu as anois.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 and 35 together.</P>
      <P>I would like to assure the Deputies that the terms enshrined in the Treaty of Accession of Spain and Portugal will ensure that Ireland's vital fisheries interests will be protected in the enlarged Community and that there will be contained scope for further development. The fishing quotas for 1986 negotiated at meetings of the EC Council of Ministers for Fisheries in December last are very satisfactory from our point of view.  By comparison with 1985 quotas, the increases secured for 1986 are based on average values worth over £5 million extra.</P>
      <P>As the Deputies are aware, responsibility for fisheries protection is proper to the Minister for Defence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I should like to wish the Minister and the Minister of State well in their new Departments.  There is always an element of surprise in fishing but it is very surprising how both Ministers got hooked in this Department. However I wish the Minister well for the few days I hope he will be in office.  Is he aware of the widespread anxiety in the industry that enlargement of the Community will mean a sizeable reduction in the amount of financial aid available for modernisation and for restructuring the fleet?  Is he aware that the quotas are totally inadequate and that the industry is genuinely depressed, worried and anxious about the present situation?  Will he undertake an immediate review of the quota arrangements to see how that matter can be improved and to ensure there will be no loss of revenue in the enlarged Community for development of the fisheries infrastructure?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for his kind remarks initially.  I would point out that my first position when in Opposition was as spokesman on Fisheries, so this is not a totally new experience for me.  The quotas which have been achieved for the present year, even after the enlargement of the Community as a result of the entry of Spain and Portugal, represent an increase of £5 million to the fishermen, which I consider a very good result of the discussions in which my predecessor participated in the December Council.  In my new role I will certainly <Col N="2803" /> take account of the situation in regard to fishery quotas for Irish fishermen in the months ahead when these come to be discussed again.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am fully aware of the risk to Irish forests from pests and diseases which can be carried in imported wood and to this end there are strict plant health controls on imports of certain types of timber and plants.  Phyto-sanitary certificates from the country of origin must be presented.</P>
      <P>In addition, periodic health surveys of forest areas, especially in the vicinity of sea ports, are carried out.  Contingency plans to cope with any reported infection of infestation have been drawn up.</P>
      <P>While statutory responsibility for plant health matters is vested in the Minister for Agriculture, my Department as the body responsible for forestry advise the Minister for Agriculture on matters relating to forestry plant health.  In addition to the national plant health legislation, regulations are made from time to time by the Minister for Agriculture implementing the provisions of EEC plant health directives.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister keep in mind the real danger to the industry here especially from imported timber which still has bark?  Is the Minister aware of this and will he examine the situation with a view to introducing some controls?</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of these dangers but as I said in my reply there is <Col N="2804" /> good liaison between my Department and the Department of Agriculture to ensure that any infestation arising from importation will be dealt with immediately. Plant health controls are very strict for those types of timber which are liable to bring in this infestation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>In January 1984 the West Mayo Fishermen's Co-Operative submitted a modified development scheme for Darby's Point consisting of <Col N="2806" /> an extension at right angles to the head of the pier.  The Department's engineers have examined the matter and consider that the site and model investigation should be carried out to enable final and practical designs for developments to be drawn up.  The Office of Public works have been requested to outline the full scope of the site investigation.  It is understood that any costs arising from site investigations this year would be small. Consequently, should any such costs arise they can be carried in the 1986 allocation for harbour development.  With regard to Blacksod pier, discussions took place in 1980 between the Department of Fisheries and Forestry, Roinn na Gaeltachta, the OPW and the Fishermen.  Roinn na Gaeltachta requested OPW to prepare an engineering report and an estimate of the costs for the following development works at Blacksod pier: firstly, the extension of the pier to give 4ft depth at mean low water; secondly, the provision of leading lights and pier lighting; thirdly, the extension of the pier to give 6ft. depth at mean low water and the provision of a breakwater parallel to the existing pier. In January 1984 Roinn na Gaeltachta forwarded to this Department an engineering report and an estimate in respect of the works mentioned as follows; firstly, to extend the pier by 55 metres to provide four feet at mean low water &mdash; £432,000; a working light and an navigation light on the existing pier would cost £3,000; a working light and an navigation light to the extension would cost £2,000; the extension of the pier by 80 metres to provide a 6ft depth, £651,000; breakwater to suit 55-metre extension, £259,000; breakwater to suit an 80-metre extension, £348,000.  The minimum cost would have been £693,000 for these.  Having examined the report and the cost estimate, it is considered that the expenditure involved could not be justified in view of the landings at Blacksod which were valued at approximately £15,000 in 1983.  There is another proposal for an anchorage at Cartron, approximately two miles north of Blacksod, by building a breakwater. A meeting took place in September 1985 <Col N="2807" /> with the local fishermen, Roinn na Gaeltachta and the Department to discuss pier improvements also at Blacksod when the fishermen were informed that the original proposed improvements at Blacksod could not be justified, and their views were sought as to the possibility of some alternative improvements such as I have already mentioned.</P>
      <P>The modified scheme has been costed and a report on it by the OPW is at present being considered.  That report is being examined and assessed in this Department with a view to seeking the sanction of the Department of Finance if its cost is deemed justified on economic grounds.  To this end more detailed catch figures have been compiled and these are on record credited to the Blacksod pier and have been challenged by the fishermen. Meanwhile this Department in the interests of safety have offered Mayo a grant of 75 per cent of the cost of providing urgently required working navigational lights which are part of the modified scheme.</P>

At present there seems to be an amount of money to provide navigational lights only, particularly since the value of the catch, as I have told the Deputy, was the very low sum of £15,000 in 1983.  Should the figure have improved substantially I imagine we can reinvestigate the situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>The main elements of the aid package which came into operation on 1 July 1985 were &mdash; (a) Capitalisation of arrears; (b) Extension of repayment period; (c) Transfer from straight line to annuity system of loan repayment; (d) Increased level of interest subsidy.</P>
      <P>The elements at (a), (b) and (c) above in relation to the restructuring of accounts meant that in some cases a considerable reduction in the annual repayments by fishermen but it is not possible to put a cash value on this aid.  The improved interest subsidy provided for a minimum net interest rate of 9 per cent and was estimated to cost £300,000 in a full year.  Because, however, of the fall in interest rates in 1985 the estimated additional cost for the six months in which the revised rates applied was of the order of £100,000.</P>
      <P>The package also included the total remission of the excise duty on fuel oil for fishing vessels at an estimated cost of £0.5 million and provided for an additional sum of £480,000 for marketing and exploratory fishing with a view to improving fishermen's incomes.</P>

Would he accept also that this grant aid is available only to those who obtain grants from BIM and that many people in the fishing industry have secured grants from other financial institutions and through other channels?

      <P>asked the Minister for Fisheries, Forestry and Tourism when he will introduce a plan of action to encourage private investment in afforestation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the Government's policy to encourage private investment in afforestation in harmony with the State forestry programme.  To this end there are generous planting grants available and my Department also provide a free technical advisory service covering all aspects of afforestation.</P>
      <P>A special publicity campaign was launched in October 1985 to promote private forestry generally and highlighted the favourable rates of afforestation grants available under the forestry elements of the western package.  The campaign led to a substantial increase in the number of requests received for information and technical advice by potential private investors.  There is every indication that there will be a substantial increase in planting in 1986 and subsequent years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>Having regard to the great disparity between the level of grant aid in the 12 western counties and the rest of the country, the prospect of encouraging people in counties outside the 12 western counties to invest in private afforestation is very slim; the chances of them investing their money in private afforestation are very slim.  Does the Minister not think the time has arrived when the level of grant aid which applies in the western package area should apply to the country as a whole?  I have in mind the Cooley area in north Louth which is on the Border with south Armagh and south Down.  Much of the soil there is suitable for afforestation.  However, because the level of grant aid available in the county is not sufficiently attractive, people are not prepared to invest.  Yet a mere few miles away in County Monaghan, which happens to be in the western package area, there is a much more generous grant scheme in operation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have some sympathy with the Deputy's point of view, as I represent a county which is not within the western package area and which has a large forestry acreage.  This encouragement is given under the western package and, in order to expand that scheme to other areas, there would have to be negotiations.  The western package would have to be extended beyond the present 12 counties and that would have to be done in conjunction with the EC.  I should certainly like to see it extended perhaps to the agricultural disadvantaged areas.  It would be in the interests of everybody if that could be done.  I hope we can have discussions with the EC on the matter in the coming year, to see if we can achieve an extension of the package.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I take it from that, that the Minister is going to pursue actively the matter of ensuring that the western package level of grant aid will be available in the rest of the country?  The validity of my argument is such that it is imperative that this matter be pursued immediately.</P>

As the Deputy knows, the county from which I come could certainly benefit if the western package were extended to include it.  We are both in the same position on this matter and I hope he will accept my assurance that it would be in all our interests to see if we can get that extension.</P>

Tá mé ag rá, agus dúirt mé é go poiblí cheana, gur thóg siad na fiacha seo orthu féin in aghaidh mo chomhairle agus comhairle Roinn na Gaeltachta.  Cuireadh ina luí orthu ag an am go raibh siad ag tnú le suimeanna airgid nach mbeifí ábalta teacht orthu.  Níor ghlacadh leis an chomhairle sin agus bhí siad i dtrioblóid. Cuireadh £300,000 ar fáil dóibh ó Chiste na nAgróirí agus chuir sé sin moill ar a gcuid deacrachtaí beagán, ach tá fadhbanna acu.  Glacaim leis go bhfuil obair an-tábhachtach á déanamh acu, ach dar ndóigh is fadhbanna caipitiúla atá i gceist, ní fadhbanna airgid reatha.</P>

      <P>asked the Taoiseach, if in view of the serious public concern about the number of incidents at the Sellafield Nuclear Reprocessing Plant in Britain involving leaks of radioactive material and the evidence that British Nuclear Fuels have on a number of occasions given misleading and inaccurate information about incidents at the plant, he will indicate the measures the Government are taking to ensure the health and safety of Irish citizens is not endangered; pending discussions with the British Government on the future of the plant, if he will request the British authorities to agree to the appointment of an observer nominated by the British Government to be based in Sellafield and to monitor and <Col N="2818" /> report on all incidents there and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend to take the two questions together.  It is appropriate that I should say how disturbed the Government have been, and continue to be, about the entire situation.</P>
      <P>I intend to raise these concerns at a meeting which I am having with the British Prime Minister tomorrow and I would intend to convey to her that the number of incidents, notwithstanding that they may be described as being of negligible radiological significance, has caused a loss of confidence in Ireland in the safety of the reprocessing of nuclear materials at Sellafield.  This loss of confidence has been heightened by the disclosure in <i>The Sunday Times</i> of 16 February 1985 that discharges from Sellafield which took place in 1953-55 may have been 40 times higher than those made available for the Black report.</P>
      <P>In the light of all this, I will be urging the British Prime Minister that there should be a thorough review of safety procedures at the Sellafield plant.  I intend also to seek ministerial discussions in Brussels with a view to proposing a European inspection force which would monitor activities such as those at Sellafield.</P>
      <P>In recent years this Government, through the contact group established with the UK, and by other means, have taken steps designed to ensure that we would be kept abreast of all developments at Sellafield.  But because of my dissatisfaction with the information we have been given, it is my intention to seek a full meeting of officials of all relevant Departments and bodies in the UK and in the Republic.  I consider that this would contribute to greater cohesion in the prompt receipt of the information being made available.  I see this as a necessary improvement to the working of the contact group established by Irish and UK Ministers in 1984.</P>

      <P>At his meeting with the British Prime Minister tomorrow, will the Taoiseach convey to her the deep anxiety <Col N="2819" /> felt throughout Ireland at the continuing existence of this potentially deadly menace, and the widespread anger and resentment that exist here because of the many false statements made, bogus reassurances given and the cover up engaged in by the British authorities in this matter?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have said, I will convey to the British Prime Minister that the number of incidents have caused loss of confidence in Ireland in the safety of the reprocessing plant at Sellafield, and this has been heightened by the information now available that earlier figures given were incorrect.  We have been concerned also that the initial information given in respect of an incidents of 5 February 1986 turned out to be incorrect.  The fact that in these two incidents in particular the information made available initially &mdash; in one case the information was allowed to stand for a long period &mdash; proved to be incorrect gives particular cause for concern.  We were not promptly and fully informed of what actually had been happening at Sellafield.</P>

Will the Taoiseach now admit that these assurances, like all the similar assurances which followed, were worthless and that the Tánaiste was naive to the point of negligence in accepting them?</P>

Will the Taoiseach indicate if he is aware that Dr. Black, an Irish scientist, has indicated that in his view the only way to make Sellafield safe is to have it shut down?  Will the Taoiseach comment on the view expressed by Dr. Nolan of the Irish Nuclear Energy Board that reports from the nuclear installation inspectorate in Britain are not being made available to him promptly or in any detail?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have said, the question of the availability of information is something that concerns us.  That is why I am seeking a full meeting of officials of all relevant Departments and bodies in the UK and the Republic, because I am not convinced that the information coming separately from different sources at present is giving a coherent picture or that we are getting the information as rapidly as we should.</P>
      <P>On the Deputy's first point, I have to say that the question as it reached me proposed an observer nominated by the British Government, not the Irish Government.  It was only when the Deputy read out his question that I learned that it was an Irish Government observer he was proposing.  That seems to me to be a more reasonable proposal than the one I received in writing.  In fact, I believe this is a matter that could better be dealt with, if we can achieve that, through a European inspection force. That is a matter that we will be raising in the first instance in Brussels.</P>

Does the Taoiseach further recall that the Minister of State at the Department of Energy, Deputy Eddie Collins, accused me of indulging in alarming questioning on 22 January 1985 and stated that there was no danger to people living in Ireland from discharges from Sellafield? Will the Taoiseach now ask the Ministers to withdraw their statements, admit they were wrong and apologise to the Irish people for their negligent behaviour?</P>

I believe I am right in saying that it is under 1 per cent of the safety margin.  I do not accept what the Deputy has said, but the fact that that is the result of our own monitoring of the air and sea pollution does not mean that we can be satisfied with a situation in which incidents have occurred with such frequency and in which the information available has turned out to be correct.

    <Speaker pid="ColmMHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>I find it very difficult as a member of the Opposition to contribute to a budget debate when the budget was introduced by a different Minister for Finance and especially when the Taoiseach misled this House with the recent juggling of the Cabinet.  It is strange to have a different Minister for Finance taking the budget through the Dáil now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This budget has done little or nothing to give our people hope.  It is obvious that the people want a change of Government. It is wrong for the Government to stay in office seeing that the people have <Col N="2950" /> no confidence in them.  There must be confidence in any successful business, and Government is a business, if its policies are to be successful. The longer such a Government stays in office the more cautious harm will be done to the economy. People are becoming more cautious about investing money here at home.  The Government have done nothing to improve the situation with this budget. There is no encouragement for business or farming enterprises to expand and there is no encouragement for workers to work harder or to create extra employment. It is sad to have able and willing people on the dole, people who want to work and cannot get work.  Family life is being seriously affected by this.  It is sad that so many educated young people must emigrate.  Most people want to do something worthwhile with their lives but unfortunately many cannot find employment here and must emigrate.  Boredom can be very harmful to society so it is important that we properly equip those who have to emigrate.</P>
    <P>This budget will not maintain or increase our economic growth.  Without economic growth we cannot create the revenue to provide the services.  We cannot demand more from the taxpayers. Taxpayers' money should be invested in new productive areas and in areas which have been successful but which need increased investment if we are to create the urgently needed extra revenue required.  There is no sense in continuing to spend more of taxpayers' money direct on administration and services when we cannot afford to do so.  The money generated from productivity should be reinvested in productive areas a second time and this should be the priority of any Government at present.  This policy would certainly help to create the cash needed to maintain and improve our services and, at the same time, create more employment. there must be radical changes in the collection of tax and how we spend it.  If we continue in the same way our financial problems will become even greater.</P>
    <P>We have plenty of successful business and farming people who could employ <Col N="2951" /> more people if they were given direct encouragement to do so.  However, there is too much red tape when one applies for grant aid.  Let us create competition among our own business people rather than a policy of protection.  Why is our system of paying out grants geared to protecting those in business especially when some are not as efficient as they should be while others who wish to start up similar businesses and create employment find it impossible to get grant aid? Many young people in my constituency are quite capable of starting up in a small way in business, they are willing to do so and could employ four or five workers. They could and would pay taxes to the State but they are not encouraged under present regulations.</P>
    <P>A national risk fund should be set up and each county development officer should be given a certain amount of cash to distribute locally to people who are decent, honest and capable.  They should be given a chance to prove themselves. Initiative should be encouraged instead of knocking it.  These people would be more of an asset to the economy instead of drawing the dole and doing nothing for it.  I am not talking about big grant money; in many instances small grants to buy simple machinery is all that is needed.  A small percentage share of the huge amount of money at present provided for the IDA, Manpower, the Youth Employment Agency and others should be provided to the people I have mentioned who are anxious to start up businesses. The taxpayers would certainly get better value for their money and even if some of the ventures failed, the cash risk would be very small.</P>
    <P>Another way of spending taxpayers' money better would be to deal directly with small successful business people.  We have many of these and they should be given assistance and encouraged.  We are spending far too much of taxpayers' money on setting up very costly structures so as to register the unemployed and to provide courses and so on.  In their own way these new structures provide encouragement and employment but <Col N="2952" /> many young people who participate in these schemes do not find employment on completion of the courses.  The policies of the Coalition Government over the last three years have not been successful.  We need more and more tax revenue to provide for decreasing services and our national debt continues to increase.  We cannot continue asking people to pay more and more tax to justify expenditure when they know that their money could be spent more wisely.  The cost of the services we require and demand must come from extra productivity and profit. In November 1982, before the last general election, Fine Gael and Labour said that they were the only parties who could solve the budget deficit, reduce our national debt, create employment and reduce taxation.  They have failed to honour any of these promises.</P>
    <P>Our national debt on 1 January 1985 was £18.5 billion, £10.5 billion in Irish pounds and £8 billion in foreign currency, of which £3 billion was in US dollars, £2? billion in Deutsche Marks, £0.5 billion in Swiss francs, £0.75 billion in Yen currency, £0.75 billion in sterling and the balance in Dutch guilders, ECU and others.  The cost of foreign borrowing is subject to considerable uncertainty &mdash; for example, a 1 per cent change in the international interest rates would account for a variation of £47 million in our payments. Our national debt increased by £2 billion in 1985 and it reached £20.5 billion.  At the end of 1986 it will have increased by a further £2 billion to reach the record figure of £22.5 billion.  This is the record of the Coalition Government.</P>
    <P>Our first and basic objective should be to curb the growth of debt service costs by reducing the level of Exchequer borrowing. We must exercise firm control over the level of foreign borrowing requirements and encourage more home investment instead.  There is a need for a new national pride, awareness and commitment to solve the debt problem.  That is what our people did in the past in a different way when they gave us the opportunities to develop.  They worked hard for little pay to do so, and never believed that they were entitled to buy <Col N="2953" /> something unless they had the money to pay for it.  These were the financial principles of the past.  However, it looks as if we are prepared to mortgage our country more and more each year and go deeper into debt.  If we do, generations of the future will be doing what our forefathers did in the past and this time it will not be the fault of the British but of the moneylenders of Germany and the USA.</P>
    <P>Almost one-third or £2 billion of our increasing revenue must go to repay our national debt in 1986.  In 1984 interest absorbed 32p in every £ of current revenue. In 1975 it was 21p in every £ of current revenue.  For the past three years the Government have been borrowing more and more for the budget deficit than for capital development.  In 1986 £1.25 billion of the extra £2 billion borrowed will be for the budget deficit.  When Fianna Fáil were in Government they borrowed more money for capital development. There is no guarantee either that the estimated budget deficit of £1.25 billion for 1986 will be the figure at the end of the year, because if we judge it on the record of the Government for 1985 we find that the budget deficit was £50 million greater than they had estimated.  The real budget deficit in 1985 was a record figure of £1.284 billion.  The major reason for the 1985 budget deficit being £50 million greater was due mainly to the fact that the revenue receipts were £123 million less than expected and provided for. Why?  There was more unemployment during the year than the Government had expected, there was less trade and commerce, less capital investment and our imports fell.  The Government failed to realise this and they also failed to realise the financial hardship under which our people were living.  People spent most of their money on lower VAT rated goods during 1985.  Income tax receipts were down by £28 million, customs duties were down by £8 million and VAT receipts were down by £82 million.  This is a confession of failure by the Coalition that their policies have not been successful.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance in his 1986 speech gave the impression to the media that he had reduced taxation.  Before the <Col N="2954" /> Minister came into the House he had a budget deficit of £1.3498 billion and when he finished his budget speech the deficit was £1.2500 billion, a reduction of £99.8 million net, and I repeat net.  Where did he get this money from?  There were two parts to the budget, the revenue side of income and the expenditure side of income.  Under the first part the Minister took in £305.2 million in tax and gave back £151.1 million, thereby, collecting an extra £154.1 million in tax.  The £305.2 million would be collected under the following headings: £10.5 million from alcoholic drink, £12.9 million from tobacco, £15 million from petrol and diesel, £4.7 million from road tax, £76.7 million from VAT increases, £18 million as a result of the cancellation of the tax-free child allowance, £7 million from income tax from the self-employed, £75 million retention tax, £1.4 million from corporation taxes, £6 million from the tax-based lending of financial institutions, £38 million from life insurance companies, £15 million in respect of anti-evasion and avoidance measures and £25 million from income tax.  These amounts make a total of £305.2 million.</P>
    <P>The Minister gave tax reliefs amounting to £151.1 million and they were under the following headings: £49.6 million PRSI allowances, £0.5 million stock relief, £7.5 million excise duties, £17.5 million VAT relief, and £76 million income tax relief.  This means the Minister will collect an additional £154.1 million in taxation.</P>
    <P>In Part II of the budget he increased expenditure by £144.5 million.  He did that by an increase of £70.8 million in respect of social welfare and new claims. He provided £70 million for public service pay and £3.7 million for other matters. He reduced expenditure income by £90.2 million under the heading of &ldquo;Expenditure savings and balances&rdquo; leaving him with a debit balance of £54.3 million in income.  If one takes Part I and Part II together one arrives at the following figures: a tax credit of £154.1 million and an expenditure debit of £54.3 million, which leaves a net credit of £99.8 million. <Col N="2955" /> This is the figure by which the Minister reduced the budget deficit.</P>
    <P>I will refer to a few hidden increases about which the media do not appear to be aware and on which the Minister did not give details in his budget speech. Under the Social Insurance Fund the ceiling figure has been increased from £13,800 to £14,700.  This will bring in an additional £3 million in 1986 and an additional £11 million in 1987.  Under the Redundancy and Employers' Insolvency Fund he increased the ceiling from £13,800 to £14,700 and he also increased the contribution rate from 0.5 per cent to 0.6 per cent.  This will give him an additional £3.2 million in 1986 and £5.5 million in 1987.  He increased the ceiling in respect of the Occupational Injuries Fund from £13,800 to £14,700 and he increased the contribution rate of 0.4 per cent to 0.43 per cent.  This will give him an extra £1.3 million in 1986 and £2.4 million in 1987.  He increased the ceiling with regard to health contributions from £13,000 to £14,000.  He will take in an extra £0.2 million in 1986 and £2.1 million in 1987.  In respect of pay-related benefit to which the workers themselves contribute, he increased the floor price from £49 to £58 for new claims from April 1986. As a result of that he will take in £2.8 million in 1986 and will get the sum of £6.8 million in 1987.  Under those five headings he will take in £10.5 million and will get the handsome sum of £27.8 million in 1987.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision of £50,000 to Gaeltacht Rath Cairn in County Meath. The people concerned have done excellent community and development work. Recently, they built a church and they have a fine community centre also.  They are the new growth centre for successful development and the use of the Irish language. It is their wish to establish an all-Irish secondary school in County Meath and I hope the Government will continue to assist them in the future.  I wish the people of Gaeltacht Rath Cairn continued success.</P>
    <P>This budget has been disastrous for the construction industry.  There have been <Col N="2956" /> cuts in funds for local authority housing, there have been increases in the cost of diesel and petrol which will add extra costs to transportation and there have been cuts of £25 million in the public capital programme.  There is no new hope whatever and certainly no help to create employment in this area.</P>
    <P>The unemployment figure is a disgrace. The Coalition Government have failed to assist the construction sector.  The figure of 240,000 unemployed people is a clear indication of the failure of Government policies.  Many young educated people write to me each week looking for jobs but trying to get employment for them is an impossibility.  I am tired reading in the newspapers and seeing on television announcements of more jobs by the former Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism, Deputy Bruton.  We read announcements about a factory opening and promising 500 jobs over the next four years but the truth is that the employment projection figures are never maintained.  In many cases the companies go out of business after one or two years.  If the Minister is correct, the unemployment figures would not be as they are today.  A few weeks ago in my local newspaper, the <i>Meath Chronicle,</i> there was a heading: &ldquo;54 New Jobs in County Meath&rdquo;.  This announcement was made by the former Minister, Deputy Bruton, at a Fine Gael meeting.  It was announced as a great boost for County Meath.  Let me remind the Minister in the House of the situation in my county with regard to unemployment.  Since November 1982, when this Government took office, unemployment in Trim has increased by 100 per cent, in Kells by 60 per cent and in Navan by 30 per cent.</P>
    <P>The Government do not appear to be interested in or to understand the importance of Drogheda harbour to the trade and commerce of Counties Meath and Louth and other areas.  Cement Limited are only a few miles away and they and others could benefit greatly if harbour facilities were available.  Instead, for the first time in the history of Cement Limited workers are let go because of high production costs and decreasing business. <Col N="2957" /> I am glad to say that when Fianna Fáil were in Government, the then Minister, Deputy Faulkner, gave a sum of £1.5 million for Drogheda Harbour Board. That has not been matched to date.</P>
    <P>People involved in the furniture and carpet business in County Meath are struggling under severe trade difficulties. Again, I ask the Minister to reduce VAT in this area in order to help these hardworking and responsible business people to maintain employment.  Otherwise, there will be more unemployment in County Meath.  We must create more jobs if we are even to maintain the present services let alone provide the additional services demanded.  We cannot create more administration if we do not increase productivity.</P>
    <P>There has been little or no unemployment in the public sector.  Most, if not all, of the unemployment in the past three years has occurred in the industrial and agricultural areas.  How can we expect people to pay their way if they are unemployed? Employment is the key that will allow people to pay mortgages, local authority charges and so on.  It is the key to success.  I am convinced our system of taxation is seriously affecting the creation of employment.  We must find some way to reduce taxation for those who may be in a position to create employment.  I doubt if any tax will be lost to the Revenue and even if there was some loss at least there would be more people at work.</P>
    <P>The 35 per cent retention tax is the major new feature of this year's budget and it will net an extra £75 million in taxation.  The banks and financial institutions will certainly pass on these charges to their customers.  It is they, the customers, who will have to pay.  It also means that the Government will collect two years' income in one year.  It is most likely that bank interest rates and building society mortgage rates will increase.</P>
    <P>Many old age pensioners will now have to pay tax on interest income which was not taxable until now and they will not be able to claim back this tax.  This cannot be accepted and I am surprised and disappointed that the Minister should have <Col N="2958" /> gone to this level to balance the books. Childrens' savings accounts will also be subject to this tax of 35 per cent.  People who are taxable at a higher rate than the standard rate will now have to pay the difference between the two rates.  It is likely that there will be higher life insurance premiums and building societies will either increase their mortgage interest rates or decrease their deposit rates. Many insurance companies will find it much more difficult to remain in business. This decision will cause much uncertainty and unrest in the financial agency business. People who invest redundancy money will also be subject to this 35 per cent tax.  Other groups who will be affected by it are community organisations, group water schemes, fund raising enterprises for charity such as Concern and Trócaire, young couples saving to get married who put their money in deposit accounts, residential groups trying to improve the environments of housing estates.  Environmental improvement groups will also be affected.  This new tax will slow down the initiative of many voluntary groups in local community development and other worthwhile enterprises.</P>
    <P>However, certain aspects of this new tax may be acceptable but I recommend that the Minister should reconsider his full proposals.  If he does not, he will cause much unrest and uncertainty among our people.  It is strange that the former Minister for Finance thought it wise to exempt non-residents from this tax because he knew there was a grave danger of mass withdrawals of money. Yet he is not worried if our own investors choose to invest outside the country, which I believe many will do.</P>
    <P>The Minister will collect £15 million extra on petrol and diesel tax and £4.7 million extra in road tax.  At the same time Meath County Council and other local authorities are getting less and less revenue from central Government.  The county roads in County Meath are falling asunder and a crisis situation has now been reached.  It is impossible to ask people to pay more tax at local level. <Col N="2959" /> With great financial effort and co-operation from the people, Meath County Council are maintaining all other services but it is not possible without Government aid to make a realistic start on improving our country roads.  Our engineers are doing their very best with limited resources. I suggest that a percentage of the grants for national primary and national secondary roads should be allotted for spending on county roads or otherwise a special grant should be made for the improvement of county roads.  I ask the Minister to give serious consideration to my request.</P>
    <P>Agriculture was badly treated in the budget also because less money was provided for development in this area.  Agriculture is facing many problems and it is important that the Government should encourage productivity.  It appears that the Coalition Government are saying to the farmers that they are not interested in them.  No real effort is being made to develop a national food processing enterprise. We have been in the EC for many years but we have made very slow progress in the area of promoting and marketing our agricultural goods.  The opportunities are still there but the Government do not appear to have the ability to motivate our farming community to rise to the challenge.  Instead this budget provides £5 million less for the expansion of our cattle breeding herd, the base of our great industry.  The scheme for payments under the exchange rate as guarantees on loans, used by farmers to produce beef cattle, mainly on the grass, has been abolished.  It was £10.6 million last year but only £0.6 million. This is the Coalition Government's agricultural policy and they should be ashamed of it.</P>
    <P>This Coalition have failed the people who elected them.  One might say they are doing their best but if that is so their best is certainly not good enough.  The people are saying the same.  Let us look at the record of the Government over the past three years.  Trade and commerce have slowed down; investment has <Col N="2960" /> slowed down; capital spending has become less and less; unemployment, taxation and emigration are increasing; so, too, is the national debt.  The construction industry has almost come to a halt.  The Coalition Government may not be aware of it but the people definitely are and I am certain that the Coalition will be fully aware of it after the next general election.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamSkelly" hpid="Mr. Skelly Mr. Skelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>A lot of water has gone under the bridge since this debate started. The temptation has been on the Government side to justify their performance for the last three years and, of course, on the Opposite side to knock it completely.  In order to find the true path forward, which neither side seems to do very often, it is necessary to state bluntly and clearly the problems we have had to date, the position we are in at the moment and the prospects of getting out of it.  Everybody seems to be short on ideas on how to get out of it.</P>
      <P>There are several serious problems affecting the country.  The first and most serious is the job situation.  The second is taxation and the third is emigration.  It is fair to say that everybody has thrown a hat at the first and the third but cannot seem to come up with constructive, worthwhile solutions.  They seem to feel that by ignoring the emigration problem it will go away, except when the Opposition find it very useful to use it as a stick with which to beat the Government. They conveniently forget it when they themselves are in Government.  Emigration has been with us for a long time and the history of both parties in Government will show that while emigration was rampant no attempt was made to stop it. It was conveniently forgotten.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It must be said in fairness that in the seventies the leaders repeatedly bragged about the young, vibrant population we had and they constantly referred to it as our greatest asset.  In recent years we hear not a word about it because they have in truth become our greatest liability and we just do not want to do anything about it.  It is totally dishonest to ignore a problem of such serious dimensions and <Col N="2961" /> not even to say that it is there and we do not know how to tackle it, and not even to ask for suggestions so that we might tackle it and hope that eventually it will work its way out.</P>
    <P>Also it must be totally frustrating for those people in Opposition and on the back benches on the Government side to have ideas or suggestions to make in relation to these problems and not to have them even heard.  I doubt if any attention at all will be paid to the speeches that have been made by Members in this debate and not often are they paid attention on other debates.  The advice seems to be got from outside and we seem to rely more and more on theoretic, academic economic advice from people who seem to be the gurus in this country.  You find them in every Department and at every level of Government working out what they seem to think is the answer to our problems and if we are all patient enough and are prepared to wait for another decade, at least ten if not 20 years, it will work its way out again.  Then we will be a very depleted population resembling somewhat the population we had in the late sixties after a constant outflow of our young people, all the vitality of the nation spread throughout the world, and they seemed to do reasonably well for themselves abroad.  I will come back to that.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the problems that led us to where we are at the moment.  I know that in the last two years there has been a rapid reduction in inflation, in rates of interest and in the growth of unemployment. That is what we are reduced to now, the reduction in the growth of unemployment.  There has been no increase in employment but there has been a reduction in growth.  There has been improvement in expenditure control on capital and current account and an improvement in the balance of payments. These are all accepted.  We know the extent of the crisis that faced us when we came in which is not to be ignored and to put things into context it must also be referred to.  We know that there was economic stagnation and no activity; we even had a decline in that area.  Real <Col N="2962" /> GNP was falling and manufacturing production had declined for two of the previous three years before we came in. Unemployment was spiralling upwards. The balance of payments situation was frightening and the cumulative deficits over the four years to 1982 amounted to half of our total annual production. Inflation was rampant, well over 20 per cent, and the value of money had been halved in less than five years.  Our international competitiveness was being seriously and relentlessly eroded.  We had an imbalance in the public finances which seemed to have taken on a permanent character with the EBR at 16 per cent of GNP and interest rates at exorbitant levels putting impossible strains on the financial position of business, farmers and the ordinary individual.  That situation confronted us as we started out. Now we have four budgets, including this one, behind us in attempting to deal with it.</P>
    <P>The Minister will say that he has confronted the reality of the situation and given an honest assessment of it and that he has faced up to the difficult decisions needed to put the economy on a sound footing again.  He will say that he has confronted head on the real problems of the economy, namely the creation of sustainable employment, the control of inflation, the restoration of our international competitiveness, the correction of the public finances and the reduction of borrowing.  That is fair, because he has done those things and it was not an easy task to accomplish, given how near we were to bankruptcy when this Government came into office and that the tasks that had to be undertaken were not universally popular.  To give credit where credit is due, substantial progress has been made in taxation and budgetary policies and control has been restored over the management of the annual budget.  The deterioration in the public finances has been halted and Exchequer borrowing requirements and the public sector borrowing requirement as a proportion of GNP have been reduced.  We are now getting to grips with taxation and <Col N="2963" /> we have seen the first small step along that way.</P>
    <P>We still face enormous problems and we will not easily satisfy the people who are at the butt end of them.  Much more needs to be done and we hope that we can set about doing it and give some indications and make some suggestions as to how that might be done.  The Minister for Justice, then Minister for Finance, said recently that the primary aim of the Government's economic policies is to refer upwards the trend in unemployment, and that depends among other things on the rate of economic expansion. He said that faster growth creates more job opportunities and helps to reduce the budget deficit because it boosts tax receipts and reduces expenditure commitment. We had a good growth performance last year, probably the best in Europe, which was against the odds.  We realise that there has been a tremendous increase in the number of people unemployed even though we started off at the end of 1982 with 180,000 people out of work, and that was more than double the number five years before that, and unemployment was rising at almost 40,000 per year then.  This is not the fault of the Opposition.  It is the fault of all of us.  At least the total problem is not the Opposition's fault.  There are contributory factors to that on both sides.  We should accept that and then look for a way out, a way that can be supported by all parties and all sections of the community. That way out should be laid out very clearly over a given period of time and all sections of the community should be asked to support it.</P>
    <P>The Minister has said that he appreciates fully the wide range of influences that affect employment here and, while that is genuine, the flaw is that he and other Members went on to say that they wanted to talk about the annual increase in the number of unemployed.  They spoke about how this had moderated and that there are not so many out of work as had been last year.  However, there are still 240,000 unemployed.  The problem is <Col N="2964" /> that people cannot wait around for that improvement to take place.  In the meantime they are being crucified, hammered and suffering unbelievable hardship.  It is a commonly held belief of economists that it would take a considerable time to turn the tide on unemployment.</P>
    <P>Two approaches have been taken to the solution of unemployment.  One is the payment of unemployment benefit and the second the creation of training schemes such as those provided by Manpower, CERT, ACOT and the VECs. Much mention has been made of that and many thousands have been absorbed into these schemes.  The numbers engaged in special employment training schemes under the Youth Employment Agency grew from 33,000 in 1982 to about 53,000 in 1984 and increased again last year. Among the long term unemployed, there was the social employment scheme which was to provide part time work for one year for those who had been unemployed for over a year and that absorbed 4,000 people.  Then there was the enterprise allowance scheme designed to assist the unemployed to start their own businesses and that absorbed 4,500 people.  That is about the extent of employment creation or absorption of long term unemployed and young unemployed that we were able to manage.</P>
    <P>In the autumn of 1985 in order to boost the construction sector there were announcements such as that the Custom House-dockside area was was being designated for a major redevelopment programme and a wide range of incentives were being made available to stimulate investment in construction.  There was also the institution of an additional programme of inner city development and reconstruction in Dublin city by designating specific areas of the city and making a wide range of incentives available there.  That was also done in Cork and Limerick.  It will be countered that these were not desperation measures but they were necessary measures and were the least that could be expected, given the awful plight of many people. There was the introduction of home improvement grants and of a programme <Col N="2965" /> of improved community and leisure facilities and other general amenities to develop much needed facilities, principally in urban areas.  There were also special grants of up to £30,000 to develop better facilities in hotels and guesthouses, £2 million being made available for this. We had the accelerated development of the national gas grid and the doubling of the number of new employed eligible for aid under the employment incentive scheme.  Then we had the introduction of a scheme of exemption from PRSI contributions by employers for the tax year 1986-87 in respect of additional employees taken on by any private employer between now and 31 March.</P>
    <P>All these schemes are regarded by the Government as imaginative initiatives, wide ranging and a tangible response to the unemployment situation, designed to boost private sector job creation particularly in the construction sector.  My point, sir, with the greatest of respect and in all sincerity, is that, even including the great success of the local authorities' tenants purchase scheme, they are not wide ranging or imaginative enough.  They really only are keeping at bay the dissatisfaction felt throughout the country.  This is borne out by the improvements in the welfare payments which have been made over the past three budgets.  Long term welfare recipients have obtained compound increases in benefit amounting to 27.6 per cent and those on short term welfare benefits got an increase of 24.8 per cent. The long term unemployed got an increase of 32.8 per cent.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has said that we are unique in Europe in that not only have we maintained the value of welfare payments during the present recession but have actually improved them in real terms, so that we have honoured our commitments to the people concerned. But that is the minimum that would have been acceptable to people who are about to scream for help.  Really imaginative job creation programmes are needed now and that is what is missing.  I have not heard anybody come up with solutions. To put things in their proper perspective, in Dublin, which has at least one-third of <Col N="2966" /> the population, we had a student population of 47,000 in 1975 and it is 74,000 in 1983.  There is a very heavy concentration in the 15 to 24 years age group.  There is a 17½per cent rate of unemployment in Dublin compared with 14 per cent in the rest of the country.  There has been a very large increase in the services sector since 1979.</P>
    <P>We have great imbalances in our society.  In part of my own constituency of Ballyfermot, for example, there are 2 per cent self-employed, compared with 11 per cent self-employed in Dún Laoghaire.  There are 21 per cent unemployed among surveyed heads of households in Dublin.  Ballymun has an unemployment rate of 39 per cent, Finglas 25 per cent, Coolock 10 per cent, Ballyfermot 20 per cent, Crumlin 50 per cent among heads of households.  In part of Clondalkin the figure is 60 per cent unemployed.  In very tiny sectors one can get even as high as a 76 per cent unemployment rate.</P>
    <P>The Greater Dublin area has a total labour force of 446,535 according to the 1981 census.  The two main approaches to unemployment have been payment of unemployment compensation and benefits and the creation of special agencies. These have been created to redress the problem of unemployment, but they are not really solving that problem.  The vast sums of money spent in those areas can be only a temporary measure because we are only playing around with the problem.  Many have criticised this approach, saying that we are training people for jobs that are not there.  Dublin has the fastest growing population and is one of the few cities in north-west Europe developing at such a rapid rate.</P>
    <P>I do not think we have tackled unemployment in a realistic way &mdash; I am not sure if we know how to tackle it.  The latest answer of the IDA was to come up with what is called linkage, a term used in the high technology industry.  It may work, but only to a certain extent.  I might add that the IDA were away behind when they concentrated on multinational companies throughout the years and overlooked the importance of small <Col N="2967" /> businesses.  I was criticised bitterly for attacking them four years ago in this repect.  I pointed out that in America 20 per cent of industry was composed of small businesses, and Harold Wilson, as British Prime Minister, was looking in that direction.  The multinationals have been and gone, leaving a haemorrhage behind them which sacrified thousands of our young people, firms like Ferenka, Mostek and others.  We should have been concentrating on building up our small business sector much earlier.</P>
    <P>I am trying to impress on the Government &mdash; I suppose I am only impressing on myself &mdash; how big the problem of unemployment is and what some of the answers might be.  This is the first time since the Famine when we have had our total population together, the young, the old and the people in between.  In the meantime we have had emigration throughout the years, even since the foundation of the State.  We ended up with very few ideas after our experience of the first two decades of independence.</P>
    <P>Earlier in the century we did not have many young people coming up, and if a person were under 60 years he was unlikely to get the top job on a company board.  One had to be close to retirement before one was taken cognisance of. Therefore, there was emigration.  In the fifties we were losing about 40,000 people a year through emigration, about half a million in ten years.  In the sixties the emigration rate was 20,000 a year.</P>
    <P>Recently I heard different people in the House saying that emigration was good, that it should be encouraged because people would go away, get experience and use that experience for the benefit of the country when they returned.  I was about to say that is a lie, but it was noted here already&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamSkelly" hpid="Mr. Skelly Mr. Skelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I will say it is a myth. Encouraging emigration is a theme of the upper middle class who think about their sons and daughters going away for a few <Col N="2968" /> years to spend their time with uncles, have a period abroad paid for, and then return and settle down here.  I would point out that those who need to emigrate do not come back, and it is easy to see why.  They go to live in a different country, in different enviornments, they enter into personal relationships, probably get married and have careers.  Few of them, as few as 1 per cent, come back at all.  We have a highly educated young population coming out of our universities but we still have the dreadful points system in our education system and we know that only the sons and daughters of the professional classes or of the well off get into the universities.  We have a terrible imbalance. I have personal experience of it in my constituency.  For instance, in Inchicore only 1 per cent of the population get third level education and between 26 per cent and 27 per cent of the population in Saint Patrick's and Mountjoy are from there.  In Ballyfermot, again only 1 per cent get a crack at third level education and 17 per cent of the population of Saint Patrick's and Mountjoy come from among them.  I should like to have that reversed, and that is why I do a lot of shouting and complaining here &mdash; that is why I am so unpopular&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>If one is liberal or conservative he is unpopular.  Emigration does great damage to a nation.  Indeed, we have no right to call ourselves a nation if we cannot give career opportunities and proper education to our young people. This is the challenge, the test, of ourselves as a nation, of whether we are fit to rule ourselves.  Some people would like us to take on more than we have now, but to allow emigration to become a sluice gate as in the fifties and sixties would be a recurrence of earlier tragedy. That was the position until the late Seán <Col N="2969" /> Lemass redressed the position.  It was not an answer to our problems.</P>
      <P>It is not acceptable to have teams of economists saying they have it all worked out in regard to expenditure being brought under control, and the balance of payments and our deficit.  Of course if they sit there it might all come right in 20 years.  Those people claim that everybody else is thinking of short term solutions, but I am afraid they themselves do not think very far ahead.  I do not think they will be there when solutions are found.</P>
      <P>We must come up with schemes that are imaginative and courageous if we are to absorb our many young people in work.  We have seen our capital city crumbling around us.  It is in tatters but nothing is being done about it &mdash; we have no solution.  It does not matter which way you dickie around with PRSI or with businesses, asking them to take on more people.  It will not even being to address the size of the problem we have, 250,000 unemployed.  We need to put tens of thousands of people back to work.  The IDA who now occupy a new office building along the canal which cost £26 million are full of people who do not know how to create jobs.  That organisation stopped announcing their job creation figures some years ago.  On the last occasion they made an announcement &mdash; we were told 18,000 jobs had been created in that year &mdash; their figure was out by about 8,000. Later that body announced jobs in a cluster. We were told that 50 jobs were created in a country or 150 jobs between seven different countries.  That does not amount to job creation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have an opportunity to create employment in the country's biggest centre of population, Dublin.  Dublin should not be considered merely as a city on the east coast with a population of 1.5 million.  It should be considered as a city in the midst of 60 million taking into consideration the islands of Britain and Ireland.  The objective should be to turn it into the jewel of these islands, the most attractive city, a shopping-entertainment Mecca that can attract thousands of people for entertainment and shopping. We should be trying to attract tourists <Col N="2970" /> from every centre from Glasgow to London.</P>
    <P>That is not a wild dream because such a project proved very successful in cities in North America.  Those cities created over 50,000 jobs by such projects.  If we had a link between Bord Fáilte, the hotels federation, Aer Lingus and the business and entertainment element, we could put together a package that would attract people from British cities to Dublin for a two or three day stay or a long weekend. If they had a longer holiday they could be enticed to visit areas such as Shannon, Cork or Knock.  They need not necessarily use Dublin Airport and could use the smaller airports around the country. Some people may forget that the best tourists and spenders prior to the troubles were the British.  One difficulty in attracting those people to Ireland again is the fares structure between London and Dublin operated by Aer Lingus and BA. It may be very laudable to help Aer Lingus &mdash; they have been an enormously successful company in recent years &mdash; but if that is done to the detriment of our economy or the business sector it is not a good policy to pursue.</P>
    <P>Mention was made of that in the course of the debate on the Air Transport Bill. The contributions of Deputy O'Malley on that Bill were berated while my own were pilloried because I dared to mention certain things.  I was pilloried also for daring to criticise the sacred cow, the IDA.  However, we must realise that there is no way we can persuade people who can travel from London to Amsterdam for £45 to come to Dublin for £99 or £120.</P>
    <P>I understand that some Dublin hotels offer package deals operating from Belfast for £29 for stays in hotels like the Gresham.  While I accept that many of the steps taken by the Government in regard to the economy were necessary, it appears that we are now throwing up our hands and saying that we cannot do any more, that we must wait until things come right.  That will not happen.  We must remember that people point to our high VAT charges and the high charges all round.  We are not allowing businesses to <Col N="2971" /> use their skills and experience to take advantage of projects such as I outlined. The work being undertaken by Irish businesses, at present could be increased with very little encouragement.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that we could attract tens of thousands of tourists to Dublin if we built up the city using EC grants. Our aim should be to turn Dublin into a tourist, shopping and entertainment centre.  We should build a big complex in downtown Dublin to house sporting events or big concerts.  Such events would fill our hotels and public houses where young people would be employed.  A lot of money would be spent on the construction of such a complex and more employment would be created in glazing, joinery, with builders suppliers and so on.  We need something big and imaginative in Dublin.  That work could be carried out in conjunction with the programme outlined by CIE for a major bus station in the centre of the city.  Taken in conjuction with the tax incentives announced by the Taoiseach for work carried out along the Liffey up to Mountjoy Square those projects would create a great deal of employment.</P>
    <P>I do not think we have come up with a new method of employing the huge number that need to be employed.  We need jobs for up to 50,000 people and, unless we produce an imaginative plan to do that, we are wasting our time and creating tremendous dissatisfaction among our young people.  We must remember that in the fifties those who emigrated were to a great extent uneducated but those who are unemployed now are more articulate.  If they have any sense they will not stand for this.  I do not see why fathers and mothers should have to watch their children emigrate.  I do not see why our people should tolerate failure to the extent that there are not employment outlets for their children.  I would love an opportunity to be able to present employment schemes to the Minister and the Government.</P>
    <P>The only plea I would make, and it is one I have made here on many other occasions, is that they would give us the <Col N="2972" /> opportunity to make those presentations, that they would listen to our ideas. Because the Finance portfolio is such a senior and critical one, it behoves the Minister, and the other Ministers too, to listen to what others have to say.  One often gets the impression that when people are appointed to these positions they get the ideas that they are the only ones who have any contribution to make to the national economy thereby excluding specifically in that context other Members of the House.  I do not know whether this stems from a fear of rivalry. Cabinets are chosen for many different reasons.  There are many different elements involved in the selection of a Cabinet. The members are chosen on the basis of ability, of geographical consideration and of inside track as well as other factors.</P>
    <P>It would be impossible to include in a Cabinet everybody who sits on the Government benches but very often we hear expressions of dissatisfaction from backbenchers on all sides of the House; regardless of who is in Government.  This is because as backbenchers they do not have the means of putting forward their ideas on behalf of constituents.  Therefore, we are left in the position of depending on the Ministers who make up the Cabinet.  This is by no means intended to be an implied criticism.  It is an actual criticism and one that I think I am entitled to make after four years of sacrifice on these benches during which time I have not been given the opportunity of contributing whatever little I may have to contribute. We must sit down together and face this problem and the Minister and his predecessor must be prepared to recognise that we do not have any coherent plan that would result in a solution to our huge unemployment problem. During the past few years I have listened carefully to the various suggestions that have been put forward from all sources and I have not been able to detect any sign of any such plan.</P>
    <P>It is disturbing that the growth in emigration is being ignored in the way in which it was ignored in the fifties.  If the Minister has not done so already, he <Col N="2973" /> might begin by reading John Healy's book which was serialised in <i>The Irish Times</i> in 1967 and which was entitled, <i>No One Shouted Stop</i>.  He was writing about the emigration of the fifties.  At that time there was a level of emigration that was nothing short of a national calamity and scandal.  We should be courageous enough to face up to the full extent of today's emigration problem.  We should be prepared to say that we realise the problem exists and even to give a breakdown of the various categories of people who are about to leave us.  We should say that we are not in a position to do anything about the matter but that we are prepared to listen to anyone who has any concrete suggestions in regard to keeping our people together.  Otherwise, we are doing a disservice to everyone in the community who ticks a ballot paper or even those who in annoyance do not bother to vote.</P>
    <P>I trust that the contributions that are made in the Minister's absence from the House will be brought to his attention and that he will not be like a Minister I overheard once saying that he does not bother reading the speeches made here because they will be summarised anyway in the newspapers.</P>
    <P>I should like to conclude on the remarks I made about unemployment especially in the Dublin area where up to 20,000 or 30,000 jobs could be created. Dublin has the fastest growing population and is one of the few cities in north-west Europe developing at such a rapid rate. The inner city suffers from extreme blight, described as rotting at the heart with decay just where everyone can see it.  The urban sprawl has created major infrastructural problems.  Unemployment is higher in Dublin than anywhere else in Ireland with particular acute levels prevailing in the inner city.  Many of the suburban estates have a prevalence of social and economic conditions reminiscent of those constituting the inner city problem &mdash; high unemployment rates, low levels of skill attainment, large families and overcrowed dwellings.</P>
    <P>Rapid urbanisation and social change have been accompanied by a sustained <Col N="2974" /> increase in criminal activity, most of which is concentrated in Dublin and in the inner city in particular.  Indeed the current crime problem is described by some as more of a drugs problem.  Young people are most vulnerable to exploitation by the increasing sophistication of the drugs industry.  The economic, social and personal cost of alcohol and drug abuse range from health damage, through family and marriage break-up, to criminal involvement and absenteeism.</P>
    <P>The circularity of the problems encountered in Dublin and especially in the inner city draws attention to the areas of poor housing, unemployment, illiteracy, drug and alcohol abuse, crime and violence as well as environmental and cultural deprivation.</P>
    <P>Injection of finance and resources into these areas in a piecemeal way has proved ineffective.  Resolution of the problems calls for an integrated plan to concentrate national and community resources in the most effective and dynamic way.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether my experience is shared by other Deputies but increasingly I am encountering very high levels of poverty in some estates.  I am encountering cases of children being fed on bread and butter alone in instances where the fathers are on the long time unemployment list and in many cases where the home is broken with the mothers being left with up to six children to rear on very small amounts of money.  People in such circumstances cannot make ends meet.  It behoves us not just to take a chance but to do something totally dramatic in order to deal with the unemployment problem and that would not be even touching the tax area.  If there is anything worse than paying high taxation it is to be out of work.  Apart from the effort in the budget to deal with the abuses of the social welfare system, there are many people who are much more miserable than are those who are paying too much by way of taxation.  I am talking about those people who are humiliated and who consider there is some stigma attaching to them by reason of being unemployed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2975" /> The Minister may have to consider providing financial support in many cases for marriages.  I say this because of the many children who are suffering, because of the strain on marriages, the number of broken homes and the total destruction of confidence among the people, factors that are brought about mostly by unemployment. We have to do something about that and the only thing we can do is to create jobs on a massive scale.  Job creation is the one area which we are ignoring and skimming over.  The city plan about which I talked should be seriously considered.</P>
    <P>I do not like some of the things which the Government will attempt to do during the year and I intend to try to talk some sense to the Government especially in relation to the proposal to introduce a national lottery in July next.  Such a move would be a backward step, in effect a tax on the poor.</P>

      <P>When the Minister comes up against problems like the teachers' pay dispute and the closure of Carysfort College he should remember that the Cabinet introduced emergency legislation to legalise gaming or swindling machines which up to now have been illegal. It is still not intended to introduce emergency legislation to ban these machines despite the proposal of the city council and Dublin County Council.  This is an absolute disgrace.  A fraction of the earnings of these illegal operators, if they even paid tax, would pay the total wage increase demanded by the teachers.  The budget has concentrated heavily on curbing abuses in the social welfare system and the tax code.  I do not understand why they have not gone after gaming machine operators.  In case it is not known most of the people operating these businesses are graduates of massage parlours from Northern Ireland who have come down here and made fortunes out of the poor people.  That is the kind of lobby that has been successful in getting <Col N="2976" /> emergency legislation introduced here. Every day that goes by without action on the part of the Government to ban gaming machines is another day of shame on the Government.</P>

      <P>The Government's solutions for unemployment bear out my points.  The solutions to unemployment apparently are social welfare benefits and training schemes.  Of course, we are geting the finances corrected and are keeping expenditure down but nobody has come up with a massive job creating programme.  If we want to save the country from depletion of our young people we must face the unemployment problem.  I would like an opportunity to present employment schemes to the Government.  The Minister should look to other countries where employment schemes have been successful.  We will have failed as a nation if we cannot employ our young population.  We should sort out this problem so that we can stand up with our heads high as one of the successful nations of the world, fit to govern ourselves.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>A budget has been described as a mathematical reflection of a plan.  A plan is the predetermination of a course of action, a course of action designed to attain some goal or address some problem.  The major problem confronting us is the spectre of unemployment. This budget, similar to previous budgets of this unbelievably incompetent administration, does not reflect a plan, not even the plan they adopted in <i>Building on Reality</i>.  To all intents and purposes that has been abandoned.  This budget is another <i>ad hoc</i>, finger-in-the-dyke reaction to a progressively deteriorating economy, fuelled by a Government bankrupt of ideas and mesmerised by their total inadequacy.  Worse, since this budget was introduced three weeks ago the finger in the dyke, being Deputy Dukes as Minister for Finance, has been <Col N="2977" /> changed.  I am in the very awkward position of addressing a budget when the man who introduced it has been recognised by the Taoiseach as being totally inadequate and has been kicked out of his position in the total shambles and panic of what we have had over the last week, the reshuffle of this Government.  Panic is the only word to describe it.  We have an incredible mess from that reshuffle of last Thursday.</P>
      <P>Let us remember last Wednesday and Thursday and put them in context.  Last Wednesday, the Taoiseach went to his Fine Gael Party meeting and announced there would be a major restructuring of the Government.  On Wednesday night, until about 4 o'clock in the morning, the Taoiseach tried to move the Minister for Health, a Minister responsible for major expenditure in this budget.  The Taoiseach could not move the Minister and the Minister for Health is now in effect the Taoiseach.  The Taoiseach, not exercising his constitutional prerogative did not move the Minister for Health who said, &ldquo;I will not go, you must fire me&rdquo;. The Taoiseach did not fire him and we have today a Government being led by a Taoiseach who had neither the guts nor the ability to move the Minister for Health.  The Minister for Health today has a veto on the activities of this Government. The Government are not being led by the Taoiseach, are not being assisted by the Tánaiste because he cannot control the Cabinet members of his own party, but are being led by the Minister for Health who proceeds to announce hospital closure after hospital closure.</P>
      <P>Leaving aside the position of the Minister for Health the Taoiseach in his statement last Thursday said that in relation to the Ministers of State he had today accepted the resignations of Deputy Joe Bermingham from the office of Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Michael D'Arcy from office as Minister of State at the Department of Fisheries and Forestry and at the Department of the Gaeltacht, and Deputy Donal Creed from office as Minister of State at the Department of Education.  He also stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2978" /> The Government today appointed the following Ministers of State to the Departments mentioned with the responsibilities indicated.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach then listed various names. Today he had to come to this House and tell us that he had misled the House.  I quote from his statement:</P>
    <P>In the absence of resignations in writing, the Government today terminated the appointments as Minister of State of Deputies Michael D'Arcy and Donal Creed.  The appointments of Deputies Enda Kenny and Avril Doyle as Ministers of State, accordingly take effect from today's date.  I regret that on Thursday last I informed the House that the two Deputies had resigned.</P>
    <P>That is a lie.</P>

      <P>The reason I mention these appointments is that the budget puts into effect the Book of Estimates and gives the necessary funding and a Minister and a Minister of State carry responsibility for the moneys voted.  It is in the context of that responsibility that I wish to raise some questions.</P>
      <P>In his announcement to the House last Thursday the Taoiseach said he accepted the resignations of the three Ministers of State.  That now turns out to be untrue. In relation to two, if not three, Ministers he said:</P>
      <P>The Government today appointed the following Ministers of State to the Departments mentioned with the responsibilities indicated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to ask a few questions and perhaps the Minister of State present would pass them on to the Taoiseach.  I wish to know if there was a meeting of the Government <Col N="2979" /> last Thursday.  Secondly, since the Taoiseach's announcement last Thursday in relation to the appointment of the three new Ministers of State clearly implied that the appointments took effect from that date and since he has just told us today that the appointments of Deputies Kenny and Doyle take effect from today, is he saying that Deputies D'Arcy and Creed held office until today?  Did Deputies Kenny and Doyle take up their duties on Friday last, even though the Taoiseach now tells us that their appointments took effect from today?  If Deputies Kenny and Doyle took up their duties last Friday, will the Taoiseach tell the House the nature of the official duties carried on by them since last Friday?</P>
    <P>This is very important in the context of the budget because Deputies Kenny and Doyle have responsibilities as Ministers of State for the allocation of funds and the signing of Government orders.  Did those Deputies sign any official documents since last Friday that would have committed their Departments to expenditure of sums shown in the Book of Estimates?  If so, under what authority did they do that?  Will the Taoiseach now correct the situation with regard to any such expenditure?  What official orders were signed and what decisions were taken by Deputies Kenny and Doyle?  I do not in any way cast imputations on the two Ministers involved.  I congratulate them on their appointments and I am not in any way critical of them.  I am critical of a Taoiseach who made a shambles of a reshuffle in a panic response to the opinion polls.</P>

What he is saying now he can say in the debate on the no confidence motion that his party have put down on Thursday and Friday.

      <P>I am quoting the Taoiseach. In the absence of written resignations he had to come here and terminate the appointments of Deputies Creed and D'Arcy.  I am merely asking under what legal authority Deputies Kenny and Doyle operated on Friday and yesterday. I want to know if Deputies Creed and D'Arcy had the power to work in the Department on last Friday and Monday? Apparently it is an embarrassment to the Deputies opposite.  Perhaps if the Minister of State had not lost her telephone numbers a Cabinet reshuffle might not have been necessary.  It was a panic reaction by the Taoiseach to the opinion polls and even that he could not get right. I wonder in what hall in Madame Tussauds he will be put: will it be the Hall of Rogues or the House of Horrors?</P>
      <P>I should like to quote a speech made by the Taoiseach on 7 February 1985 when he was dealing with the 1985 budget.  He said:</P>
      <P>The budget itself represents a watershed. It marks the end of the period of rising taxation and falling living standards forced on our people by the need to pay belatedly for the vast increase in public spending that occurred between 1977 and 1981 and which has now been brought to a halt.</P>
      <P>He continued:</P>
      <P>The fall in employment is now being halted.  It will take some time before rising employment, aided by this Government's special employment measures, succeed in providing sufficient extra jobs to cater for the whole of the annual increase in the labour force.  We are now within sight of a reversal of the rise of unemployment which was launched by the disastrous policies of Fianna Fáil.</P>
      <P>On employment he stated:</P>
      <P>These facts need to be emphasised to counter the gloom being spread by Opposition speakers, whose exaggeration of what is certainly still an unhappy employment situation is spreading despondency among our people ...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2982" /> The Taoiseach went on to say in his budget speech last year:</P>
    <P>The point I want to revert to is that this Government have brought our country successfully through the crisis we inherited in 1981 &mdash; not, of course, that this crisis has been resolved but it has been brought under control.</P>
    <P>A year later we have 240,000 unemployed. The Taoiseach continued:</P>
    <P>No longer do people have to fear that every budget will bring a further increase in an intolerable burden of taxation.</P>
    <P>We know what happened after the 1985 budget.  He went on to say that no longer do they have to watch employment falling and unemployment accelerating out of control.  I would remind the Minister of State and Deputies opposite exactly what has happened during the past 12 months.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach continued:</P>
    <P>The restoration of control is evidenced most clearly by our success in bringing the current budget deficit into line with budget projections.</P>
    <P>Even the Taoiseach does not believe that any more.  We know that he is a very trusting man.  He said earlier that he was at a Government meeting on Thursday but the country at large knows that there was no Government meeting on Thursday. He just ran in here with a list of changes.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach also said that he and his Government had at a stroke rationalised and simplified the tax system in respect of income tax and VAT.</P>

They will have to face the people and Deputy Dowling will be dragged before them.  No matter how much he may bluster in this House, no matter how often the Taoiseach misleads this House, they will not be able to avoid meeting the general public at the ballot box and there they will get their answer.  I will resume my quotation from the Taoiseach's speech:</P>
      <P>Now that this Government, having broken the back of the problem left to them by their predecessors, have been able in the national plan and in this budget to launch the process of recovery, Fianna Fáil have been floundering in their own ineptitude.</P>
      <P>The people made their decision on that in the local elections.  The Taoiseach is a man for quotable quotes:</P>
      <P>After three successive budgets of a radical and imaginative kind, after three years of low inflation rates and of rising employment, with unemployment beginning to fall again as the special measures being introduced by the Government begin to take effect, the electorate in 1987 will respond to good government and to bad opposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no doubt that in 1987 the people <Col N="2985" /> will respond to the sort of Government they have been getting.</P>

      <P>If we have a Minister of State who cannot even hold on to her handbag, she should not be interrupting. The killing level of unemployment is such that it poses a grave threat to social stability. Our trusting, young, well-educated body of unemployed provide all the ingredients of a social time bomb and finding solutions to this dreadful social cancer is an urgent priority.</P>
      <P>The construction industry is the best avenue for creating jobs rapidly.  The multiplier downstream spin-off of activity exceeds that in any other sector.  A further advantage is that construction has a very low import content.  It contributes to capital formation, social stability and provides a prime social need, shelter. Economists the world over have identified construction, particularly the private housing sector, as the major leadinto-slump indicator; equally they have argued that the sector should be encouraged as the lead-out-of-slump motor, something this Government know nothing about.</P>
      <P>I want to say how bad this budget has been for the construction industry.  I will use not just my own words but those of the Construction Industry Federation in a letter sent to all Deputies on 30 January this year which states:</P>
      <P>Dear Deputy</P>
      <P>I would like to advise you of our Federation's acute disappointment that the government has not introduced the range of incentives to boost construction activity which had been proposed by the industry prior to the budget.</P>
      <P>The CIF is particularly disappointed that the Minister for Finance did not reduce the level of VAT on construction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They were referring at the time to Deputy Alan Dukes but he has since changed and we have Deputy John Bruton back in <Col N="2986" /> Finance who, with the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, comprised the winning team which brought this House to a vote which brought that Coalition Government crashing down.  I hope they will be as successful on this occasion.  The letter from the CIF continued:</P>
    <P>The continuing decline experienced by the industry during 1985 which was significantly contributed to by the doubling of the VAT rate in last year's budget will continue to have a negative impact on demand in 1986 particularly in relation to new housing which suffered a 15 per cent decline in new work in 1985.  A reversal of last year's VAT increase to a 5 per cent rate would have provided a major boost to construction activity.</P>

      <P>This Government promised certain things with regard to the construction industry in their dismal grey book, <i>Building on Reality 1985-1987</i>.  For example they said in relation to roads on page 58 of that document:</P>
      <P>The Government have also decided that the economic and social importance of an adequate road network justified accelerated State investment and accordingly State expenditure on road improvements will be as follows over the next three years.  ...</P>
      <P>It went to 1984 as the base year at £101 million; in 1985, £125 million; 1986, £140 million.  What figure is in the Book of Estimates this year?  It is £103 million. These are the Government who said that they recognised the economic and social importance of an adequate road network. They also talked about the employment content of that.  The quotation continues:</P>
      <P>The aggregate provisions for 1985 to 1987 exceed the corresponding provisions contemplated in the 1979 Plan... It is estimated that the proposed level of State expenditure on road improvements and maintenance will result in the following levels of direct employment...</P>
      <P>In 1986 we are supposed to have 5,700 people employed in it, but we cannot because the Government have cut their budget provision to £130 million.  They have cut down the allocation in their dismal grey book, inadequate as it was.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2988" /> On local authority housing this book states as follows on page 113:</P>
    <P>There is a direct link between local authority rent levels and the size of their housing programme, since low rents inflate the demand for local authority housing, discourage tenants from buying their own houses and worsen the burden of ongoing subsidies. Assuming sufficient progress in relation to rent levels, the Government will:</P>
    <P>(a) provide accommodation annually for 9,000 households on waiting lists by building 6,000 new houses a year...</P>
    <P>What do we see in this budget with relation to local authority housing?  On local authority housing if you were going by the budget plan you would be talking about £210 million approximately but in the budget we have a figure of £178 million. Therefore, what is happening to the promise made in relation to local authority housing construction?  Inadequate as it was in this plan, they have even scrapped that to the tune of £25 million or more. They have nearly £30 million less for local authority housing this year than was anticipated in that plan which was published only in the autumn of 1984, and that is from a Government who talk about employment and from a Taoiseach in his speech of February of last year.</P>

I have no doubt that he will jump in and be in there defending the Minister for Education on this one.  I know the Deputy is out there fighting all the time and he will be delighted to do it.  He will be able to attack Gemma now because they got rid of her.  She has been shifted sideways. She has a safe job and she is in there now and she is going to make a grand job of it until she starts to fight with somebody in there and has to be shifted again.  They have a decent man in there, Deputy Paddy Cooney, and I would like to take the opportunity of congratulating him on his appointment.  I know that Deputy Dowling will be delighted to get in and talk about him.</P>
      <P>Regarding the accuracy of these Estimates, I want to talk about the local authority housing subsidies.  A local authority housing subsidy is a figure not related to the expenditure for 1986.  It is directly related to the expenditure in the past number of years, over the years as far as construction is concerned.  The investment by a Government in local authority housing over the last number of years results in a simple mathematical sum.  You have houses built, therefore so much money is owed in housing subsidy. It does not relate to the houses being built this year.  It relates to everything built last year and in previous years.  It is a strict mathematical sum and there is no variation in it, there can be no differentiation in it and there can be no argument about it.  It is a simple sum.  You build so many houses, you owe so much subsidy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2990" /> The Book of Estimates before us shows a figure of about £180 million for the housing subsidy to be paid to the authorities for houses that are already constructed. I have gone through these figures very carefully, having been involved in the Department of the Environment and having been a Minister there twice, and to the best of my way of calculating the figure that should be in those Estimates is approximately £205 million. In other words, the figures there are out by about £25 million.  I would like the Minister to come in here and correct me if I am wrong on that figure and tell me how I am wrong, but in my view this Estimate has been cooked to the extent of £25 million in local authority housing subsidy alone.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me come to the water and sewerage subsidy.  Again it is a simple sum directly calculable on the basis of investment to date in the provision of local authority water and sewerage projects.  This is not in any way connected with work to be done this year. It is related to work already in the ground, such as local authority sewerage and water piping and other projects involved in it.  The figure there is without a shadow of a doubt being cooked to the extent of £6 million.  There is no doubt that the figure shown is not the accurate figure.  It is a serious charge I make and I would like either that I would be corrected in this House or that the figure would be accepted.</P>
      <P>Between those two figures, £25 million and £6 million, in the Department of the Environment alone you are talking about over £30 million which I claim in this House on this budget debate should be shown in the Book of Estimates but is not.  Those figures have been kept out of the Book of Estimates so the percentage current budget deficit can be kept low, as this Government want it to be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as the reconstruction grants are concerned, the figure shown in this Estimate is totally inadequate to cover the applications received up to and including <Col N="2991" /> 7 February of this year of 36,000.  There is only £24 million in the budget to cover these.  Taking an average of £1,000 per application, for 36,000 applications that would amount to £36 million.  I accept that of the 36,000 received so far, perhaps 12,000 will not be approved and that is a large figure.  That brings you down to 24,000 applications.  At the very conservative average of £1,000 &mdash; because some much higher grants will fall to be paid&mdash; that will give, for 24,000 applications, £24 million to be paid out this year.  That is going on a reply I got in the Dáil this week.  If the applications have been coming in at the rate given by the Minister here in the House, there being 150,000 application forms sent out and 36,000 having been received so far, assuming that another 36,000 come back and of that number 12,000 are not accepted, the Minister will be £24 million short by the end of the year on the Estimate shown by the Department.  Take just that figure of £24 million or £25 million &mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>That amount short in reconstruction, £20 million short in local authority housing subsidy, £5 million or £6 million short for the sanitary services. One can see the extent of the interference with the due process of an Estimate by the Government.  On that basis, no wonder the Taoiseach felt it necessary to move the Minister for Finance.  No wonder we have seen the back of the Minister for the Environment, although I wish the man well, he was a decent man in his own way.</P>

      <P>Property has a long gestation period.  It could be five years or more from purchase of a green field to the first house built, during which time the haemorrhage of interest is unceasing. <Col N="2992" /> Private enterprise, particularly the construction sector, accept that the Government are unwilling or unable to solve their problems.  The minimum role that they are entitled to and demand from Government is that an environment of economic stability and confidence should be created and sustained so that the necessary private investment so urgently required takes place.  By contrast with this ideal, the property sector in this little island is so demoralised by the crazy <i>ad hoc</i> changing of the rules of the game by this pathetic Government that the main activity thrust of the large employment generators is now, unfortunately in foreign fields, whether it be Roadstone Cement, McInerney's, Rohan or others.</P>
      <P>Is there not a frightening parallel between the 1973-77 administration when Messrs. Tully, Cosgrave and Richie Ryan virtually strangled the construction industry and consequently the economy? Now the present Government have had the massive outflows of capital and enterprise. What kind of Government have we where enterprise is almost socially unacceptable and entrepreneurs in particular, are treated as pariahs or social lepers?  It is a Government with a philosophy of pseudo-socialism where it is frequently more profitable to be idle than to work, where an increasing number of people are discouraged from working and resentment is shown to those who do work with an aspiration towards a decent return on their efforts and investment. Some of the unbelievable statistics of the construction industry include that 1986 will be the fourth consecutive year of decline, that there has been a 44 per cent decline in the workforce since 1980, 40 per cent of them now unemployed and a 16 per cent decline in the private house-building sector for the first ten months of 1985 <i>vis-à-vis</i> the equivalent period in 1984.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Cement sales, a classic barometer of construction activity, have been declining by 6 per cent to 8 per cent annually for almost five years.  Direct public investment in construction will decline yet again by up to 10 per cent in volume in 1986.  As I have already said, 1985 sees <Col N="2993" /> the new private house completions down to 17,000, compared with 1981 when new house completions stood at 23,000.  Construction suffered from the lunatic doubling of VAT on a sector already on its knees.  It also suffered from inadequate credit and fiscal policies in the subsector of house construction where all involved &mdash; developers, builders, builders' providers and, of course, house purchasers &mdash; are uniquely heavy borrowers. More and more small builders are being forced into the black economy with crazy VAT levels, planning charges, arbitrary development levies and a crippling administrative burden of form filling and revenue returns.  This savage attack on the one area that traditionally can lead the economy out of a slump is unbelievable &mdash; at least it would be unbelievable only that the record of this Government is so well known in that regard.</P>
    <P>Let me talk about the record of this Government.  In 1982 they came into power on a change of Government and the unemployment figure stood at 170,000, an unacceptably high level. They said at the time &mdash; let me remind the House &mdash; in relation to their joint programme, on housing:</P>
    <P>The Government will aim to raise housing output towards 30,000 a year, with sufficient local authority housing to cater for those who cannot, even with the aid of schemes like the Housing Finance Agency, undertake the purchase of their own dwelling.</P>
    <P>Where are the 30,000 houses a year when one considers the figures that I have just given?  By coincidence, I happen to have in front of me, on education&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Col N="2994" /> In particular, education must be made relevant to the world of work and the nature of a rapidly changing and complex society.  Our young people must be trained in the skills necessary to obtain and retain employment, as well as being educated to cope with the demands of modern life.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, the Deputy will have his own opportunity.  I come back to the unemployment situation which was, in 1982 when we left power, at an unacceptably high level of 170,000.  What have we now, in 1986?  Over 240,000 people are now unemployed, compared with that 170,000.  The 1982 figure for emigration was about 2,000 most of them voluntary emigrants.  In 1985 the figure was more than 20,000.  This is the brain drain of the eighties.  Our young people are becoming disillusioned with the system, yet when Deputy Fahey puts down a question to the Taoiseach, the Taoiseach runs away and leaves it to Deputy Barrett, the Minister of State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We hear much from the Government about the national debt being under control. They say Fianna Fáil were borrowers and spenders.  In 1982 the national debt was £1.28 billion and by the end of 1985 it was £2.04 billion, a two-thirds increase. If we look at the current budget deficit, when we left power in 1982 it was £988 million; but by 1985 it had become £1,284 million, up more than £250 million.  And they told us they would get it under control. I remember during the campaigns <Col N="2995" /> for the 1981 and 1982 general election I would be asked at every doorstep: &ldquo;Mr. Burke, will your party get to grips with the current budget deficit?&rdquo;  It had become a cliché.  The Taoiseach told the people that the current budget deficit had reached its limits, that it would be eliminated in five years.  It has gone up to £1,284 million, and even with their cooking of the books it will be still higher in 1986.</P>
    <P>I will look at tax levels.  Earlier I quoted the Taoiseach's speech in February of last year on this subject.  In 1982 tax was 32.9 per cent of GNP; by 1985 it had gone up to 35.6 per cent.  Current expenditure has increased from 47.8 per cent of GNP in 1982 to 48.69 in 1985, gone through the roof because we must look at other figures, like the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.</P>
    <P>Of course, the Government have hit other records, like the rate of business closures.  In 1984 there were 736 such closures and the Government in 1985 succeeded in closing 932 companies, and rising.  The Government were worried about repatriation of profits by the multi-nationals, and so were the Labour Party, and if it were not for Deputy Barry Desmond running the Government the other Labour members might not be there today.  However, in 1982 the multinationals repatriated £500 million profits but in 1985 the figure was £1,200 million.</P>
    <P>The Department of the Environment are a good example of how the targets in <i>Building on Reality</i> are coming out, particularly in regard to borrowing requirements, budget deficits and all the other wearying figures in that discredited document.  The Minister of State, Deputy Nealon, is in the House so I will refer to the local radio Bill.  It is not because Deputy Cluskey sits on the third row of the Government benches that we have not seen that Bill since July last year when the Second Stage debate was adjourned.  It will not be resumed while this Government are in office.</P>
    <P>The Government were not to have any interference in the affairs of semi-State bodies.  We had interference in the RTE <Col N="2996" /> Authority, the position of the Director General; there was interference in regard to the position of the CBF Director.  We do not know where we are in regard to B &amp; I and the Tara-Bula affair.  Our foreign debt in 1982 was £5 billion.  By 1985 it had reached £8.4 billion.</P>
    <P>I will deal with crime statistics.  We have record prison suicides, record prison breakouts and prison drug addiction problems.  Look at the public service pay bill that was to be got under control.  In 1982 the pay bill was £1,982 million and in 1985 it stands at £2,484 million, another growth industry.  We have still another great Government record, the number of empty IDA factories, 336 in 1985.  We have 45,000 people unemployed in the building industry.</P>
    <P>Let us look at the Government's record in regard to farmers, the feed voucher scheme, the nitrogen subsidy scheme, the Shannon relief scheme, tillage relief. Farmers lost £40 million and got £2 million in compensation.  They are being crippled by the Government.  Last year saw a drop of 16 per cent in farm incomes in real terms.  Farmers' real incomes dropped to their lowest level since 1970. All the farmers have got from this Government is a reduction in Government expenditure on agriculture &mdash; underspending on the farm sector of £47 million, with a doubling of the disease eradication levy.</P>
    <P>In 1985 there was no growth in GNP, when it ground to a halt.  All in all, it is a pathetic record.  The budget was introduced by a Minister for Finance who was unceremoniously fired while the debate was proceeding on his budget.  He was replaced by a Minister for Finance who was unceremoniously fired by Dáil Éireann when he brought in a budget imposing VAT on footwear and clothing.  We had the Taoiseach last week misleading the House on the firing of two Ministers of State.</P>
    <P>We have a Government led by a Taoiseach who in 1985 described the budget introduced then as one that had come to grips with all problems and told us that employment was on the increase but we all know that unemployment stands at <Col N="2997" /> 240,000.  There is only one thing for the Government to do, for God's sake get off the backs of the Irish people.  They are clinging to power by their fingernails. The Government are not being led by the Taoiseach from Dublin 4, but by the Minister for Health from Dún Laoghaire. That Minister thumbed his nose at the Taoiseach recently.  The Taoiseach is incapable of carrying out his constitutional responsibilities.  He has reneged on his constitutional functions and is not worthy to rule our country.</P>
    <P>My appeal to the Government is to go. They have lost the support of the Irish people.  According to the latest opinion poll more than 70 per cent of those questioned indicated that they do not have any confidence in the Government.  The Government should go so that the electorate can vote into office a single party Government who will provide stability for the country, who will create a climate for economic growth where investment and profit will not be dirty words.  That single party Government will provide hope and jobs for our young people and proper incentives for the farming and industrial sector.  The Government should go so that the country can continue with the growth experienced under Fianna Fáil.  We can no longer tolerate this discredited Government whose Taoiseach is so dissatisfied with the performance of individual Ministers, even the Minister for Finance, that he has moved them around.</P>
    <P>We should not forget that the Government are led by a Taoiseach who misled the House last week and tried to correct that without a fulsome apology today.  As the Leader of my party said today, he is a Taoiseach who should at the minimum be considering his position rather than flying off to Madame Tussaud's to see himself in waxwork style.  Many people believe that the wax image would be more effective than the real thing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L.T. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity to contribute to the budget debate.  It is important to outline the difficult economic problems the country faces and will have to face for some years to <Col N="2998" /> come.  Our financial position remains difficult particularly with so much money being needed to repay loans that were taken out some years ago.  It is because of decisions to borrow abroad some years ago that certain strait-jacket taxation measures have had to be adopted.  I hope the measures in the budget will in some way loosen the strings on that strait-jacket. We are all aware of the difficulties our people find themselves in and of the fact that unemployment has risen.  We will only surmount those problems if we have collective action by the Government backed up by constructive leadership. Our problems will not be solved by simple rhetoric.  It is my view that some elements in the budget will mean a cash injection into the pockets of many people and that in turn will help to create many extra jobs.</P>
      <P>It must be remembered that the Coalition inherited a difficult financial position. We have had to cope with external factors which were outside our control. We must pay special attention to the fact that there is a clamour for a reduction in taxation.  The taxation benefits in the budget will cost £200 million and represent a shift in emphasis towards indirect taxation.  It is important that we explain to the people that benefits in taxation result in cuts elsewhere in the public service. It is important, as taxpayers demand, that we get better value from money spent.  When we spend public money we should be extra vigilant and more cautious, particularly at a time when money is scarce.</P>
      <P>Before we agree to any spending cuts we should go into all the details and bring forward alternatives or other proposals. The bull in the china shop approach will not have the desired effect or help the public to recognise the need for cuts.  The public realise that in regard to the pay bill for the semi-State sector, and the various Votes for the different Departments, savings can be effected and money better spent.  The method of spending adopted five or ten years ago may not be the best one today.  We must consider the consequences of decisions and have adequate consultations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2999" /> Regarding recent announcements of hospitals closures, while it is clear that some of the changes were already well known, what is important is that available moneys are spent properly in the health services area.  It is important also that any apprehension or fear on the part of the patients concerned or their relatives be allayed and that adequate provision be made for the patients in the areas affected.  One cannot simply move patients overnight without prior adequate consultation.</P>
    <P>Much has been said about the provision of moneys for community care facilities but this is a question also which must be thought through to its conclusion.  It sounds fine to say that patients should be returned to the community.  We hope that in many cases it will be possible to do this but there will also be cases in which such a move would not be feasible.  Those of us who as public representatives are approached regularly by constituents anxious to find places in hospitals or nursing homes for their elderly relatives realise that there are people for whom medical attention is imperative.  I trust that in relation to using available moneys in a more efficient and effective way, there will be full discussion and consultations in the areas in which changes are proposed.  We accept that change is necessary but change must come about only in an orderly manner.</P>
    <P>Regarding the proposed closure of Carysfort Training College, not all the questions have been answered.  The case has been made that the reason for the closure is changing needs, for example, that not as many teachers are required now as was the case some years ago.  We can all accept that.  We can accept, too, that more money may be needed for such areas as in-service training and in other areas of education but no case has been made for closing a training college overnight and for telling those who have served the State well that they are no longer needed.  That is why I say there must be prior and full consultations in relation to all these matters.  A certain element of teacher training should be <Col N="3000" /> continued in a college in which the State has invested large amounts of money. Surely we must not allow the loss to the taxpayer of the large amount of money that was invested in this college several years ago.  I trust that in the coming weeks there will be full discussion on this matter.</P>
    <P>There are unanswered questions in the matter of what is to happen to the staff of the college.  It may be possible to move some of them, if that is what is desired, but people who have given a lot of service to the State and who still have a lot of service to give should not be told suddenly to get out.  There must be adequate alternative proposals fo the use of this college.  We are all aware of the large amounts of money voted for education and we are aware, too, of the need for changes in some areas of the education system, for instance, in that area of pass subjects for the leaving certificate which are a total waste of time and are probably not useful to students leaving school today.  It is important that full discussions take place with the relevant authorities and the Departments concerned and that there be discussion also of such matters as were apparently raised with the Department some time ago but which, possibly because of some internal way of handling matters, were not on the agenda for the meeting concerned.  It is time for a change in the education field.  Perhaps it is time that even the Department look at themselves.</P>
    <P>The money being spent on education should be considered in the context of all areas.  We must ensure that the taxpayer gets the best return possible for his money.  We must ensure that when there is a proposal for a saving in some Department we consider whether there are other areas of that Department or whether there are other Departments where the money could be utilised.  It has not been established in the case of the proposal I am talking of that a large amount of money is involved.  At least, it may not be large in terms of the huge amounts that go into State spending and into the whole of the semi-State sector. All these other areas must be considered. If there is a full examination across the <Col N="3001" /> board, it will be found that savings can be effected in many areas.  In this way there will be a saving to the taxpayer in terms of the transfer of the savings to other areas and this may result also in more efficient State bodies.  It is clear that some of the objectives of the semi-State sector need to be changed.  Some of these bodies were set up ten or 15 years ago but circumstances have changed in the meantime.  At times of scarce financial resources we must use to the greatest advantage possible the money that is available.</P>
    <P>In this budget the Government have gone some way down the road towards bringing about a better balance in the taxation system, towards reaching a stage where there is a reduction in the overall level of taxation.  For instance, the higher rate of 60 per cent has been reduced to 58 per cent and there is an increase also of £100 in personal allowances.  In addition the bands have been altered but a special welcome has been given to the abolition of the 1 per cent levy.  These measures will go some way towards putting money in people's pockets.  In that way they will have some discretion as to where and how they spend that money.</P>
    <P>No doubt there are people who would have wished the Government to go further but the reality is that tax savings have to be made up by way of increases in other areas.  While there has been a shift in the way in which this is done, we must realise that the problem cannot be solved overnight.  Therefore, the Government would have been reckless to have made a drastic and sudden move in an attempt to court popularity.</P>

      <Col N="3002" /> Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>In moving this Bill I want first to explain, for the record, what this Bill represents.  This is a Bill to provide for a referendum.  The purpose of its passage is so that the people of this country may be asked to vote on one basic question. That question is: &ldquo;do you believe that the people you have elected as legislators should be able in certain circumstances to provide for the right of remarriage to couples whose existing marriages are irretrievably broken?&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It is very important that this Bill should be seen for what it is, and no more.  It is a Bill which seeks to give the people the right to choose.  It is no more than that.  The people of this country ultimately are the only ones who can determine a change in our Constitution, and they alone have the right to make that decision. As legislators we have an obligation to place that choice in front of them, and I believe that we have that obligation now.</P>
      <P>I should like to begin, therefore, by outlining the choice that this Bill would put in front of the people.  The Bill proposes: first, that the existing provision in the Constitution, which forbids the Oireachtas from even considering legislation on divorce, should be modified; and secondly, that a new provision should be inserted that would enable the Oireachtas to provide for divorce, subject to certain vital safeguards.</P>
      <P>These safeguards are three in number: (1)  No divorce should be capable of being granted except by courts established under the Constitution; (2)  No court would be empowered to grant a divorce except when it was fully satisfied that it was no longer reasonable for the two partners to a marriage to live together; (3)  No divorce could be granted in any situation where the dependent spouse and children are not adequately catered for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So the Bill proposes to place a choice in front of the people&mdash;a choice between the present situation, where this House <Col N="3003" /> is prohibited from providing real and concrete remedies, even though every single Member of the House is aware of the enormous social tragedy of marriage breakdown&mdash;a choice between this total prohibition, on the one hand, and the possibility that we could provide new hope for the thousands who are trapped in hardship and unhappiness, on the other.</P>
    <P>This Government were given a mandate from the people.  Among other things, their appeal was based on a reforming outlook, a determination to bring our social fabric into the modern age, and to do away with many of the injustices and inequities of the past.  The appeal of this Government also included a willingness, perhaps for the first time in our history, to legislate on behalf of all the people, subject to no denominational constraints.  That appeal was summed up for many in the image conjured up by the phrase first used by the Taoiseach&mdash;&ldquo;constitutional crusade&rdquo;.  But that crusade has faltered.  A relaunch of that crusade, a decision to take our courage in our hands and break out of inactivity, could only be for the better.</P>
    <P>In any event, the mandate this Government have is running out.  Some time within the next 18 months or so this Government are going to leave office.  It is not my purpose here to speculate on whether they will regain office, but it is important to make the point that there are no guarantees.  Above all, there is no guarantee that a Government will exist in this country in the next ten years or more who will be willing to put the choice in front of the people.</P>
    <P>It is clear, therefore, that by failing to move now, we may be consigning to the far distant future the hope of any progress in this area, and all the time the scale of the problem will continue to grow while the hands of the legislators remain tied.</P>
    <P>It is not as if this Bill and this debate were descending on the House like a bolt of lightning.  This subject has been debated for years.  We have all heard in our time contributions to that debate <Col N="3004" /> from politicians, child-care experts, victims of the present situation, churchmen, and many others.  We have discussed the problem of marriage breakdown in this House.  We debated it when the Constitution was first placed before this House almost 50 years ago and on many occasions since.  We have debated it in the community and in the media and in the New Ireland Forum.  We have debated it in this House in Committee and in plenary session.  Most Deputies in this House have enunciated their positions in regard to the problem of marriage breakdown not once, but many times, and still the problem keeps growing, and still the legislators' hands are tied.</P>
    <P>We have debated this issue within our own parties.  My party have a clear and unequivocal policy position in favour of the removal of the constitutional ban and the introduction of divorce in certain clearly defined circumstances.  The Fine Gael Party have, I believe, a similar policy of long standing.  There is no party in this House, as I understand it, who have adopted a contrary policy stance, and no party who regard the Constitution as imperishable and unchangeable.  Yet the problem keeps growing and still the legislators' hands are tied.</P>
    <P>In my view, it is no longer accurate to say the time has come for action.  It is past the time.  The people of this country should have been consulted long before now on this question.  We must accept, I believe, that the time for excuses is past. Even if, as I hope it does, this Bill passes the Second Stage, it will be many months, and much detailed discussion will take place, before it leaves this House.  It must then go through a further process in the Seanad before, finally, the people are asked to make the choice.  All we are asking for now is that we make a start.</P>
    <P>It has been implied that moving this Bill &mdash; even voting on this Bill on Second Stage &mdash; in someway pre-empts the necessity for, and the possibility of, further consultation, particularly with the Churches.  I want to make two points in relation to this: first, it is clear from what I have said already that I do not believe that further consultation is necessary.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="3005" /> However, I believe that there is nothing in what we are doing which precludes the possibility of any further negotiation or consultation that any see as desirable. Nor is there anything in what we are doing which necessarily pre-empts the outcome of such consultations.  I should like to elaborate on these two points, first, the question of the necessity for further consultation.</P>
    <P>It is normal in any democracy &mdash; and right that it should be so&mdash;that those who have an interest in any situation should be consulted when change is proposed.  The process of change is always going to be more successful and beneficial when those who are likely to be affected by change are persuaded that change is right and necessary.</P>
    <P>I believe that where this question of marriage breakdown is concerned, the Churches, who act as agents of the State in respect of many marriages, must be consulted about the implications of proposed changes for their role and functions.  They are not alone in this. Many other agencies and individuals, particularly those who come face to face with the consequences of marriage breakdown, would have a great deal to offer in any consultative process also.</P>
    <P>These consultations have, in fact, already taken place at great length both in the New Ireland Forum and before the joint committee.  To repeat these consultations yet again gives rise to the suggestion that nothing more is intended other than a delaying tactic.</P>
    <P>What we are asking the House to do in this Second Stage debate is to decide in principle that legislation is necessary to give the people a choice.  This brings me to the second point I made about the process of consultation, namely that, whether or not I believe it is necessary, I do not believe there is anything in what we are asking the House to do which would preclude or pre-empt consultation.</P>
    <P>The process on which we are embarked in this debate is a very particular one under the Standing Orders of this House. Unlike normal legislation, this Bill, if it passes Second Stage, will be referred to a special or select committee.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="3006" /> In other words, if the House agrees to Second Stage, the House will be deciding in principle that some legislation in this area is desirable, and the House will further decide that it will be a matter for a special committee to decide the final shape of that legislation.  I understand that that committee could be an existing committee, such as the Committee on Legislation; or a committee established especially for the purpose; or indeed, a committee of the whole House.  It will also be a matter for the House to decide when and how often that committee should sit, and for how long.</P>
    <P>I want to give this solemn assurance to the House: we are seeking the maximum support on Second Stage, and in return we will facilitate the work and deliberations of that special committee to the maximum possible extent.</P>
    <P>Indeed, we would welcome the fullest possible deliberation of this whole issue in such a committee.  We do not regard ourselves as possessing the only truth in this matter.  For example, it may well be that Deputies would like to see further safeguards written into the legislation&mdash; there could be no better opportunity than the work of such a committee for this exercise.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, we see no reason why the work of that committee could not be undertaken in parallel with any consultations that were taking place outside the House&mdash;such overlapping deliberations would inform each other, rather then pre-empt each other.  The consequence, I have no doubt, would be better legislation, to which every Member of this House would have an opportunity to contribute.</P>
    <P>I would ask the House to remember this&mdash;we are not in a position, because we are a relatively small number of Deputies, to curtail any debate in the House on this Bill.  A Government with an overall majority can take the view that it will only accept amendments that suit it; but from the perspective of the whole House and of individual Deputies, it is one of the virtues of our minority position that we are dependent on Deputies' support. Therefore each Deputy has a guarantee <Col N="3007" /> that his views must be taken seriously into consideration in arriving at a completed Bill.</P>
    <P>So, not only are we not precluding consultation; we are guaranteeing that the views of every Member of this House will carry equal weight, no matter how those views might be informed.  The legislation that will emerge from this process will, in so far as we can ensure it, reflect a consensus of the House on this widespread social problem.  I turn now to the need to deal with marital breakdown.  It would be possible, in the circumstances that have surrounded this whole issue, to conduct this debate entirely about politics, tactics, and the like.  To do so would be to forget what the debate is about. This Bill sets out to deal with a human problem of enormous proportions, and it is that human problem I now wish to address.</P>
    <P>The problem of marital breakdown and its consequences has been inadequately documented in our society.  It is a problem that has long been side-stepped, and the result is that there is no one in this House who can place before us all the relevant statistics, so as to put beyond any doubt or discussion, the scale of the tragedy and the urgent need for remedy.</P>
    <P>Why should this be so?  Why should this be the only country in the developed world where there is no accurate and reliable index of such a troubled issue? In part, no doubt, it has to do with the kind of society we are, a society where the importance of marriage as a symbol of one's place in society has always been real.  In part, of course, it has to do with the Judea-Christian ethic which rightly lays great stress on the permanence and sacredness of marriage.</P>
    <P>In part, too, there has been fear of this whole subject &mdash; a fear that even the admission that marriages do break down will lead in some way to the undermining of the family and to the beginning of the end of society.</P>
    <P>So I cannot say that there are 50,000 or 100,000 families suffering from marriage breakdown.  The definitive statistics are simply not available.  But I can say that <Col N="3008" /> the number of such families is large and that it is growing, and that the consequences involve pain, suffering and hardship for a great many people.</P>
    <P>We have the evidence, after all, of the many experts who testified before the Oireachtas committee.  We know the experiences of the individuals and groups who work on a day-to-day basis with families in distress.  We know the views of the pressure groups campaigning for change.</P>
    <P>But when it comes down to it, we do not need all of this information, because everyone of us in this House knows of the problem.  We meet it every day in our clinics, in our contact with ordinary people, in our constituencies and among our friends and relatives.</P>
    <P>We may not have definitive statistics on the number of people whose spouses have divorced them abroad and remarried, but we have all seen it happen.  We may not have definitive statistics on the number of women and indeed men who have been deserted and have been made dependent on inadequate levels of social welfare, but we have all seen it happen. We may not have statistics on the number of people who have been subjected to violence, both physical and mental, by their spouses, or how many women have needed medical care as a result; but we know it happens.  We may not have statistics that tell us the exact number of children who are brutalised as a result of violence from one or other parent, but we know it happens.  We may not have statistics that tell us the number of homes that have been wrecked by alcoholism, by cruelty, by brutality or by sheer daily misery; but we know it happens.</P>
    <P>We all know that there are countless problems that can be realistically addressed without the need for divorce, but countless more where no remedy other than divorce is possible.</P>
    <P>Opponents of divorce in any circumstances often refer to the alleged adverse affects of divorce on the children.  However current research from developmental psychology indicates that more damage is done to a child who is reared in an atmosphere of conflict, than to a <Col N="3009" /> child who experienced a stable relationship with at least one person.  Research has also shown that it is advisable in considering the mental health of a child to terminate a sick relationship rather than perpetuate it.</P>
    <P>As legislators, we know too the many anomalies in our present law which give rise to the hardship and injustice.  The major anomaly concerns the area of nullity and illegitimacy.  The courts have recently developed a slightly more liberal trend in broadening duress as a ground for nullity of marriage.  This liberal trend derives from the constitutional prohibition on divorce.  In a recent Supreme Court judgment, Mr. Justice Henchy conceded that non-viable marriages have on occasion been declared null on a humane interpretation of the doctrine of duress.  It seems clear that the absence of a divorce jurisdiction has led the courts to try to extend the law of nullity instead.</P>
    <P>This is clearly unsatisfactory.  The burden of law reform should rest squarely here in this House.  We will just have to put aside the sham and the fiction once and for all and recognise the fact as the <i>Irish Law Times</i> editorial points out this month that &ldquo;the quality of matrimonial relationships is a matter which falls primarily within the province of divorce&rdquo;&mdash; not nullity.</P>
    <P>The &ldquo;humane interpretation&rdquo; of the courts referred to by Mr. Justice Henchy has not unfortunately until now been reflected by humane legislation in this House on this issue.  However, the House does have an opportunity in this Bill &mdash; probably a last opportunity for a long time &mdash; to take the first tentative steps towards redeeming this situation.</P>
    <P>We know that without the possibility of divorce there are thousands of people trapped in hopeless situations.  All of the changes that we want to make, in situations where nullity is concerned, and in relation to illegitimacy, are hollow unless we are prepared to tackle this one major issue.</P>
    <P>All of us in this House, share a commitment to parliamentary democracy.  All of us share experiences of social realities. We are all familiar with the existence of <Col N="3010" /> injustice: all motivated by an awareness of hardship, of poverty, of inequality and of lack of opportunity.  Therefore we must each accept that our task as legislators is to work for the removal of these injustices.  We must do so whether or not those who are affected by injustice are Catholic, Protestant, Jew, or of another denomination, or of no denomination.</P>
    <P>We must do so while protecting the right of individuals to follow the dictates of conscience.  The Churches always have, and must always have, the right to inform conscience, to guide and to lead individuals in the exercise of that conscience. We cannot interfere in that process because by doing so we would be removing a basic human freedom.  Thus, nobody in this House could, or should, be under any illusion.  The solutions that we propose to any social problem must be compatible with the needs of individual conscience.</P>
    <P>We do not propose this Bill on the basis that divorce is desirable.  Divorce is no more desirable than broken marriage.  Of course, we would all prefer a situation where the consideration of divorce was unnecessary, where marriages never died, where the stresses and strains which can lead to crisis in families never arose but to believe that the situation is the way we want it to be is to delude ourselves. Marriages do die, irretrievably and irrevocably and the consequences of that must be faced.</P>
    <P>It has been said before, and I believe it is worth repeating, that divorce bears the same relationship to marriage as a funeral does to a death.  I do not believe that the mere existence of divorce is likely to increase the incidence of broken marriages but I do accept that without care a situation could arise where because divorce is too convenient marriage itself could become a convenience.  We have to take care to avoid this.  If we accept, as we do, that the family is a vital and fundamental unit in our society, we must protect it but not by forcing people to live together who can no longer reasonably be expected to live together and who have not lived together for years.  We are not protecting the family by trapping people <Col N="3011" /> in situations where poverty, hardship and violence are daily realities.</P>
    <P>The word &ldquo;family&rdquo; is much discussed in the context of the Constitution and the debate on marital breakdown.  We should analyse what we mean by this word. Taking a typical situation where a couple has separated and one or both have formed permanent and stable relationships with other people &mdash; perhaps having children of this second union &mdash; which is the &ldquo;family&rdquo; that we seek to protect or validate?  Is it the original marriage &mdash; obviously finished forever &mdash; or is it the one or two permanent and long term relationships subsequently established and enduring?</P>
    <P>In my view the need to protect the family is entirely compatible with a carefully prepared approach to divorce.  Such an approach would only allow divorce within certain parameters and it would inevitably place a heavy burden on those seeking divorce to show that their case falls within those parameters.  The grounds on which divorce could be granted would have to be stringent and I would hope that as this debate develops it would be possible to reach a consensus among us on what those grounds should be.</P>
    <P>We cannot continue to ignore a reality which I believe is ignored by those who argue that any divorce law would open up the floodgates.  That reality is that even though we have never permitted divorce we have never been able to prevent the death of marriages.</P>
    <P>We are all, of course, aware of the argument that the availability of divorce legislation undermines family life and consequently hits at the moral and social fabric of society.  In fact divorce itself is not the cause of these problems, though it may be the end product of marital breakdown.  The nearest divorce jurisdiction is in Northern Ireland and an examination of the divorce statistics there shows that the availability of divorce there has not caused any significant undermining of family life in Northern Ireland.  Over the past four or five years <Col N="3012" /> the number of divorce decrees granted shows a slight decline.</P>
    <P>In moving this Bill we are arguing that the time has come to place a choice in front of the people.  The choice we are proposing can be summarised this way: we believe that the people should be offered the opportunity of removing the present total ban on divorce from the Constitution and replacing it with certain safeguards within which the Oireachtas would be empowered to legislate for divorce.</P>
    <P>We are arguing also that this Bill is timely, indeed that is past time, because the incidence of marriage breakdown is such that we are dealing with a major human tragedy.  Thousands of people, adults and children, are trapped within marriages that have long ceased to be anything but vehicles for hardship and suffering.</P>
    <P>We believe that if we fail to act now the opportunity may not exist again for many years.  We believe also that there is an expectation that this Government will have the courage to do what has not been done&mdash;to lead and develop the debate, so that public opinion will have confidence in a careful and caring solution.</P>
    <P>We have argued that the moving of this Bill can result in the establishment by the House of a special committee to finalise the shape of legislation and that we would welcome and co-operate with such a development.  For that reason, we do not believe that we will be pre-empting any consultations considered necessary outside the House.  We believe that it is possible to legislate in this area without infringing the right of private conscience and we do not accept that legislation which is carefully constructed would damage the family.</P>
    <P>The moving of this Bill places the debate about marriage breakdown in a concrete context.  Many, if not most, of the Members of this House have set out positions in the debate but so far that debate has been conducted in an abstract way.  I appeal to every Member over the next week to consider carefully the arguments for supporting this Bill.  The <Col N="3013" /> hardship that marriage breakdown generates can no longer be ignored and the right of the people to this referendum must be paramount.</P>
    <P>For all of these reasons, I commend this Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>A proposal to amend the Constitution is a very serious matter with grave and long term implications for the people as a whole and for society.  For this reason referenda to amend the Constitution are prepared by a Government only after mature and responsible consideration. Fianna Fáil are not opposed to the holding of a referendum on divorce but this must be done following a Bill sponsored by the Government as a whole.  We will give constructive consideration to any mature and complete proposals when the Government bring them before the House.  We will then as a party take a responsible and caring decision on this matter.</P>
      <P>The Labour Party amendment does not have the support or authority of the Government of which they themselves are an integral part.  The wording in their Bill is vague, uncertain and inadequate. It would provide for divorce on demand and would offer only a token gesture towards dependent children, with no real protection for them.  The first family could become a constitutional orphan stripped of family rights.  It is outrageous that the Labour Party who share in Government should abuse Private Members' time for such an important question.  It highlights their frustration with the Taoiseach and their other Cabinet colleagues when they resort to such cynical backroom tactics as this.  It is clear that the Taoiseach is dragging his feet on the referendum which he promised.  He is attempting to sit on two horses as they struggle to go in different directions. Both the Oireachtas and the people deserve a more responsible approach by the Government to such an important social and constitutional question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill to amend the Constitution is presented by the Labour Party and put forward in Private Members' time because it did not have the support of the <Col N="3014" /> Government of which the Labour Party is an integral part.  The extraordinary and somewhat ridiculous situation places the Opposition&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in an unprecedented position.  The Labour Party have obviously not been able to convince the Government that this Bill is worthy of support, yet they seek to usurp the function of the Cabinet and place their divorce Bill before the House.  We know that the Labour Party have a controlling interest in this Government and can enforce their will on the Government if they so wish.  Only last week the Taoiseach had to capitulate when a Labour Minister usurped his constitutional function and insisted on having his own way. The Minister for Health, Deputy Desmond, with the support of the Tánaiste and Labour Party Leader, Deputy Spring, forced the Taoiseach to comply with their wishes where the placement of the Minister, Deputy Desmond, was concerned.  Could the Labour Party not have done the same with such a major constitutional proposal?  Would the Taoiseach not have been forced to support such a Bill at Government level and to consider seriously its framing and implications? There can be no doubt that if the Labour Party had pressed their Bill at the Government table the Government would have had to accept it or face an election.  Do the Labour Party believe in their own Bill or is it presented just for the cosmetics and media kudos?  It is evident that they do not believe in it and the House is being used purely for the purpose of hypocritical posturing and publicity. If the Labour Party and the Government think that they can gain media kudos and popularity by playing ducks and drakes with this issue, they must have a very low and cynical regard for the media.  I do not believe that the media will fall for such cynical tactics designed to throw a smokescreen over Government vacillation and indecision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Labour Party's role in presenting this Bill on such a major constitutional <Col N="3015" /> issue in Private Members' time is therefore less than honourable.  If the Labour Party had the political conviction to put this Bill before the Government then it would have had to be considered seriously by the Government before being presented to this House.  They have shown a lack of commitment to their Bill and a lack of faith in the Cabinet by the manner in which they are proceeding. Deputy Taylor made it quite clear that he was not particularly convinced of the suitability of the process being used in Private Members' time and he tried to impress on us all that if we accept this as merely introducing the Bill in principle we can all agree that it should go to a select committee.  Debate at a select committee would be limited to a Committee Stage debate and would lack the adequate discussion and presentation of views which can take place in this House in the normal process of a Bill.  In the circumstances it is impossible for the public, let alone the Opposition, to establish where the Coalition stand on this question&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>It is difficult to understand where the Deputy stands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and to respond accordingly.  Fianna Fáil are not opposed to the holding of a referendum on this important question.  We regard it as a major constitutional matter which deeply affects the lives, Welfare and common good of our people.  Accordingly we want to see the Government's proposals to amend the Constitution so that we can put forward our constructive and considered views on the Government proposals. It was in this spirit that Fianna Fáil supported and participated in the work of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown.  This committee gave serious consideration to divorce and to the whole complex area of marriage and the protection of family life in modern society.  The Government, having had the introduction of divorce as part of their election programme, said they wished to await the report of the <Col N="3016" /> joint committee before bringing forward their own Bill to amend the Constitution. We gave our total commitment to that committee and the Government received their comprehensive report almost a year ago in March 1985.  The Government made a great deal of play about the urgency of getting this report so that they could proceed with their plans to draft and prepare the wording of a constitutional amendment.  Nevertheless, after further manoeuvring the Government wanted a debate in the Dáil on the report before any decision was taken on it.  That purposely prolonged debate concluded last month.  The Taoiseach now says that he wishes to become involved in a process of discussion and consultation before bringing forward his proposals.  Even this process has not begun yet.  Deputy Taylor said that in his view there had been enough discussion and sufficient presentation of views through the New Ireland Forum and the joint committee.  Views are well known but still the consultation process is what the Taoiseach puts before us and even this process, we understand, has not yet begun.</P>
      <P>So far the Government have failed to live up to their responsibility and produce their own proposals.  If a referendum is to be held the people must have an opportunity to consider all the issues involved, including the nature and extent of the proposed changes, both constitutional and legislative.  In such circumstances it is incumbent on the Government, with all the legal and other resources at their disposal, to produce an appropriate provision for amending the Constitution, along with detailed legislation setting out the scheme under which the law would operate.  This is necessary to give the people a full understanding of the choices and the decisions they have to make. Deputies on all sides of the House agree that the people should be given a full and clear understanding of the choices and decisions they would have to make. These should be set out, debated and discussed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The wording of a Government proposal would be crucial.  It would propose <Col N="3017" /> to amend the Constitution for the foreseeable future.  This would have a major impact on future legislation in this area. It would affect family rights profoundly and would be interpreted by the Supreme Court over the years to come.  In our view, therefore, it must be afforded the whole process of debate in the Dáil and in the Seanand.  It is not sufficient to put a Bill of this kind into Private Members' time with the limitations which apply there and even to suggest then that there would be a very open approach on Committee Stage, because we would be limited in a Committee Stage debate in any event at that time.  What is important at this stage is that the Government with their law officers and the experience they have in the whole area of preparation of legislation and in the social area should give their attention to the wording of the proposed amendment.  I do not criticise Deputy Taylor and his colleagues for coming up with some form of amendment of their own.  I know they have not available to them the full legal backup, support, drafting and consideration which would be available to the Government in dealing with such a measure.</P>
    <P>This measure must, therefore, be afforded the full process of debate in the Dáil and the Seanad.  That is why we say that the Bill is inappropriate.  We are presented with a Labour Party Bill cobbled together in some party backroom and introduced into the Dáil by the back door of Private Members' time which is totally inadequate from a Government party who seek serious consideration of such a fundamental proposal to amend the Constitution.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party Bill now before the House lacks the benefit of the advice available to the Government and the whole legal and social analysis which normally preceeds the presentation of such an important measure in Dáil Éireann. This creates a further difficulty for the Opposition in that the Bill has not the certainty or authority of a Government measure.  Yet it is presented by one of the Government partners without the application of these normal and rigorous legislative standards and tests.  In these <Col N="3018" /> extraordinary circumstances it falls to the Opposition to raise some of the questions which must be asked about the Labour Party's Bill to amend the Constitution.</P>
    <P>The amendment is drafted in such broad terms as to permit the introduction of divorce on demand and also the provision of quickie divorces.  Even those who campaign for divorce in Ireland agree that they want protection against such a development.  The Oireachtas joint committee were unanimously opposed to such an outcome.  Consequently the wording of the proposed amendment would have to be such that it would prevent that situation from developing.  That was seen to be the view of all those who seriously considered the need for a referendum and for change in this area but, as we see it, the present proposals have that defect.</P>
    <P>The language of the draft Bill is such as to permit one of the partners to a marriage to terminate a marriage unilaterally for the worst of motives notwithstanding the wishes of the other party to the marriage or the adverse effects on dependent children.  The drafters of the Bill by leaving Article 41.1.1º in place, which gives the family &ldquo;inalienable and imprescriptible rights, antecedent and superior to all positive law&rdquo;, and by repeating Article 41.3.1º, which describes the family as an institution based on marriage, in the text of the proposed amendment have provided that the powerful protection given by Article 41.1.1º to the family, where a real marriage follows a divorce, must be taken away from the first family and given in its entirety to the second family.  In other words Article 41.1.1º, which should be a protection for the first family, becomes an instrument for their oppression.  The benefits that flow from Article 41.1.1º are withdrawn and switched to the remarried family or families.</P>
    <P>The State discharges its obligation under Article 41 to the first family in a variety of ways.  These include the benefits of being married, for example, in social welfare legislation, in succession and in the tax laws.  The family in question is the family based on marriage and, since <Col N="3019" /> the first marriage is to be dissolved the benefits go to the second family, and the first family then have no constitutional rights under Article 41.  They will depend on the goodwill of the Government of the day.  Indeed, Deputy Taylor pointed this out to us when he said it should be left in the hands of the legislators of the day.</P>
    <P>The first family becomes, therefore, a constitutional orphan even if the State were disposed to be evenhanded in its treatment of the first family.  Members of the second family could with the backing of the Constitution make claims for priority or perference over and against the first family since the inalienable and imprescriptible rights would be transferred to the second or subsequent families. The Labour Party have left this very strong protection for the family in the section on the inalienable and imprescriptible rights.  Article 41.1.1º of the Constitution provides that:</P>
    <P>The State recognises the Family as the natural primary and fundamental unit group of Society, and as a moral institution possessing inalienable and imprescriptible rights, antecedent and superior to all positive law.</P>
    <P>That is left in this amendment proposal but, at the same time, the family is still described as the family based on marriage. Therefore, those rights would transfer to the family based on the remarriage.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party's Bill does not provide protection for the children.  It provides only a token gesture towards the children by stating that the interests of dependents must be satisfied &ldquo;in so far as is just and practicable&rdquo;.  Thus the children would become pawns in post-divorce negotiations.  The proposed amendment clearly subordinates the rights and welfare of dependent children of a marriage to the right of either of the parents to a divorce, notwithstanding that this may be brought about solely by the unilateral wish or misconduct of one of the parents. Provisions like this have been included in <Col N="3020" /> divorce legislation in most other jurisdictions and have proved to be useless as a protection for children against the irresponsibility of one or other parent who is determined to bring the marriage to an end.</P>
    <P>This is so in this Bill because clearly the right of one parent to a divorce prevails over the right of the other spouse and their children.  It is noteworthy that in Britain and the US most dependent children of dissolved marriages end up on social welfare.  We would like the Government in coming forward with proposals to try to tackle this problem which is known to exist elsewhere and try to come up with wording and phraseology which will provide better protection for the children than we see in other jurisdictions, and in our view this has not been done in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Last Sunday the Tánaiste said on radio that under this proposal divorce would not be granted to one party unless there was adequate protection for the interests of the other spouse and children.  For the reasons I have outlined this comment is ill-informed and misleading.  The amendment clearly intends that divorce will be granted and these interests protected so far as is just and practicable only.  Our advice is that if it is not practical to protect their interests, then divorce as contemplated in the amendment will proceed leaving the spouse and children unprotected. The text of the proposed amendment is vague and inadequate.  It refers to the breakdown of marriage without defining it.  This is a vague concept unknown to the law and lacks any legal meaning.  In the context of marital difficulties, it has no meaning which would enable a clear constitutional interpretation to emerge.  The drafters of the Bill must themselves lack confidence in its meaning.  They include the term &ldquo;clear breakdown of marriage&rdquo; as if this gave some added meaning to the term.</P>
    <P>The proposed Bill also offends against the principle of private international law whereby dissolutions of marriage granted in a foreign country to persons domiciled in that country are recognised within this jurisdiction.  Under our present law, a <Col N="3021" /> marriage which has taken place here may be dissolved in accordance with the laws of a foreign country if the parties to that marriage are domiciled in that country. If the Labour Party amendment became part of the Constitution, such dissolutions would no longer be recognised under Irish law.  This is a typical example of the kind of deficiency that can arise when amateur and hamfisted attempts are made to change a law as fundamental as the Constitution.</P>
    <P>These are some of the more obvious criticisms and limitations of the Bill. Taken as a whole, the Bill is an inadequate and incomplete response to this important constitutional question.  If the people are to be asked to decide whether divorce should be introduced, then this is not the way to do it.  Have the Government even asked the Attorney General to advise them on the implications and wording of this amendment?  If so, what are his views and if not, why not?  This leads me on to ask the Taoiseach to state the Government's view on this Bill as arrived at in accordance with the principle of collective responsibility enshrined in the Constitution.  He may have to confess to this House that the Government have no view.  If so, this demonstrates the very shoddy level to which Government have come.  It must be unprecedented in the history of the State for a Bill which proposes to amend the Constitution of that State to be debated in the Dáil without the Government submitting their considered view of the position. It demonstrates the Government's contempt for their own constitutional function, for Dáil Éireann and, ultimately, for the people as a whole.</P>
    <P>The proper way to exercise the responsibilities of Government is not to introduce inadequate legislation, however well intentioned, through the back door. The Government as a whole should make a decision whether a referendum should be held.  If so, they should bring comprehensive proposals before the Oireachtas. We in Fianna Fáil will give constructive consideration to any mature and complete proposals which the Government bring forward.  We will seek <Col N="3022" /> to promote public debate on such proposals in a positive, caring and responsible manner.  We will do this with a view to establishing and promoting the common good in this important area.  Indeed, in that context I would refer to Deputy Tayior's comments emphasising just how important this matter is to the people at this time, how important it is that it be considered and that an adequate proposal would be prepared.  He does not claim that this wording is the most suitable and in that respect I would have to agree with him.  The process for doing this is for the Government to come forward with their Bill even at this late stage.  I know that Deputy Taylor and the Labour Party members &mdash; who are here in great numbers tonight for this Bill&mdash;are quite worried that, as Deputy Taylor said, Government time is running out.  The Deputy is concerned that the Government may not be prepared to go ahead with an amendment.  If he is, I would suggest that he get his party Leader and the other Members representing the Labour Party to go to the Cabinet and demand that a wording prepared by the Government be brought before the House in the near future.</P>
    <P>As I have said, we are not opposed to the holding of a referendum but a whole year has gone by now.  Look at all the criticism which the Government heaped on the joint committee for what they regarded as delays in reaching their decisions and in bringing forward their full report.  This work was done in very good time, given the complexity of the matters before the committee and the fact that the first six months were lost by virtue of the staff not being appointed to the committee, in any event.  Leaving all that aside, the committee, in which we participated fully, did their work and brought their report before the House.  That report has been with the Government for almost a year.  Surely they have had time to prepare a suitable wording?</P>
    <P>When the Government asked us to come and spend week after week here discussing and debating the report, we came and gave our views.  I then pointed out that the joint committee considered <Col N="3023" /> that they had neither the expertise nor the time to draft a referendum proposal. It was the all-party view at that time that this was a matter which required the expertise of the law officers and the drafting facilities and support which a Government have in putting forward a suitable referendum wording which would go as far as it could to meet the requirements envisaged by Members in the House when they spoke on both sides during that debate and by the views which have been expressed outside the House. It is the task of the Government now to come up with this wording.  I pointed out then that it was seen as a task for the Government, with their legal back-up and constitutional expertise.  I said that the next step was for the Government to take, that they must now prepare the proposed wording for the referendum which they are recommending.</P>
    <P>We, as the Opposition, await that wording.  We have said that it must make clear two things&mdash;first, the nature and extent of the constitutional amendment which they propose and the degree of protection which would be left for the family and, secondly, the form of divorce legislation which the Government have in mind following a referendum.  These must be set out clearly for the people in advance, so that they can be debated openly, not by any slipshod or half measures. However frustrated the Labour Party may be in the present position in Government, that is not an adequate way to come before the House with a proposal to amend the Constitution.</P>
    <P>There were, as has been pointed out, a number of areas in which the committee had unanimous support and agreement. These were matters like mediation services, a family court, updating of the law on nullity and on legal separation and a whole variety of other things.  These should have been under way and could have been from last March.  They, too, would have the full support of the Opposition. We would come constructively to meet the Government on these matters. As I have pointed out, this is a matter which calls for responsibility, concern <Col N="3024" /> and caring on the part of Members on both sides of the Houses.  It was very clear that these matters should be installed and in place and operating before divorce legislation would come into operation. That was clearly the intention of the joint committee and they were very explicit about that.</P>
    <P>I have set out as clearly as I can our position in relation to this Bill.  We are not against the holding of a referendum in this area, but want to see the Government's proposals.  We will give them full, responsible and very caring consideration, once they are put on the table.</P>

      <P>This Bill is a Private Members' Bill brought forward under a procedure provided for in the Standing Orders of this House.  For Deputy Woods to suggest to this House that this is in any way unprecedented or contemptuous of debate or of the people seems to me to be a scandal.</P>
      <P>Deputy Woods said a few moments ago that the opposition found themselves in an unprecedented situation. I asked myself what is unprecedented about a debate on a Private Member's Bill under procedure provided for in the Standing Orders of the House?  What is unprecedented about a situation in which Members of this House are faced with the issue of making up their minds on how to go about dealing with that issue? I can see nothing at all unprecedented in that.  Neither can I see anything unprecedented in the reaction of Deputy Woods to it.  He has followed his usual line: when you meet an issue with a choice to be made, you throw a few platitudes at it and lob in a few innuendoes for good measure, like his use a few minutes ago&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>If Deputy Woods finds that unprecedented he must have been asleep for more years than I have been a Member of this House.  I had not intended to make remarks like that in the context of this debate but I confess to having been prompted by the waiting tiddler over there in that approach to this.</P>
      <P>I agree with a great deal of what Deputy Taylor has said and a great deal that is in his motivation for doing this.  But I oppose this Bill not because I believe we should not have a referendum but because I do not think, for reasons I will outline in a moment, that this is the moment for us to be discussing a Bill of this kind in the House.  For some time we have been conducting a debate on an issue that is of very considerable importance and we ought to be sure that we have examined the issues fully.</P>
      <P>Deputy Taylor said we do not have statistics that would allow us to grasp the full extent of the problem we are talking about.  The joint committee pointed this out.  We do not know the full extent of the problem.  We know what the problem is, we know what is behind it, we know there are people behind that problem who suffer in many different ways, as Deputy Taylor said, emotionally, physically, economically in many cases.  I do not think there is a Member of the House who can be unaware of the existence of that problem.  If there is, that Member must be in a very privileged or isolated position.  We see the different manifestations of the problem, and it is very unsatisfactory for many of us here that we have not yet defined a way to deal with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure of one thing: we will not define a satisfactory way to deal with this if we embark on another trip or attempt to find an Irish solution to an Irish problem, as has been tried on previous <Col N="3026" /> occasions.  This is one of the most important social questions to engage the attention of the Irish people and this House for some years.  It raises fundamental questions about our attitude to marriage, which is recognised by our Constitution as the fundamental unit of our society.</P>
    <P>It has been our tradition, for reasons adverted to by Deputy Taylor, to regard marriage as a union entered into for life. It is fundamental to our general view of things.  It has been fundamental to the way we have organised our society; and the question posed by this Bill and by similar proposals is whether we should modify our attitude on that basic issue. There are sharply divided opinions on it and it will not be enough for us to seek a consensus in this House: we have to seek a far wider consensus.</P>
    <P>I do not say &mdash; it is the very thing I do not want to say &mdash; I am not suggesting that we should refuse to contemplate any change, but the nature of the issue imposes a very heavy obligation on all of us to inform ourselves as fully as possible of the implications of what is being proposed so that we will be able to satisfy ourselves whether proposals for change should be put before the people, and second, if they should be put, what proposals they should be.  That concern, which I hold very deeply, is in keeping with those outlined by Deputy Taylor.</P>
    <P>The joint committee made a substantial, notable contribution to the debate. I do not think any member of the joint committee would claim any particular literary elegance for the report, but it is an extremely comprehensive report dealing with all of the issues arising.  They laid great stress on the issue that divorce is only one aspect of a much wider subject. Therefore, the committee members addressed themselves to various causes of marriage breakdown, to methods by which the institution of marriage may be protected, to methods by which the people involved may be protected, and to the various legal remedies, including divorce, though not solely concentrating on divorce, by which some alleviation of the problems caused by marriage breakdown may be achieved.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="3027" /> The committee recognised the diversity of the problems and their acuteness for the people involved.  They considered the whole area of family law, including nullity, judicial separation, maintenance, guardianship, custody and many other matters.  These are all matters to be taken into account when we are considering marriage breakdown.  Many of them are areas on which work is going on in my Department with a view to bringing forward proposals for legislation including, for the benefit of Deputy Woods, legislation covering the recognition of foreign divorces.</P>
    <P>The discussion of divorce in the committee's report amply illustrates the complexities of the problem and the wide divergences of view held by all of them with considerable conviction.  I am not sure, however, what impact that report has had on public opinion generally. Indeed, I would not be at all confident that I would arrive at a conclusion on what the impact of that report has been on the opinions of Members of the House.  I know what the impact has been on those Members who spoke in that debate but we are left to guess at what its impact was on other Members, including many of those not present this evening on the other side.</P>
    <P>Nobody has suggested that divorce is the sole solution to marriage breakdown. Everybody agrees that there are a great many other initiatives that must be taken if we must have divorce.  Most people will agree that the last thing that is wanted is divorce easily obtained on the scale that obtains in many other countries.  I am sure it will be generally agreed that no proposal to introduce divorce should involve a departure from our fundamental position of fostering and protecting the institution of marriage.  If it is to be introduced I think the view of a majority of people would be that it should be available as a last rather than as a first resort.</P>
    <P>I am not sure what Deputy Taylor had in mind when he suggested that the debate on the report was structured &mdash; I believe I am quoting his words &mdash; in an <Col N="3028" /> abstract way.  All debate and discussion leading to a conclusion has to be for a part of it structured in an abstract way particularly if the debate is to lead to a specific set of proposals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Taylor may be jumping to a conclusion which is not justified by the tone of the debate we are having.  It was as part of that debate and discussion that the Taoiseach, as he indicated in the House today, wrote to the principal Churches proposing consultations during the month of March on action to be taken on the whole range of matters arising from the report of the joint committee.  The Taoiseach has indicated also that it is his intention, following those discussions, to bring proposals to the Government.  In proposing those discussions with the various Churches the Taoiseach was particularly conscious of their role, as he said this afternoon, in the solemnisation of marriage and of their concern with all of the issues, including divorce, but including also the other areas discussed by the joint committee.  That full range of issues will be the basis of those consultations.  They are all matters that raise important questions, some of them complicated legal and social issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is only right that divorce should not be considered in isolation.  We have a duty also to meet the difficulties of those who have marital problems who do not see divorce as a solution.  We need a wider consensus than that in this House and the consultations that the Taoiseach is undertaking are aimed at identifying to what degree we can get a wider consensus than that in this House.  That is important for a great many reasons not least of which is the debt of justice we owe to people who find themselves in a position, as many people do, of extreme difficulty as a result of marriage breakdown.  In the light of that initiative I take the view that it would be inappropriate, certainly inappropriate for all those who support that initiative, to engage in this House in <Col N="3029" /> a detailed debate on the merits of the Bill at this time.</P>
    <P>I do not think the Taoiseach could be expected on the one hand to conduct consultations with the Churches, the purpose of which is to help develop and define the sort of response that is needed to the problems of marriage breakdown, while on the other hand a debate is cronducted in the Oireachtas on a Bill which opts for one specific approach to the matter and to that extent prejudges a central issue in a particular way.  I cannot agree with the contention of Deputy Taylor that parallel discussions would be useful in this regard.  Sequential discussions seem to me to be far more useful in informing our conclusions on this issue.  The proposals which the Taoiseach will bring forward following the consultations which he has proposed will be formed taking account of those consultations and also of the work of the joint committee and the debate in the House.  In all those circumstances I take the view that the proper course now is to postpone further debate on the Bill until consultations with the Churches have been completed and the Taoiseach has had an opportunity of putting proposals to the Government taking account of all that has been said so far on this subject.</P>

      <P>The Progressive Democrats are committed to the holding of a referendum on divorce and to the introduction of divorce here in certain limited circumstances.  This party will support giving a Second Reading to the Bill advanced by the Labour Party.  The Bill, however, is in our view seriously defective. We believe it is substantively and technically unsound in many respects. Having removed the constitutional prohibition on divorce the Labour Party Bill goes on to propose what it describes as certain safeguards.  These are so vague as to be meaningless.  The Bill states that <Col N="3030" /> divorce should be granted only &ldquo;in such circumstances where it is clear that due to the breakdown of a marriage the parties cannot reasonably be required to continue to reside together as husband and wife&rdquo;.  On the face of it that provision restricts the availability of divorce to couples actually residing together as husband and wife at the time they apply for a dissolution of their marriage.  At best this is unrealistic and unhelpful and at worst it could lead to a great increase in the physical or mental risk to one or other spouse or to both of them.</P>
      <P>The other two safeguards, as they are described in the Bill, are in the article of the Bill.  The first of these seeks to confine the granting of a dissolution to the High Court and, on appeal, to the Supreme Court.  I do not see that as any real limitation or protection.  It is what one would assume, that a matter as serious as this was not going to be dealt with in the District and Circuit Courts.  I do not see that as a protection in any sense.  The other protection, or limitation, as it is described, is that the dissolution will not be made unless the court is satisfied that the interests of any dependant spouse or child have in so far as is just and practicable been protected.  In other words, that alimony will be paid in cases where the court considers it appropriate to a dependant spouse, child or children.  There is nothing unusual in the way of safeguard in the payment of alimony.  That provision is common to divorce jurisdictions everywhere.  For example, it is a provision that would be found in the divorce jurisdiction of the state of Nevada and cannot be seen as of any particular value here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our vote for the Bill is in order to seek to keep the issue alive to the next Stage of debate when we can propose amendments, assuming of course that we are allowed representation on the select committee of the House that will debate it. In that connection, in a matter as important as a constitutional amendment there should not be one of these contrived select committees.  If the whole House can sit as a committee on any Bill that is not of great importance it is my view that <Col N="3031" /> a Bill of great importance such as this should be referred to a committee of the whole House and nothing else.</P>
    <P>Deputy Michael O'Leary's divorce proposals put before the Dáil last December had much to be said for them.  They too require modification for technical reasons but in concept and substance however they have a great deal in common with the views of the Progressive Democrats.  On Committee Stage of this Bill this party will propose an amendment to prevent the enactment of any divorce law unless the specific proposals are put to the people.  The peculiarly personal nature of marriage, and its dissolution, convince us that this is the fair and prudent way forward on this difficult issue at this time.  Opinion polls indicate that 77 per cent of the electorate support the introduction of divorce in limited circumstances. The experience of recent years indicates that there may well be a bitter and divisive debate on this issue when it is put to the people in a referendum. In order to ensure that the real issue at stake is addressed and that we have a rational and meaningful debate, we believe that the electorate should be given the right to approve the extent and nature of any divorce legislation that is deemed appropriate for our society.</P>
    <P>To do this is to recognise not only the political reality but also the deep concern of so many people for the well-being of our society.  This party will shortly publish detailed proposals for the substantive Divorce Bill which we consider should be put before the people ultimately.  These proposals will be positive.  They will be designed to protect and strengthen marriage and to deal compassionately and realistically with the irretrievable breakdown of marriage.</P>
    <P>All political parties and all politicians have an opportunity now to express their views on this tangled and controversial question.  It is tragic for those who believe in serious politics in this country that a covert and hypocritical system of unofficial and official Whips is likely to keep many, if not most, Deputies cowering in silence while their parties play it safe and <Col N="3032" /> wait for the storm to pass.  On numerous occasions in the past few weeks Fianna Fáil have called on us to spell out our policies.  We have stated our policy on this issue.  Let us hear now what their policy is.  Unfortunately, we will more probably find Fianna Fáil not supporting this Bill and not opposing it, but just doing nothing.</P>
    <P>It is remarkable, so far as Fine Gael are concerned, that those in that party who have postured longest and shouted loudest on this issue are now so anxious to postpone it.  The plight of 70,000 victims of marital breakdown cannot be ignored forever.  What we are in danger of forgetting is that the Ireland of 50 years ago or even of 20 years ago cannot be brought back.</P>
    <P>If it is the duty of politicians to lead, we must show some modicum of courage. The longer we wait the more people we drive into an arena of family life that is not covered by any law.  This does more than anything to damage the institution of marriage.</P>
    <P>People have expressed a clear view on this issue.  The self-declared constitutional crusaders are prepared to fight any battle so long as it takes place tomorrow. The Progressive Democrats believe that in the realm of marital breakdown, as in the realm of the economy, the people are tired of politics of <i>mañana</i>.  We will work for solutions today.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>This question of divorce has been bandied around in political circles for so long now that it is difficult to identify when it first became a respectable issue to even discuss.  However, the party to which I belong have for many years recognised the need to remove the constitutional ban on divorce in order to allow this House to seriously discuss the question with the possibility of offering some solution to the many tens of thousands who are at best tolerating life.  I am not talking only about those whom we can include in the statistics because their marriages have broken down visibly. There are also couples living under the same roof in respect of whom it would be a mockery to describe their lives together <Col N="3033" /> as marriages.  Those of us who are in contact with people day after day recognise that there are many in such situations who could be added to the statistics, regardless of how unreliable those statistics may be.</P>
      <P>I was not always convinced about the wisdom of marriage.  I have always had the idea that if two adult people enter into a commitment but chose at some future date to disengage themselves from that commitment, that is fair enough; but it has always been my belief that, if there are children involved, in such circumstances the rights of parents must take second place.  I am supporting this measure because many years ago it was proved to my total satisfaction that in many cases the real victims of a broken marriage are the children when there is no legal way to end the marriage.  I am not talking necessarily about physical damage.  I am talking about the mental damage that is inflicted on tens of thousands of children as a result of their parents' marriages breaking down and because we have not faced up to our responsibilities in this House.  That failure is a crying shame to Irish society.</P>

      <P>Could the Minister for Justice have believed what he was telling us?  Do Fine Gael and the Taoiseach expect any intelligent person to believe that the Churches must be consulted if we are to know what their views on divorce are?  The Minister was talking to people in ivory towers when he talked about being detached. How detached can one be if he does not know what is the Churches' attitude to divorce at this stage?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other side of the House sit a party who have been in Government in this country for more years than has been <Col N="3034" /> the case of any other party.  Fianna Fáil have been in Government in their own right, but they have ignored this problem. This evening their only concern and focus was on the backs of at least 70,000 men and women and the children of those couples in trying to make party political points.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley referred to the imposition of Whips.  So far as I know, he did not object to the system when it counted. There is a Whip on the other side of the House for Fianna Fáil to sit and do nothing.  That does not apply over here. I agree with Deputy O'Malley when he says that the trendy liberals in Fine Gael can now stand up and be counted in the context of this Labour Party Bill.  This Bill is for real.  This is not an L and H debate where one can stand up and be for or against with all of us clapping the best speaker.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I should like to thank the Ceann Comhairle for giving me permission to raise this important matter tonight.  It is, indeed, very important.  I learned with regret late this morning about the proposed closure of Cappanalea Outdoor Education Centre in Killorglin as from 1 March.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The history of this project is very interesting party because it is shortlived but, secondly, because it is a most interesting project.  This outdoor education pursuits centre was constructed and organised mainly through the Kerry VEC and by various voluntary organisations primarily in the Killorglin area of County Kerry.  I understand that the Department of Education invested capital to the tune of £116,000 in respect of this education centre.  It is the only outdoor pursuits centre of its kind in Kerry.  Thousands of young people, including students and adults from areas throughout the whole <Col N="3035" /> country, avail of the tremendous amenities attached to the centre.</P>
    <P>Early in 1985, I understand that Deputy George Birmingham, Minister of State at the Department of Education and the Department of Labour gave a firm commitment to the board of management of Cappanalea and to the County Kerry VEC that the project would be supported financially for three years by the State at £30,000 per annum for 1985, 1986 and 1987.  I also understand that this proposal was to be funded mainly out of the Teamwork funding scheme for the staff.  This Teamwork funding for the staff has now been cut off suddenly and the Kerry VEC have no alternative but to close down the centre on 28 February.</P>
    <P>I understand that the CEO received a letter yesterday morning from the Department of Labour, and from the Department of Education this morning, stating that financial aid was being withdrawn.  The County Kerry VEC and the board of management of Cappanalea feel very much let down by the Department of Education and by the Department of Labour and, indeed, by the Government.  Six persons are employed on this scheme.  It will cost £600 per week to run the enterprise without the Teamwork funding scheme.  County Kerry VEC cannot possibly afford a loss of anything near this, to say the least.  I am a member of the County Kerry VEC and I am also a member of the board of management of Cappanalea Outdoor Education Centre and I have a very special interest in this project because of the very nature of the project and because of the section of the community for which it caters, mainly and primarily our young people, particularly teenagers who came from far and near to avail of the training services in this centre.</P>
    <P>I understand that a suggestion has been made by some Government Departments to the County Kerry VEC that the social employment scheme fund should be availed of to finance this project from now onwards.  I am sure the Minister of State will realise that this scheme is not suitable <Col N="3036" /> for the payment of the staff employed in the Cappanalea outdoor pursuit centre because, first of all, the employment scheme is confined to persons over 25 years of age who have been in receipt of unemployment assistance for at least 12 months.  Having regard to the names which will be supplied to the board of management by the National Manpower Service and in particular the local employment exchange office, it is felt generally that these persons would require quite an amount of training to enable them to operate the centre as satisfactorily as it is being operated at present with skilled staff.  Again, under this social employment scheme, the employees can work only two and a half days per week or five half days per week so there would not be continuity of employment, continuity of service as far as the employees are concerned and as far as the operation of this whole scheme is concerned.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, should this project fail, it would be a big loss to Killorglin town and to its business sector.  It would also be a big loss to the education and well being of the students in the south west of the county.  This scheme is financed more or less by way of £32,000 collected annually in fees and charges, £99,500 in respect of equipment by the Department of Education and then £30,000 to support that from the Department of Labour. You can see, therefore, that the £30,000 grant will not be forthcoming this year.  It is also important to note that the County Kerry VEC are not permitted to finance this project themselves out of their own fund.  What we really want from the Department of Labour and the Department of Education is a replacement cost grant of £30,000 to continue this scheme.  All the schemes would be operated by the County Kerry VEC.  The Department asked recently for a scheme to be prepared by the VEC and the board of management in respect of Cappanalea which would benefit North-South relations as far as the youth of this island are concerned through the promotion of excursions to the south, to Killorglin and <Col N="3037" /> Cappanalea.  In view of the correspondence from the Department of Education and the Department of Labour within the past few days to the County Kerry VEC, it looks as if this whole proposal is being set aside as well.  I should like to get the views of the Minister of State on that aspect of the case in view of the decision to withdraw from this scheme.</P>
    <P>Again, I want to point out to the Minister how unsuitable the social employment scheme is for employing the category of persons required to operate a scheme like this successfully where continuity of service is essential.  I ask the Minister of State to view this in a very sympathetic fashion and to negotiate for the continuation of this grant of £30,000 for the remainder of 1986 and also for 1987 and fulfil the commitments given by Deputy G. Birmingham when he was Minister of State at the Department of Education and at the Department of Labour.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBegley" hpid="Mr. Begley Mr. Begley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy O'Leary for kindly giving me some minutes of his time and I re-echo some of the sentiments expressed by him.  I am very disappointed with this decision and I hope it can be reversed.  This is a magnificent project which has tremendous potential.  It is in line with the Anglo-Irish Agreement in that over 1,000 boys and girls from Northern Ireland have come to Kerry over the past five years and spent several days there, staying with the locals in different houses and camping out when the weather was suitable.  Friendships developed which are still going on and these people come back again and again.  If crossBorder friendship is to develop, here is positive proof of deeds in action.</P>
      <P>This centre cannot be surpassed for outdoor education.  Teachers from all over Ireland come there with their pupils and stay over long weekends, studying all aspects of nature.  The new curriculum for education highly recommends this study. The sheer excitement of outdoor pursuits such as canoeing, mountaineering and fishing is to be found at Cappanalea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This decision will be a tremendous bombshell for those who have already booked for next summer.  It has not been <Col N="3038" /> well thought out.  The Department were good enough to spend over £116,000 there during the past few years.  Why leave it there now like a white elephant on the side of a Kerry mountain?  It is difficult to find words when speaking about the new schemes recommended by different people to carry on this project. Anybody with commonsense would know that these schemes are impractical. Where young people are involved, there must be continuity of employment so that the men and women in charge of the scheme get to know the children by name.  The Department should know that it will not work if different people are employed on different days.  These people were advised by the Department last year that this project would be financed for 1986 and 1987.  It is not good enough for a Minister of Department officials to give a commitment like that to a committee and then renege on it.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the new Minister, whom I wish well in his appointment, to make a name for himself in Kerry by a stroke of the pen.  I would ask him to meet a deputation from the management committee. I know that a similar request was sent to a previous Minister.  The Minister might tease out with the management committee a means of keeping the centre open in order not to disappoint the children North and South of the Border who eagerly look forward to their time in Cappanalea.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Barrett,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Dún Laoghaire):</i> I have listened very carefully to both contributions and thank both Deputies for the manner in which they presented their case.  I would be only too delighted to consider Deputy Begley's request to meet a deputation from those concerned with this centre.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Cappanalea outdoor education centre was built in 1981 by County Kerry Vocational Education Committee with the assistance of a grant-in-aid provided under the programme for the provision of recreational facilities.  Grants in respect of furnishing and equipment are <Col N="3039" /> made available on an annual basis by the Department of Education.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, it has not been possible for the Department of Education to authorise full time staffing for the centre due to the embargo on the creation of new posts in the public service.  Having regard to the many demands for staffing in various areas within the education sector, there is no possibility of effecting the redeployment of any posts to cater for the staffing needs at Cappanalea centre.</P>
    <P>Since March 1985 it has been possible for the management committee of Cappanalea centre to avail of the Department of Labour's Teamwork scheme.  During that period grants totalling £28,980 were allocated to enable eight people to be employed to run the centre.  That particular Teamwork scheme terminated, however, in December 1985.</P>
    <P>An application for further assistance under the scheme was fully and sympathetically considered but regrettably has been turned down due to the greatly increased demand on the resources provided for this particular scheme.  The County Kerry Vocational Education Committee have been advised that their proposal could qualify for assistance under the social employment scheme.  So far as I am aware no application has been received for such assistance.</P>
    <P>During the course of Deputy O'Leary's contribution he stated that it would cost £600 per week to run the centre.  The figure received from the County Kerry Vocational Education Committee shows the cost of staffing to be in the region of £1,000 per week.</P>
    <P>The question of the staffing of outdoor education centres, including that at Cappanalea, was considered by the National Youth Policy Committee.  In the Government's recently published White Paper entitled <i>In Partnership with Youth</i> Paragraph 5.5.3 states:</P>
    <P>The Government recognise the valuable contribution which Outdoor Pursuit Centres, managed by Vocational <Col N="3040" /> Education Committee, and youth hostels and residential centres, run by voluntary youth organisations, can make towards meeting important personal development needs of young people.  The Department of Education will ensure that the Outdoor Pursuit Centres will be adequately staffed and financed to enable their full and effective use as part of the National Youth Service.</P>
    <P>That is the commitment given in the recently published document.  I would ask County Kerry VEC to keep this very valuable asset in operation with funding from the social employment scheme as an interim measure, pending the implementation of the national youth policy.</P>

The same will apply with the social employment scheme, but I made the point that the latter scheme could be used as an interim measure until the national youth policy is implemented.</P>

      <P>I am aware that there are no salmon drift net licences available for the area from Bannow Bay, County Wexford to Wicklow.</P>
      <P>The number of commercial fishing licences available for issue is controlled under the Control of Fishing for Salmon Orders, 1980 to 1982.  When these controls were introduced in 1972, the number and type of licence allocated to each fishery district was decided in the light of the type and level of salmon fishing in operation in all areas at that time and prior to them.  As there was no drift netting in the Wexford fishery district, no drift net licences were allocated to that area.  The traditional type of commercial salmon fishing operated in the area is draft netting.  Bearing in mind the traditional fishing practices in the area I do not regard the position as discriminatory.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 22 and 38 together. As the repairs of the storm damage to Clogherhead pier have not yet been carried out by Louth county council the question of payment of the grant by my Department does not arise.  My Department have already paid a grant of £5,809 to Louth County Council towards the cost of the diving survey to ascertain the repairs necessary to the pier and to recover the dislodged coping stones from the harbour bed.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, from a meeting which he and a deputation of local interests had with the Minister for Fisheries, Forestry and Tourism on 12 February 1986 an undertaking was given that the repairs and stablisation of the pier would proceed as quickly as possible and that my Department would make a 50 per cent contribution towards the cost of the work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the development of the pier an outline plan of a development scheme prepared by the Louth County <Col N="2828" /> Councils consultants was received in my Department on 11 February 1986 and is at present being examined.  At the meeting with the deputation to which I have already referred it was indicated that my Department were committed to a development scheme for Clogherhead as a priority item.  It was also pointed out that the Department's contribution to the cost would be limited to a 50 per cent grant and that such expenditure would have to be justified on the basis of a full economic appraisal of the project.  Until the scheme has been appraised and the approval of the Minister of Finance obtained to the financial cost involved I cannot say when work will commence or whether any funding from the EC will be sought.</P>

      <P>I am assuming that the Deputy is referring to sawn softwood, and not to hardwood, panel boards or the like.  I understand from the Central Statistics Office that the volume of sawn conifers imported in the period January to November 1985 the latest date for which such information is available was 216,000 m³ valued at approx.  £28 million. Imported sawn conifers comprise whitewoods and redwoods.  Irish timber is mainly substituted for the former and is now estimated to represent about 35 per cent of the total market, whereas in 1980 it was less than 25 per cent.  It is expected over the next five years that market share could increase to about 45-50 per cent. An 80 per cent market share is the potential maximum because some imported timbers are not produced in Ireland.  On the basis of our planting to date and development of our forests this level of <Col N="2829" /> market share is unlikely to be reached until well into the next decade.</P>

This quota includes a flatrate amount of 4,500 tonnes, which will only be applicable for a three-year period.  The Irish quota of 1,550 tonnes in 1986 represents an increase of 8 per cent approx.  On last year's quota.  I can assure the Deputy that I will continue to press for the highest possible quotas for our fishermen whenever the opportunity arises.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Fisheries, Forestry and Tourism the total tonnage and value of fish disposed of by dumping during 1983, 1984, and 1985; if he is considering any alternatives to dumping; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <P>The reply is in the form of a tabular statement which I propose to circulate in the Official Report.  Information on the quantity of fish dumped relates only to 11 species of fish covered by the EC market support arrangements.  The figures for 1985 are provisional.  Dumping of fish is, of course, only one of the methods used in disposing of fish withdrawn from the market under the market support system of the European Community's Common Fisheries Policy.  Fishermen's producers' organisations have been urged by my Department to avoid dumping where possible and to dispose of the surplus fish for fishmeal or animal feed.</P>

The total cost of foreign travel, subsistence and official entertainment paid from my Department's Vote and the Vote of the CSO in 1985 was £214,151.

      <P>I assume that the Deputy's question refers to the view expressed in paragraph 6 of report No. 23 of the Fourth Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities dated 18 December 1985.  The making of statutory regulations for the implementation of EC directives in the form referred to in that report, where this is considered appropriate, does not fail to reflect the legislative supremacy of the Oireachtas. The statutory regulations in question are invariably made pursuant to powers conferred on Ministers by Act of the Oireachtas, in particular the European Communities Act, 1972.  Accordingly the legislative supremacy of the Oireachtas is duly reflected and fully respected.</P>

        <i>Limerick East):</i> As the Deputy will be aware the company in question were recently obliged to lay off most of their workforce due to the fact that they have almost completed a production run of rural buses for CIE and have no further orders on hand.  To date, the company have been reliant on the domestic market demand for buses to maintain production levels.  However, they recognised that their long term viability had to be based on export orders and have recently supplied a prototype bus to a UK operator.  Testing of this bus will take some months yet but the company have expressed their confidence of securing additional orders which would allow them to recommence production.  I can assure the Deputy that everything possible will be done by the appropriate State agencies to assist the company in identifying and developing export outlets and thereby improving its future prospects.</P>

      <P>The condition of Irish rivers and lakes is kept under review in my Department in the light of the monitoring activities of An Forbartha.  An Foras has an extensive on-going programme to assess the quality of rivers.  In recent years a total of 6.928 kms of river and stream channel has been the subject of biological surveys.  Some 84 per cent of this channel was found to be free of pollution, slight to moderate pollution occurred on some 14 per cent of the length, while 2 per cent was subject to serious pollution.  Of some 39 lakes examined since 1974, eutrophic conditions (that is nutrient enrichment) have been found in 25 lakes.  The remedial measures appropriate in each case are matters in the first instance for the local authorities concerned, having regard to the degree of eutrophication and the threat, if any, posed to the beneficial uses of the lakes. Remedial action already taken by local authorities on some lakes includes the installation of improved sewage treatment systems for the removal of phosphorus, and improved controls on agricultural activities, particularly slurry generating and disposal operations, through the application of the provisions of the Planning and Water Pollution Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am satisfied that the Local Government (Water Pollution) Act, 1977, provides local authorities with an adequate statutory framework for the control of pollution.  I intend to assess the performance of local authorities in the implementation of this legislation and will be <Col N="2852" /> seeking to have any shortcomings which may be identified corrected.</P>
    <P>I am committed to providing the capital resources necessary to improve the sewage disposal schemes of local authorities. Significant progress has already been made in this regard.  Improvement works costing £14.4 million have been completed at 12 of the 34 locations identified in 1983 by the Water Pollution Advisory Council as meriting priority attention. Work is in progress on schemes costing £11.4 million at five more of these locations and schemes estimated to cost a further £18.2 million are at various stages of planning to cater for another ten locations.</P>

At present the land reserve for afforestation in the Newcastle area is 32 hectares of which two hectares will be planted in the current planting season. The suitable areas of the remaining 30 hectares will be cultivated this year and planted in 1987.</P>
      <P>The area planned for reafforestation is 149 hectares of which 16 hectares are being planted in the current season.  It is expected that the remaining 133 hectares will be planted at a rate of 25 to 30 hectares per annum.</P>

      <P>I understand that existing facilities can cater for a wide range of such functions.  From studies carried out by Bord Fáilte it is clear that a specially built centre would not be a viable proposition as the rate of return in commercial terms would be inadequate given the significant capital investment likely to be involved.

      <P>Many State companies publish their annual reports within a reasonable length of time after the end of the financial year.  A limited number of companies, however, have on occasion not published their annual reports as quickly as I would wish.  State companies are expected to publish their reports as soon as possible <Col N="2863" /> after the end of the financial year, in line with best accounting practice.  The reports are expected to contain as much relevant information as possible on the affairs of companies, subject to the need to ensure that commercially sensitive information is not disclosed.  The publication by State companies of simplified accounts for their employees is a matter for the boards of individual State companies and I would expect this practice to become more widespread in the future.</P>

However, it is estimated that the amount of income tax in respect of farming profits paid in 1985 amounted to £37 million. Statistics of revenue receipts are, in general, prepared on a calendar year basis and for that reason the estimate of receipts is given in respect of 1985 rather than 1985-86.  The farm tax will be levied in late 1986 for the first time.  The Deputy will appreciate the difficulty in estimating at this stage the first year yield.</P>

      <P>At the request of Kerry County Council the Commissioners of Public Works agreed to lease an area of ground to the <Col N="2868" /> council for the extension of the burial ground at Abbey Island in Derrynane Historic Park in the Caherdaniel area. The offer was subject, <i>inter alia,</i> to an archaeological investigation of the site to ensure that there were no archaeological remains in that area.  A preliminary excavation carried out in 1985 found that there were archaeological remains there and established that portion of the site should be preserved.  A further excavation would be required before a decision could be made as to whether spaces could be made available in another part of the site.  The Kerry County Council have indicated that they have no funds for further excavation and in the circumstances no further progress can be made with the leasing proposal.  There are no other surplus lands within the National Historic Park that could be made available for a burial ground.</P>

      <P>The rules for the first election of members to An Bord Altranais, which were presented to the Houses of the Oireachtas in January 1986, provide that the five administrative nurses to be elected should be at head nurse level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I decided in favour of specifying head nurse level because of the method of election.  The proportional representation system will apply.  Use of that system would have had the potential to produce a situation where none of the five administrative seats would be filled by head nurses from any of the disciplines.  I felt that it would be quite inappropriate to leave the way open for the establishment <Col N="2869" /> of a national nursing board without representation of the most senior administrative nurses among the elected membership.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances, I regret that I do not consider it necessary at this time to adjust the criteria for eligibility for election laid down in the rules.</P>

The nursing staff comprises one matron, one assistant matron, one home sister, six ward sisters, 85 staff nurses, two night <Col N="2872" /> sisters and one theatre sister.  The medical staff includes a consultant anaesthetist, physician, radiologist and surgeon, one registrar, eight house officers and three interns; (4) The cost of capital works funded by my Department since 1977 amounts to £156,222; (5) The obstetrician gynaecologist post was approved by Comhairle na nOspidéal on the 20 March 1981.  On the recommendation of the Local Appointments Commission the chief executive officer approved an appointment in February 1982; (6) The number of back-up staff required was 14 at an annual cost of £100,000 for 1982; (7) The question of support staff had to be considered in the context of the existing financial situation and the Government's policy in relation to numbers in the public sector.  The Western Health Board which was seeking substantial additional staff in other areas at the time was asked by my Department to re-examine the situation and to identify its priorities with a view to meeting its more urgent needs by redeployment of existing resources.  This remains the position; (8) The paediatrician was appointed on the 16 February 1982.  He took up duty on 1 July 1982 and he resigned on 1 April 1983.  The cost of funding for the nine month period was approximately £25,000; (9) No applications have been received from the Western Health Board for the appointment of a second physician and surgeon.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare in view of the fact that a person (details supplied) in Dublin 12 is now eight weeks in arrears with house rent and is in danger of being evicted for non-payment, and that the Eastern Health Board have refused assistance as he is the joint owner of another house, and his lawful wife from whom he has been separated for very many years, and with whom he has written agreement giving her entitlement to the house; if she will instruct the health board to assist in this case as they are demanding that he legally assign the deeds of the house to her to prove he has no interest in the property, which will take months to achieve.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mrs. Hussey)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is understood from the Eastern Health Board, which is responsible for the administration of the supplementary welfare allowances scheme in the Dublin area, that payment to the person concerned of assistance towards rent was not considered warranted as he was the owner of a house which was vacant at the time.  It is a matter for the person concerned to supply reasonable evidence that alternative accommodation is not available to him.  The determination of entitlement to an allowance in any individual case is entirely a matter for the health board.</P>

      <P>Invalidity pension is payable to insured persons who satisfy the contribution conditions and who are permanently incapable of work.  The person concerned was examined on 30 January 1986 by a medical referee who did not consider him to be permanently incapable of work and asked to have him referred for a further examination in May 1986.  A deciding officer has decided that he is not therefore entitled to invalidity pension.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare the reason the maximum rate of unemployment assistance has not been granted to a person (details supplied) in County Offaly in view of the fact that he is married with three children and is in receipt of only £40.75 per week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mrs. Hussey) Gemma Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mrs. Hussey)</NameTxt>
      <P>Following investigation of his unemployment assistance claim the means of the person concerned were assessed at £43.90 weekly, derived from the benefit from his wife's earnings.  He is, accordingly, entitled to unemployment assistance at £40.75 weekly being the appropriate maximum weekly rate payable in his case of £84.65 less means of £43.90.</P>
      <P>He recently appealed against the means assessment and his claim has been submitted to an appeals officer for determination at the earliest available opportunity.  The rate of unemployment assistance payable to the person concerned will be reviewed in the light of the decision of the appeals officer.  Further weekly payments will continue to be made as they become due.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare the reason optical benefit has not been finalised for a person (details supplied) in County Meath; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mrs. Hussey) Gemma Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mrs. Hussey)</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the contribution conditions for receipt of optical benefit requires persons over 21 years of age to have had not less than 26 reckonable contributions paid or credited in the governing contribution year.  The governing contribution <Col N="2884" /> year for claims made in 1985 was the 1983-84 year from 6 April 1983 to 5 April 1984.</P>
      <P>The person concerned claimed optical benefit on 26 November 1985.  According to the records of the Department she had a total of 21 credited contributions only in the 1983-84 governing contribution year and therefore her claim could not be approved.  She was informed of the position on 3 December 1985.</P>
      <P>She then requested that her claim be considered under the scheme for expectant wives of qualified insured workers. Under this scheme benefit can only be awarded in respect of optical services or appliances claimed during the course of pregnancy.  Medical evidence supplied by the claimant indicated that she had been confined prior to the date of her claim and it could not therefore be approved. She was notified accordingly on 16 December 1985.</P>
      <P>The governing contribution year changed with effect from 6 January 1986 and entitlement to optical benefit is now governed by contributions paid or credited in the 1984-85 contribution year. The person concerned has a total of 47 contributions paid and credited for that year and therefore would be entitled to benefit in respect of any optical services or appliances provided since 6 January 1986.  As it is understood from her optician that she has not received a sight test or glasses to date it is now open to her to resubmit her claim and a form for this purpose has been issued to her.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mrs. Hussey) Gemma Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mrs. Hussey)</NameTxt>
      <P>Entitlement to unemployment assistance is dependent on an applicant being the holder of a qualification certificate and to obtain a qualification certificate, an applicant must satisfy certain conditions including an assessment of means.  The person concerned was not available for interview when the social <Col N="2885" /> welfare officer called to investigate his means.  Despite a return call, he still was not available for interview and consequently, no further action could be taken at that time.</P>
      <P>He recently advised his local office of a change of address and the papers were then referred to the appropriate social welfare officer who will carry out the necessary inquiries as soon as possible. When the inquiries are completed, his means will be assessed and his entitlement to unemployment assistance will be determined accordingly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare the reason a person (details supplied) in County Cork is not being paid disability benefit at full rate as his local authority housing rent is based on full benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mrs. Hussey) Gemma Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mrs. Hussey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The person concerned received payment of disability benefit at the maximum rate of £74.50 to 4 January 1986 based on his contribution record in the 1983-84 governing contribution year. From 6 January 1986 his claim is governed by the 1984-85 contribution year and according to the records of the Department he has only 40 credited contributions recorded for that year.  Therefore, from 6 January 1986, he qualifies for payment at the reduced rate of £71.55.  He has been requested to furnish details of his insurance record for the 1984-85 contribution year if he contends that the Department's records are incomplete. However to date he has not done so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mrs. Hussey) Gemma Hussey">

Further inquiries in the matter will be made, if the Deputy will furnish additional information to enable the person concerned to be identified.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare the reasons regulations have not been made relating to Section 29 (4) (a) of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1981, concerning availability for work; whether Statutory Instrument No. 7 of 1953 has been amended to bring all monetary sums mentioned up to present day monetary values, in particular Section 7(b) (ii), if not, when it is intended to do so; if instructions or guidelines have been issued to deciding or appeals officers governing implementation of Section 7(b) (ii) of S. I. No. 7 of 1953 and, if so, if she will give these guidelines or instructions.</P>

      <P>The purpose of the power to make regulations contained in Section 299(4)(a) of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1981 is to enable regulations to be made which would allow a class or category of claimants for unemployment benefit, who would otherwise be regarded as not available for employment, to be deemed to be available for employment.  Except in the case of nightworkers and claimants following a subsidiary occupation to whom Articles 7 and 8 of S.I. No. 7 of 1983 apply, it has not been found necessary to make regulations under Section 29 in relation to other classes or categories of claimants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The limit on the amount of profit or remuneration for unemployment benefit claimants following a subsidiary occupation which was fixed at five shillings a day by Article 7(b)(ii) of S.I. No. 7 of 1953 was increased by amending regulations to 50p by S.I. No. 52 of 1965 which also introduced a contribution test as an alternative to the monetary condition; to £1 by S.I. No. 182 of 1974 and to £2 by S.I. No. 287 of 1980.  It is not proposed to <Col N="2887" /> revise the figure further for the present. Deciding officers and appeals officers determine any cases arising where a claimant to unemployment benefit is following a subsidiary occupation by reference to the actual wording of Article (7)(b)(ii) of the regulations as revised. No instructions or guidelines have been issued to them about the interpretation or application of that article, which is quite specific.</P>

      <P>Entitlement to unemployment benefit is subject to the condition that a <Col N="2888" /> person must have at least 26 contributions paid or credited at the appropriate rate in the contribution period governing entitlement to benefit.</P>
      <P>The person concerned claimed unemployment benefit on 25 November 1985. According to the Department's records, he does not satisfy the condition of having 26 paid or credited contributions during the period 6 April 1983 to 5 April 1984, which governs entitlement to benefit on this claim.  Inquiries are, however, being made to establish whether his employment during the relevant period was insurable at a class providing cover against unemployment.  These inquiries will be completed as soon as possible and entitlement to unemployment benefit will then be determined.</P>

    <P>According to the records of the Department the person concerned has only 85 contributions paid on his behalf since entry into insurance.  He claimed disability benefit from 4 February 1985 and was paid to 5 February 1986 after which date his 52 week entitlement became exhausted.  In order to requalify for disability benefit it would be necessary for him to have at least a further 13 weeks of insurable employment for which the appropriate contributions are paid.  The person concerned was requested on 29 January 1986 to furnish details of his <Col N="2889" /> insurance record to the Department and on the basis of the information now supplied by the Deputy investigations into his record have been initiated.  His entitlement to further benefit will be reviewed on the completion of these investigations.</P>

She claimed unemployment benefit for the period to 15 January 1986 when she exhausted her entitlement to 312 days benefit.  Payment of arrears of unemployment benefit for the period 14 November 1985 to 15 January 1986 was withheld pending the completion of inquiries regarding concurrent drawing of unemployment benefit and disability benefit.

      <P>An applicant for unemployment benefit who is a landholder but does not satisfy the contribution condition of having 78 paid contributions at a class that provides cover against unemployment in a three year period, is not entitled to unemployment benefit if the income from his holding exceeds £2 daily.  The person concerned is a landowner who, on his claim for unemployment benefit of 15 December 1984, did not satisfy the contribution condition of having 78 paid contributions at a class that provides cover against unemployment, in a three year period.  According to the Department's records the claimant had only 49 appropriate contributions paid during this period.  The profit from his holding was also deemed to exceed £2 daily and, accordingly, his claim for unemployment benefit should have been disallowed at that stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, due to an oversight at the local office it was not realised that the claimant was a landowner until May 1985 <Col N="2895" /> and payment of unemployment benefit was made up to that date.  When it was discovered that he was a landowner payment was suspended and inquiries were made to establish if he satisfied the special conditions applicable to a landowner. When these investigations were completed his claim for unemployment benefit was disallowed.  He was notified of the decision and a form to enable him to appeal against this decision was issued to him on request.  The appeal form has not been returned to date.

He appealed against the disallowance and following further investigation an appeals officer assessed his means at £26.60 weekly.  Verification is required from the person concerned regarding the period of unemployment in his case and the appropriate documentation has issued to him for this purpose.

The person concerned is entitled to unemployment assistance at the appropriate maximum weekly rate of £31.75 from 11 November 1985.  All arrears due, together with the current week, will be paid this week and further weekly payments will continue to be made as they become due.</P>

      <P>The person concerned was in receipt of unemployment assistance at £73.15 weekly, being the appropriate maximum rate payable in his case of £92.35 less means of £19.20, up to 21 January 1986 when one of his children reached 18 years of age.  From 22 January 1986 he has been in receipt of unemployment assistance at £65.45 weekly, being the appropriate maximum rate for an applicant with an adult dependant and three child dependants, of £84.65, less means of £19.20.  The means of the person concerned, which were assessed in July 1984, are derived from the profit from his holding.  The profit was calculated on the basis of a gross income of £2,000 per annum, less £1,000 per annum by way of expenses incurred in earning that income.  Accordingly he was deemed to enjoy a profit of £1,000 per annum, or £19.20 per week from his holding. Further weekly payments of £65.45 will continue to be made as they become due.</P>

      <P>Following a review, the unemployment assistance claim of the person concerned was disallowed on the grounds that his means derived from the value of board and lodging on his son's holding exceeded the maximum rate payable in his case.  He was notified of the decision on 12 February 1986 and was issued with an appeal form but to date he has not returned it.  When it is returned the papers will be submitted to an appeals officer for determination of his means, at the earliest available opportunity.

      <P>In accordance with the provisions of the legislation governing the unemployment assistance scheme, the value of any benefit or privilege derived by an applicant from any source must be taken into account in the assessment of <Col N="2914" /> means.  Following investigation of his unemployment assistance claim the means of the person concerned were assessed at £9.60 weekly, derived from the value of board and lodgings in his parents' home.  He appealed against the means assessment but an appeals officer also assessed his means at £9.60 weekly.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mrs. Hussey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The person concerned is not entitled to pay-related benefit during his current disability benefit claim, as the relevant legislation provides that pay-related benefit cannot be added to flat rate benefit to an extent which would cause his total weekly payments to exceed 75 per cent of average weekly earnings in the relevant income tax year. The percentage of reckonable earnings which determines the upper limit of pay-related benefit payable in conjunction with disability benefit is provided for in the Social Welfare (Pay-Related Benefit) <Col N="2916" /> Regulations, 1979, as amended by the Social Welfare (Amendment of Miscellaneous Social Insurance Provisions) Regulations, 1984.</P>
      <P>In the case of the person concerned, the relevant income tax year is 1983-84 in which 75 per cent of his average weekly earnings was £36.57.  He is in receipt of flat rate benefit at the weekly rate of £102.40 and therefore, is not entitled to pay-related benefit.  There is therefore, no basis for a formal appeal in this case.</P>

According to the Department's records the person concerned has only 13 contributions paid since entry into insurable employment and consequently her claim for unemployment benefit was disallowed.  However, the person concerned stated that she had been employed for four months up to November 1983 in respect of which period the Department has no record of contributions paid.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Deasy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under present EC arrangements, the primary benefit that would arise from reclassifying a less favoured area as a mountain area would be that larger dairy farmers could be paid headage grants on all their dairy cows, rather than on only part of their herd.  There are very few of these larger herds in more severely handicapped areas like Connemara and Mayo.</P>
      <P>Another benefit of reclassification would be to remove the milk co-responsibility levy which is paid at the reduced rate by farmers in less favoured areas. The burden of this levy is, however, offset for all the smaller dairy farms by the scheme of aid for small scale milk producers. Thus, here again, the benefit of reclassifying Connemara and Mayo would accrue to large dairy farmers and not small farmers.</P>
      <P>It is Government policy to concentrate any additional resources for farm development in the disadvantaged areas on the smaller and medium sized farms and to this end the headage payment on beef cows is being raised from £32 to £70. This will have a far greater effect on the incomes of farmers in Connemara and Mayo than reclassifying the area.</P>

      <P>Improvement in the returns for Irish lamb can best be achieved through greater awareness on the part of both producers and factories of the need to produce the type of product which will obtain maximum prices on export markets.  Producers should dispose of their lambs before they get overfat while factories should <Col N="2924" /> pay greater attention to the standard of carcase dressing and presentation.  I am pleased to see that in the past 12 months there was a noticeable improvement in the quality of Irish lamb sent to export markets.  The level of prices here is very much influenced by returns on the French export market where demand in recent times has been weak.  It should of course be borne in mind that sheep producers receive an annual ewe premium which compensates them for the difference between Irish market prices and the Community's basic price.</P>

It involved the surveying of 10,000 townlands in 600 district electoral divisions covering approximately 4 million acres of lands.  The adjustments resulting from this examination represent the maximum possible area that can be included or reclassified consistent with the criteria laid down in the EC directive for designating areas as disadvantaged. In this situation, there is no possibility at present of adding still further to the list of areas to be classified as more severely handicapped within the disadvantaged areas.</P>

      <P>I am aware that there are delays in the Land Registry.  I am informed by the Registrar of titles that the length of these delays varies according to the category of work involved.  The delays are due to an increase in the intake of work in recent years and the cuts in staff which have resulted from the staffing restrictions which apply to the Civil Service generally. Within these constraints everything possible has been and is being done to reduce the delays in the Registry.</P>
      <P>A programme of computerising the Land Registry folios commenced in 1982. The Dublin folios have all been computerised and this has helped to increase efficiency in this area.  It is hoped that it will be possible to extend the programme to other areas.  The possibility of computerising map details is being considered also.  The introduction of a word processor in the ground rents section has helped to decrease arrears considerably and consequently reduce delays.  Other developments such as the use of personal computers and the redistribution of work are being considered at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Cooney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 224 to 230, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The decision to provide a community school in Castlerea was reached after consultation with all the local interests including the vocational education committee and the fullest consideration of all the relevant factors.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the educational interests of the pupils in the Castlerea area, both short term and long term, will best be served by the proposed community school development.  I have taken into account the best educational provision which should be made available given the projected enrolments in the area and having regard to the fact that all pupils, irrespective of sex, social background or ability, should have access to the widest range of subject choice feasible.</P>
      <P>I am confident that, on completion, the community school will have the full support of all educational interests in the area &mdash; management, pupils and parents &mdash; and that it will be recognised as a facility equal to the best available anywhere in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The school will be in the ownership of the Minister for Education but will be vested in trustees representative of the <Col N="2934" /> religious authorities and the vocational education committee.  These trustees have not yet been nominated.</P>
    <P>A local contribution equal to 10 per cent of the cost of the school will be payable &mdash; 5 per cent by the Vocational Education Committee and 5 per cent by the religious authorities involved.  Since this contribution is calculated by reference to the final cost of the school, it is not possible to say, at this stage, what the total amount will be.</P>
    <P>No compensation is payable to the existing school authorities.  However, since the new school will be located at the convent site and will incorporate such of the existing convent school accommodation as is suitable for the purpose, the transfer of that property will be a matter for negotiation between the Sisters of Mercy and the Department.</P>
    <P>The school has been designed to accommodate 675 pupils.  Like all such designs it allows for ready extension should this ever be required.  It is anticipated that approximately 670 pupils will enrol in the school when it is completed.</P>
    <P>The staffing level of the school will be determined by reference to the standard applied in all community schools, i.e., a pupil-teacher ratio of 19:1 with additional posts for principal, vice-principal, etc. However, all permanent whole time teachers who were on the staffs of the two schools at the time the decision to create the community school was announced are guaranteed the right of assimilation to the staff of the new school without loss of income.</P>
    <P>The following is the design team for the new community school: Architects &mdash; Jeffers Kearns &amp; Associates, 27 William Street West, Galway; Quantity Surveyors &mdash; Joseph C. Hogan, 18 Clare Street, Dublin 2; Services Engineer &mdash; John Egan &amp; Associates, 7 Bath Avenue, Sandymount, Dublin 4; Structural Engineer &mdash; Jennings and O'Donovan, Finsklin, Sligo.</P>

    <P>(b), (c) and (d).  As the company concerned was insolvent, the redundancy lump sums were paid direct to the employees from the Redundancy and Employers' Insolvency Fund.  The procedure in such cases is that, when the lump sums are paid, my Department submit a claim on behalf of the fund against the assets of the company for the amount of lump sums less the appropriate amount allowed by way of rebate, normally at the rate of 60 per cent of lump sums paid.  The liquidator does not, therefore, submit a specific claim for rebate nor is a rebate paid by the Department.</P>
    <P>In the case of the company referred to in the question, the amount of rebate allowed in calculation of the Department's claim against the assets was at the rate of 60 per cent of the lump sums paid. The amount of rebate appropriate to each employee was not identified separately but it would be on a pro rata basis related to the amount of each individual lump sum.</P>
    <P>My Department have no other application for payment from the redundancy and Employer's Insolvency Fund in accordance with the provisions of the Protection of Employees/Employers' <Col N="2939" /> Insolvency Act, 1984, in respect of the 26 employees concerned.</P>
