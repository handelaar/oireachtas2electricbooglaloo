    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 4, subsection (2), line 18, after &ldquo;order&rdquo;, to insert &ldquo;and that such alteration of the boundary of the Metropolitan Central Area shall have the consent of the relevant local authority or local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2043" /> If this amendment is accepted subsection (2) will read that the Minister may by order alter the boundary of the metropolitan central area so as to include therein immediately adjoining land or to exclude therefrom land forming part thereof and, where the Minister makes an order under this subsection, for so long as the order remains in force the First Schedule to this Act shall have effect subject to the terms of the order and that such alteration of the boundary of the metropolitan central area shall have the consent of the relevant local authority or local authorities.</P>
    <P>We on this side of the House and other Members in the House have proven that this legislation is a cosmetic exercise by the Minister.  In the Schedule to the Bill the Minister names a series of streets from Cavendish Row, Parnell Street and Parnell Square to Grafton Street.  He set a life span of three years for the commission. As the Minister has a voting majority and was able to force through Second Stage, it is likely he will do the same on the remaining Stages.  We are anxious that the effects of the Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission (No. 2) Bill be limited to the streets as laid out in the Schedule and that if the Minister is going to take any further undemocratic powers he would go at least to the relevant local authority, Dublin Corporation, so that they would have the power to decide as to whether they are agreeable to the Minister's extension of the areas to be covered by this commission. We feel that the powers the Minister is taking on in subsection (2) are far too embracing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Boland) Minister for the Environment (Mr. Boland)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot see that there is a need for the amendment.  I have made it clear that the area defined in the Schedule is the area that will be administered by the Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission. At this stage it is not envisaged that there will be any extension to that area.  The inclusion of the subsection which the amendment seeks to modify is for the purpose of providing that, if at <Col N="2044" /> any time during the lifetime of the commission it becomes apparent that there is a demand for an extension of the boundary of the commission's functional area or a reduction, which would have the obvious implication that the area being omitted would automatically return to the care and maintenance of the local authority, the Minister will have the power to make an order making that modification.  However, that order will have to come before the House.  The Bill is being enacted by the Houses of the Oireachtas to set up the commission and there is provision in subsection (4) for the Houses to annul any order made by the Minister.  Considering the emphasis I placed in the course of the Second Stage debate on the fact that the area is considered to be one of special importance and significance requiring national consideration, it is reasonable to suggest that if the administrative area of the commission is to be added to or taken from, it should be done by the national Parliament.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset the Minister said he did not have any intention of altering the boundaries as laid out in the Schedule but later he said that if there is demand for an extension or reduction &mdash; we would all welcome a reduction &mdash; it would be a matter for the Oireachtas. I accept that the centre of the capital city is a matter of national importance but it is also a matter of great importance to the democratically elected members of Dublin Corporation who have a statutory obligation to care for and deal with planning and other matters which concern that area.  Surely any alteration of the boundary should have the consent of the relevant local authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is more relevant to have that consent than having the consent of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I do not mean any disrespect to the Members of the Oireachtas.  The centre of our capital city may be of importance to the citizens of the land but it is of greater importance to the people of Dublin and the members <Col N="2045" /> of Dublin Corporation.  It is more relevant to get the consent of the city authority than to get it from a Member who may be from Donegal, Cork, Waterford or some other corner of the land.  The Minister told us he does not have any intention of extending the boundary and I suggest that on Report Stage he should include a provision to the effect that he may alter the boundary by reduction. That would represent a major step forward.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Was it the Deputy's father who used the expression that time brought greater enlightenment?  I have to remind the House, and Deputy Burke, of the Urban Development Areas Bill, 1982, which was introduced by him when he was Minister for the Environment. Section 2 of that Bill provided for the establishment of a Custom House Dock development area and a Dublin walled city development area.  Subsection (3) of that section allowed the Minister to add to or take from the areas to be administered by those authorities.  At that time the Minister did not see the need to consult with or have the agreement of the local authority involved which, coincidentally, happen to be the same local authority involved here, Dublin Corporation. That Bill did not provide that the Houses of the Oireachtas would have the right to vary any order made by the Minister if, subsequent to the passing of the Bill, he chose to alter the boundaries of the Dublin walled city development area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I find it difficult to follow the Deputy's line of argument which is so materially different from what he advocated when he was Minister in 1982.  In the debate on the Urban Renewal Bill on 28 May last &mdash; that Bill established the Custom House Dock Authority &mdash; the Deputy moved an amendment, as reported at column 319, volume 367 of the Official Report which, if accepted, would have provided for the establishment of a body to be known as the Dublin walled city development authority and would have affected part <Col N="2046" /> of the area administered by Dublin Corporation. That amendment did not provide for any consultation with Dublin Corporation in the event of boundary changes.</P>
    <P>Will the Deputy explain to the House why he considers such a provision is necessary in this case when it was not considered necessary in an analogous case last May and when the right of the House to be consulted on the variation of the boundaries of a development area was not considered necessary by him when he introduced a Bill of this nature in 1982?</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment tabled by Deputy Burke and I should like to make some comments on it before I move an amendment in my name.  Whatever Deputy Burke did in 1981 or 1982 or at any other time, the fact is that the amendment before us is one which any Minister should accept as most reasonable.  The Bill is excluding part of the city from the powers of the local authority.  We do not want the Minister to extend that in any way he wishes, on either side north or south, east or west, without referring in any way to the local authority.  The Minister pointed out, that in 1981 or 1982 the then Minister did not see any need for such powers.  Of course, neither the Minister nor the Department ever see any need for consultation with local authorities when they are putting commissions in charge, but in the interests of democracy the Minister should accept the strength of the argument for such consultation before attempting to expand the boundary.  The extention proposed here is very large by any standard.  It is taking the whole heart of the city and making it very difficult for the local authority to administer the remainder because they are deprived of any say or responsibility for what will happen in the centre of the city.  Under this section the Minister wants to take the power at any time to extend the commission's control over the inner city.  I support Deputy Burke's amendment, which seems to me to be eminently logical and reasonable.</P>

      <P>Earlier when speaking on the Bill the Minister referred to the 1982 legislation introduced by me on behalf of Fianna Fáil for the Custom House docks site and in relation to the Dublin walled city authority.  I feel very strongly about both areas and I would remind the Minister that the Taoiseach, then the Leader of the Opposition, spent a considerable time touring the country attacking the proposal to introduce measures to revitalise the centre of Dublin. From March to November 1982, Deputy FitzGerald and his front bench members attacked the Gregory deal.  Deputy FitzGerald then submitted to Deputy Gregory a list of his priorities for the inner city.  Not believing the then Leader of the Opposition, Deputy Gregory supported the Fianna Fáil administration plan.  That was at a time when a general election was imminent.</P>
      <P>Approaching another general election now, the Government are showing great concern for Dublin inner city.  It is a bit late in the day for that.  Thank heaven Dublin Corporation members have shown a very enlightened approach to the needs of the centre city.  The measures they have been taking were outlined in a speech by Deputy Ahern, the Lord Mayor, on Second Stage of this Bill.  All the items provided for in this Bill are taken from a schedule of work laid down by the corporation, much of which is already under way, including pedestrian ways and other such projects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we are to debate the Bill in a constructive way we should look at all the provisions in it rather than considering who did what, where, why and when. The Minister was reasonable when he said it is not his intention to extend the area covered by the First Schedule.  He made it clear that the area scheduled as the central area would not be extended. I am asking the Minister to clarify that in the legislation.  He should take to himself the power to reduce the area when it has been improved to the standard required. If he wants the power to extend the area, he should at least give the elected members of the corporation the ability <Col N="2048" /> either to agree or to disagree with any proposed extension.</P>
    <P>We have heard quite a lot from the Minister and the Government about the devolution of power to local authorities. We had it in a debate last week when we had a bit of a charade about devolving powers in regard to local authority rents, when city and county managers were given powers to increase rents without involving the democratically elected members.  In a press release on 14 August that was described as &ldquo;a devolution of powers to local authorities&rdquo;.  During the local elections campaign of 1985 much play was made of the desirability of devolving powers to local authorities. Indeed we had the postponement of those elections from 1984 to 1985 on the basis that the Government wanted to introduce legislation to give extra powers to the local authorities.  Of course, those powers were never given.  The Minister has admitted that he does not want to extend the area included in the First Schedule.  Therefore, I ask him to accept the amendment providing for the consent of Dublin Corporation for any extension.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Burke has not addressed the question I posed as to why his attitude is now different regarding a virtual veto power to the local authorities in this instance: he did not see the need for such a power in the Urban Development Bill, 1982, or indeed when he proposed amendments to set up a development authority for the walled city area.  It is interesting to note that as late as May this year the Deputy did not see a need for such a provision.  Reference was made to the opposition to the 1982 Bill.  That opposition was based quite simply on the fact that the Bill was providing for two authorities and it gave to the Minister of the day the absolute power to establish any authority in any area when and where he chose and for as long as he chose.  At the time it was felt that would give too wide a power to the Minister.  Deputy Burke agreed with that last May when he indicated the Minister should have power to establish a myriad <Col N="2049" /> of development authorities wherever a need for them arose.</P>
      <P>We took a different view, that in each instance of a single function authority being established it should be done by a special piece of legislation in which the specific purpose of the proposed authority should be set out, its functions, powers and life span, and that if the Government of the day envisaged a need for doing such a thing the Government should be prepared to commit Exchequer funds to it.  All of those matters are provided for in this Bill.  In the Bill which I referred to earlier, these things were not provided for.  There was to be no life span, no defined area of responsibility, no definition of when or in what part of the country the Minister might establish an authority from time to time, and no provision whatsoever for Exchequer funds to be made available.</P>
      <P>The approach here is fundamentally different.  It is that, if a move like this is being taken, it should be done by a specific power of the Oireachtas, that the Oireachtas should have explained to it the reasons the Executive seek to take such a decision, that there should be a limited time span given to the activities of the commission after which when the work is satisfactorily completed, the area would be returned to the care and maintenance of the relevant local authority. That is what is being provided for in the Bill now before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take the opportunity to reiterate my opinion that I doubt it will be found necessary to change the boundaries which are set out in the Schedule to the Bill.  Certainly, as things stand, I have no intention of seeing those boundaries changed.  I would have to confess, perhaps with a slight sense of irony, that there seems to be a growing Munster interest in the establishment of this commission. The House will remember the lengthy contribution by Deputy Lyons last week.  I notice that the political correspondent of a newspaper published in Deputy Lyons' county complained strongly about the condition of the street running from O'Connell Bridge to Butt <Col N="2050" /> Bridge.  He suggested that a test of the success of the commission would be how well that street was improved and to what extent it was found possible to remove the standing points for CIE buses in the street.  In fact, if you examine the Schedule to the Bill, only a little less than half of that street is being included and yet already the suggestion has been made that a test of the commission and of my bona fides would be how well the commission operated in bringing about a material change and improvement in the entire length of that street.</P>
    <P>It is probably unrealistic not to accept that from time to time people will make reference to areas on the periphery of the statutorily defined boundaries of the commission and expect that the commission should be involved in improvement schemes for those areas.  I would not envisage that that type of observation ought to lead to an extension of the commission's functional area.  The area essentially is the spine of the central streets, with the streets which are put onto that spine being included, normally for a distance of about 50 to 75 yards.  Part of the reason for containing the commission's area to that narrow strip was to concentrate their minds on the central area and invite them to devote all their time and resources to improving that central area.  Obviously, the wider the boundaries are extended the more attention will have to be given to a larger area and consequently, perhaps, the less successful over the overall area would be the activities of the commission.</P>
    <P>The provision as it is defined in section 2 is quite a normal one in legislation of this type.  I do not want to be contentious, but I have to say that it goes further than the Urban Development Areas Bill did in 1982, through the provision in subsection (4) allowing the Houses of the Oireachtas to pass a resolution annulling any modifying order which might be made by the Minister.  A provision similar to that was not included in the 1982 Bill.  It is reasonable, while the commission are being established by virtue of the enactment of this Bill by the House and the administrative area of the commission is set out <Col N="2051" /> in the Schedule to this Bill which one would hope would be adopted by this House, that any modification of the area being proposed by the Minister would be subject to the power to annul such an order by the Houses that established the commission in the first place.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to labour the point.  We have 21 amendments here and I shall not continue the debate on this amendment.  However, it is significant that the Minister, every time that he contributed, emphasised that it is not his desire or his intention to extend the boundaries of the commission.  Therefore, it is quite reasonable on this side of the House to ask, if he feels so strongly about not increasing the metropolitan area that, on Report Stage, he alter the Bill to allow him to take power to reduce the boundaries but, if he is to increase them, to take into account the genuine rights and consent of Dublin Corporation members in view of his party's and his Government's commitment to the whole area of devolution of powers.  Obviously, I will not succeed in changing the Minister's mind on this.  I thank Deputy Mac Giolla for his support.  The merits of the case are quite obvious.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 4, to delete lines 24 to 30 and substitute the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(4) Whenever an order is proposed to be made under this section, a draft of the order shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and the order <Col N="2052" /> shall not be made until a resolution approving of the draft has been passed by each such House&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The section says that where the Minister makes such an order to extend the boundaries of the Metropolitan Streets Commission area, such order made under this section is to be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas and the section goes on to say that if a resolution is passed within the next seven days annulling the order, then such order shall be annulled accordingly. In other words, if no such resolution is placed before the Houses annulling the order, the ministerial order goes through without any debate or reference to it.  My amendment provides that a ministerial order shall not be made until a resolution approving the draft has been passed, in other words making it a positive proposal.</P>
    <P>My experience on a previous occasion was that, certainly as far as The Workers' Party were concerned, where we wished to bring in a resolution annulling a ministerial order we were unable to do so. There was an occasion when such an annullment resolution had to be brought in within 21 days and, due to the procedures of the House, we were unable to bring in such a resolution.  It is likely that on this Bill such difficulty might again occur.  If the Minister decided in six to eight months' time that he wished to extend the boundaries dealt with by the commission from O'Connell Street down to Capel Street on one side and from O'Connell Street down to Gardiner Street on the other side, if no resolution were brought before the House to annul it, it would go through within seven days.</P>
    <P>I am proposing in this amendment that it should be incumbent on the Minister where he places a draft order before the Houses of the Oireachtas to see that a motion is put to the Houses approving the draft order.  If it is approved, the ministerial order goes ahead but if not, the order is annulled.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I hate to admit it but the Deputy has me in a somewhat embarrassing position on this matter.  I have <Col N="2053" /> said in the House previously that, as a general principle, I am in favour of the provision of affirmative orders.  I invite the House to consider the matter for a moment.  Where the substance of legislation which is to be of a lasting nature is sought to be altered by ministerial order, it is not only fair and reasonable but better parliamentary procedure that this should be done by affirmative order rather than by annulling provisions.  In this case, the Bill is to establish a commission which would operate for a period of three years.</P>
      <P>I have already indicated in relation to Deputy Burke's amendment that I do not think it likely that the boundaries of the commission will be altered during their lifetime.  However, if for some reason a compelling enough case were made for an alteration, because the normal dates of parliamentary sessions could mean that quite a length of time &mdash; literally months &mdash; could elapse before the House would have the opportunity to address itself to the passing of an affirmative motion, during that time the commission would not be in a position to operate within the proposed area of extension or to shed their responsibilities within the proposed reduction.  For that reason subsection (4) was framed in such terms.</P>
      <P>I must also confess to being a little surprised to hear the Deputy say that he was unable to enter an annulling resolution to an order in connection with some previous legislation.  Without wanting to suck the Chair into the debate, I would have thought that, if a motion to annul an order made under a subsection of a section similar to this was put before the House, the House would have felt itself obliged to address itself to such a motion.  Perhaps the Chair might be able to advise the House as to the situation in that case.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his valuable general comment to the effect that he generally favours affirmative orders in regard to permanent legislation. Affirmative orders are much more desirable.  Under this section an annulling order must be made within seven days.  I have not put down an amendment to that provision.  The point I am making to the Minister is that, difficult as it is to bring in an annulling order with 21 days &mdash; we found it impossible, although perhaps we did not go through the correct procedures &mdash; in the case of most legislation of this nature where ministerial orders are referred to, it would be impossible to get an annulling order within seven days, due to the rather cumbersome procedures in this House.  The provision is that it must be done within seven sitting days after the order is laid before the House.</P>
      <P>Most legislation I have seen going through the House allows for annulment of ministerial orders within 21 days. While the Minister is generally in favour of affirmative orders, he feels that in this case an annulling order is appropriate because it is not permanent legislation but is to last only for three years.  In view of the fact that the Minister has cut to one third the time for annulling an order, and since he is not prepared to accept the amendment, I hope at least he will reconsider the provision for seven days, possibly after some consultation with the Ceann Comhairle or with the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, if that would be appropriate.  In view of the difficulties for Deputies in putting down an annulling order, the Minister may consider that seven days is a rather unreasonable time.  I hope he will consider this matter, even if he is not prepared to accept the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment proposed by Deputy Mac Giolla because it is vital to the argument made by the Minister for not accepting the previous amendment which I proposed.  He made the strong case that he was giving to the Oireachtas the power to examine any order being put forward with regard to possible extension of the streets laid <Col N="2055" /> out in the Schedule.  If he is serious about that issue of giving power to the Oireachtas, he must give it in an affirmative way rather than in the manner laid out in section 2 (4).  It must be on the basis of a positive decision being taken by this House to extend it.</P>
      <P>The Minister argued about the previous legislation introduced in 1982 where the Minister of the day was taking on powers to extend without the confirmation of this House.  It is vital that there should be a positive resolution in this House.  In arguing against Deputy Mac Giolla's point the Minister said that if the Dáil were in recess and if we suddenly wanted to extend the schedule of streets it would be necessary to go ahead with the work without waiting for the Dáil to come back.  According to the Minister's wording, the order may be changed within seven sitting days.  Therefore, the Minister is not suggesting that an order be made, say, in July one year and that because the Dáil does not resume until October in the meantime the commission will operate in regard to extended streets in August and September. The power is always there, in the first seven sitting days after the House resumes, to change the order of the Minister. It is reasonable to expect that the commission would not take any action on any extension of their boundaries pending the expiry of those seven sitting days.</P>
      <P>It is important for the Minister to follow his principle which he has enunciated on a number of occasions with regard to the desirability of affirmative orders.  The whole principle in relation to the original amendment, as outlined by the Minister was that this House would take the decision of extending the streets to be included in the area of responsibility of the commission.  If that principle is to be followed &mdash; as the Minister enunciated it this morning &mdash; it can be done only by accepting the amendment proposed by Deputy Mac Giolla rather than the Minister adhering to what he has written in subsection (4).</P>

      <P>I am not sure whether it <Col N="2056" /> is a good or bad thing but Deputy Mac Giolla appears to be inviting me to put on the record my views as to the way the amendment of legislation by orders ought to be approached as a general principle. I have a vague suspicion that I did this in a debate at the commencement of this Dáil in relation to changes proposed by the then Leader of the House.  I reiterate my belief that affirmative orders constitute the proper way for Parliament to approach power to be given to Ministers for the variation of legislation which does not have time limitations on it.  In this case the commission are to have a limited lifetime of three years.  For that reason, and another wider one to which I might refer, the insertion of the more normal 21 days in subsections of this type has been reduced to seven days.  Seven sitting days normally would indicate in excess of two sitting weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a general principle the 21 sitting days provision which still obtains in legislation is an anachronism and was of more relevance to a time when life operated at a more leisurely pace.  Very often an order might be made which is, shall we say, of public interest at the time it is made but does not hold the interest of the public or of the Members of Parliament to the same extent 21 sitting days later, which is normally seven sitting weeks.  Indeed it could be substantially later if the order happened to be made during a lengthy recess.  Therefore, whilst 21 days appears to be eminently reasonable it invites Members of the House into a sense of a lack of urgency in regard to addressing its content.  Towards the expiry of the 21 sitting day period the reasons which might have invited them to seek a debate will not be as current or as much an issue of the day as they might have been at the time the order was made.  After all, an order is virtually an extension of the legislation originally debated in detail throughout its various Stages, including a Stage like this which is considerably detailed.  An order made may in some way, vary that legislation. If the House then feels it wants to consider that order in detail it is right it <Col N="2057" /> should do so relatively proximate to the time at which the order itself is made.</P>
    <P>As a general principle, had I introduced more legislation in this House during this Dáil, generally I would have sought to reduce the 21 sitting day provision. As it happened, because of the portfolio within which I found myself, my debates were more often outside this House than with the Members of the House and the opportunity afforded me to introduce legislation was limited.  I addressed this point previously.</P>
    <P>Because the commission will have a three year lifetime, on the same principle I enunciated in that regard if an order is made to vary the boundaries of the commission and if the House thinks it is right that that order should be annulled, then it is right that the House should make its views known within a reasonable period after the order seeking to vary the boundaries has been made.  Seven sitting days would indicate a period of between two and three weeks after the order had been made.  Again, in the context of the limited lifespan envisaged for the commission that is reasonable.  It is not unique in legislation.  It was included in the Local Government Services (Corporate Bodies) Act, 1971.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The more the Minister speaks about this amendment the more he confirms the need for it.  In replying to my original amendment to this section, the Minister made the point that if there was to be any extension under previous legislation it would have to be done by order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is making the point here that we have discussed on Second Stage and will have discussed in the House when the Bill is passed the principles behind this Bill so that it is quite all right then to extend any area by order, the general principle of the legislation having been accepted.  The only saving point he attempted to use was on the basis that the provisions of this Bill have a limited life of three years and, therefore, any extension of the streets will not matter very much.  If it will not matter very much why introduce it in the first place?  The <Col N="2058" /> Minister makes the point that the whole area being covered by the commission will be very important because it encompasses the heart of our capital city.  Therefore, any alteration to it will be equally important and should have, if not the consent of the relevant local authority, at least that of the Oireachtas here in an affirmative way rather than in the manner laid down by the Minister.</P>
    <P>The Minister has mentioned 21 days, giving the impression that it was 21 days which was written into Deputy Mac Giolla's amendment.  I had to confirm for myself that 21 days was not written into Deputy Mac Giolla's amendment.  All he asked was that:</P>
    <P>Whenever an order is proposed to be made under this section, a draft of the order shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and the order shall not be made until a resolution approving of the draft has been passed by each such House.</P>
    <P>The setting of the order of the House is a matter for the Government of the day. Having made an order, if they want, they can bring that order before the House on the very next sitting day, have a debate and have it passed here.  It is a very important matter to extend further the yardage within the heart of our city, to take it away from our democratically elected members, giving it to an unelected commission. That case has been made strongly by the Minister in regard to previous legislation proposed in this area. Therefore, the Minister should accept Deputy Mac Giolla's amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to extend the discussion on this because there are important sections coming up. However, I want to make the point that the boundary of the area which the commission will control constitutes the very nub of the whole Bill.  If this commission propose to deal with Westmoreland Street and D'Olier Street only, I do not think anyone would kick up much of a fuss.  The area selected, from St. Stephen's Green to Cavendish Row, is the centre and nub of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2059" /> The commission will have charge of that section of the city and they will not have to consult in any way with the local authority.  They will have more powers than the local authority ever had and they will have plenty of money.  When that is passed by the Dáil &mdash; the Minister must agree that there has been considerable opposition to the Bill &mdash; the Minister can at any time extend that boundary.  It is not as if the ministerial order was on some other section of the Bill so that the Minister could give extra power to the commission; it is the actual extension of the boundary of the area over which this Bill gives the commissioners more control. That is why we regard this ministerial order as having immense effect. The ministerial order can extend the boundary and therefore it should be incumbent on the Minister to see that an affirmative order is passed by the Oireachtas.  The Bill which will give the commission power over this section of the city will have to be passed by the Oireachtas.  That is the whole purpose of the Bill.  By one sweep the Minister can extend that power to cover other sections of the city.  Therefore, while it is all right for the Minister to say that it is not as important as permanent legislation because the commission will only be in power for three years, nevertheless the fact that the Minister can extend the area of operation at any time during that three years alters the whole basis of the Bill. For that reason the Minister should adopt the principle with which he generally agrees.  That is the purpose of the amendment.</P>
    <P>I have no amendment down in regard to the seven days.  I made the point that it makes it even more difficult to get an annulment order through in seven sitting days rather than in 21 sitting days.  I do not think it does much for the Government's image of reform of the Dáil to say that seven sitting days amounts to over two weeks.  A recommendation should be made so that seven sitting days would be just over one week. Taking into account the various procedures that will have to be gone through <Col N="2060" /> in uncovering the fact that a ministerial order has been made, in the plethora of European and Oireachtas work that comes through, and getting the order through within the appropriate time as there is a time schedule within which it has to be submitted, one and a half to two weeks is not much time to allow Deputies to do the job.  The job should be done by the Minister.  If he wants to make an order extending those powers it must be for some special reason, something new which has occurred and which has not been discussed in the course of the debate.  If for some reason the Minister must extend the powers over this area it is incumbent on him to come before us and tell us why he wishes to do so.  He should put down a motion to affirm his order.  I am sure he would get the agreement if he could prove that there was some reason which did not exist or which was not seen when the Bill was being discussed.  The Minister would have to prove that he was not doing it to annoy the local authority or because some of the commissioners stated that they would like power over another area.  The local authorities would not even be consulted, not to talk of getting their approval, as stated in Deputy Burke's amendment, which would be reasonable.  The Minister would not have to consult or even inform the local authority if he was extending the boundaries of the commission.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>In an effort to meet the Deputy's point and bearing in mind that Deputy Burke mentioned the number of amendments which have yet to be discussed in relation to this Bill, perhaps the Deputy will accept the general principle of what I have been saying.  I would be prepared to give an undertaking to the House that in the unlikely event &mdash; I do not think it will happen &mdash; that I would want to make an order varying the boundaries of the commission I will take the opportunity to bring it before the House for discussion.  I am quite sure that neither the Deputy nor Deputy Burke can envisage in the context of their contributions on Second Stage of this debate, <Col N="2061" /> any greater ogre than becoming Minister for the Environment in so far as the affairs of Dublin Corporation are concerned. If I can give that undertaking I am quite sure that both of the Deputies, in view of their contributions, would feel that anyone other than me would have to have at least a more passive if not a more conciliatory attitude towards the local authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>That is very gracious of the Minister.  I admire his view of himself which, when talking about affirmative orders, I would go along with.  As the Minister has given this undertaking to the House &mdash; it is a major step forward in the debate &mdash; in a general way it confirms the importance of debate in this House. Many people would accuse it of being just a rubber stamp.  We are making progress on this occasion.  We have got confirmation and a commitment from the Minister that if he remains Minister for the Environment he will bring such an order to the House.  It is fair and reasonable to say that it is vitally important that whoever the Minister for the Environment is, from no matter which political party, he should be bound to bring this forward.  I say that in anticipation of an early general election when I have no doubt, the present Minister who described himself in the manner in which he did will no longer be the Minister for the Environment and there will be a replacement for him.  Even if his political party happened to be re-elected with some other unlikely group to form a Government, it is unlikely that the Minister will be reappointed as there are changes regularly within ministeries.  The life span of any Minister is very short, even shorter than a commission of three years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the Minister has given a commitment and has accepted the principle, I ask him to go that final step.  While I accept fully his good faith and the undertaking he has given, if he feels it necessary to give that undertaking to the House in the light of the arguments put forward by Deputy Mac Giolla and myself, he should accept the amendment and write <Col N="2062" /> that undertaking into legislation.  That is exactly what the amendment is.  It is writing into the legislation that any Minister, no matter which Minister, would have to come back to this House if there was to be an extension.  The Minister has accepted the principle and has committed himself to doing it and it is important that others who will follow him in that Department in the lifetime of this commission should also have to be committed by that undertaking.  The only way that can be done legally is by accepting the amendment as laid down.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>We are dealing here with the reason for this legislation. Section 2 (3) provides that:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dublin Corporation shall in the discharge of its functions have regard to the special importance in the national interest of the Metropolitan Central Area and to the need in that interest <Col N="2063" /> to ensure therein a high environmental standard and a high standard of civic amenity and civic design.</P>
    <P>Dublin Corporation have been aware of the need and if they had sufficient funds they would have made further progress along the lines they have been making in recent years.  There is a greater awareness which was brought around by the pressures of the legislation and the debates that took place in the early eighties and since then on the importance of revitalising our metropolitan area, the heart of our capital city, not just for the benefit of the people in the city centre but of the people of the country.</P>
    <P>There was too much dereliction and we on this side of the House went about demolishing many of the old tenements and replacing them with some very fine local authority housing.  The members of Dublin Corporation, to their credit have given a greater sense of urgency to the need to revitalise our city centre.  The Lord Mayor in his contribution on Second Stage put forward the point that they had a programme of work laid out for themselves and indicated how they were going about it in the city centre area.  They put forward a programme of work on pedestrian ways and amenity projects through the whole of the heart of the city, not directly relating to the spine as laid down by the Minister, Liffey Street and the Halfpenny Bridge and that whole area.  The work is already under way there to revitalise the heart of the city.</P>
    <P>In this Bill the Minister is setting out this metropolitan central area that we are talking about.  It is window dressing by the Minister.  We have seen pictures of him strolling with TV cameras along Grafton Street and O'Connell Street and they are all very nice.  It is a nice sort of publicity to show concern for the city centre, but the main way this Government should show concern for the city centre is by providing sufficient funds for Dublin Corporation to allow them to get on with the necessary work of revitalising the city centre.  They are funds that are <Col N="2064" /> required, not extra commissions or bodies.  It is important to emphasise that on Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 3 is in the name of Deputy R. Burke. Amendment No. 4 is an alternative. Amendment Nos. 3 and 4 may be debated together by agreement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 4, subsection (2), line 37, after &ldquo;members&rdquo;, to insert &ldquo;and these shall include elected representatives of Dublin Corporation.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>It is very important that here we have the establishment of a Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission.  The Minister is going to establish the commission and he sets out that the commission shall consist of a chairman and not more than six ordinary members.  We believe that those six ordinary members should include elected representatives of Dublin Corporation. I go along with Deputy Mac Giolla's amendment that no fewer than three ordinary members should be members of Dublin Corporation nominated by the elected members of the corporation. That is right and reasonable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dublin Corporation members are the democratically elected representatives of the people in the city of Dublin so elected in the election of 1985, where for the first time the Fianna Fáil Party got 50 per cent of the membership of the corporation.  It is vitally important that those members should have a say in this matter.  It is important to remember that only since June 1985 have our party had this strong voice in the corporation numerically and we have been tackling the problem of the centre of our city under the previous Lord Mayoy, Deputy Tunney, and the present Lord Mayor, Deputy B. Ahern.  Now their functions will be abolished by this <Col N="2065" /> Minister in relation to the central spine of our capital city.  Membership on this authority should not be confined to just the manager of the corporation as the Minister suggested on Second Stage Those who should be there are the democratically elected members of the corporation. I go along with the point made by Deputy Mac Giolla and Deputy De Rossa in their amendment that they should be democratically elected members nominated in turn by the corporation.</P>
    <P>We have seen the situation in relation to the hospital board in Tallaght and the Dublin Transport Authority.  In the case of the hospital the members nominated by the health board have not been accepted by the Minister.  In the DTA there was an attempt by the Minister for Communications to wriggle off the hook of the legislation and try to nominate his own pet democratically elected members as distinct from those nominated by the local authority involved.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I ask the Minister to accept this principle of democracy as laid out in the amendments before him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Burke said, the purpose of our amendments is to have representated on the commission the elected members of the local authority. It is not intended that they would dominate or anything like that.  The Minister is still going to appoint a chairman and a majority of the members, but if the commission are to work in any reasonable way and have any reasonable relationship with the local authority, it is essential to have elected members of the local authority on the commission, whether it is the Lord Mayor or whoever else.  I would suggest that the elected members nominate people from among their own members for the commission.  It would be bad if the Minister appointed a purely ministerial commission or if the commission were appointed on political grounds.  Possibly the Minister has in mind bringing in experts in the field but such experts can also be very dangerous because they may want to start putting into operation some ideas of their own <Col N="2066" /> that they have been developing and see this as their chance to put them into effect.</P>
      <P>How they are to be received by the people living and working in the area is another matter.  There must be checks by reasonable people who know the city and something about its difficulties and the administration of it.  The experts may have brilliant ideas but may not see the snags in them before they start putting them into operation.  It is therefore appropriate, from the point of view of local democracy, that there be some feedback to the local authorities so that we will know exactly what is happening.</P>
      <P>Local authorities in Dublin city and in other parts of the country have representatives on the local health boards, on the vocational education committees and on the port and docks board.  The local authority always have representatives on these other authorities within their area of jurisdiction, and that principle should be extended to the commission.  This would make for a better working relationship between the local authority and the commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had considerable debate on Second Stage regarding the purpose of this commission and on what the duties and obligations of the commissioners would be.  I hope the commission members will give a great deal of their time and their expertise in a concentrated way to make the work of the commission successful over a limited lifespan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I assure the House that my approach to appointing the commissioners would be to invite people with a proven record of success and expertise in particular fields and who would have to offer a contribution grounded in sound commonsense. As we all know, the duties of people in public life are particularly onerous.  Many members of the corporation, for example, are also members of this House or the other House.  The normal day to day duty of those elected members to attend not just Dublin Corporation and meetings of its many committees, but meetings of various other <Col N="2067" /> bodies to which they virtually automatically assign themselves by virtue of being members of the corporation, means that they are very busy people indeed.  The corporation is a multi-functional authority with a myriad of responsibilities over a very large administrative area and the demands made on its members are numerous.  I admire the work done by elected members at local level and I have never lost an opportunity to express my admiration for the commitment of the members of local authorities generally.  But what I am trying to do here is to establish a commission to carry out, in a very short period of time, intensive work in a limited but vitally important area.  Deputy Burke may call it window dressing.  Perhaps in a way, that is exactly what it is.  This is the central area of the capital city.  In many respects it is the window on Dublin and the window on Ireland.  Perhaps that is precisely what we should do, dress that window to display the centre of our city, part of our architectural heritage.  We want to make it look as well as possible. We want to ensure that the people charged with the responsibility of lifting it to a high standard over a limited period of time can devote as much as possible of their time and talents to doing that.  In that case it is reasonable to ask people from other aspects of life to come and to serve on this commission in a committed way and to give an unusual amount of their own time to making the work of the commission a success.</P>
    <P>When the 1982 Bill was being enacted there was no such talk.  Likewise, when the Urban Renewal legislation was being enacted in May last, providing for the establishment of the Custom House Dock Authority, I do not think that this point was dwelt on in as much detail or by way of amendment as has been the case today.  I would like to think that whatever else the Members of the House might accuse me of, they would not accuse me of seeking to denigrate the role of public representatives.  In general terms there is a case to be made for <Col N="2068" /> suggesting that where special function authorities are being established for a limited lifespan their membership should be drawn from areas other than the existing corps of elected representatives with all of their existing myriad of responsibilities.  What we want to do is to invite people to concentrate their minds on a particular task, whereas with the existing public representatives we are talking about a body of people who are already devoting all their minds to a myriad of tasks.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>That argument does not hold up when one takes into account that the Minister said he would appoint the Dublin city manager to be part of this commission.  If there is one man in this city who should have his mind on a myriad of tasks, it is the Dublin City manager.  He is not only the city manager, he is the city and county manager with a network of assistant managers.  He is dealing with one third of the population. The Minister's argument is that he wants as members of the commission people who can devote all their time to the working of this commission; yet the one man he is appointing is already involved in a myriad of tasks.  Admittedly, he would be very suitable because of his knowledge of the city, but as far as the time aspect is concerned, I find the Minister's argument extraordinary.  The Minister is asking us to accept the argument that this man who is dealing with one third of the population should become a member of this commission. He says he will have the unlimited time needed to devote himself to the work involved, but the 52 members of Dublin Corporation will not have time to devote to the work of this commission.  If the corporation members have the right to nominate three members of the commission, the members selected will give of their time.  They will be in a better position to do this than the one man the Minister said he will nominate as a member of the commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said he wanted people on the commission who had good, sound common sense.  One of the principal attributes of any democratically elected <Col N="2069" /> members is good, sound common sense. People elect representatives because they feel they have common sense that, although they may not be experts in specific fields, they will be able to make a rational judgment on any issue that comes before them, and they are able to sift the advice they get and make a decision showing sound common sense. I am sure the Minister did not intend it but there are some members of the local authority who would take offence if they were excluded because the Minister considered they did not have sound common sense.  I suggest that these democratically elected representatives, chosen by the people of Dublin to take care of their city, would be the ideal people to be appointed by their corporation members to sit on this commission and put the spotlight on the city of Dublin.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned window dressing and the necessity to tidy up the city. Nobody is arguing about the need to tidy up the city, but if the corporation were given sufficient funds they would carry out this work.  I am not talking about the window dressing of the city of Dublin and the need to tidy it up; I am talking about the cosmetic exercise and the window dressing by the Minister to tidy up his own image and that of his Government.</P>
    <P>In my view the case for democratically elected members of Dublin Corporation to be nominated by their own members to serve on this commission is unanswerable. The answers the Minister gave to the arguments put forward by Deputy Mac Giolla and me merely confirmed why members of the corporation should sit on this body.  These people are elected because of their common sense and they have the time and the expertise needed. I believe the Minister has made a case why he should accept these amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has spoken of the great problems faced by the members of Dublin City Council and how difficult they would find it to serve on this commission.  He said this would mean more work for them, as if he did not want to overburden them and wanted to relieve them of the pressures involved. <Col N="2070" /> I do not believe that was in his mind when he was drafting the section.  I believe he took the view that this was a big job which would be outside the scope of the elected members and that super efficient experts would have to be brought in to carry out the job without any messing by elected local representatives.</P>
      <P>I want to remind the Minister that a far bigger job, with many millions of pounds involved, was carried out by the elected representatives in Dublin Corporation, Dublin City Council and officials of Dublin Corporation who set up an inner city committee.  They worked together and carried out a massive population movement from the Summerhill, Gardiner Street, Waterford Street and Killarney Street area.  They levelled all the houses in that area and carried out a rebuilding programme with new parks, new houses, shops, pubs, and a planned VEC school at the back of the Gresham Hotel.  They rebuilt the area and brought families back to it, all without any fuss, publicity or bother.  If that job had not been done there is no way any commission could do anything with O'Connell Street.  Five or six years ago there was a great deal of crime in the area, bad housing and so on, all affecting the population of the area and, therefore, the O'Connell Street area which will be the responsibility of this commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The elected representatives of Dublin Corporation and the officials carried that job most efficiently in consultation with the people of the area.  If that job had been attempted by a ministerial commission there would have been riots because they would not have taken into consideration what the people wanted, where they wanted to go, and so on.  That was a much more massive job than this fiddling job being given to this commission with an expenditure of £10 million.  This is a very simple job.  Dublin Corporation have great experience in this area because they have carried out similar work.  If they had the powers and the money they would not have any difficulty. As regards the members of the local authority, they would be delighted to elect members to sit on the commission.  The <Col N="2071" /> elected members of the city council could pursue this task for which the commission are being set up over a three year period and could report back to the local authority on progress.  The members nominated by the local authority would do this job as their primary job.</P>

      <P>Exactly, and they could report back to the city council. These members could devote as much time to this task as could the commission as they could see it as their primary task. The Minister need not worry about the members being overloaded with work as this task would be the only major work they would do during their period of office.</P>
      <P>The Minister should ensure we have a commission who will not bulldoze their way through, irrespective of what people think.  Whatever they do will be under scrutiny and they could cause great problems if they bulldoze their way through without consultation.  A good liaison with the local authority is vital if the commission are to do their job.  The best way to do this is to appoint some elected representatives, to accept either my amendment or Deputy Burke's amendment.</P>

      <P>When the commission are appointed, the city manager will be on that commission, so there will be a link between the corporation and the commission.  There has been a huge furore about what the commission will do.  Anybody who walks down O'Connell Street or Grafton Street will be able to see what the commission will do.  Nothing has happened to improve those streets in the past number of years.  There is no point in saying resources are not available.  An attempt was not even made to keep the streets in reasonable order.  The Minister during Second Stage debate invited Members to walk the streets and note that the basic <Col N="2072" /> standards have been allowed to deteriorate over the years.  One questions why this is happening.</P>

Had I accepted Opposition amendments to the Urban Renewal Bill we would not have needed legislation to set up this commission; we could have set it up by order.  However we were in favour of doing this on the basis of specific legislation. Nobody will disagree that this city, particularly the main streets, should be to a high standard.

      <P>Deputy Mac Giolla threw cold water on this idea and I was entitled to reply to him.  We are setting up a commission to do a special job and when the job is done responsibility will be handed back to the local authority who we hope will maintain the high standard that will be set by the commission in the interests of our city.  We have a link with the local authority in that the city manager will be on the commission. People do not understand what we are about here.  The whole idea is a contract to bring the streets to a very high standard. It is not as if we were taking away responsibility for good.  We are merely doing so for a period of time after which we will ask local authorities to ensure maintenance at that standard.</P>

      <P>Listening to the Minister of State filling in for the Minister one could be excused for forgetting that he was Lord Mayor of the city a few years ago.  The city's condition &mdash; not just the main streets &mdash; is the result of lack of administration, control and direction by the Coalition when they controlled the corporation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said that the Opposition do not understand the Bill.  We certainly do, it is about window dressing.  The Minister confirmed the appointment of the City and County Manager to the commission which is against all the arguments the Minister of State made for not accepting elected members of the corporation. The Minister of State said that they should not be accepted because they were so busy that they would not have time to <Col N="2074" /> devote themselves to the work of the commission.  The official to be appointed, the City and County Manager, is probably the busiest man in the county as he has overall responsibility for one third of the population.  Democratically elected members of the corporation are refused the right to membership of the commission. The Minister said they will be too busy to concentrate on the commission but, as Deputy Mac Giolla said, it would be easy to arrange for elected members to concentrate on the commission only and not to be involved in other committees of the corporation.  I am sure members involved would be willing to devote their time to the commission and report back to their colleagues at monthly meetings.  It is very important for the principle of democracy which is so often trumpeted by this administration, that the commission as part of their membership would have democratically elected members of the corporation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>As a member of Dublin Corporation and as someone who has spoken in the past about the qualities of the officials and the commitment of members of the corporation I support the point made by the Minister.  There is a basic contradiction in the point made by Deputy Burke and others on the Opposition. The purpose of the Bill and the need for fast action has been explained. If ever there was a Bill which should have been non-partisan and non-political it is this, a Bill which has been welcomed by the vast majority of Dubliners.  However, the Bill has been totally politicised by the Opposition.  They are saying that Fianna Fáil have a majority in Dublin Corporation and that if three or four members are appointed by the corporation they will all be from Fianna Fáil. Fianna Fáil have opposed this Bill in principle and in detail and we are expected to believe that they would now support the scheme to the best of their ability.  A Minister who would accept a corporation with a hostile majority and expect them to co-operate with the objectives of the <Col N="2075" /> Bill would not have his full mental faculties.</P>
      <P>The Bill is important and should be passed very quickly.  This proposal would militate against speed and the efficient operation and achievements of the Bill. By all means let us have the fullest liaison with the corporation and keep the members and officials fully informed.  Let us work in a co-operative way with the members of the corporation.  To do what the Opposition suggest would almost certainly mean a slowing up of the work of the Bill and would perhaps lead to the frustration of its most important objectives.</P>

      <P>Deputy Manning's intervention has been most unfortunate because he has given credence to a suggestion made on Second Stage that the commission were established because the Coalition had lost their majority on <Col N="2076" /> Dublin Corporation.  I did not believe this but Deputy Manning's remarks make me think that there might be something in it. However, I should like to point out that Fianna Fáil do not have a majority on Dublin City Council as one of their members joined the Progressive Democrats. That destroys the point which Deputy Manning made, that since the Minister knows Fianna Fáil would have a majority and would appoint people to the commission he would be very stupid to allow their members on the commission. It debases the whole issue of local democracy and of councillors by introducing a political point into a debate on the right of local elected city councillors to have a place for some of their members on a commission dealing with the heart of the city which they were elected to deal with.  This is being imposed on them and we are speaking about their right to nominate one, two or three members to the commission. Deputy Manning's contribution has reduced the whole question of local democracy to politics.  It is a pity this sort of attitude was introduced because we had been having a very reasonable discussion on the Bill.  It is very important to have representatives from the elected members of the City Council on the commission. That would make for a better relationship.  I do not think the Minister should consider Deputy Manning's point in relation to our amendments.</P>

      <P>I should like to tell the Deputy I do not have any intention of appointing Deputy Manning to the commission. I have no hesitation in giving the undertaking sought by Deputy Burke. We must be careful to try to find people who have a contribution to make.  I should like to give an assurance to the House that the members of the commission will not be drawn on purely party political grounds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to point out that there is nothing in the section that states the Minister shall not appoint members of the corporation to the commission but, as I made clear in the course of the debate on the amendment, that is not my intention. I am sure that view is shared by other Members.  It appears to me Deputy Burke shared that view when he was Minister. In fact, when the Deputy was contributing to the Committee Stage debate on the Urban Renewal Bill last May he said he did not find that Bill in any way anti-democratic but today he is suggesting that the Bill before us puts question marks over the democratic function. I hope the commission will be successful in their work by having as wide a range of advice and consultation as possible available to them.  Apart from the statutory commission I hope we can establish an advisory committee, drawn on a wide range of interests and, perhaps, representing the experts about whom Deputy Mac Giolla has some reservations.  He <Col N="2080" /> felt that, in pursuit of their narrow field of expertise, they might be aware of broader objectives or constraints.  It is my intention that an advisory committee composed of people from various walks of life would serve.  It would provide a useful reservoir of advice for the elected commission.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The appointed commission. I am quite open to the idea that perhaps some sort of consultative committee or grouping from the elected membership of the corporation could be formed who would have continuing dialogue with the commission regarding the work.  When the commission have completed their work in three years it is important that that work will be transferred to the permanent care of the corporation. I chose three years for two reasons: one, to have a defined limit on the life span of the commission and, two, so that the limit would expire before the lifetime of the existing Dublin Corporation. I want the existing corporation to have an opportunity within their lifetime to be responsible again for the administration of that area.  The area will have been lifted and improved to a certain standard and then transferred back to the care of the corporation in perpetuity. I want the responsibility handed over to the corporation before they again get an opportunity to go to the electorate.</P>
      <P>I hope the House will accept I am not appointing the commission, as has been suggested, because of the particular political composition of the corporation at present.  That suggestion is fallacious. Irrespective of how the balance of power exists in the corporation, I would have approached this matter in the same way. Once this is done in a specific piece of legislation which will set out the functions and purpose of the commission, there is provision for the care of the improved area to revert to the corporation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My suggestion that the city manager would serve on the commission was prompted by the desire for a close linkage <Col N="2081" /> on a day-to-day basis between the corporation and the commission.  A day-to-day liaison between the corporation and the commission could best be achieved by having the CEO of the corporation acting on the commission as a member. I was taken aback by some of Deputy Burke's suggestions in this regard.  I do not know if he was advancing them simply as debating points.  If I felt he had a deep belief in them or that he has some deep-rooted objection to the Dublin City manager being appointed on the commission, if he felt that because of his responsibilities the city manager would not be able to give sufficient time and attention to the work of the commission, I would like to hear the Deputy on that.  I suspect he does not believe that.  There will have to be close co-operation between the commission and the various sections of the corporation and, therefore, having the city manager on the commission would provide a useful conduit through which the consultative and co-operative process could continue.</P>
    <P>I suggest there might be a committee of Dublin Corporation members to engage in consultations and to act in an advisory capacity with the general advisory committee that would be appointed. The House might consider that side-by-side with the general advisory committee some members of the corporation might be involved who would have an opportunity to hear the views of experts and others, and those other experts would have the opportunity to hear members of the corporation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The plot thickens.  Now we have got ourselves not only a commission but we are into a general advisory committee which will advise the commission on their work and we have a further suggestion that a committee of the corporation would liaise with the commission.  We started with Dublin Corporation, then we had the Dublin Transport Authority.  Before the transport authority got going taking the powers from the corporation we have this commission taking the powers from the Dublin Transport Authority.  We have <Col N="2082" /> confusion heaped upon confusion.  We now have the commission and a general advisory committee to advise the commission as to how they should do their work.  In a sop to the local authorities the Minister suggests that perhaps we should have a corporation committee as well to liaise with the commission.  Where does the confusion end?</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to my comments on the proposed appointment of the city manager to the commission.  In his argument against accepting democratically elected people to serve on the commission the Minister said that members of the corporation were busy people and would not have time to give to the intensive work in which this commission will be involved.  At the same time he said he would appoint the city manager, the CEO of an area which contains one-third of the population of the entire country. If there is one man in Dublin who has a full-time job it is the CEO of Dublin Corporation.  I was not emphasising the qualities or otherwise of the city manager; I tried to highlight the contradiction in the Minister's argument rejecting the democratically elected members of the corporation on the basis that they are too busy but, at the same time, appointing a man who is administering an area containing one-third of the population of the country.</P>
      <P>The logic escapes me.  The further this goes the more it confirms me in my suspicion that this is a political decision because the membership of Dublin Corporation changed after many years, from being Government-controlled and the Government decided that because they did not have control of the corporation any longer they would appoint a commission to control them.  That changed in 1985 and there is this knee jerk reaction of the Government that since they do not any more have control of it they will take control in a different way with regard to this commission.  The cat was let out of the bag by Deputy Manning and as the debate goes on I am ever more confirmed in my suspicions.</P>

      <P>I have no objection whatsoever to the city manager being appointed to this commission.  It is an excellent idea.  However, that is not the same thing as having elected representatives on the commission and has nothing to do with the argument with regard to elected representatives.  It is good that the city manager will be on the commission.  From the point of view of administration, it is absolutely essential that either he or a Deputy should be appointed.  I am sorry that the idea of having the elected representatives on the commission is not acceptable.  However, the advisory committee idea is a reasonble suggestion by the Minister, to have advice going to the commission other than just having the expertise on the commission. I would be very worried about having another committee as well as the advisory committee, a Dublin Corporation committee which they would feel would be the advisory committee, because there would be argument as to whose advice comes first, or whether they are only an advisory committee to the advisory committee and not to the commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister made the suggestion that perhaps elected members of the city council should be on the advisory committee and that that would be the best type of substitute for having elected members on the commission.  I urge the Minister to have an advisory committee with elected members from the corporation on it and not to have another separate committee after that.  The role of the advisory committee will be decided purely by the Minister, I presume.  We have no input into that in this debate where we are discussing a Bill.  I commend the Minister for suggesting the advisory committee, hoping that he will go through with it and make it in some way representative of the local elected authority, presumably people of the area, business people, although I have a feeling that the Minister will have these people <Col N="2084" /> represented on the commission.  The advisory committee must have people who are concerned with the area if it is to have any effect.  Elected members of the corporation should be on the advisory committee.  The commission should in some way have to listen to or read their submissions and the Minister should see to that.  The commission should not be able to say that they would ignore the advisory committee because they are not mentioned in the Bill, which is quite possible. I hope the Minister will follow up this idea and give it some bit of clout.</P>

      <P>Let me make the point, in my defence and in clarification of Deputy Burke's remark, that my only reason for suggesting a separate consultative committee exclusive of Dublin Corporation members was in an effort in some way to meet some of the points made by Deputy Burke and Deputy Mac Giolla earlier. Quite frankly, I have been endeavouring to approach this debate from the point of view of being reasonable towards some of the points being made.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>My difficulty is that if I respond in this manner I am accused of further confusing the issue, of thickening the plot.  It is difficult to endeavour to be positive in response generally.  Basically, I would like to see some sort of vehicle whereby the elected members could make their views known to the commissioners, not just through the improvement scheme and observations thereon but in relation to the ongoing work of the commission over the three years.  If the work of the commission is successful, that is one thing.  When the work reverts to the care and maintenance of the corporation, I hope that the members will be so pleased with what has been done that they will give particular attention to the special status designation of the central area and will themselves make special arrangements in relation to its ongoing care and maintenance to a high standard.  I was merely endeavouring to meet, at least, the spirit of some of the <Col N="2085" /> contributions which have been made by the two Deputies who have been participating in the debate.  There was nothing more sinister or Machiavellian than within my remarks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately, the waters were muddied by the contribution of Deputy Manning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that if the Minister were sincere in his acknowledgement of and concern for the contribution which the elected members could make, the obvious thing for him to have done would have been to accept the amendment and include elected members on the commission.  That appears to be the obvious result of what he is claiming to have done himself, but in typical fashion he is trying to straddle the two horses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When this affront to the elected members was sold it was on the basis that there was need for work in the centre of the city, that it was not within the capacity of the elected members to do that work, that it was so urgent that the only way it could be done was by the appointment of so-called experts who could have this work carried out.  Now the Minister is telling us that he does not see the work being carried out in that fashion, that it will be necessary to have an advisory committee and also that there will be a third committee consisting of other people, including members of Dublin Corporation.  If there was ever an example of doing things in reverse, this is it.  The elected members of Dublin Corporation, in discharge of their functions, where they feel that they have not the necessary competence in respect of art and culture establish advisory committees and that is what should have happened in this case.  If it was felt that there was some contribution that could be made by anybody other then the elected members, then it should have been indicated to them that they should proceed to have this business done and it could be indicated that they might employ the advisers who have been spoken about <Col N="2086" /> here, but I revert to my earlier position on this.</P>
    <P>The legislation is unnecessary.  It would not be before the House where it not for the fact of the changed circumstances in respect of the elected members of the corporation.  This particular aspect that we are discussing now would have been satisfied and representation would have been given except for the fact that, on examination of the figures it was discovered that the Fianna Fáil Party would have to have greater representation than any other party.  That is the sole reason. Having accomplished the initial part of a conquest to demonstrate that they were not the elected members of Dublin Corporation who were doing this but rather a benign Minister we are back to accepting the reality of the position, that is, the competence of the elected members of Dublin Corporation to discharge their functions.  In a backhanded way we are saying: &ldquo;All right, we will take them because we know they have something to offer now and we will make provision to have them included.&rdquo;  As I see it, no self-respecting elected member of Dublin Corporation would accept a position inferior to that of people who have not been elected at all.</P>
    <P>In the matter of our esteemed city manager I have listened to the Minister and to Deputy R. Burke.  I venture to say that the point made by Deputy R. Burke was that if, on the one hand, the Minister argued that the nature of this work was such that it could not be undertaken by busy elected representatives, he would have to accept that that argument of his was being defeated in circumstances in which he invited the city manager, who was equally busy, to accept membership of the commission.  That point made by Deputy Burke is the one I would make myself.  The city manager is very much busier than any of our elected representatives. Surely if it is being maintained that the elected representatives are so busy that they could not accept membership of the commission, it must be accepted also that the city manager is equally busy and, accordingly, not as <Col N="2087" /> qualified as other people to serve on that commission.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. J. Doyle Mr. J. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I heard a number of speakers on the opposite side of the House this morning say that the Bill before us was introduced because the main Opposition party had a majority on Dublin City Council.  That is not true. They have not a majority because, for the election of the Lord Mayor, they had to depend on votes from other parties.</P>
      <P>The Minister speaks of an advisory committee.  The elected members of Dublin Corporation, in a sense, constitute an advisory committee.  Under the managerial Act many of their functions now are of a managerial or executive nature and elected members can advise the city manager only.  I am glad to note that the city manager has been appointed to the commission.  One of the important roles of the commission will be to combine the executive and co-ordinating functions essential to their satisfactory working.  The city manager can constitute the linchpin in that area.</P>
      <P>I endorse what Deputy Mac Giolla has just said, that when the Minister is appointing the members of the commission he should bear the business community in mind.  In recent times Dublin Corporation have made positive efforts to upgrade the inner city.  An example of this is the paving of Mary Street and Henry Street in which the business community supported Dublin Corporation financially.  With that goodwill on the part of the business community they should be borne in mind by the Minister for representation on the commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not believe the Minister would share Deputy J. Doyle's view that Dublin Corporation constitute merely an advisory body to the city manager. A corporation or local authority are a democratically elected body having specific reserved powers to do a lot more than advise a manager whether of Dublin Corporation or any other local authority. On the point made by Deputy J. Doyle with regard to the work being done by <Col N="2088" /> Dublin Corporation on the paving of Henry Street and Mary Street, I should say that is exactly the type of work which forms part of the overall programme which the Minister now intends to be undertaken by the proposed commission. That is the type of programme that had been outlined by Dublin Corporation, much of which was already under way, and confirms our argument that this Bill is not necessary.</P>
      <P>I might refer once again to the position of the city manager.  The Minister asked me a direct question across the House.  I want to answer it because, if I do not, it will be taken that I am saying the city manager is not a suitable person for the position.  I want to emphasise that I have absolute confidence in his ability and commitment to his job.  He would be an addition to the commission or to any other authority or committee on which he was asked to serve.  I want to emphasise that the Minister, for the purpose of the argument, made the point in relation to not allowing members of the commission to be nominated by the elected members of Dublin Corporation on the basis that they were too busy.  Surely the role of the city manager is a far busier one than that of any member of that local authority.  There is no question as to the ability of the city manager.  He is a man of integrity, commitment, dedication to his role, who has shown his ability over a wide range of functions he has undertaken on behalf of the people.  It should be remembered that he is the city manager for a third of the population of this country and, consequently, is a very busy person indeed, which would run totally counter to the argument the Minister put forward as his main reason for not nominating members of Dublin Corporation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be a matter strictly for the elected members of Dublin Corporation to take their decisions as to <Col N="2089" /> whether they would care to participate in the work of any advisory committee.  The Minister has put forward two proposals. He put forward the proposal for a general advisory committee.  There will be the general advisory committee and then there was the suggestion by the Minister of a further liaison or monitoring type committee of Dublin Corporation.  It is strictly a matter for the individual members of Dublin Corporation to decide on their roles.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 4.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 5, subsection (2), to delete lines 4 and 5 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;<i>(a)</i> the transfer of the property and rights of the Commission to Dublin Corporation,&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provisions of this section, as worded, propose that, on the expiry of the life span of this commission of three years, the property, rights and liabilities of the commission shall be transferred to Dublin Corporation.  My amendment proposes the transfer of the property and rights only of the commission to Dublin Corporation and that the Minister take on any other liabilities. This subsection proposal is a bit hard to swallow from the point of view of Dublin Corporation.  They are doing their job in relation to their city.  Their powers are being taken from them by an unelected commission appointed by the Minister for three years.  At the end of those three years they are being asked to take on the liabilities of that commission in whose operations they have had no say.  If the Minister wants to appoint a commission at the end of their term of office the least he can do on behalf of the State is to take on the liabilities of that commission. <Col N="2090" /> That argument cannot be knocked.  Perhaps the Minister would respond at this point.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>As I am sure the Deputy knows, this is a standing provision in relation to the establishment of any body, especially where a time limitation is being put on its operations, that its property, rights and liabilities would be transferred at the end of that period.  In fairness to Deputy Burke, he entered this amendment in conjunction with amendment No. 7 which has been ruled out of order. Because of that, this amendment on its own stands rather strangely.  Were it accepted, the liabilities, if any, of the commission would then be assigned to nobody.  One could only share the fear which the Deputy is expressing if one assumed the commission would act in a totally irresponsible way in the exercise of their functions and that at the end of their period they would have accrued liabilities of a crippling nature which would transfer to Dublin Corporation.  I do not believe there is any real reason to worry about that.  There are specific provisions in sections 10(8) and 12 to enable the Minister by issuing directives to ensure that the commission would operate only within certain parameters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When a similar point was raised in the other House, I said it would be my intention to use those powers, perhaps at the commencement of the last of the three years of the commission's operations, if it appeared there was any danger of liabilities being built up.  It would be totally irresponsible of the commission to operate on the basis of using all the moneys available, accruing outstanding liabilities and handing those liabilities to the corporation at the end of the period.  That would be totally outside the spirit of what the commission are being invited to do and I cannot foresee that this would happen.  I would be tremendously disappointed to think there could be a likelihood of its happening.  There are control provisions in sections 10 (8) and 12 to enable the Minister to move in time to prevent such an eventuality if it <Col N="2091" /> appeared likely.  The form of this provision is standard in relation to the establishment and dissolution of particular bodies set up under statute.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is standard, is it necessary?  Under section 12 the Minister is providing for a situation where he is obligating the corporation to pay all expenses.  If after consultation with the commission there is any disagreement, the Minister reserves to himself the power to say &ldquo;you shall pay&rdquo;.  Since such provision is in section 12, why is it necessary to have another provision, even though it might be standard in respect of the establishment of bodies?  If section 12 were defeated it would be necessary for this provision, but in circumstances where it seems it will be passed, why do we need it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>These are standard provisions which apply to any body established under Statute.  There is nothing sinister in their inclusion in this section. This is the form in which the parliamentary draftsman prepared the section.  It is a standard provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister would consider this point over lunch.  I had not in mind the ordinary expenses of the commission.  Somebody has to pick up the tab for postage and stationery and I believe the Minister should be responsible. I am more concerned about legal responsibility in relation to possible compensation claims.  This commission have as one of their main functions to design an improvement scheme.  If there is a conflict between this improvement scheme and Dublin Corporation's development plan, a property holder may take a case relating to his constitutional rights in relation to his property.  It may be claimed the commission's improvement scheme would damage his property rights as they would have been laid down in the development plan of the corporation. If he or she takes a case against the commission on the basis that property rights have been damaged in any <Col N="2092" /> improvement scheme designed by the commission, what is the position regarding those liabilities?  If the Bill goes through in its present form, the liabilities will be passed to the corporation rather than the Minister.</P>
      <P>My amendment No. 5 states:</P>
      <P>In page 5, subsection (2), to delete lines 4 and 5 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(a)  the transfer of the property and rights of the Commission to Dublin Corporation,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 7, which has been ruled out of order, states:</P>
      <P>In page 5, subsection (2), between lines 12 and 13, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(c)  all the outstanding financial liabilities of the Commission shall, on the dissolution of the Commission, be assumed by the Minister.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I was trying to make the Government responsible rather than passing on potential liabilities to Dublin Corporation. Dublin Corporation would have had no control in the matter and compensation claims could arise simply because they had a development plan in the first place. It is a complex question and I would be grateful if the Minister would set my mind at ease on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand precisely the worry the Deputy is expressing.  Let me give an example of what I would regard as an irresponsible action.  If the commission moved under section 11 to seek to have somebody discontinue a use where there might be possible compensation claims under section 11 (7) and if the commission decided in the 11th month of their third year to serve such a notice, obviously the size of the compensation could not be determined until after the lifetime of the commission and thus, there would be an undefined liability.  I must assume the commission will not act irresponsibly.  The Deputy might consider section 10(8) which allows the Minister from time to time to give the commission a general directive in writing <Col N="2093" /> as to policy regarding the performance of any function assigned to them under the Act.  If during the first two years of the operation of the commission there was a fear grounded in fact that something like this might happen, the Minister could use that power in section 10(8) to direct the commission, for example, that they should not serve any such notices within a period where they would not be in a position to meet any liabilities resulting from them during their lifetime.  That is what I would envisage being done, were it felt necessary.  I do not believe the necessity for this will arise unless the commission act totally irresponsibly, as all of us hope will not happen.</P>

      <P>In accordance with the general practice, I do not propose to say whether or not communications have been received from other Heads of State or Government or to comment on the detail of intergovernmental contacts.  In so far as the courts system in Northern Ireland is concerned, the Deputy will be aware that matters arising from the Intergovernmental Conference, including those related to the administration of <Col N="2094" /> justice in Northern Ireland, are publicised in so far as this is possible in the communiqués issued after each meeting. copies of which are laid before this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Taoiseach's wish to adhere to normal practice in not disclosing communications of a confidential nature between Heads of Government.  However, I would draw his attention to the fact that very positive statements which seem to emanate from Government sources appeared in our newspapers to the effect that such a letter was received.  May I ask the Taoiseach if he would agree with me that the effect of the statement issued by Mr. King, the British Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, clearly indicates that there is not to be any progress in regard to the question of the Diplock courts, that there are not to be any changes instituted in those courts?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that major concerns of the two Governments as set out in Article 7(c) and Article 8 of the agreement are that the security forces in Northern Ireland be more readily accepted by the nationalist community, and the importance of public confidence in the administration of justice through seeking measures which would give substantial expression to this aim.  In this connection the two Governments agreed to consider, <i>inter alia</i>, the possibility of mixed courts in both jurisdictions for the trial of certain offences so long as jury trials are impracticable because of the danger of intimidation of juries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the British Prime Minister has stated, there are difficulties in respect of this proposal which the British Government have not yet been able to see their way around, but that Government have not excluded the possibility of such an arrangement becoming feasible and acceptable as some future time.  In the meantime other methods of ensuring public confidence in the administration of justice have been considered, including three man courts and a series of reforms in the system of justice, a number of <Col N="2095" /> which, as referred to by the Secretary of State in a speech last Saturday, have been welcomed by leaders of constitutional nationalism.  That speech included references to the supergrass trial system which are reassuring.  The Irish Government are continuing to press the issue of the number of judges in the Diplock non-jury courts and will continue to do so pending progress with mixed courts or the achievement of a situation in which a return to jury courts in Northern Ireland becomes practicable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that this question of the Diplock courts is a key issue and is something to which many people look as an instance of good faith or otherwise?

      <P>As far as the Government are concerned our objective is, as set out in the agreement, to achieve public confidence in the administration of justice through seeking measures which would give substantial expression to this aim.  One element in that process could be the changes in the Diplock courts and one change could be either a mixed court or alternatively a three man court.  We have pressed these points with the British Government and will continue to do so.</P>

My first question is if he would agree that this is a key and vital issue and is regarded as such by large sections of the community in Northern Ireland.  Secondly, would he not agree with me that the present position is that there will not be any progress in regard to the issue of the Diplock courts?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The operation of the Diplock courts is and has been a key issue.  In the past there has been concern among the Nationalist community in Northern Ireland and in this State on that <Col N="2096" /> matter.  The question of what changes can be made or need to be made in order to ensure public confidence in the administration of justice is a broad one with many elements.  The one to which the Deputy refers is an important one.</P>

      <P>Can the Taoiseach clear up for us the situation in regard to the statement by the British Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and the fact that the Minister for Justice reacted immediately to that statement and indicated that he regarded it as very positive and encouraging, whereas the following day the Minister for Foreign Affairs indicated that the Government would study the statement by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and then reach a conclusion on it?  May I ask the Taoiseach which of these versions of events is correct? Was the Minister for Justice right in his immediate and instant reaction of optimism to the matter, or was the Minister for Foreign Affairs right when he indicated that the Government were going to study the statement and see what conclusion they would come to?  Would the Taoiseach agree that there is only one conclusion they could come to, that is, that the statement represents no progress whatsoever?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On the contrary, the statement represents significant progress in a number of important areas.  I am surprised that the Deputy should fail to recognise that.  Many aspects of the system of justice in Northern Ireland have given rise to concern and the fact that a number of changes are being made, as announced by the Secretary of State, is encouraging.  I would also point out that the last sentence of this statement was that &ldquo;we must seek constantly to develop and improve the arrangements we make for the administration of justice in terrorist cases&rdquo;.  What we are dealing <Col N="2097" /> with here is an ongoing process including the measures that have been mentioned by him.  These are significant and deal with matters that have given rise in the past to considerable concern.  The unique position in respect of the basis of arrest being grounds for suspicion but not reasonable grounds for suspicion in Northern Ireland is one of the major difficulties there.  It has meant that people have been arrested in respect of whom there were not and could not be shown to be reasonable grounds for suspicion. That change, bringing the law there in line with the law in the rest of the UK, is very important in terms of how the Northern community are dealt with and consider themselves to be dealt with by the security forces.</P>
      <P>The shifting of the onus in bail applications in scheduled cases is also important. Measures taken in regard to admission of confession of evidence are important also, where a very large number of convictions arise from confessions as, indeed, is the case in this State also.  The change there is important as a safeguard.</P>
      <P>The new rights of a suspect in custody to notify somebody within 48 hours that they are in custody, and to have a solicitor, are very important, and were missing for the whole period, including the period of violence of 17 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These measures, all of which are now to be incorporated in the law in Northern Ireland, cannot be dismissed lightly nor can the measures that have been taken to accelerate the process of hearings in Northern Ireland, because the extraordinary length of time that people have been held in custody and in many cases eventually found not guilty has been a major source of grievance and has given rise to a justified feeling of injustice. Quite significant and effective measures which are being taken to speed up the process are very important and are seen as such by the Nationalist community in Northern Ireland, and, I am sure, by the Unionist community, members who have suffered from the same problem of delays.  What the Secretary of State had <Col N="2098" /> to say about supergrass trials was also significant and important.</P>
    <P>The Leader of the Opposition in dismissing these changes is not being himself judicious, or is not giving due weight to matters which for people living in Northern Ireland who have gone through these last 17 years are important.</P>
    <P>Of course, a few issues remain and, as the Secretary of State said, the process is ongoing.  We will continue to seek further improvements in the administration of justice and further improvements under Article 7 (c) in relation to the acceptability of the security forces to the Nationalist community which is also fundamental to the achievement of peace and stability in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach did not deal with my principal question which was the different responses given by two of his Ministers to the statement by the Secretary of State.  The statement which was issued immediately by the Minister for Justice welcoming the proposals as positive and constructive was followed by a different statement from the Minister for Foreign Affairs who said that the Government would be considering them before reaching a conclusion.  Perhaps the Taoiseach will reconcile the two statements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>They are two quite separate issues and I thought I dealt with them in what I have just said.  On the one hand these measures are important and valuable and are greatly welcomed by constitutional Nationalists and perhaps more widely in the community in Northern Ireland.  On the other hand, they do not exhaust the reforms or improvements needed in the system to make it fully acceptable.  The Minister for Justice was reacting to the content of what was included in the Secretary of State's speech and, indeed, effectively expressed the view of the Government in so doing. The Minister for Foreign Affairs is quite rightly concerned, as are we all, with the ongoing process and, as co-chairman of the conference, must be concerned that the matters are not left at this point, <Col N="2099" /> satisfactory though these changes are in themselves, but that further issues are pursued.  These two positions are totally in conformity one with the other.</P>

      <P>I am anxious that negotiations on the future of the GMS should be completed as soon as possible.  As the Deputy will be aware, detailed proposals for a new structure were worked out in discussion with the Irish Medical Organisation but were rejected by their AGM in 1985. Since then negotiations have continued. The IMO have placed prime importance on the issue of superannuation.  This has required further reference by me to the Government for policy decisions.  I <Col N="2102" /> expect to be in a position to resume negotiations shortly.  I am hopeful that there will be sufficient flexibility on both sides to enable a satisfactory outcome to be reached.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Not on a unilateral basis.  The GMS scheme is extremely expensive and, as the Deputy knows, I am strongly of the view that within the framework of drug expenditure substantial savings could be made.  Part of those savings could be availed of with a view to bringing in a particular pension arrangement.

Within the limitations of resources available for the scheme I am prepared to co-operate and to negotiate. Unfortunately, that position on my part has been rejected time and again by the IMO.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory-Indepentent</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he will consider a TV advertising campaign on the dangers of heroin abuse; and if he will seek the support of leading showbusiness and sporting personalities for the campaign.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The Health Education Bureau are currently running a television campaign on the misuse of drugs with the theme &ldquo;The Drug-atmosphere Home&rdquo; and this is scheduled to run up to the end of 1986.  This campaign is consistent with the bureau's view that illicit drugs, including heroin, should be dealt with in the context of substance abuse generally and in the context of a drug-using society.</P>
      <P>The bureau's television campaign is but one aspect of a comprehensive programme for young people on drug education which is currently being promoted in schools and among out-of-school youth through national youth organisations.  In this, I refer to teacher training projects, the development of school materials and the distribution of a wide range of literature.</P>
      <P>The bureau also co-ordinate their activities with health boards and national statutory and voluntary organisations involved in drug education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I share the Health Education Bureau's <Col N="2105" /> view that drug education is best conducted in the context of health education where many issues of social and personal developments concerning young people are dealt with.</P>
    <P>I do not believe, therefore, that a TV advertising campaign on the dangers of heroin abuse would be appropriate at the moment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory-Independent Mr. Gregory-Independent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory-Independent</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that the vast majority of young people who have become heroin addicts live in disadvantaged urban environments where the type of material the Health Education Bureau have so far produced is of little relevance and where indeed education, in the normally accepted sense of the word, has little or no influence on their lives?  In view of that would the Minister not consider, seeing that heroin is one of the most serious social problems today &mdash; there are something in the region of 3,000 addicts in Dublin &mdash; a programme or a campaign such as the one I have mentioned that would have an influence on the people most at risk?  Does the Minister not consider that it is wasteful to direct educational programmes towards people who are not at risk from heroin and at the same time fail to provide the type of campaign that would be geared to those at risk from heroin?  I am sure the Minister is aware of a similar type campaign which was initiated by media personalities in Britain and which has been very successful.  For those reasons will the Minister reconsider his refusal to consider this type of campaign.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The use of a major television campaign such as that being currently conducted in the UK is questionable in terms of combating heroin abuse.  The stressing of the dangers of heroin in a television framework may often throw down a unique challenge to young people to experiment.  There has been severe criticism of the current UK campaign.  Frequently such campaigns lead to a degree of self-fulfilling prophecy in encouraging people to experiment. <Col N="2106" /> Working on the streets, we have examined the problem with the Health Education Bureau.  Persons who experiment do not look at conventional television but watch videos in a different setting.  Using that type of material young persons can frequently be given a more sophisticated appreciation and an adequate understanding of the experiences relating to heroin.  I have some doubts, and these have been confirmed by our experts, that the highly self dramatised account by wealthy popstar showbiz personalities in relation to heroin, does not particularly have any impact on young people and in fact almost at times romanticises heroin. That is a culture we are not anxious to develop.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he will ensure that participation in the social employment scheme does not make a person ineligible for a general medical services card.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The issue of a medical card is a matter for the chief executive officer of the relevant health board.  I have no function in the matter.  Eligibility is determined by reference to the criterion of hardship.  Income guidelines are published annually to indicate the level of income for persons in different circumstances at or below which a medical card will normally be issued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Full account is taken by health boards <Col N="2110" /> of any particular medical or other circumstances of applicants for medical cards.  Similarly, if a medical card comes up for renewal while the holder is engaged in temporary work, such as being a participant in the social employment scheme, full regard is had to the temporary nature of that work.  However, it would be quite inequitable to specify that a category of workers, such as those engaged in the social employment scheme, should be treated preferentially compared to other workers at similar levels of income, particularly when they may not enjoy any greater security of employment than SES workers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a letter here which contains conclusive evidence that the Eastern Health Board cancelled a person's GMS card when he became employed in the social employment scheme and advised him to reapply as soon as the scheme ended.  Obviously, if the normal processing of applications prevailed in this case months would elapse before the card would be reissued to him.  I hope the Minister shares my wish that priority should be given to employing people.  Does the Minister agree that the loss of a medical card could be a distinct deterrent to becoming involved in the social employment scheme which is of very short duration with small pay?  My question only refers to those in the very low income bracket and I hope the Minister will give a direction that people employed under the scheme will not lose their medical card.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The only people who could be at risk of losing a medical card in this regard would be single people.  The figure of £70 is more than 150 per cent of the income guidelines regarding medical cards for single people.  In any event, it is up to the health board when the card is up for renewal to make inquiries and to assess the income and means of the person concerned.  I have not issued any special directions to health boards asking them to withdraw or issue cards.  It is in the framework of the income guidelines. The same would apply to a temporary <Col N="2111" /> single worker employed on a two-day week with Bord na Móna.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>

The Minister must bring in a system which will reverse this position.  In effect, the North-Western <Col N="2113" /> Health Board paid £5.5 million over and above what they should have paid for referrals in 1985.  They made 228 referrals in that year but paid for 3,207 who were referred by consultants and GPs.</P>

We cannot have them on the never never waiting to be paid by the health board some time in the future.

      <P>The estimated cost arising from commissioning the CAT Scanner at Galway Regional Hospital is about £200,000 per annum for some seven head of staff.  In the current difficult financial situation I am simply not in a position to make additional funds on this scale available to the Western Health Board.  However, I have asked the board on a number of occasions to examine the possibility of redeploying existing resources for this purpose from areas of lower priority within their existing services. I have also informed the board that I will consider sympathetically any reasonable proposal which they might make to me in this regard.  To date, I have received no proposals for redeployment from the board.</P>
      <P>I might also point out that it is generally agreed that one CAT Scanner should serve a population of 700,000 people and that there are now four such machines in use in the public hospitals in the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>

The budget for the Western Health Board this year is £116,160,000 including £13.3 million for the GMS provision.  Within the framework of that budget it should be possible for the board to make a proposal to us.  I will not be found wanting in making an effort to bring it on stream.

      <P>Is the Minister aware of the alarm throughout the country at his proposal to reduce the number of health boards?  Will the Minister accept that if the number is reduced it will diminish the extent of local democracy and, in terms of the health services, it will mean they will not be as readily available and, if they are, that people will not have easy access to them?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>

      <P>Is the Minister aware, <Col N="2122" /> as I am, of the wholesale concern at the lack of accountability in health boards and of the lack of responsiveness to the public since those boards are neither accountable to local authorities nor to this House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a great need for reform.  For example the Eastern Health Board serve 1.3 million people while other health boards serve between 200,000 and 300,000 people.  The structure was brought in in good faith in the early seventies and I supported it at the time but it needs to be changed to reflect the many developments that have taken place since.  One change that is needed is the question of accountability.  For example, we are only now processing through the House the audited accounts of health boards for the financial year 1982-83 and they do not refer to my period in office.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>My answer, most emphatically, is &ldquo;no&rdquo; because local authorities do not raise any money and do not propose to raise any.  Any time they were asked to raise money they refused to do so in relation to the health services.  Various political parties in this House abolished local health charges and health contributions by local authorities such as the SWA, which are now being paid out of Exchequer funds.  Local councillors are demanding the right to run the services at local level but they are not making any resources available towards their financing.  That has changed the position dramatically in the last 15 years.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 22 and 42 together.  I am aware that the present level of service provision particularly for mentally handicapped adults does not as yet meet all needs.  To identify particular areas and to draw up guidelines for the future development of the service, an urgent review of the mental handicap service is being undertaken by my Department. This review is being carried out largely by way of consultation with the persons and organisations involved in the provision of the service.  The review began in June 1986 and I expect it to complete its work by the end of this year.</P>
      <P>The number of mentally handicapped people in residential care is 5,872.  In 1982 the number was 5,816.  The following table details the age groups and numbers of mentally handicapped people in residential care:</P>

    <P>My Department's policy in relation to the provision of residential care for mentally handicapped people, is that long-stay residential care should only be provided when, following assessment, other alternatives such as family support and hostel accommodation are considered inappropriate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate all the information the Minister gave me, but he did not answer my question.  I asked him if he would provide funds to ensure that severely handicapped young adults will not be sent home from residential care to <Col N="2125" /> parents who, because of age and infirmity, are unable to look after them.  What is happening around the country in this regard is an absolute scandal.  Strong, able-bodied mentally handicapped young adults have been sent home to old age pensioners who cannot cope with them. Will the Minister provide funds to ensure that they will be maintained in residential care where they should be?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>It needs to be said in the most emphatic way that there has been no reduction whatsoever in the number of residential places for mentally handicapped persons.  Quite deliberately I included in the reply the information that despite the considerable financial difficulties with which I have been faced we have opened an extra 55 residential places in recent years.  There are now 5,872 mentally handicapped persons in residential care and I hope to open more places in the near future.  There is much malicious propaganda going around, not least those appalling Fianna Fáil hoardings in public streets, which is causing severe distress to the parents and families of mentally handicapped persons.  As the Deputy knows, I have been endeavouring as a matter of priority to take another 2,000 people out of the psychiatric hospitals where they are, in addition to the 5,800 now in care.  I want to take some of them out of care but I am being impeded by a large number of politicians, notably from the Deputy's party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure the Deputy will share my opinion that there is a necessity to open up some additional places because we have an extra quota of acute profoundly handicapped adults who are, understandably, living longer with better medical care but whose parents have become very old and who are dying and who themselves need to be put into residential care.  I repeat that there have been no cutbacks: I have spent more only on the care of the mentally handicapped than any other Minister in the history of the State.  We are increasing the budget for the mentally handicapped at the rate of 6 per cent or 7 per cent per annum when the budgets of other health agencies are <Col N="2126" /> being increased by no more than 3 per cent.</P>

      <P>I am disappointed that the Minister politicised this matter. Indeed it is a disgrace because this is a matter of great importance.  The Minister told us he will open this, that and the other.  I am asking him if he will provide funds to ensure that these young adults will not be sent home to parents who are unable to cater for them.  For example, there are several young adults in St. Mary's from the North-Eastern Health Board alone.  Will he ensure that they will be maintained there, that they will not be sent home because of lack of funds?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a residential centre catering for mentally handicapped girls.  A number of these girls have reached adulthood and they are still in residence in St. Mary's.  The management there have indicated they have the space but may require extra staff.  The Midland Health Board are at present reviewing the entire range of services for mentally handicapped persons and St. Mary's is part of that review.  I assure the Deputy I will do my utmost to cater for that need but as of last December we had nearly 1,000 mildly handicapped people and 2,500 moderately handicapped people in residential care.  They have been there for a long time and for those who are mildly handicapped I am very reluctant to authorise residential care.  As far as possible, our mentally handicapped people should be living with us as we live and work, not put into institutions, no matter how wonderful may be the care in them.  It is best that they be kept in the community as part of our daily lives. Therefore, I wish to put down a marker about residential care &mdash; it is not necessarily the best life, particularly for those who are mildly handicapped who do not require residential care.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the statement and, indeed, my Department, as part of their new cash management system in 1986, recently received data from all health boards on projected weekly cash flow requirements and bank balances for the remainder of the year. On the basis of this information a strategy in relation to cash and overdraft requirements for each board will be agreed to ensure that any potential crisis will be avoided.</P>

With the Department of Health, I monitor the cash and bank balances of every health board every week. Some of them do not like that but it is being done.  The same applies to <Col N="2128" /> hospitals.  The Deputy does not refer specifically to the health board in question but I think he is alluding to the South Eastern Health Board.  We shall ensure that their cash management will not get into a crisis towards the end of December.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 30 and 44 together.  The modern purpose built facilities at Beaumont have been unused for some time. During that period patients and hospital staff have had to endure a service provided in old and unsuitable accommodation at St. Laurence's Hospital and Jervis Street Hospital.  To alleviate some of this inconvenience it is intended to provide out-patient services on a limited basis at Beaumont Hospital by the end of the year.  The Medical Board at St. Laurence's Hospital have agreed to transfer some of the out-patient clinics presently held at St. Laurence's to Beaumont. The management of the hospital are examining the situation with a view <Col N="2129" /> to identifying which clinics could be transferred to Beaumont.  The Beaumont Hospital Board are to request the Board of Jervis Street Hospital to undertake a similar exercise at that hospital.</P>
      <P>Negotiations with the trade unions representing staff transferring to Beaumont have been taking place since early this year and are continuing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister completed any negotiations with any of the staff who will be moving out to Beaumont? Does he seriously expect that patients will go to Beaumont Hospital for their outpatient treatment and then come back into St. Laurence's Hospital for X-rays, blood tests and everything else? Does he not think this is ludicrous and that it would be much better to continue planning to open the hospital at the earliest possible time as a proper major teaching hospital for the north city?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;before the hospital opened.  As the Deputy well knows as a member of the medical profession, only a fraction, probably not more than 5 or 6 per cent, of those who present themselves at outpatient clinics require acute admission and those who do would be immediately transferred to the acute hospitals.  There is no problem and I wish to thank the board of St. Laurence's and the consultant staff in Jervis Street for their co-operation on the other issue, which was that of the consulting rooms.  That matter has been resolved.  I am quite hopeful that we will get Beaumont Hospital running and that other facilities such as the dialysis done in St. Mary's Hospital and the pathology work from the Richmond and several other facilities will be transferred.  At the moment Beaumont Hospital has a staff of <Col N="2130" /> 37 people employed and a good secretary manager.  We can bring over library and X-ray facilities from the Royal College, open the hospital and appoint a new board in January.</P>

    <Title>Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission (No. 2) Bill, 1986    [Seanad]:    Committee Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 5:</P>
    <P>In page 5, subsection (2), to delete lines 4 and 5 and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(a)  the transfer of the property and the rights of the Commission to Dublin Corporation,&rdquo;.</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Deputy R. Burke.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Prior to the Adjournment, I had been making the point in relation to amendment No. 5 in my name that the words, &ldquo;the transfer of the property and rights of the Commission to Dublin Corporation&rdquo; should be put in place of the words, &ldquo;the transfer of the property, rights and liabilities of the Commission to Dublin Corporation.&rdquo; This amendment would have gone with amendment 7 which has been ruled out of order by you, a Cheann Comhairle, on the basis of involving finance.  That amendment was proposing that all the outstanding financial liabilities of the commission should, on the dissolution of the commission, be assumed by the commission.  Here you have a commission taking over the powers of the <Col N="2168" /> democratically elected Dublin Corporation and the corporation are going to be handed back this package in three years' time, with any liabilities that have been run up by the commission, without yea or nay.</P>
      <P>I made the point that I am particularly concerned about possible compensation claims arising from planning.  Dublin Corporation have their own development plan for the area.  It is operative at the moment.  Property holders within that area know their position with regard to the particular zoning or classification for their property.  This commission will set up a planning scheme for the area and if there is conflict between the scheme as set up by the commission and the development plan of the corporation there is, at least, the possibility of a constitutional case in regard to property rights of the individuals concerned.  The Minister made the point earlier that he did not see a situation arising, and if he did that it would be in the last month or two of the operation of this commission, of passing on liabilities to the corporation. I suggest that if at an early stage in its operation it interferes with particular development proposals of individuals in the area and that if the development plan is in contradiction with that of the corporation, there is the possibility of compensation claims.  As the Minister will well know, compensation claims of that order would stretch for two to five years through the courts.  Would the Minister clarify the position as to whether the proposition I have just put forward is factual?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Boland) Minister for the Environment (Mr. Boland)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>The best way I can answer the Deputy is to say that the very same situation will obtain at the end of the lifetime of this commission as would have obtained at the end of the lifetime of the development authority which would have been established under his Bill and which would have had section 19 (2) (a) of the Urban Development Areas Bill, 1982, applied to it.  Could the Deputy explain why he did not have fears in relation to <Col N="2169" /> outstanding liabilities with those authorities? Then I could perhaps better understand the case he is making.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>That is no answer to the point.  That legislation died with the Government of 1982 and was not brought forward again, except in amended form by the Minister.  I am asking him in a noncontroversial way if he will clarify the position with regard to the possibility of conflicts between the development plan and a planning scheme laid down by the commission and the possibility of liabilities resulting from claims to the courts on constitutional property rights.  The real problem is not small liabilities such as postage and telephone bills.  Will the corporation have to take on the burden of property claims that might arise?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the first and most basic tasks of the commission will be to prepare an improvement scheme for the area.  Deputy Burke's point seems to be that the improvement scheme might envisage a different type of usage for a particular section than is already provided for or allowed in the development plan for the same area.  The best way to deal with that point is to say that the improvement scheme will be made at the outset of the three years of the commission's existence.  Compensation claims could not arise from it alone but only from the commission looking for a discontinuance of use in compliance with their improvement scheme.  The Deputy will recall that the improvement scheme will not be ratified until the views of Dublin Corporation have been sought and until the Minister confirms the improvement scheme.  If there were material differences from the point of view of general usage of a section of the commission area from that provided for in the development plan which might give rise to compensatable claims, that would have to weigh very heavily in the mind of any Minister before approving the improvement scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position regarding the closing period of the lifetime of the commission is well safeguarded in section 10 (8).  If <Col N="2170" /> necessary, the Minister could use the provisions of that section to ensure that there would not be a large amount of outstanding and perhaps unestablished liabilities at the end of the commission's lifetime.  If, for some reason which I find impossible to comprehend, there were liabilities outstanding of an unusual nature, greater than if the corporation had been operating within the area themselves, any reasonable Government of the day would have to consider that matter at the time.  We are talking about a hypothetical situation and this is not a problem which would have to be faced at the end of the three-year period.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that any reasonable Government at the time would take on the burden passed by this commission. That reasonable Government will probably be our administration.  The difficulty is that the debate which takes place in this House is not part of the legislation itself and any justice or future Government who are not of such a generous disposition as ourselves would be able to claim the law states that the liabilities belong to the corporation.  I do not think the case is as hypothetical as the Minister suggests.  He says the planning scheme will be the first task undertaken by the commission and that the commission will then submit the scheme to him.  It will be examined by the corporation and they can make observations on it, but the Minister does not have to take heed of any of these observations.  The corporation can go through the ritual of making their comments but legally the Minister can ignore them and sign the scheme whatever way he likes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The commission will be dealing with a valuable section of property in the city. To change even one or two properties could cost millions of pounds in the area between O'Connell Street and Grafton Street.  Premises have changed hands in this area for enormous sums.  Even one minor change between the development plan and the planning scheme could result in huge compensation claims.  I ask the Minister to agree with the principle I am putting forward, that is, that the liabilities <Col N="2171" /> in those circumstances should not be handed on to Dublin Corporation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It is difficult to respond because we are talking about such a hypothetical circumstance.  I said on Second Stage I envisaged that the vast bulk of the funds allocated to the commission would be used by them in the improvement of facilities on the streets &mdash; street furniture, paving, lighting, the provision of sculptures and management of the streets.  The clauses relating to compensation and changes of usage ought to be minimal, both because of the cost implications and because any suggestion of trying to persuade people to change from a permitted usage should be based on fairness and equity.  Property owners will themselves carry out improvements to their properties as a response to what is being done in the street and this will create peer pressure on operators of properties that are not compatible with the thrust of development of the street and its overall appearance. On the other hand it was felt correct that these powers should be built into the provisions of the Bill.  They are not radically different from those already vested in the relevant local authority, indeed in local authorities generally, under the Planning Acts.  However, my difficulty there is that I am really inviting discussion on a subsequent section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Very much so.  For example, in section 6 (5) we are into the whole question of exempted development, what will and will not be exempted development.  The Minister must relate this liability question to that.  It is fundamental to the provisions of the Bill that liabilities can be taken on by this commission on the basis of their undertaking the work set out by the Minister. For example, the Minister instructs this commission, as a general duty, to prepare a scheme.  In so doing, then a list of things will be designated to be exempted development if they fit into the scheme &mdash; the carrying out of any development <Col N="2172" /> within the metropolitan area, all of these things.  For example, section 6 (6) (a) says:</P>
      <P>In the determination of an application for permission under Part IV of the Act of 1963 relating to development in the Metropolitan Central Area, regard shall be had to the provisions of an improvement scheme approved under this section, and a decision to grant such a permission shall not be made, except with the consent of the Commission, if the proposed development would materially contravene the provisions of such a scheme.</P>
      <P>If planning permission for the same project had been applied for under a development plan and planning permission was received, then my view is that the property owner is entitled at least to submit a constitutional claim for loss of property rights, contending that he has been injured resulting from the provisions of this Bill and will have an eligible compensation claim.  I am sure that is something on which the High Court would divide.  It is not in the realms of fairyland; it is feasible that this can happen.  It is unreasonable to hand over such a liability, if it runs into millions, half millions or figures of that order, which it can because of the property values in that area we are at present debating, the very spine of our capital city.  It is unreasonable to pass on to Dublin Corporation such liabilities that may arise from such court cases at the expiry of the lifetime of this commission.  It should be remembered that Dublin Corporation will not in any way have been responsible for those liabilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The situation outlined by the Deputy would not arise.  However, I suspect that a difficulty might emerge were we to continue to pursue this line of thought or discussion in the House in that we might be influencing a future, unsuccessful applicant for permission for development within the commission area to entertain the idea of pursuing a case within the courts.  I would not have <Col N="2173" /> thought that the case made by the Deputy would be a compensatable one.  As he said, in the example he gave, it is one on which the High Court might divide. Therefore we are talking about an area &mdash; as applies to all of our legislation based on a written Constitution &mdash; in which ultimately any part of legislation may end up being tested in one form or another in the courts.  In that regard the decision of the Judiciary can be clearly established only when it is arrived at.  We are talking about something we can never establish with the utmost of certainty, until a case is actually taken and a decision handed down.</P>
      <P>The Deputy and I will just have to disagree on our interpretations of the sections and on the likelihood of the outcome of any case being taken in that regard.  In my view there would not be a compensatable case in the example cited by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not a lawyer. However, individuals whose opinions I would greatly respect make the point I have just made in regard to the difference that can arise between the development plan and the planning or improvement scheme as set out by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Leaving aside the Minister's desire to engage in a cosmetic political exercise, I accept his intentions, that his heart is in the right place, that he wants to see the centre of our city improved.  We all want to do so but in different ways.  We feel the Minister is going the wrong way about it under the provisions of this Bill. However, I accept the Minister's bona fides as far as that is concerned; any Irishman wants to see the centre of our capital improved.  But it is incumbent on us, when discussing legislation in this House, to ensure that we do not pass bad legislation. It is important that we ensure we do not pass legislation which will unwittingly involve taxpayers in millions of pounds by way of compensatory claims. My proposition is that if there is a difference between the development plan of Dublin Corporation and the improvement scheme, as laid down by the commission, and if that improvement scheme <Col N="2174" /> alters the property values set out in the development plan of Dublin Corporation, there is then at least a case to be answered in regard to compensation claims.  As the provisions of this Bill are drafted Dublin Corporation will have to take over those liabilities at the end of three years.  I do not believe they should be left to take over liabilities in respect of which they have had no responsibility. Rather that is something the Minister should take on.</P>
    <P>The Minister earlier in discussion on this amendment made the point that any reasonable Government would take on that responsibility if the sums involved were seen to be excessive.  All I am asking is that the Minister write his good intentions into the provisions.  I fully accept that it would be his intention to pick up the tab in the likelihood of such an event occurring.  I confirm that that would be our intention.  However, personalities change; it may not be the Minister or myself who would be dealing with the matter.  An occasion may arise when other Ministers will be here dealing with this who would not hold the same view. For example it could happen that the Minister for Finance of the day would not hold the same view, that even if the Minister for the Environment did, he would be unable to persuade the Minister for Finance or his Department.  Therefore, I recommend that the Minister achieves what he wants.  I contend that the best way to do so is to write it into the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I am quite prepared to drop my amendment at this stage if the Minister will assure me that he will at least think about it between now and Report Stage, when we can re-examine it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to disabuse the Deputy of a few things.  I have every intention of being Minister for the Environment at the end of the three year lifetime of this commission, so that the Deputy's other remarks in that regard do not apply.  I presume the Deputy can speak only from personal experience when he refers to personalities changing and the difficulties posed for Ministers <Col N="2175" /> for the Environment having to persuade Ministers for Finance of the day.  That is up to the Minister for the Environment of the day.  So far I have never encountered any problem in that regard and I would not envisage encountering any problem in the future if the need arose.  It would help the debate if we stopped having these continual references to future Ministers and future administrations.  If any reasonable administration saw that for some extraordinary reason the commission was going out of existence with excessive and unusual liabilities that would mean that an unfair burden of liability would be transferred back to Dublin Corporation, they should recognise it in the allocation of the rate support grant or whatever was the most appropriate vehicle available to the corporation at the time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This section which the Deputy seeks to amend is an absolutely standard provision provided for in countless pieces of legislation.  It was provided for recently in the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act, 1983, when all the rights and liabilities of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs at the time and of the Office of Public Works were transferred to An Bord Telecom and to An Post. What this provision seeks to do is nothing different from that.  Without wanting to be contentious it is exactly the same provision as the Deputy, when he was Minister, sought to have included in relation to development authorities which might have been set up under his 1982 Bill and the transfer of their rights and liabilities to the relevant local authorities and the expiration of their lifetime.  Apparently, there was no problem envisaged in the Deputy's mind in relation to that much wider ranging proposed legislation which would have allowed for a series of development authorities to be created at different times and in different places across the country.  If we are to take the examples given by the Deputy the liabilities would be multiplied by X, X being the number of authorities that might have been set up under that legislation. The liabilities they might have <Col N="2176" /> incurred would have been passed on to the respective local authorities.  Apparently at that time that was quite acceptable so far as the then Government were concerned.  The standard way in which legislation seeks to provide for the orderly winding up of any body such as this is that all the assets, rights and liabilities would be transferred at the cessation of its business to the relevant authority who were assuming responsibility for what that body had previously administered.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that in normal legislation such as that for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs being broken up into An Post and An Bord Telecom it would be standard practice to transfer the liabilities and assets from one to the other but what we are dealing with is not standard legislation.  It is extraordinary legislation to the extent that in Government I was involved in the preparation of legislation in 1982 that was similar to what we are dealing with today. Personalities and Governments have changed but, with no disrespect to the Minister, it is the same officials basically who are drafting the legislation for him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest that he look again at this section dealing with liabilities in view of the very extraordinary powers that this commission will have in the preparation of a development plan, to be called an improvement scheme, which will and can run contrary to the development plan of Dublin Corporation.  The Minister stated that the basis for this legislation is that Dublin Corporation have not been doing their duty with regard to the centre of our city, that they have been giving permission for the honky tonk establishment and that the character of the city has deteriorated.  The Minister wants to see an improvement in that respect.  He wants to see an improvement scheme which will tidy up the city, not just so far as trees, pavements or lights are concerned but in order that there will be exempted permissions and so on.  As I have said a number of times, the Minister has produced legislation, the extent and the effect of which will be to leave the <Col N="2177" /> commission open to compensation claims.  At the end of the life of the commission these compensation claims can be passed on to Dublin Corporation who will have had no hand, act or part in causing the liability in the first place.  It would be unfair to pass on to the corporation a liability over which they had no control.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I will cite an example of an analogy.  Deputy Burke expressed apprehension on the grounds that compensation claims might arise.  At present a local authority may refuse permission for an application for development where the type of use applied for is in conformity with the general thrust of the development plans for the area but where, for other reasons, the application is refused. Similarly if that refusal is appealed or if a permission is granted and appealed to An Bord Pleanála, they may decide to make a decision in relation to an individual appeal although that decision is not in conformity with the general thrust of the local authority's development plans for the area.  The example the Deputy cites and which he fears is a compensatable one already obtains in relation to the existing planning code and is not compensatable for that reason, though there may be other reasons.  If the Deputy has this fear of contingent liabilities falling on a local authority, he will probably recall that under a section of the Planning Act, 1963 &mdash; from recollection it may be section 57 or 58 &mdash; in certain cases depending on the reasons for refusal given by An Bord Pleanála for particular applications a claim for compensation may fall upon the local authority although the decision is not one in which the local authority will have had any part.  There already exists in law a position where a local authority may be liable for compensation through decisions taken by another body.  What is being provided for in this legislation creates a lesser likelihood of that type of compensatable claim than does the example under the existing code I have outlined.  The Deputy seems to have a different view on that &mdash; but as I said, that is something <Col N="2178" /> on which many Members of this House, whether lawyers or not, could have a view.  It could only be tested to its exhaustive conclusion if a case were to be taken and a decision of the courts arrived at. As the Deputy suggested, it is a decision on which the High Court might divide.</P>

      <P>No, I just want to speak about it on the general question of liability as distinct from court liability, standard liability such as office accommodation which might be surplus to the needs of the corporation.  The corporation would then have to take over any liabilities other than the compensation type liabilities I have mentioned.</P>
      <P>The Minister says that in standard legislation transferring powers from a Department to a semi-State body liabilities are passed over.  That is understandable because the operation continues.  In this case the operation will cease at the end of three years and it will be all in the hands of the corporation again.  What happens?  Will the Minister not pick up the tab for any other liabilities or responsibilities that are there?  Why pass them on to the corporation who would have no say in being forced into this liability in the first place?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The ordinary liabilities will transfer to the corporation but really I do not see that these would be of any substantial nature.  For instance, take the example the Deputy has given of office property which might be occupied by the commission.  It would be a pretty extraordinary decision of the administrative staff of the commission were they to lease property for, say, a 21-year period on behalf of a commission with a three year <Col N="2179" /> lifetime.  My intention is that this commission will have a very small staff who would be appointed for the lifetime of the commission and they would arrange their facilities such as office accommodation, equipment and so on on the basis that they were needed for the lifetime of the commission.  Therefore, any fears that there would be an extraordinary bureaucratic apparatus <i>in situ</i> at the time of cessation of the activities of the commission are not grounded in fact.</P>

      <P>Another authority involved are the DTA.  If it were felt in the light of experience of operation of the commission after three years that something in the area administered by the commission might better be done by the transport authority then that function might be transferred to the authority rather than back to the corporation.  I cannot cite an example but the provision is there to allow for a modification should it be felt and recognised that such a need arose at the end of the lifetime of the commission.  There is no specific intention relating to it as it stands at present.</P>

      <P>The Minister has sold this legislation on the basis of one part of his argument which has been that this is only for three years, that we are taking the powers away from the local authority but only for three years, that we are setting up a commission to do their work which they had not been doing and we are going to do it more efficiently, but after the three years it is going back to the democratically elected council, the Dublin Corporation.  The Minister says that the functions vested in the commission &ldquo;shall, on the dissolution of the commission, become and be exercisable by Dublin Corporation&rdquo;.  Then he put in this little sting in the tail and said that it shall be the function of the corporation <Col N="2181" /> but that perhaps between now and the end of the three years when he is dissolving the commission he may think up something else and put it in and not really leave these as functions of the corporation but give them to the DTA or some other body we do not even know of or does not exist at this stage.</P>
      <P>The Minister had drafted this Bill and he is attempting to sell it to the public on the basis of a three-year limited lifespan which is going to conclude and then all of the functions will go back to the corporation other than those that are specifically for the DTA as already passed.  He has in this Bill what he describes as a saver but I would describe it as a sting in the tail, giving himself the power to give the functions to some body about which we know nothing and which probably he has not even in his mind at this stage, rather than transferring them back to the corporation.</P>

      <P>Sometimes I think that that much maligned fellow, the parliamentary draftsman, would welcome an opportunity to come in here and speak in the House on his own behalf.  This wording is the wording arrived at by the parliamentary draftsman to provide, as I suggested, a saver.  It is absolutely wrong for the Deputy to suspect that this is a sting in the tail inserted by a Machiavellian Minister to achieve some other purpose at the end of the period of the operation of the commission.  It is merely to allow the transfer of a function of the commission to a body other than the corporation if it is felt that would be a more appropriate way to have that function handled when the commission come to the end of their period of operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>On the basis of this legislation which is taking away the powers of this democratically elected council, Dublin City Council, the Minister has made his argument that all he is doing is taking these powers away for three years and at the end of the three years he is going to hand them back lock, stock and barrel to the corporation.  We are not only handing back the powers but <Col N="2182" /> the property, the rights and the liabilities. We are now saying we will hand the powers back to the corporation but if we think up another way of doing this rather than have the corporation do it we are putting in this saver, that is, subject to such modifications as the Minister shall specify in the dissolution order.  So that the Minister's bona fides can be absolutely transparent he should just transfer the functions back to the corporation and he should not allow himself to be tied by this saver of the parliamentary draftsman. It is important for the corporation and the people of Dublin to see that this commission will have a limited life and that it will not be a backdoor method of giving some of the functions to some other authority.  I do not believe the Minister had that in mind when the Bill was drafted but he should look at it in the context of the overall legislation and accept the amendment put forward, even if it is proposed from this side of the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I suspect the Deputy would have gone on to say it was the draftsman who expressed this intention in legislative form.  This Bill provides a specific function for a specific authority for a set time.  The 1982 Bill made provision to allow a Minister to set up an authority at any time.  Section 19 provided that the Minister could by order provide for the dissolution of an urban development commission when it appeared to him there was no longer a need for the existence of the commission. As opposed to having a commission with a finite lifetime, that was allowing the Minister of the day to decide on any bad Friday that there was no longer a need for the commission.  Subsection (2) provided that a dissolution order should contain such provision as the Minister thought <Col N="2183" /> necessary or expedient consequent on the dissolution effected by the order and in particular made provision for the transfer or dissolution of the property rights and liabilities of the urban development commission being thereby dissolved to one or more than one statutory body.  Had that legislation been enacted the Minister could have set up a number of development authorities and after six months the Minister could have dissolved the powers of a commission, say, in Tipperary North Riding and transfer them instead to Tipperary South Riding Council.  The Minister would have had virtually dictatorial powers conferred on him by that Bill.  On the other hand, the Bill I have introduced provides for a commission to be set up for a set period to do a specific job and the powers are to transfer back afterwards. The words which have attracted the attention of the Deputy merely provide that if at the time of dissolution the Minister of the day thinks that another statutory body is a more appropriate one to handle an aspect of the function carried out by the commission he would have the discretion on the matter.  That discretion being given to the Minister is a far lesser power than what would have been given to the Minister for the Environment under the 1982 Bill which is becoming more and more relevant to this discussion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I know the Leas-Cheann Comhairle is absolutely amazed that Tipperary North Riding and Tipperary South Riding got into this discussion on the Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission Bill.  The 1982 legislation fell when that Government fell. However, when the Minister finds himself unable to answer a point he refers back to the 1982 legislation.  I take it as a compliment that he has shown such interest in that forward-looking legislation. No doubt when we got to Committee Stage much of that Bill would have been improved considerably.  There is always room for improvement, even here, much as that might surprise the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2184" /> The Minister has stated publicly, whether in the newspapers or here, that it is his intention that this commission will have a lifetime of three years and that the functions of the commission will then transfer back to Dublin Corporation, other than those functions that relate to the Dublin Transport Authority. In section 4 (3) (a) the Minister has given himself powers to transfer the functions of the commission, not to the corporation but at the whim of the Minister of the day, to any other authority set up by the Minister in the meantime.  For the Minister's bona fides to be transparent he must limit himself to the transfer of the functions to the corporation or to the Dublin Transport Authority.  Otherwise the Minister is leaving himself open to the charge that, while he says the commission's lifetime is only three years he might set up another authority to continue its work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the House understand that the Minister has not got the power to set up another commission because this legislation provides for the establishment of the Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission?  It is not as if the 1982 Bill had been passed and the Minister would have been able to set up a series of commissions.  I invite the House to seriously consider section 4 (3) (a) and consider the following examples. If the commission had been operating litter control in their area on a 24-hour basis and not as street cleaning is being carried out at present in that area, it might well be thought at the end of three years that a 24-hour basis was the appropriate way to keep these streets clean.  I give that as an example.  I do not know if that will be the case but it might well be that in transferring the responsibility for refuse collection and street cleaning back to the local authority, the Minister of the day might wish to modify the transfer of those functions back to the corporation and to put a stipulation on the corporation that they should continue with a 24-hour refuse collection and street cleansing service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2185" /> If it was considered that the commission had been operating a system whereby commercial deliveries were allowed during certain periods only in the early morning or evening and that that had led to a greater usage and enjoyment of the areas in O'Connell Street and Grafton Street by pedestrians, the Minister might well decide to impose a modification to keep the streets to that standard.  This wording would allow the Minister, while transferring the statutory functions back, to put a requirement on the corporation that in carrying out those statutory functions, they would have to do so in a certain way, to ensure that the work the commission had done in bringing the Dublin central area up to a certain standard would be continued in perpetuity.  The special status provided for in the Bill in relation to the area will be recognised through the modification of the way in which the powers will be assigned back to the corporation.  That is another example of how the subsection could be used.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Greater enlightenment comes as the debate proceeds.  That brings me back to the question of liabilities of the commission.  If the Minister intends to modify the functions by ordering the corporation to perform them in the manner just outlined by him and specifying the level of services which the corporation will provide, can he say what section gives him the power to do this? According to this section, he can modify and give the powers to another body.  It does not specify the level of service which the corporation must provide, which is a matter for them within their financial constraints.</P>

      <P>If you read the words we are discussing in conjunction with section 2 (3) which we discussed this morning and which requires Dublin Corporation, in the discharge of their functions, to have regard to the special importance in the national interest of the metropolitan central area, it may appear that the corporation may have difficulty in defining the special importance in the national <Col N="2186" /> interest of the metropolitan area.  In reassigning the functions to the corporation, the Minister, by these modifications, could well set out to establish the way in which the special status provision should be enacted in practice.</P>

      <P>The Minister suggested that the function vested in the commission shall, on dissolution of the commission, be exercisable by Dublin Corporation.  He wanted to include the words &ldquo;subject to such modifications as the Minister shall specify in the dissolution order&rdquo;.  The only interpretation that can be put on such modifications is not related to the functions of the corporation but to the fact that some of their functions will not be returned to them.  The original interpretation is that it is not necessary for the Minister of the day to transfer all the functions outlined to the corporation.  He can transfer some to other bodies apart from the Dublin Transport Authority. The Minister has promised the corporation and the people of Dublin that the life of this Bill is only three years but it would be better for all concerned if the Minister accepted the amendment.

This Bill will take over the functions of the DTA before they even get going.  The Authority, in turn, will take over functions of Dublin Corporation.  We are told that the Bill we are discussing will improve the operation of public administration in Dublin city centre, the spine of our capital, through a more streamlined administration but there are too many Bills involved.</P>

Many people are concerned about what will happen to transport when the commission do this beautiful job on the city centre.  What will happen to the surrounding areas when transport is eliminated and people have to find other ways to travel?</P>
      <P>The Minister suggested that there should be an advisory committee and he will probably find that, as it develops, it will take on a more important role. Dublin Transport Authority should also be represented on the advisory board. This area has been dealt with by a group under Dublin Corporation.  This group comprised the corporation, the Garda Síochána and CIE.  Those three groups will still have a strong input to make into the work of the Dublin Transport Authority.

      <P>I move amendment No. 9:</P>
      <P>In page 5, line 35, after &ldquo;parking&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;the promotion of the greater use of public transport&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment relates to the question of traffic in the commission's area of responsibility, which is mainly from Parnell Square, through O'Connell Street and D'Olier Street to College Green.  As I said earlier, that is the main traffic area of the city.  During the course of the Second Stage debate a number of speakers on the Government side, the Minister not included, made the point that O'Connell Street was destroyed by buses parking there and there were too many bus stops.  There were considerable references to buses being an unsightly business in O'Connell Street.  We were concerned that only buses were considered a problem while cars were not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everyone will agree that if the commission are to be there at all they will have to deal with standards of civic design, the convenience and safety of pedestrians, the general appearance of the streets, traffic regulations and parking and the provision of further civic amenities.  In view of the comments made on Second Stage we felt we should put down this amendment on the basis that the greater use of public transport would reduce the overall amount of traffic.  I am not saying that buses have always been <Col N="2189" /> of the highest design and colour.  I was most disappointed a number of years ago when the old green buses were removed and the colour changed to a purple-yellow or purple-orange.  Worse still, the purple disappeared and the buses became all yellow or orange.  This colour becomes dirty very quickly because it is not a pleasant colour visually.  A series of those buses in O'Connell Street always looked unsightly.  I am very glad that CIE have restored the bright green colours on the buses.  I think the buses in Dublin city look very well at present.  They are kept excellently clean by CIE and their visual appearance is now much better.  Some people may have objected to those big yellow buses coming up through O'Connell Street in rows.  When the commission put up this beautiful mall in the centre of O'Connell Street it will remove at least one lane each way and, as was remarked on Second Stage, it could possibly remove two lanes each way which would reduce O'Connell Street to two lanes on each side.  If that occurs, there will be a major traffic problem all over the city.  If the Minister and the commission have that in mind, total use of public transport in the city centre area would be essential.</P>
    <P>It was mentioned on Second Stage that buses do not need to come through O'Connell Street, that they could park nearby.  There was no reference made to the fact that cars do not have to come through O'Connell Street.  The impression should not be imposed on the commission from the outset that we must keep everything out of O'Connell Street and pack it into both sides of Middle and Lower Abbey Street.  Where are people to go?  Capel Street is already a disaster. It could not take one more car.  In preparation for this new design the corporation are now speeding up their inner tangent ring road.  One may have noticed that over the last five of six weeks from the Rotunda Hospital to Moore Street has been knocked down on one side. About three weeks ago we discovered that from Peat's to the Commodore pub had been levelled.  Everybody wondered what had happened.  That was in the plans for years.  Suddenly, this plan is being <Col N="2190" /> implemented by the corporation.  All that remains to be knocked are a few old houses on Parnell Street.  The CPOs have been prepared.  Some morning shortly we will come out and find that piece gone as well.  Therefore, all of Parnell Street on the left hand side will have been knocked. When that goes the next to go will be from Brereton's in Capel Street to King Street.</P>
    <P>The corporation's plan is to have a dual carriageway down Parnell Street breaking through on to King Street and it appears that is being rushed through by the city manager so that the commission can direct all traffic on to Parnell Street.  In my view the commission should be considering the greater use of public transport in the centre city.  Many local representatives hold that view.  Since I was first elected to the local authority, councillors have been suggesting that private cars be kept out of the centre city and greater use made of public transport. Single deck buses should be used in that area so as to avoid traffic congestion.  If it is the intention of the commission to try to reduce the amount of traffic in the centre of the city in order to provide a wide mall they should consider using public transport.  I suggest there should be some inter-play between the DTA and the commission on this matter.</P>
    <P>If traffic is crushed into the side streets off O'Connell Street the corporation's plan for an inner tangent ring road which caused such controversy in the area of St. Patrick's Cathedral will be pushed through very rapidly.  The Minister might suggest to the commission that they promote greater use of public transport when considering traffic flows and the parking of private cars.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the general thrust of the Deputy's amendment but I do not think there is any need to enunciate it.  The choice of words does not fully convey the import of what the Deputy is attempting to do.  The promotion of greater use of public transport would seem to suggest the commission <Col N="2191" /> should operate as a promotional or advertising agency for CIE although I accept that that is not what the Deputy intends. However, that could be interpreted from the wording of the amendment.  Obviously, an integral part of the work of the commission will be to look at traffic flows, the way traffic is dispersed and the way traffic uses the central area at present.</P>
      <P>Deputies are aware that a computer-based traffic model of the traffic patterns in the Dublin city area was prepared in anticipation of the setting up of the Dublin Transport Authority.  The intention is to use that computer-based model to experiment with different suggestions as to alterations of traffic flows and to see the effect any suggestion might have on traffic in other parts of the city.  It would be pointless to decide, for example, to remove all cars or buses from O'Connell Street if that resulted in Capel Street being totally fouled up with pressure being put on that traffic artery to such an extent that it would be rendered virtually useless and the rest of the city thrown into chaos.  I am sure all Members accept that for a start there should be greater channelisation &mdash; a word traffic engineers use &mdash; of the existing traffic in O'Connell Street.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Only an engineer would come up with that word.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I suspect I first heard the word from traffic engineers whom the Deputy meets more often than I do.  We should persuade traffic to use traffic lanes in a more orderly fashion.  It has been suggested to me that traffic study engineers of Dublin Corporation came to the conclusion that the width of the existing traffic lanes in O'Connell Street could be substantially reduced and the narrowed carriageways could still carry the existing volume of traffic if that traffic was persuaded to use the street in a more orderly manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From that point one moves to examine the other options put forward.  For example, Deputy Briscoe mentioned that Dublin Corporation traffic engineers <Col N="2192" /> have been looking at the possibility of inviting north-bound traffic to turn right at O'Connell Bridge rather than going into lower O'Connell Street before turning right into Abbey Street.  He said the engineers felt that that change would reduce the heavy amount of traffic on that short stretch from O'Connell Bridge to the intersection with Abbey Street. The Deputy gave that example during the course of the Second Stage debate.</P>
    <P>If the objective in setting up the commission is successful and a far greater number of pedestrians come to use the street for a variety of purposes, there will be a greater need for public transport access points adjacent to the central area. It will have to be easy for the public to get into and out of the central area by public transport while still gaining the maximum possible enjoyment from the centre. Members will be aware that that problem has been treated in different ways in other cities.  In some cities areas have been extensively pedestrianised with free bus services operating around the perimeter of the pedestrianised area.  In other cities there are special bus services which run through the centre while in others only public transport is allowed to the centre. All those options will have to be examined. The computer-based model is available for the commission and their advisers to look at in conjunction with, I hope, Dublin city traffic engineers and the DTA.  They will have to examine all options before deciding on the best way to meet the objectives while, at the same time, trying to improve traffic flows throughout the city.  Of course, that is one of the primary functions of the Dublin Transport Authority who are having their first meeting today.</P>
    <P>I accept fully the point made by Deputy Mac Giolla on the need for close co-operation and discussion between the DTA and the Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission but I do not want to go into that point any further today.  It is not normal to talk about people serving on an advisory body although, in an effort to be helpful to the House earlier, I did and I got into all sorts of complications. <Col N="2193" /> I would prefer not to follow the Deputy down that <i>cul-de-sac.</i></P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>It is these lengthy <i>cul-de-sacs</i> that we are afraid of, particularly in relation to Dublin traffic from the north to the south.  I share the concern expressed in Deputy Mac Giolla's amendment that the main street should still be available for public transport.  I have heard views expressed outside to the effect that buses are not welcome in O'Connell Street.  The Minister used the language of the engineers when he spoke about channelisation, in other words reducing the number of traffic lanes in O'Connell Street to three.  That disturbs me.  I drive through the city and I know the problems that can arise at the moment.  I hope the Minister will spell out his proposals in regard to this idea of narrowing the traffic areas.  Is a reduction in the number of lanes part of the Minister's plan in the Second Schedule?</P>
      <P>That schedule also provides for cafes and other facilities in the centre island of O'Connell Street.  It would be preferable if these things were written into the Bill, as Deputy Mac Giolla has in mind, so that the commission could not then make decisions that would in any way interfere with or discourage public transport to the city centre.  Taking the traffic from O'Connell Street and putting it through Capel Street on the one hand and Marlboro Street on the other, with movement through Parliament Street, Tara Street, Wolfe Tone Street, etc, would cause chaos, though it might present O'Connell Street as a better shop window.  We must remember that one third of the country's population lives in Dublin city and county, so we must have something more than an ornate centre spine.  We cannot isolate the main street from the rest of the city and county.  It is right to improve the core of the city but that cannot be done to the detriment of the remainder. We cannot take the double decker buses off O'Connell Street just for the sake of visual improvement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What will become of the status of Deputy Skelly's hole in the ground in <Col N="2194" /> relation to the functions of the commission? If the centre of the city is to be relieved of traffic it will have a major effect on traffic movement to the stations and therefore I wonder if the commission will have a function in relation to the hole in the ground.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy's local authority complies with the Minister's direction we will proceed with that but if the Deputy's local authority do not then we will have to look again at it.  If the Deputy looks at the First Schedule he will see that the area of land will be within the administrative control of the authority set out and not the area mentioned in the Deputy's comments.  It would be out of order for me to make any further reference to the matter.  In relation to the other point made by the Deputy, which has some relevance to the amendment, the Second Schedule provides that the improvement scheme could have to do with traffic management.  It places an obligation on the commission in preparing improvement schemes to have consultations not only with Dublin Corporation but with the DTA.  Because the DTA is such a new creature, having its first meeting today, there has not been as much discussion about it as there might be when it has been in existence for a year or so.  Many of the functions which Deputies suggest will be transferred from Dublin Corporation to this commission, as of today are in the process of being transferred to the DTA.</P>

    <P>I assure the House that there will be the closest possible liaison between the DTA and the Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission.  Adequate provision for the use of public transport will have to be an integral part of the commission's objective.  Many of the contributions so far seem to envisage that I would be so reckless as to appoint commissioners who in turn would be so irresponsible and <Col N="2195" /> feckless as to set about virtually destroying the centre of the city rather than adhering to the task given to them, dramatically to improve the facilities for the general public.  Much of the debate today seemed to be based on safeguarding the city centre against the barbarian horde who will wreak havoc in the city centre. We are talking about people being invited to serve on a commission for three years who will improve the appearance, use and enjoyment of the centre of Dublin. Deputies seem to suspect that the commission will set about destroying the Dublin central area.  It is difficult to comprehend.</P>

      <P>That may seem reasonable to the Minister but if we look at section 5 we will see that the emphasis is on improvement of environmental conditions, the level of civic amenities, the standard of civic design with special reference to the convenience and safety of pedestrians, the general appearance of streets and buildings, regulation of traffic and parking, etc.</P>
      <P>If you want to improve environmental conditions these things may be taken to mean that there will not be buses with exhaust fumes coming up O'Connell Street, or if you want to provide for the safety of pedestrians that you will prevent dangerous traffic or heavy buses from going along the street.  People have different attitudes as to how to improve the standards of design, cleanliness and appearance.  They may wish to remove all bus stop signs, traffic signs and all the encumbrances of street furniture and improve the street in that way.  People could see all of these objectives being achieved much better in O'Connell Street or the centre city area by not having buses stopping at Cavendish Row, down in Abbey Street, or below Marlborough Street.  Passengers would only have 75 yards to walk, the Minister said &mdash; I would say 150 yards &mdash; to O'Connell Street.</P>

      <P>Everybody in approaching this matter would have a different idea.  While the Minister's attitude is quite correct, that the whole idea is to uplift O'Connell Street and have more pedestrians there, he sees that the best way of getting pedestrians into O'Connell Street is to bring them there, to empty the buses in O'Connell Street. I would agree with that.  People like to walk straight out of their buses and into the cinema.  We have many rainy nights, winter and summer.</P>
      <P>Traffic regulators, experts in the field of architectural design and visual environementalists and such do not look at things in that way.  They think of how they can make the street or the area bright, beautiful and clean with no encumbrances, no smells of exhaust fumes, no dirty buses and so on.  Such improvements would make the place look beautiful but you might not be able to get into the city centre because of the way parking of buses is regulated.  We must put what the Minister said into the minds of those who sit on the committee because that is their remit.  Their remit is what this House will provide for.  It is not what the Ministers, or Deputy Burke, or I would like.  These are their terms of reference, this is what they are to do.  I suggest, to get this into their minds, that the Minister include a reference to the need for greater use of public transport in the area.  Would he endeavour to have a reference to the use of public transport inserted after the matters relating to regulations and parking?  The first thing the commissioners will say is that the regulation is for no parking whatsoever in the commission's area.  They would also want regulation of traffic parking around the city, but outside their area. The Minister should indicate in that section that pedestrians will be let alight from buses in the centre city area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully share Deputy Mac Giolla's view on this.  I accept the good faith of the Minister that he does <Col N="2197" /> not see it that way.  If we are trying today to improve this Bill, the commissioners that the Minister appoints must have clear guidelines and know the feelings and views of this House as written in legislation.  They will not be reading the Official Report and saying that the Minister said this, Deputy Burke said that and Deputy Mac Giolla said the other. For them it is going to be what is in the Bill.  It is not stretching the imagination too far, knowing the approach that all of us in our public life, whether as Ministers and councillors in local authorities or other places, have got from engineers, architects and other experts, as they come before us.  They come with proposals that are specific to themselves and their area and do not take the broad view of what is for the common good.</P>
      <P>I share Deputy Mac Giolla's worry that there is no reference to the continuation of public transport in the streets.  If it is not specified in the Bill then the measures to be taken by the commission could be of the order of thinking that if traffic were not let through there could be extra flower pots here, extra shrubs there, and extra cafe areas elsewhere.  They might stop the buses at, say, Parnell Square and people would get connecting buses at Abbey Street or it might be that buses going to the south would have to connect up on the far side of the river.  The commission might want to encourage people to stroll through the streets rather than having the through traffic.  Admittedly, these engineers and other experts are very balanced individuals but we have all had our experiences with them.  It is not right to pass legislation that is in any way loose and this legislation can be tightened up and improved by specifying that we suggest a concentration on, at least, a place for public transport through the areas under the control of the commission.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to return to the point again.  The intention is that the commissioners to be appointed will be sane. I shall add that as another requirement to those I outlined this morning of their being sensible, with a sense of style and <Col N="2198" /> of what the street should be.  Listening to some of the discussions this afternoon one would have to assume that I am going to recruit these people from the ranks of those who would set out with the malicious intent to do away with the centre of the city.</P>
      <P>We are talking about people who will give up a lot of their time and effort to trying to make the centre of Dublin a better place for people to enjoy.  They are, of course, going to be responsive to all points made by the Deputies.  They will not act like commissars.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>They are going to have to respond to and interact with the other body.  I have already assured the House that they will have the closest liaison with the Dublin Transport Authority.  For fear, as Deputy Burke seems to think, that they would think so little of this House that they might not read the Official Report of the debates, or the advice of the Deputies, I shall ensure that copies are made available, as I suspect most Ministers do when they invite people to serve on bodies created by the House.  I shall ensure that copies are made available to members of the commission and, in particular, will invite the members to pay attention to the specific points made by Deputy Mac Giolla regarding public transport.  However, I honestly cannot see how reasonable commissioners could try to improve the street and attract more people in to use the street without paying the utmost attention to ensuring that the public transport system was such as to allow the maximum number of people to use the street with the maximum amount of convenience to the access points for public transport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Basically, what is wrong with this street &mdash; and we probably all know it &mdash; is that there are many people who, if they were going from Limerick to Dundalk, would decide that the way to go was through O'Connell Street.  Traditionally, Deputy Burke talks about O'Connell Street being <Col N="2199" /> the important north-south route but because many are familiar with the area they head towards O'Connell Street once they have to cross the Liffey at all.  I should think the traffic that should logically be taken out of the street immediately is heavy vehicular traffic such as articulated trucks and the like.  It is quite pointless to see trucks carrying loads of sand and gravel traversing O'Connell Street.  That seems a totally inappropriate use of the street.  I am hesitant to become sucked into this discussion but I suspect that the Dublin Transport Authority and CIE will, as part of their function, be examining all the CIE existing routes to see how they can best serve the needs of people.  This is outside the remit of the Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission and my remit but perhaps existing routings for the public transport system could with benefit to the public be examined to see if in many cases they best serve the needs.  In the same way as we are all experts in relation to tourism, I suspect we all believe ourselves to be experts in the matter of improving the public transport services.  That will be one of the vital tasks facing the Dublin Transport Authority.  I appreciate the thrust of what Deputies are saying but I do not see any necessity for the inclusion of wording such as this in section 5 or in the Bill generally.</P>

      <P>The Minister is giving a remit to these people to tidy up the whole centre of Dublin.  Their concentration will be on trying to remove as much traffic as possible.  The Minister let it slip earlier on that he will not allow traffic from country areas or heavy traffic through the centre of the city.  That will be an attempt to change the habits of generations.  I am prepared to go along with Deputy Mac Giolla's amendment, although he is not going to push it any further.  Clear guidelines should be given to the commission <Col N="2200" /> that they should be encouraging the use of public transport.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 5 states:</P>
      <P>It shall be the general duty of the Commission to secure in the Metropolitan Central Area by every practicable means an improvement in environmental conditions, in the level of civic amenity and in the standard of civic design, with special reference to the convenience and safety of pedestrians, the general appearance of streets and buildings (including standards of design, maintenance and cleanliness), the regulation of traffic and parking and the provision of further civic amenities.</P>
      <P>This must be read in conjunction with the Second Schedule of the Bill which deals with the provisions relating to an improvement scheme and states:</P>
      <P>1.  An improvement scheme shall consist of a written statement and visual display indicating the manner in which the Commission considers that the Metropolitan Central Area should be improved and renewed and, in particular, may indicate</P>
      <P>(a)  the buildings and facades in need of improvement, redecoration, renovation or renewal,</P>
      <P>(b)  the advertisements, shop signs, hoardings and kiosks that should be replaced, redesigned, redecorated or renewed...,</P>
      <P>This brings me back to the question of compensation.  The general duties of the commission and the provisions relating to an improvement scheme could lead at least to the possibility of compensation claims under the Act.  Will the Minister clarify?</P>

      <P>The Minister has already ruled out a few himself.  A few that the Minister had in mind would not fit in with the exclusions so far.  I believe it is quite correct that there should be stronger control over the Minister of the day in the form of the scheme he would confirm.  As the wording stands the Minister merely has to consider any objections raised but, having considered them, he can then ignore them.  I contend that there should be greater control than that. I have no doubt that the Minister will refer back to 1982.  The Minister's normal practice, when unable to answer a point, is to refer to the Bill of 1982.  I would remind the Minister that we are discussing the Bill of 1986.  In view of the fact that the Minister was not very happy with the 1982 Bill I should like to know whether he has learned anything in the four intervening years and will accept the points I am now putting forward.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not, of course. Indeed I do not know that I even spoke in the Second Stage debate in the House. One does have to compare the change in attitude of Deputy R. Burke then and now.  At that time a variety of development authorities which he sought the permission of the House to establish would have been established and the relevant local authority would have had to amend their development plan to keep in line with the objectives of the development authority.  In the Bill we have put forward the commission must prepare an improvement scheme, take account of the development plan extant at the time, seek the views of Dublin Corporation and then the approval of the Minister.  They would have to be represented as a recalcitrant commission and an unreasonable Minister who would not take into account any responsible points put forward by Dublin Corporation in their observations on the improvement scheme.  I honestly do not expect that the commission will operate in that way.</P>
      <P>If I may revert for a moment to the unfortunate city manager whom I suspect by now to be heartily sick of the fact that I said he would be a member of the commission, again it is a lesson for the House that the membership of commissions should never be adverted to before the passage of the enabling Bill. Inevitably, as has happened today already, much of the discussion centred around the personality of the single person who I suggested would be a member of the commission rather than on the qualities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, the personage rather than on the qualities that might be expected of the commissioners.  I want to say how much I regret that.  Probably I brought it about by mentioning that I <Col N="2204" /> intended that the city manager would be a commissioner although I did so merely to demonstrate that I envisaged there being close co-operation between the commission and Dublin Corporation. But it is unreasonable to expect that the commission &mdash; which would contain within its membership the Dublin City Manager &mdash; would prepare an improvement scheme that would be vastly out of line with the objectives of Dublin Corporation. Indeed it would be unreasonable to envisage that Dublin Corporation, in their development plan, would not have the same broad objectives for the area as the commission.  Many of the fears being expressed by the Deputy are not well based.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>That brings us back to the points made all day here as we have discussed the matter.  I accept that the Minister has a reasonable approach to the matter, that any reasonable person examining the matter would do X, Y or Z depending on which section we happened to be dealing with.  The difficulty is that, when this Bill is passed, and becomes law, then it will not be what the Minister, or what we in this House feel is reasonable, rational or right that will obtain.  It will be what the law says.  The Minister says that any reasonable commission will take account of the reasonable objections of Dublin Corporation. But that is not what the Bill says.  The Bill says:</P>
      <P>Where an improvement scheme is submitted to him by the Commission the Minister shall consider any objections made to the scheme by Dublin Corporation within one month of its submission to him and may modify the scheme in such manner and to such an extent as he thinks proper and may approve the scheme or the scheme as so modified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the whole point of the exercise. If the Minister feels I have gone too far in the wording of my amendment, which says that the Minister shall modify this scheme in accordance with such objections, then he should use some form of <Col N="2205" /> wording in this subsection which would cover the point put forward by him, that any reasonable Minister will take account of reasonable points being made by Dublin Corporation in deciding whether to approve a scheme.</P>
    <P>In expressing those general sentiments, the Minister has portrayed himself as being reasonable about the matter but I must remind him that his sentiments will have no status whatsoever in law. The point I have endeavoured to hammer home all day, and Deputy Mac Giolla has done likewise, is that the intentions must be clearly written into the law before they will carry the force of law.  I contend that the debate in this House, despite the Minister's reasonable approach to it, will have no force in law, that the intentions must be written into the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the more conciliatory tone of the Deputy's last remarks in relation to the Minister being reasonable.  I might quote again the provisions of subsection (4) which say:</P>
      <P>Where an improvement scheme is submitted to him by the Commission the Minister shall consider any objections made to the scheme by Dublin Corporation within one month of its submission to him and may modify the scheme in such manner and to such extent as he thinks proper and may approve the scheme or the scheme as so modified.</P>
      <P>Surely then that subsection already contains the very spirit of Deputy R. Burke's requirement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to support the amendment.  I take it that the Second Schedule must be taken with this section, or will it be dealt with separately?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Within this section, particularly subsection (4) &mdash; in respect of which Deputy R. Burke has put down an amendment &mdash; the whole question of the relationship of Dublin Corporation to improvement schemes and so on is at issue.  I was reading the provisions of the Second Schedule which are affected by the provisions <Col N="2206" /> of this section.  I refer to paragraph 3 of the Second Schedule where it is said that, in preparing an improvement scheme the commission shall consult with Dublin Corporation and with the Dublin Transport Authority.  I take it this is an improvement scheme being prepared, in consultation with Dublin Corporation, the corporation having objections to the scheme being submitted to the Minister by the commission.  This section says that the Minister shall consider any objections made to the scheme by Dublin Corporation. He does not have to do anything but consider these objections.  The section states he may modify the scheme if he likes having considered the corporation's objections.  I take it that if the commission are consulting with the corporation in advance there will be negotiations and every effort will be made to have an agreed scheme.</P>
    <P>Using the Minister's criteria we must understand the commission will consist of sensible, sane people.  The Minister will have to accept also that Dublin Corporation will consist of sensible, sane people who are trying to do their best for the city of Dublin.  The commission will prepare this improvement scheme in consultation with the corporation and every effort will be made to get agreement and have compromises on various issues so that at the end of the day the scheme will not have objections from the corporation. If the corporation cannot agree to something and have a definite objection to it when the scheme is submitted to the Minister it will not be an agreed scheme.  The objections made by Dublin Corporation would be very serious objections. The improvement scheme will be prepared in consultation with the corporation so that in the normal course of events there should not be any objections. Deputy Burke's amendment is a very important one in that context.  There are very serious issues at stake and if the corporation made objections then the Minister would have to do more than just consider them.</P>
    <P>Deputy Burke's amendment suggests that the Minister modify the scheme in <Col N="2207" /> accordance with those objections, in other words, he should take the corporation's objections into account in approving the scheme.  If the Minister approves the scheme over the heads of the corporation and in spite of their serious objections on which they are unable to compromise, then at the end of the three years when it is handed back to the corporation they will eventually want to modify it.  Deputy Burke's amendment is an important one and the Minister should consider it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister makes the point again and again that this commission will be made up of reasonable men and that he is a reasonable man.  He said that the views of the commission will <Col N="2208" /> probably not differ very much from the corporation's view of how the city should be improved and developed.  If they are all so reasonable and agree with what the corporation are already doing in this area, why do we need a commission at all?  In view of the fact that the corporation will be taking over from them in three years' time and in view of the Minister's attitude in regard to the question of modification, if these major differences have arisen surely that is a recipe for trouble in three years' time. The Minister should accept the amendment put forward by me.</P>

      <P>Could the Minister clarify what will happen under this section? The Commission will prepare an improvement scheme working on the basis of the Second Schedule which sets out such things as the types of buildings and so on.

      <P>When the improvement scheme is approved by the Minister, if a person were applying for a planning permission, must he apply to the commission or to the corporation or to anybody? I ask the question because if the <Col N="2211" /> project fits into the scheme as approved by the Minister, it is exempted development and can proceed as an exempted development.  If a property owner wanted to make an alteration, does he apply to the commission or the corporation and does he still have the right of appeal to An Bord Pleanála?  If a property owner wants to develop a property and the development fits into the development scheme set out by the commission, does he still have to get by-law permission before any work can commence? If the projects fits into the corporation's development plan, which is different from the improvement scheme, but is turned down on the basis that it does not fit into the improvement scheme, can An Bord Pleanála overturn the improvement scheme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>When the commission prepare an improvement scheme any proposal which conforms to the improvement scheme could be regarded as an exempted development from the point of view of the Planning Act.  On the other hand, if a requirement for building by-law approval would normally obtain, the property owner would still be obliged to seek building by-law approval from the by-law authority in the normal way.  If a proposed development was not in accordance with the improvement scheme, or if an improvement scheme had not been drawn up for that area when the applicant applied the applicant would have to apply to Dublin Corporation for planning approval and would have the right of appeal to An Bord Pleanála.  The Deputy will notice that the section provides for an improvement scheme or schemes.  The most efficient way for the commission to go about their business, bearing in mind their limited life span, would be to prepare a number of improvement schemes. If they adopt that approach an applicant would be obliged to apply for permission in the normal way even if the area had not yet been addressed by the commission in the formal preparation of an improvement scheme for that area.  If a scheme was not in place the applicant <Col N="2212" /> would have to apply for permission in the normal way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a very complex problem.  Let us say that the corporation have a development plan for the part of O'Connell Street in which Clery's is situated.  The commission, we will say, have come up with a different improvement scheme for that portion of O'Connell Street as distinct from the development plan of the corporation.  If Clery's want to do some extension work at the back of their premises, not on O'Connell Street, do they apply to Dublin Corporation for planning permission or to the commission for a certificate saying that it is an exempted development?  How do they go about it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>The Dublin development programme is under review at the moment.  Early next year there will be a new development plan.  A number of things have to be considered, but at the moment the corporation are considering what to do about the oldest house in O'Connell Street, the O'Connell Hall, which was known as the Commercial Club but which is now vacant and in danger of becoming derelict.  If the corporation decide that that house should be preserved although preserving it as it is might not fit into the streetscape and if the commission decide that the improvement scheme is totally out of scale because it ruins the appearance of the street, and that the building should be knocked down and replaced by a different building, what powers have the corporation to protect the building they wish to preserve?  Who wins?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The improvements scheme would take precedence over the development plan.  If, in the example the Deputy gave, the improvements scheme provided for the facade of the Commercial Club to be altered and the development plan provided for the preservation of the facade, the improvements scheme would take precedence.  The Deputy's example is not very helpful <Col N="2213" /> because it is unlikely that an improvements scheme prepared by the commission would allow for the alteration or demolition of the facade of a building if the corporation had already decided it was of such significance that it should be preserved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>It has happened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies should remember the other sections which oblige the commission to consult the corporation and the transport authority in preparing an improvements scheme.  When the scheme is sent to the Minister he can take into account observations made by the corporation regarding the provisions of the improvements scheme.  In the examples which Deputy Mac Giolla has given, where two materially conflicting objectives were defined for a particular building, there would be an onus on the Minister to look very carefully at the plan.  However, it is very unlikely to arise as the corporation are considering placing a preservation order on the building to which the Deputy referred and I would be very surprised if the commission did not look equally carefully at the building because it is the oldest in the street.</P>
      <P>I do not know if Deputy Burke gave a good example because it relates to the rear of a premises which fronts on to another street which is not in the administrative area of the commission.  The improvements scheme in relation to property will basically refer to facades&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>If the proposed development is in accordance with the objectives set out in the improvements scheme, the potential developer will not need to apply for permission.  In the example the Deputy advanced, it is almost certain the property owner would have to apply for permission because it is unlikely that the commission would be dealing with the rear of premises in the improvements scheme, especially if the rear of the said premises is still within the administrative <Col N="2214" /> control of the corporation.  The Deputy's example referred to a particularly large block of property but if we consider instead a property where the entire curtilage is within the commission's administrative area and the changes proposed by the property owner were in accordance with an adopted and agreed improvements scheme, the property owner would not need to seek planning permission but would need by-law approval if necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Who decides that the development is exempt?  What is the time-scale if a property owner wants to develop a property and it is designed in such a way as to fit in as far as possible with the scheme prepared by the commission and approved by the Minister?  Will the property owner have to wait for the exempted development certificate?  If one part of the premises is in the administrative area of the commission while the remainder comes under the corporation, who decides what goes ahead?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to exempted development, the question of what is exempt is a matter of fact.  If there is a dispute in relation to a person claiming that development is exempted, the provision of the Planning Act is that An Bord Pleanála will determine whether the proposed development is exempt.  In relation to the earlier example which the Deputy gave, it is not very&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an awkward example.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The commercial premises to which he referred is a bad example because I was thinking about the rear of the premises and I said that it was outside the functional area of the commission. That premises is really another block of property opening on to another street at the rear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a side street at the back.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It divides it.  I understand <Col N="2215" /> that all the property fronting the commission zone is included in their administrative area.  Unfortunately, the example which the Deputy gave involves another property behind that again which faces on to streets which will still be administered by the corporation.  Perhaps the Deputy could give another example?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well.  One of the principal aims of the Bill, as the public perceive it, is to close Burgerland and McDonald's, or at any rate to force them to remove glaring signs.  Is the Minister saying that these places can remain if the facade is all right although the rear of the property may be used for something quite different from what the Minister would like?  Will the commission merely prepare a scheme which will say that McDonald's will have a new front but that they can continue to operate from the back?  Will the commission say that the use of property in O'Connell Street will be for insurance offices and that anyone involved in the takeaway business will have to close?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>A back lane McDonald's is a new animal.  Paragraph 3 of the First Schedule mentions that the areas to be covered by the activities of the commission are those thoroughfares or parts of thoroughfares specified together with the structures and other land fronting on to those thoroughfares or parts of thoroughfares.  I did say that the commission when preparing an improvement scheme would devote the greatest attention to the facades of buildings which face on to the main spine of the area.  That is self evident to anybody who thinks about it.  It would be a matter for the commission to decide that in order to get totally compatable usage an improvement scheme should get into as much detail as possible with regard to specifying what the renovations should appear like or in what way they should be used. An improvement scheme prepared by the commission should relate much more to the facades of the properties as they face on to the street.  The question of the <Col N="2216" /> particular type of usage would be of relevance. Fast food outlets are almost a necessary prerequisite of city centres and places where many people congregate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be pointless for me to say that I hope the activities of the commission would be to invite far more people to come into this area as pedestrians to use and enjoy it if I were equally to say that I hoped there would be a total elimination of fast food outlets. Fast food outlets can be provided without necessarily having the types of facades, the rather gaudy plastic facades, that most of them do have at present and which are one of the main areas of criticism from the general public and most interested people.  I mentioned in the other House that a new restaurant has been opened in Westmoreland Street in recent weeks and because some attention was given by the restaurateur to the facade it is very acceptable within the streetscape.  The restaurant is essentially a fish and chip shop but the facade is entirely in keeping with the general streetscape.  I gather that the operation is extraordinarily successful.</P>
      <P>Going back to the Deputy's example, I have seen in the centre of a large, very carefully preserved pedestrian area of Salzburg a McDonald's operating very successfully without any use of a neon or plastic facade.  I have also seen photographs of a similar venture, operated under the same franchise, in Heidelberg which is entirely in the style of the old city.  The legitimate needs of people for restaurants and places where they can get meals quickly and efficiently can be met without necessarily having to destroy the facade of the streetscape and the general appearance of city centre areas.  It has been achieved in other cities and I hope it will be possible to see it achieved here also.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin North-West):</i> Can the Minister tell us whether the commission will be empowered to see that there will be no further development of <Col N="2217" /> fast food restaurants?  While talking about a facelift for Dublin the Minister mentioned unsightly signs.  I would like to know whether the Minister or the commission will be in a position to remove these so-called signs?  Will anything be done to the buildings which are unsightly at present?  Does the Minister mean that the buildings will be clean?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to hear the Minister at last put the record straight.  On Second Stage there were various speeches about O'Connell Street being destroyed by these fast food joints. I had to draw attention to the fact that before these fast food joints there were ice cream parlours which are not really any different.  The only difference are the big signs.  It is not a question of telling people that fast food joints are out and that, as Deputy Burke has said, we must have insurance companies or banks.  That is not on, because all that one will get is whatever trade wants to establish in the place.  When <i>The Irish Press</i> left the corner of Abbey Street and O'Connell Street Dublin Corporation wondered what kind of business they could attract to the area and the only business they could attract was Kentucky Fried Chicken.  They have established themselves fairly reasonably in the area without any garish signs.  When the British Home Stores eventually leave &mdash; apparently they are not doing as well as they thought they would &mdash; what is going to be attracted in their place?  It may well be the biggest fast food joint of them all. No-one knows.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is getting down to brass tacks and it is a question of making the street look as good as possible.  He will have no control over what businesses are there.  It should be mainly an entertainment street where people would go for their food before or after their entertainment. There probably will be a few pubs there.  There was a time when there was never a pub in O'Connell Street. &ldquo;The 19&rdquo; was the first pub in O'Connell Street.  There is nothing wrong with pubs in O'Connell Street.  Possibly there will be cabaret joints etc.  The whole point is <Col N="2218" /> that the Minister is now beginning to see that it is a question of how the street looks.</P>
    <P>The commission are the bosses.  They do not require planning permission.  They only have to have regard to the development plan made by Dublin Corporation. A development plan takes a long time to formulate as there have to be consultations with every tenant and residents' association, every local councillor and whoever has an input to make.  An Taisce have also made a submission.  This has been going on for more than a year and a draft plan has yet to be produced.  That draft plan will have to go on public display in City Hall and citizens will be entitled to make criticisms or suggest additions. Eventually, a development plan will be produced for the city.</P>
    <P>However, the commission of six do not have to take into consideration the views of the citizens of the city and that is what annoys those who are involved in local government.  Those people know the wishes of those who make an input at community level, they know the views of residents' associations and tenants' organisations because they deal with proposals put forward by those groups.  This section makes the commission the top dog in regard to any laws that are passed whether they deal with planning or local authorities.  It worries me that the commission will be above those laws.  It is unfortunate that the last amendment which dealt with the consideration of objections in the preparation of improvement schemes was thrown out.  There is little we can do about this when the commission do not have to take into consideration planning laws or objections from the local authority.  In fact the commission will be commissars, something the Minister said they would not be, with full power to do as they wish.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Barrett asked if the commission will be able to control the number of fast food outlets in a particular area.  I should like to point out to him that, in the preparation of an improvement scheme, the commission may decide that there was sufficient of a particular usage <Col N="2219" /> in an area and indicate that they will not be prepared to see a proliferation of that type of usage in an improvement scheme. The important thing for the commission is to improve the appearance of the street and the facades of the buildings fronting on to the street but they need to do a little more.  The commission need to look at the uses to which the property is being put and if they feel there is a sufficiency of one type of usage they may decide that they need to control that use or encourage other uses.  Examples are dangerous but it is my view that one area that will prove most difficult for the commission, although it is of vital importance, is the area of Upper O'Connell Street which because of the proliferation of office type development has become much more dead than Lower O'Connell Street.  The commission will have to consider how the type of features to be used on the central mall and that part of the street will encourage people to use that end of O'Connell Street.  The commission may decide that there are sufficient financial institutions on the street&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of public toilets there also.  I agree with the Minister that examples are dangerous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I will discuss the control of birds with the Minister for Agriculture but I am not sure how far we can go in regard to something that can be regarded as an occupational hazard.  In preparing an improvement scheme the commission will have to ensure that there is a balance of uses in any part of the central area so that people will use the area for different reasons.  In the preparation of their improvement schemes the commission will have the power to address that problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>This relates to the whole question of compensation.  Will the commission refuse planning applications <Col N="2220" /> because there are too many businesses of a similar type but tell the applicants that if they put in a solid granite front with oak beams on a building at the other end of the street they would be given permission?  The question of compensation is very dangerous.</P>
      <P>The Bill amounts to no more than dealing with the dressing up of the front of buildings on O'Connell Street and Grafton Street.  It is a tidying-up operation. The Minister has some exotic ideas of having a number of cafeteria on the centre mall &mdash; it will be interesting to get the view of the Gresham on the idea of a cafe on the centre mall directly opposite it &mdash; but the Bill does not have anything to do with what the Minister's party have been claiming, that all the takeaways will be removed and the street will be returned to good old Victorian standards.  Mrs. Thatcher here we come again.</P>
      <P>The facades of the buildings could be improved if the Minister gave sufficient funds to Dublin Corporation and allowed the planning section of that body to concentrate on O'Connell Street and Grafton Street.  It is not necessary to establish a commission to do that work.</P>
      <P>Paragraph 1 of the Second Schedule states:</P>
      <P>1.  An improvement scheme shall consist of a written statement and visual display indicating the manner in which the Commission considers that the Metropolitan Central Area should be improved and renewed and, in particular, may indicate&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  the buildings and facades in need of improvement,...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If a company with premises in Grafton Street, O'Connell Street or Westmoreland Street want to improve the facade of the building but must comply with the commission's scheme, what funding will they get to carry out that work?  That company may be in financial difficulty and may not be able to adhere to the commission's scheme.  Who will be responsible for redecorating or renewing advertisements, shop signs, hoardings and kiosks?  Will the local authority be <Col N="2221" /> forced to provide the funds or will the Minister provide the money so that the local authority can undertake the work? If some of these signs are pre-1953, and some of them are, what will the Minister do about their removal?  Will the repaving of footpaths and the removal of such signs be done by the corporation as agents for the commission or will the commission employ private enterprise to do the work?  Who will liaise with the Department of Posts and Telegraphs and the ESB in respect of operations by their teams?  The Schedule provides for replacement or renewal of street furniture. Who will be responsible?</P>
    <P>Now we come to the upgrading of Upper O'Connell Street.  That part of O'Connell Street does not have as many takeaways as Lower O'Connell Street, but the Minister wants it developed. What development does it need?  We have the Gresham Hotel, the Royal Dublin Hotel, the headquarters of Dublin County Council, offices of some State Department, An Bord Telecom, the headquarters of Aer Lingus and other buildings in Upper O'Connell Street. According to the Minister, that part of O'Connell Street needs re-development whereas the other part does not, with its rows of restaurants of various sizes, shapes and nationalities.  According to the Minister, that is the ideal part.  Will the Minister clarify that?</P>
    <P>I am interested in the traffic mall, the central mall.  Will it be along the lines of the development of the old Covent Garden in London?  The re-development included a number of little restaurants under cover.  Would the Minister give us the benefit of his ideas on how he would have the development of O'Connell Street undertaken?</P>

      <P>Points were raised in relation to the provision in the Second Schedule for roadways, footpaths, <Col N="2222" /> other walkways, and traffic islands in need of resurfacing, repaving and renewal.  There was reference to the occupants of buildings who would refuse to do what the commission would direct them to do in regard to advertisements, hoardings, etc.  There is reference in the Schedule to street furniture in need of improvement, replacement or redecoration. There is provision in relation to roadways, footpaths, traffic islands.  The Minister has not given a clear indication of what he intends to do in this respect. He will be taking over powers from the corporation in regard to road maintenance, footpaths, sewerage and so on. Will the commission become a sanitary authority, a road maintenance authority, a litter authority?  Will they take over the care of trees and shrubs from the parks department of the corporation?  Who will do all those things on the commission's behalf?  Who will operate the sewerage service from Grafton Street to Cavendish Row?  Who will look after surface flooding on behalf of the commission?</P>

      <P>So Dublin Corporation will be continuing to do the work in relation to sanitary services but they will not hold control because the commission will have private enterprise, including union members, as subcontractors.  That brings me back to the powers the Minister retains for himself in section 6, subsection (4) of which states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where an improvement scheme is submitted to him by the Commission the Minister shall consider any objections made to the scheme by Dublin Corporation within one month of its submission to him and may modify the scheme in such manner and to such extent as he thinks proper and may <Col N="2223" /> approve the scheme or the schemes as so modified.</P>
    <P>At the end of the commission's lifespan, can the Minister by order continue to employ the private sector in street cleaning, etc?  The Minister has told us that improvement schemes will be a matter for the commission and that this has nothing to do with him.  He has a function and a power in this section.  I have cited subsection (4).  The Minister thinks that Lower O'Connell Street is the ideal type of area for redevelopment and that Upper O'Connell street is less than ideal, that it is dead, in the Minister's words.  At the upper end of O'Connell Street there are such buildings as the Ambassador Cinema and An Bord Telecom and on the far side Aer Lingus.  Then you have the Dublin County Council office block and on the far side the Gresham Hotel. Further down you have Bord Fáilte on the same side as the Gresham Hotel and the Savoy Cinema and on the far side down from the Carlton Cinema you have the CIE premises.</P>

      <P>Last night I had the pleasure of listening to the Minister, Deputy Noonan, read his speech and give his ideas and suggestions on what is or is not happening in this country.  One could not help wondering if he was talking about Ireland and the problems facing it in relation to unemployment.  He seemed to think that everything in that respect was all right and that there were very few problems.  Some of his suggestions and ideas put forward were very slack and do not deserve mention.  I hope the Minister is here tonight, Deputy Quinn, will be more definite and more concrete in his suggestions and ideas on the serious problem of unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I come from a county that has possibly the highest unemployment rate in the country, County Wexford.  We have something like a 20 or 21 per cent unemployment rate and the national average is 17½ per cent.  There were 7,500 people <Col N="2225" /> on the live register at the end of September. If one added the 2,000 people who have emigrated from that county in the past year and those who are not on the live register because they are too young to sign, or cannot get money at the exchange because their parents are working and so forth, the actual figure would be somewhere in the region of 11,000.  Compare that with 1982 when the figure was 6,500 to 7,000.  Wexford is in a crisis because of unemployment.  Despite the best efforts of the Government and the Minister, Deputy Quinn, who has had plenty of visits to that county, perhaps some of which he enjoyed, the problems continue to escalate.  Factory after factory has closed down but I am not going to name them here tonight.  As a result that area is demoralised and the people feel abandoned by the Coalition Government.</P>
    <P>The commitment of the IDA must be questioned.  The Waterford regional area of the IDA has been losing out to the rest of the country.  With regard to advance factories, a blanket decision was taken some time ago not to build any more advance factories because of the space available all over the country.  I would point out tonight that that decision, which obviously had the backing of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, was not a valid decision with regard to County Wexford, to Enniscorthy, Gorey and New Ross, where there are no advance factories.  If one has not an advance factory, one cannot compete with the rest of the country.  I appreciate there is a lot of idle space in advance factories in other counties, but I ask the Minister to do what he has done in Arklow, which is to build an advance factory, because of this very serious unemployment situation in Wexford.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce in a letter today to me gave the reason for making a special case for Arklow and Wicklow as being their high unemployment problem, but Wexford has that problem on an even worse scale. I ask the Minister to give some commitment tonight and find some way of getting around that problem in the <Col N="2226" /> interests of the unemployed people in Wolfe Tone Villas, in the Liam Mellowes area and in other areas where there are 60 per cent and 70 per cent unemployed. They do not accept an advance factory is not needed because there is plenty of space in Dublin; they want one for their own county.  The whole policy of the IDA must be looked at with regard to a total commitment to the south-east region.  We are losing out seriously in that area.</P>
    <P>Unemployment is a serious problem throughout the whole country and there are figures of approximately 70,000 young people unemployed.  If one adds in the 25,000 on training schemes and the 30,000 who have emigrated over the past year, one is talking about possibly 120,000 young unemployed people. Many more young people are being forced to beg for the dole because of the social welfare system.  If their parents are working they are told they are entitled to £1, £5 or £6 per week which means a loss of dignity, of faith and confidence.  It leads to a loss of belief in the people entrusted to govern this country.  As a result, many young people see no future in Ireland and take the emigrant ship at Rosslare, Dún Laoghaire or some other port for England or some other EC country, frustrated and disillusioned at not finding any work or having any hope or belief in their own country.  That is not good enough for our young, well educated young people.  They are talented and obviously have a role to play in developing the country in the next decade and the next century.</P>
    <P>The Government no longer care that thousands of young people, many ill-equipped, unprepared and financially destitute, are being forced to leave the country.  There are many ways in which we could look at making efforts to solve the unemployment problem.  We all accept it is a major task, but our natural resources have been neglected over a long period of time.  There is potential for job creation in agriculture, horticulture, forestry, fisheries, tourism and other areas of our natural resources.  Unfortunately, the people out there feel that we, as politicians, are living in an ivory <Col N="2227" /> tower, well protected, well paid, a selected few, and that we do not care about their problems.  The Government have failed for the past four years.  The only solution to the problems of unemployment and of our young people is to have a general election and let the Fianna Fáil Party take over and give some hope and future to the people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his courtesy.  I had not intended to go on at any great length, but I appreciate the gesture.  It is very clear the continuation of our present economic policies will lead eventually to economic collapse.  Despite the best efforts of many people on all sides of the House, it has not worked and that is demonstrably clear.  I do not believe it is in anybody's interest for one side or the other to start abusing their opposite numbers.  We all know that neither side has the monopoly of wisdom in this area.  My personal view and that of my party is that the State must play a less dominant role in the economic and social life of the country.  We believe it is time to control and reduce the present levels of taxation and the size of the public sector, to reduce public borrowings and drastically to lower the levels of tax which are now necessary to pay for the inordinate level of what is often poorly managed State activity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The policy failures of the past, which transcend the length of time this Government have been in office and go back to previous days, can be summed up as a rapid and continuing rise in public spending under all recent Governments, which incidentally indicate that, although public <Col N="2228" /> borrowing has increased by over £16,000 million in the past seven years, unemployment nevertheless has soared by almost 150,000.  Yet taxation has risen dramatically during the past decade. Today over 40 per cent of taxpayers pay above the standard rate.  If our taxation system has failed to deliver more jobs to create wealth to fund Government spending or to ensure social equality, some new thinking must be devised.  In the face of a situation where this Government and their predecessor allowed public spending to rise relentlessly and allowed expenditure to dictate the level of taxation, it is time for us to put our cards on the table and say we know what the problems are and what the parameters of the next budget have to be if we are to succeed.</P>
    <P>Perhaps it would be an indication of real national leadership if an invitation were extended to the leaders of all political parties and other corporate leaders, including the trade union leaders, to sit down around a table prior to the next budget and discuss whether we could get a broad outline of agreement at least on the shape of the budget deficit and perhaps certain other elements of budgetary strategy.  It would be asking too much and tempting fate to expect more detailed consultation or agreement. Perhaps we could put aside for once the rigid postures we adopt in debates in this House and say honestly that neither side has all the answers and that what we need is a sense of political agreement, that the problems are enormous, that they cannot be resolved if we are afraid of each other across the Floor and that we will need some degree of co-operation in understanding the problem and setting out the parameters within which we could work. Maybe it is a forlorn hope to expect that kind of consultation.</P>
    <P>The total artificiality of budget day here makes it very unreal.  We all flick through the back pages of the budget speech to find out what the taxation levels are.  It is as if one man and the group who work with him in the Cabinet are suddenly expected to have the answers to these problems.  I wonder if prior to <Col N="2229" /> the next budget we could have an opportunity at least to make an input and see whether we have the courage and wisdom to admit that we know we have to reduce public spending, that we have to cut taxation if we can and that we put forward some thoughts on how that might be done.  We could put those cards on the table.  My party have tried in a small way to do that recently.  I am not saying it should be the last word in that area but we have made a start.  This is the kind of approach the people need &mdash; an end to the political bickering and backbiting that goes on here too often and the beginning of some new attempt at consensus on key economic issues.  If it did not work, we could at the least say we had tried.  I commend that thought to the Minister and thank him for his intervention at the outset.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Opposition party put down this motion I took time in deciding the wording of the amendment which would emanate from the Government side.  I would remind the House that the text of our amendment is as follows:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann supports the Government's policies to promote the growth of employment and intensify the fight against unemployment and recognises that an effective response to the persistence of large-scale unemployment throughout the European Community requires stronger action and closer co-operation on the part of all Member States.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As in the case of so many of our other problems on this island, if words and resolutions, rhetoric and demands for action could of themselves solve a particular problem, then we would not have unemployment.  On all sides it is quite clear that unemployment has been identified as a major problem and none of the parties elected to this House has been shy or not forthcoming in putting forward <Col N="2230" /> proposals to deal with it.  Obviously it is not in the interest of any party or group of parties in office not to implement policies which would have as their effect the reduction of unemployment.  Having stated those two rather obvious things, why is it that this problem is now worse than it has ever been?</P>
    <P>A major priority of this Government has been to halt and reverse the growth in unemployment.  An unemployment crisis has been an endemic feature of our economy since the foundation of the State but especially during the past seven years &mdash; with the increase in emigration in more recent years emerging as a spin-off among certain groups.  Deputy Browne referred to that fact in his speech.</P>
    <P>The range of special interventions in the labour market which have been specifically developed by my Department within this Government in their term of office have attracted a lot of interest internationally, both within the European Community and the OECD.  As far as this Government are concerned, an indispensible element of any strategy to counter unemployment must be improved co-ordination of economic policies, particularly within the EC.  I have already described these intervention measures before and I will give up-to-date details later in my speech.</P>
    <P>I want to return to the realistic world within which we have to operate.  No State, least of all a small exposed and export-led economy like ours, can succeed in a &ldquo;going it alone&rdquo; strategy.  We have recent evidence of the reality of that statement.  The French economy between 1981 and 1984 had a similar experience. It is my sincerely held view that if Europe is to find its way out of its current economic predicament, if it is to provide employment for its people, then a coordinated and structured approach to economic growth and to employment creation is absolutely necessary.</P>
    <P>We cannot rely for recovery and employment growth on any spontaneous improvement in economic performance. In recognition of that fact and of the need to devise proposals to accelerate employment growth at European level, I <Col N="2231" /> have joined with my Italian and United Kingdom counterparts in putting forward proposals for an action programme for employment growth within the context of the EC.  The purpose of this programme is to have the battle against unemployment designated as the central issue facing the European Community.  I am confident that the programme will be fully endorsed by the Council of Social Affairs Ministers in December this year.</P>
    <P>The imperative of stronger action and closer co-operation at European level in order to create new jobs and reduce substantially the rate of unemployment is a message which seems to have passed the Opposition by.  The smokescreen which the Opposition have perhaps been creating around the issue of the future development of the Community must not be allowed to obscure the real challenges that now face Ireland and the Community itself.</P>
    <P>The prospects for strengthening the range of special labour market interventions, which this Government have already developed will in future depend greatly on how other member states channel their efforts to give priority to the struggle against unemployment within their own countries.</P>
    <P>There is no room for complacency at a time when the total number of registered unemployed in the Community stands at about 16 million.</P>
    <P>The reality is this: unless there is a concerted push towards more comprehensive employment policies within the Community, some of the stronger economies will continue to take refuge in modest economic growth, low inflation and the not very cheering reassurance that high unemployment has ceased to get worse.  That is why in the Social Affairs Council I am currently seeking to direct priority measures to those who continue to suffer most as a direct consequence of these economic conditions.</P>
    <P>The new Community action priorities thus include:</P>
    <P>&mdash;improved job and training opportunities for young people through <Col N="2232" /> mechanisms like the Social Guarantee for Youth, already in operation here.</P>
    <P>&mdash;Opportunities for training and retraining for the long-term unemployed similar to those successfully developed here by AnCO.</P>
    <P>Then there were the measures to assist the establishment of self-employed and co-operative undertakings along the lines of the highly successful Enterprise Allowance Scheme &mdash; which now has dealt with just over 15,000 people who have availed of its provisions &mdash; and the community enterprise programme organised by the Youth Employment Agency.  There has been the harnessing of local involvement and initiative through the kinds of projects which have been pioneered through the Social Employment Scheme and the advancement of women in non-traditional areas of employment and enterprise through equal opportunity policies.</P>
    <P>The Opposition are so stuck in a groove that it appears, on occasion, as if they would turn their backs on the most immediate and tangible step towards securing Community resources to meet our needs in all these areas.  I refer, of course, to the Single European Act.  The Single European Act is an attempt, indeed a very modest one &mdash; as the debate which will follow in this House will demonstrate &mdash; to cure what has been described in other quarters as the Eurosclerosis which has impeded growth and development and effective decision-making within the Community for several years past.  The Community has been left behind by its main competitors, the United States and Japan, in terms of job creation, economic growth &mdash; something that is of particular interest to the Leader of the Opposition &mdash; and technological advance.  Strengthening internal economic and social cohesion to eliminate regional disparities is part and parcel of the Community's agenda for completion of the internal market by 1992 and is very relevant to Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Single European Act is of vital <Col N="2233" /> importance to the success of our membership of the Community which in 1985 alone contributed, net, £900 million in the form of transfers to this country, thus supporting Irish agriculture on a massive scale as well as providing a very significant part of the resources needed for training and employment measures, especially for young people and for regional development.  In this context there is a clear obligation on all political parties, and also on key interest groups such as the trade union movement, to take full account of what the Single European Act entails in their evaluation and comments on its proposed ratification.  To this extent the fact that the Government will be publishing very shortly a clear and comprehensive document outlining what is contained in the Single European Act will assist that process.</P>
    <P>Last Friday, when attending the Standing Committee on Employment within the EC, I was interested to meet and listen to representatives of the European Trade Union Conferderation who, on the central issue of unemployment within the Community, made it quite clear that they supported and were positive in their attitude to the emergence of a genuine European Community which, in the course of its development, will take account of regional differences and imbalances.  The confederation representatives were critical of those who retreat back into thinking in the narrow national terms characteristic of a collection of isolated nation states.  The reason we should take account of that fact &mdash; as one of the speakers in this debate said here yesterday &mdash; is that the prospects for the reduction of unemployment in this country depend on our capacity to produce, whether agricultural goods, manufacturing goods or services, and depends increasingly on our capability to sell those products into the markets of the world. The richest and most lucrative market for us is that comprised of the 320 million people contained within the twelve member states of the EC.  Therefore it is absolutely essential that we not only <Col N="2234" /> release the internal constraints on economic development within the EC but ensure that, as of right, we have full access to those markets representing an enormous population relative to our size. Having set the context within which the prospects for a reduction of unemployment in this country must be examined, I want now to turn to the question of unemployment.</P>
    <P>The current level of unemployment remains unacceptably high to everybody in this House and indeed the country at large.  But the fact that the growth in unemployment has levelled out, that unemployment has stabilised, can no longer be ignored even by the Opposition. That is not to say that any of us should take any false comfort from that change but we are at least required to recognise that there has been a change and to take some kind of solace in respect of many workers who would otherwise have been threatened by loss of job.</P>
    <P>Let me give the House some statistics. The rate of annual increase in unemployment has declined from 15.6 per cent in 1983 to 8.4 per cent in 1984, to 6.4 per cent in 1985.  In the past year the rate of increase has fallen to 3.1 per cent.  I have always been as frank as possible in this House on this matter.  I should say that these figures must be set against an increase of approximately 27,000 in the labour force between April 1982 and April 1985 and against the migration figures we have as well.  I shall turn to the question of emigration later in my remarks.  Nevertheless, in terms of the numbers of redundancies, of the actual numbers of reductions of those people at work, there appears to be some indication that things have stopped worsening. The latest economic projections suggest that the picture will show further improvement in 1987, with both the numbers at work holding up and the unemployment rate beginning to decline.</P>
    <P>I should like to focus on two aspects of the unemployment figures which have been the cause of most concern in recent years and on which this Government have concentrated very considerable <Col N="2235" /> resources, sometimes under great criticism from people outside this House and, on occasions, from people within.  The two areas on which we have concentrated our resources are youth unemployment and long-term unemployment among adults.  Programmes for young unemployed people have been maintained at the high levels to which they had been expanded as a result of the introduction of the youth employment levy in 1982. The result has been a major improvement in the employment position of young people, now showing in a positive way on the unemployment register.  Between the emergence of the September and October figures there was a decrease of 1,589 in the number of young people registered as unemployed in this State. That is not an isolated figure; rather does it confirm the underlying trend in youth unemployment.  Ireland's youth unemployment rate is now one of the lowest in the European Community despite our having, proportionately, the highest youth population of any of the member states and the constant large increases in the labour force annually &mdash; 27,000 in the last year.  Now Denmark and Germany only have lower youth unemployment rates than ourselves and they have a significantly smaller youth population.  This improvement is not accidental.  It reflects the real contribution which the range of imaginative employment programmes have made to improving the labour market position of our young people. Similarly, with regard to the long-term unemployed, those over 35 years of age, the Social Employment Scheme and the Building on Experience AnCO programme, specifically designed and implemented to provide those people unemployed for more than one year with an opportunity to return to the dignity of working life through worthwhile employment, have been successful and are now at full capacity.</P>
    <P>The direct action programme outlined in the recently published White Paper on Manpower Policy strenghtens this policy of responding effectively to the needs of long-term unemployed people.  The direct <Col N="2236" /> action programme will offer the long-term unemployed referral to guidance and replacement.  This is vitally important as those who have been out of work for a considerable time can become demotivated.  It may be the case that they are still even trying to sell a particular skill which itself has become redundant. Depending on the outcome of the assessment and advice of placement officers, they will be offered opportunities on manpower programmes suitable to their individual needs, that is, if they cannot be assisted in getting a job straightaway.</P>
    <P>The Social Employment Scheme, the job search programme and the direct action programme I have outlined perform one other vital function &mdash; they demonstrate that it is possible to get over the rigidities which have grown up around the social assistance system and to provide those most in need of opportunity with a real alternative to the horrible trap of being out of work in our society.</P>
    <P>I want now to turn briefly to the issue of emigration, referred to in our amendment and also in the Fianna Fáil motion. I have referred already to emigration as being linked to the high level of unemployment. Once again, for the benefit of the House, I shall return to the question of youth emigration which warrants so much attention.  The bulk of that emigration is not concentrated among the very young school leavers regardless of all the anecdotal evidence trotted out by various people in support of that contention. Successive surveys of school leavers have failed to show any substantial increase in the proportion of school leavers living abroad one year after leaving school.  For example, in 1980, 2.2 per cent of the 1979 school leavers had emigrated while in 1985, 2.9 per cent of the 1984 leavers had emigrated.  Preliminary work on the returns relating to this year's survey suggests that there may even be an improvement, in other words a slight reduction, in the position of those who left school in 1985.  The surveys are available in the Library of the House.  I am quoting statistics that are a matter of public record.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2237" /> The importance of education to economic and employment growth and in preparing young people for the world of work cannot be over emphasised.  The data on the employment destination of Irish graduates in recent years bears out the well-established connections between educational credentials and job prospects. Between 1981 and 1985 the percentage of primary degree graduates obtaining employment increased from 41 per cent to 49 per cent, while those unemployed decreased from 6.4 per cent to 5.3 per cent.  These figures also reflect the contribution made by graduate placement programmes developed by the Youth Employment Agency.</P>
    <P>My concern and that of this Government is to ensure that nobody leaves Ireland seeking work in Britain or elsewhere who is either ill-prepared for the experience which they are about to undertake or ill-informed of the country to which they are travelling.  Therefore, I welcome the statement issued by the Irish Roman Catholic bishops after their recent meeting in Maynooth which focussed on the problem of &ldquo;unplanned emigration&rdquo;&mdash; I am using their phrase.  I was pleased to have the opportunity last April to address the annual conference of the bishops' commission for emigrants and to outline the practical steps being taken by the manpower agencies in response to the needs of emigrants.  I announced at that time that I had directed the National Manpower Service to improve its services to young people contemplating working abroad and to actively discourage unplanned emigration.</P>
    <P>Last week the bishops welcomed the two main initiatives developed by the National Manpower Service.  The first is an information campaign involving posters, leaflets and an information pack which will be available to schools, welfare offices and manpower offices.  Secondly, the National Manpower Service is organising briefing sessions to assist personnel likely to be involved in giving advice to prospective emigrants.  The Bishops' Emigrants Commission has been consulted by the National Manpower Service with regard to these developments.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2238" /> These initiatives will continue to be developed in the restructuring of the manpower services under the new national employment and training authority. The House will have an opportunity to discuss the establishment of the authority in the context of the legislation to be enacted later this year.  I welcome the support which has been given to that legislation, both today in the House and on previous occasions by the Opposition party and other parties.</P>
    <P>I have deliberately taken the issue of emigration and honestly responded to it in a manner with which I think this House will be familiar.  On previous occasions we talked about it in as factual a way as we could.  I know that many individual Deputies have visited people in London and elsewhere and spoke to some of the chaplains about the problems some of the young people have encountered.  Some of the problems have been difficult. There has always been in the past a certain reluctance by politicians in this country to honestly deal with the question of emigration.  Instead they use it as some kind of political stick with which to beat their opponent, particularly if their opponent happens to be in office.  I am quite prepared to take on the arguments that any politician on any side wishes to make on this issue.  I do not think that arguments at home between feuding political parties fighting over who is responsible for emigration does anything for emigration; nor does it do anything for those who have emigrated.</P>

Unless we get real economic growth, and not necessarily by reducing the size of the public sector which is not an answer to our problems, we will not be able to deal with the problems.  We will have fine speeches and many resolutions and we may see many different administrations in this country but unless we get that kind of economic growth I do not believe we will be able to deal with the problem.  For my part, and I am convinced of this more than ever before, the only way in which we can get economic growth is to be able to sell enough goods and services abroad at a price that commands a market so that we can live on this island in the numbers that we want.

      <P>The annual economic report of the European Community of which we are a member and which is the largest single market into which we sell, and which, with respect to our agriculture, is the only market effectively in real terms, as Deputy Browne of Wexford is well aware.  That document, which comes out officially from the EC, says that, despite their best forecasts and the slight upturn, unemployment within the Community of the European nations will remain at 10 per cent right through the early part of the next decade.  That is not what I or anybody wants but that is being forecast.  We must look at the real world within which we are forced to live rather than pretending like young, inexperienced people that because we do not like the real world we can have it changed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some of the measures which this Government have taken, particularly in my Department, have worked, perhaps not as successfully as I would like and we have made mistakes in other areas. However, I can say tonight, despite the criticisms that have been in some of the newspapers recently, that if it was not for the measures that I took as Minister for Labour there would not be 10,000 people tonight who have a job to go to in the morning under the social employment scheme; there would not be 15,000 people who have gone through the enterprise allowance scheme and who are now working in some form of self employment, and there would not be something of the order of 46,000 young people and <Col N="2242" /> people over the age of 25 who tomorrow morning have a place to go to in one of the 18 training centres and community workshops around the country.  If anyone from the Opposition feels that in the last four years I have been wasting money or should not have been doing those things I would like such a person to say that not just to me but to the 60-odd thousand people who tomorrow morning have something to get up for and something to go and work for.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Labour is a man for whom I have a strong regard and whose ability I admire very much, but I must say without intending personal offence to the Minister that I believe he has deluded himself into thinking that the situation is normal in this country.  I beg him please to call to some of the labour exchanges, the working class areas and the middle class areas to see the catastrophe and the tragedy that unemployment has brought to some households.  When we hear statements like &ldquo;unemployment has bottomed out&rdquo; which I have heard very often from the Government in the last few years and &ldquo;we are poised for recovery&rdquo;&mdash; that much hackneyed phrase &mdash; what the Minister said tonight would be amusing were it not so tragic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In tabling this motion on unemployment the Fianna Fáil Party rightly ask Dáil Éireann to condemn this Government's failure to halt the rise in unemployment.  As a constructive Opposition we call on the Government to take urgent action to deal with the present crisis.  Everyone will agree that a crisis it is with almost a quarter of a million people unemployed and a rate of emigration reminiscent of the fifties.  It must be remembered that over 80,000 people emigrated in the last four years.  That justified our leader's statements that the overall picture amounted to a national catastrophe.  If you do not believe that <Col N="2243" /> emigration is taking place at a phenomenal rate, just call down to the American Embassy at 6 o'clock every morning and see the young people queuing up there. Our own television did not show this but BBC2 television showed the long queues of these young people going out to be exploited in America, and the Government's answer is that we must provide facilities for them in England and in other countries.  That was what came across from the Minister.</P>
    <P>On the Coalition's accession to office 170,000 people were unemployed, something which the Coalition described as a disastrous figure in their <i>Joint Programme for Government</i> of December 1982, page 7.  They said that pending a soundly based recovery in employment based on competitiveness, emergency measures were needed to halt the rise in unemployment which had reached disastrous proportions.  This sounded promising and I remember reading it at the time and saying, &ldquo;Hear hear, this is very good.&rdquo;  The reality was different.  No emergency measures were introduced and unemployment continued to spiral. By 1984 and the publication of their other document <i>Building on Reality 1985-1987</i> they had clearly given up hope of solving the unemployment problem.  In that document there was no mention of the disastrous unemployment levels.  For some inexplicable reason that was left out.  Rather we were told, and I quote from page 31; &ldquo;It would be wrong to draw too pessimistic a conclusion on unemployment from the difficult experience of the past few years.&rdquo;  At this time the unemployment figure had climbed to 212,300.  This is a classic example of Orwellian doublespeak.  When Fianna Fáil were in Government the unemployment figure of 170,000 was disastrous but with the Coalition in Government and 250,000 people without jobs there is no reason to be too pessimistic.</P>
    <P>The truth is that employment creation has ceased to be a priority of this Government. It is disturbing that those who forecast improved conditions for economic investment see no sign of substantial <Col N="2244" /> improvement in employment.  Evidently the Government accept this view and job creation is no longer seen as synonymous with economic growth.  The Government are not prepared to harness the improved economic conditions they claim will come to initiate the job creation programme, or a job creation crusade which is a proper name for what should be done, and this country needs that type of crusade above all.  Rather they claim to concentrate on cultivating the conditions for economic recovery.</P>
    <P>What good is economic recovery if it does not create jobs for the unemployed? The recent AIB report forecast increased economic activity with static high levels of unemployment.  Is this what we want? If market forces will not create the jobs then the Government must do so, and most people realise that this Government will not.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce said that Governments do not of themselves create employment nor should they be expected to do so.  As I said, jobs are not a priority of the present Government.  If they were we would have a comprehensive employment plan formulated with targets for job creation.</P>
    <P>I think that there will be areas for increased employment in the future which need to be clearly identified and the conditions for their expansion need to be developed.  To do this would require great political will, something which, I am sorry to say, this Government have not got in this regard.</P>
    <P>If jobs are not the Coalition's main economic priority, book-keeping certainly is.  Remember that this is the Government who were going to phase out the current budget deficit by 1987, and they deflated the economy so much that this proved to be impossible.  This is proof positive that monetarism does not work, especially in a small open economy like ours.  Monetarism has been the ruination of our economy.  Does anyone realise just how serious is the fact that native manufacturing industry has been wiped out by this recession?  We will have to rebuild, to start from scratch, and pursuing restrictive economic policies cannot achieve this.  It might not be so bad had the <Col N="2245" /> belt tightening produced some result, but it did not.  We have had four years of belt tightening and no results.  In 1982 each person in Ireland owed £1,400 to foreign banks.  Today each person owes £2,500 to the banks abroad.  The Government's economic policies of which they boast so much have sent many companies to the wall.  Already 384 liquidations have occurred in the first six months of this year along with 58 receiverships. Therefore, production plummets and national wealth drops, leaving less money to the economy so that the Government have to borrow more to meet their spending requirements.  If we have to borrow money surely it makes more sense to borrow for expansion rather than for retrenchment.</P>
    <P>Job creation must be approached on three levels: first, the industries that can develop by a fuller utilisation of our national resources; second, the development of a high technology industry, and finally, structural changes that can be made in educational and employment practices to improve the employment situation.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that as many as 30,000 people emigrated last year.  If this continues our population will again fall and national self confidence will further decline.  The main reason for this exodus of well educated young people is the spirit of hopelessness which is promoted by the philosophy and policies of this Government. The tragedy is that in order to maximise the gain from future technological developments we will need a highly skilled labour force and these are the people who are emigrating.  The State having invested in the education of these people is now losing their expertise to foreign Governments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>This national tragedy is worsened because various Government Deputies and Ministers actually encourage young people to emigrate.  Each year the labour force increases by approximately 16,000.  In the period up to 1990 <Col N="2246" /> there will be another 80,000 young people in the labour market.  It is a measure of the hopelessness engendered by this Government that we cannot see any hope for these young people.  We have Government agencies about which the Minister for Labour boasted.  We have the massive bureaucracy of AnCO and the National Manpower Service but what we do not have is an overall manpower policy, to combat that problem and to plan for the future.  We need immediate investment in our infrastructure which would not only lay the basis for future growth but would create immediate jobs and put more money in circulation.  This would create a much needed dynamism in the economy and serve as a motor for economic growth.  The most obvious industry which would benefit from this would be the construction industry in which 50,000 builders are unemployed.  The sales of domestic cement have dropped by 30 per cent since this Government came into power and yet great areas of our cities lie derelict and our roads are being used by some car manufacturers, as testing grounds for car suspension systems.  The Government's response in this year's budget was to cut back £25 million in the capital investment programme which will mean more building workers out of work, more potholes on the roads and more derelict sites in our cities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an alternative and it is up to Fianna Fáil to make it clear to the people. On returning to office Fianna Fáil propose to invest £200 million in the construction industry.  This is not merely a cash injection but an investment which will take workers off the dole, relieve hardship and put more money into circulation. It would cost the State money in the short term, but economic recovery cannot take place without investment. Market forces cannot work for the benefit of a small open economy.  The choice is between investing for growth or continuing under this Government with the economy being strangled.  The money can come.  Internationally Ireland is a low risk debtor and the world bankers must have an interest in our economic growth if they expect their debt to be repaid.  We would <Col N="2247" /> have little problem in having international bankers see that allowing us to defer loans and use the money to create employment would be in their interests and those of the economy.  If we have a well structured and fully costed investment programme which would lay the basis for economic recovery in the next ten years or so, there would be great hope for our country.</P>
    <P>In an agricultural country we manage to import over £1 billion of foodstuffs annually.  This is scandalous.  If we were to fulfil our potential in production, processing and marketing of food we could bring enormous increases in employment. Fianna Fáil is the only party which is developing policies to tackle this problem. They have produced a policy to establish An Bord Glas and Food Ireland which will go a long way towards alleviating the glaring anomalies of our food importation.  In order for us to realise our potential as a major exporter we must get more crops growing.</P>

The horticultural industry could create demands on the home market for fruit and vegetables and could also build for itself an international export reputation for high quality produce. We spend over £27 million a year on tomato and potato imports.  These are luxuries we cannot afford.  We can produce these foods ourselves.  We need glasshouses, cheap energy, and so on to put us on a par with the Dutch exporters. In agriculture, in horticulture and in food processing with the machinery, we can create an enormous numer of jobs.  We can also create jobs in mariculture.

      <P>Deputy Keating advised us not to take rigid postures.  This problem has reached such serious proportions that it is our duty to take a very serious stand on this problem.  I am sorry that neither Deputy Keating nor the Labour Party are here to hear us tonight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is the small things that bring home the magnitude of this problem.  I can recount two incidents which occurred during the summer and which really brought home to me the seriousness of the problem.  One morning last June when passing through Ballsbridge I became rigid with horror at the length of the queues of young people, the best and brightest of our young people, outside the American Embassy, queuing up to get out of Ireland to America where as Deputy O'Connell said they will in many cases be exploited and used as cheap labour.  In September I walked into a hotel bar in London and half the patrons of the place knew me by my first name. I recognised many of my ex-constituents. The emigrants I met there were not unskilled workers such as the ones we <Col N="2249" /> exported in the forties and fifties, but highly educated young people full of ability and talent.  It has been estimated that it costs between £15,000 and £25,000 to educate an undergraduate in electronic engineering.  Using that figure, last year we produced £7 million worth of graduate skills in electronics and more than half of those people emigrated; about £4 million worth of expensively produced skills went abroad.  Apart from the economic damage to the country we have not taken into account the trauma and personal tragedy of emigration.</P>
    <P>
      <i>The Limerick Chronicle</i> an old established newspaper in Limerick contains a section which gives a sort of flashback to what happened perhaps ten or 20 years ago.  In last night's <i>Limerick Chronicle</i> there was a question from the Labour Deputy for Limerick East, Mr. Stevie Coughlin in 1966, 20 years ago to the Taoiseach, Sean Lemass, TD about the increase to 35,000 in unemployment and the Taoiseach assured him that it would be brought down in the near future. Would that that we were back in those days.</P>
    <P>The Government response to this problem is a flippant debating society response.  They say unemployment has bottomed out and that the underlying trend has stabilised.  The trend did not stabilise between now and last year nor between now and this time last month. When did the underlying trend begin to stabilise?  The House and the country deserve a better response from the Government than this.  Now the Government are concealing the unemployment figures by hiding behind statistics.  The unemployed are hidden beneath a plethora of schemes, job training programmes, employment programmes, social employment schemes and many others.  All these things are good in their own way but not when their main purpose is as a device for hiding the truth from the people.  The other statistics which we do not have officially are emigration statistics. We managed to get our own figures which show that over 80,000 people emigrated since 1982 when this Government <Col N="2250" /> first took office.  Apart from those hidden figures and the emigration figures, the Government admit in the publication of their own figures that unemployment is now at 18 per cent of the population and is approaching 20 per cent.  The live register should be called the lie register but, even according to that register, we are approaching a figure of one in five unemployed.  If Deputy Keating or any other Deputy advises us not to take a rigid stand on that I must disagree.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Labour, Deputy Quinn, referred at great length to statistics and social employment schemes.  Those schemes are merely an exercise in expensive window dressing to hide the facts and to divert attention from the problem instead of solving it in a realistic way.  Do the Government intend to consign the unemployed and school leavers to the sort of sophisticated form of famine relief which they get from the schemes? Is this the answer of the Government of integrity to the problem which has grown and grown under their stewardship without any serious attempt at corrective actions?  Even that most respected body, the National Economic and Social Council, have stated that those schemes are all very well in their own way but that definite economic policies are needed, orientated towards job creation and policies which will lead to the creation of real jobs, not gimmicks or short-term schemes which hide the facts.</P>
    <P>We have waited for four years to see if the Government would recognise the problem and take realistic action.  Unfortunately for everyone, especially the young people who will have to emigrate, the overwhelming evidence is that the Government have not yet grasped the reality.  The speech of the Minister for Industry and Commerce Deputy Noonan, illustrate my point.  He said that the problem of unemployment represents the greatest challenge facing us today. We are sick of this lip service as we have been listening to it for the past four years. We do not want any more words, we want action.  We know that the greatest <Col N="2251" /> problem facing the country is unemployment. Those who have not attained primary certificate level know it also but we want to know what the Government's proposals are for dealing with it.  We want an account of their stewardship over the past four years and their plans for the future after the years of mismanagement. The Minister went on to say that the Government are committed to contributing in every possible and rational way to a solution to the problem.  He also said that he used the words &ldquo;contributing to a solution&rdquo; because the Government's task is to create the right environment for jobs.  There is an echo of this environmental talk further on in his speech about job creation when he said that Governments of themselves do not create employment and that they should not be expected to do so but that they have a duty to create the right environment and to put in place the proper mechanisms to enable industry to prosper and to respond to the challenge of unemployment.  He went on to say the Government had been unstinting in their efforts in this regard. I can hardly believe the Minister said such things.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance paid lip service to the idea of creating the right environment and economic climate for industry to prosper.  We heard the same thing a few minutes ago from the Minister for Labour.  If imposing the highest rates of personal taxation in the civilised world, the deposit income retention tax which takes 35 per cent of the deposit interest accruing to people whose incomes are so meagre they are not even in the tax net and imposing savage rates of VAT on our most labour-intensive industries create the right environment for industry to prosper and for job creation, then words have truly lost their meaning.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce spoke about the Government's greatest achievement, the attainment of a lower rate of inflation.  We want to nail this misconception once and for all.  The Government cannot have it both ways. The speeches of the Minister for Labour and that of the Minister for Industry and <Col N="2252" /> Commerce were peppered with references to the high rate of unemployment throughout the EC.  We are supposed to conclude that because there is a high rate of unemployment there the Government cannot be blamed for unemployment here.  However, inflation has come down substantially to levels lower than ours throughout the EC over the past couple of years and no doubt the Government will claim credit for that.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Labour said that inflation is expected to be 3 per cent next year.  Respected economic commentators agree it will be between 3.5 per cent and 4 per cent which is the highest in the EC. The relative uncompetitiveness of Irish industry, which existed when inflation was in double figures in all EC countries, remains.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce made much play on the famous industrial White Paper published in 1984 and he said that 12,000 jobs were created in 1985, presumably as a result of the policies which flowed from it.  We are not fools.  We are not worried about one side of a mathematical equation, we want to see the whole equation.  At the beginning of 1985, according to the famous live register, unemployment stood at 204,000 people but at the end of 1985 it stood at 230,000.  We are worried about these figures and we are not concerned about whether 12,000 or 120,000 jobs were created in 1985.  We are also concerned at the continuing net loss in employment.  During the same period, industrial employment was reduced from 319,000 to 305,000.</P>
    <P>The Minister went on to refer to the business expansion scheme.  Time does not permit me to go into it fully but anyone who has a knowledge of the subject will know that the business expansion scheme introduced by the Government is a charade and a joke.  The Government have a habit of announcing schemes with a flourish of publicity, pretending they are doing something but hedging them in with so many restrictions, subclauses and restraints that they will achieve nothing. The Minister went to great lengths to point out the beneficial effects of the <Col N="2253" /> business expansion scheme but the statistics prove otherwise.  I did not have to look for any statistics to tell me the result of that scheme because the Minister told us that to date an investment of £7.5 million has taken place under this scheme.  Do the Ministers not know that £7.5 million equity investment at this stage does not even begin to solve the problems which the Government's policies have caused?  The Minister went on to say that the success of the business expansion scheme cannot be measured solely in terms of statistics.  Of course it suits the Minister to say that.  He said that the scheme has had a very important catalytic effect in terms of focusing attention on the benefits of equity-style investment. Can the Minister tell us what that means?  Are we to take the Government's response to the problem in terms of a debating society instead of getting down to solving our problems?</P>
    <P>The whole tenor of the debate has disappointed me greatly.  The Government seem to think that if they catch the Opposition out in regard to a statistic the problem will magically disappear and that they have won another victory.  However, it is only a debating victory; if the Government continue in this fashion and if unemployment keeps growing then the country is on the road to disaster.  The only thing which will produce a catalytic effect on the economy is a general election and a change of Government.  We should have strong, single party Government that can solve the problem in a realistic way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Labour (Mr. Kenny) Enda Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Labour (Mr. Kenny)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Fianna Fáil motion is very broad.  It seeks to condemn the Government for their failure to arrest the continuing rise in unemployment and emigration and calls for urgent Government action to deal with the present crisis.  I want to say to Deputy O'Dea and to his fellow speakers on the other side of the House that I have listened with interest to this debate both inside and outside the House.  Many valid points and criticisms have been made both of this and previous Governments. <Col N="2254" /> The emotional word &ldquo;emigration&rdquo; has been raised time and again.  The only action that has been called for which seems to be of an urgent nature is to have a general election on the assumption that a single party Government, Fianna Fáil, would be returned to power and would set about solving all of these difficulties so that everything in the garden would be rosy.  If that is the illusion that is being perpetrated on the Irish people, it is a mythical illusion; it will not happen.  I listened, like many other people, when Deputy Haughey was first appointed Taoiseach, to his address to the Irish nation when he said we were living beyond our means and it was genuinely time to do something about it in a national sense.  Many people expected that action would follow but it did not either on that occasion or on the second occasion when the opportunity arose.</P>
      <P>Both Deputy Gallagher and I come from a part of the country which has been ravaged by emigration over the past five generations.  It is fair to say that many people have left our shores in recent times.  Some have gone to America, some have gone to the UK and some have gone to the Continent.  Many of these are in a different category from those of the old style emigration of 40 to 50 years ago who left never to return.  At least our educational system now allows people to avail of opportunities which were not available to their parents.  If people choose to leave the country it is our responsibility, through the educational system, to see that they are properly prepared for wherever they go to.  Many of the graduates I have spoken to were leaving of their own volition but intend to come back when the opportunity arises. They wish to continue to do that.  It is very important that young people keep their links with this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Statistics have been given by the Minister for Labour with regard to the categories of young people who emigrate.  It is very fair to say that this country faces an enormous challenge in the years ahead.  One can ask whether this or another Government wish to continue on a day to day basis attempting <Col N="2255" /> to manage a practically unmanageable economy in many ways or whether we are to drift towards the next century and have the condemnation of all young people or all our future workers on the various schemes which have been put forward.  These schemes have been decried by many Fianna Fáil speakers.  In any one year approximately 90,000 are trained and given the opportunity on some programme or other to do something which is of benefit to themselves and which they can follow through.</P>
    <P>On many occasions the question of the country's infrastructure has been raised. As one who must travel the length and breadth of Ireland I can say that our infrastructure has improved genuinely in the past ten years.  Rural Ireland has been supplied with water and ESB schemes and roads have been improved.  One hundred million pounds per year is being spent on the school building programme. The vast office blocks which were once required are no longer required because of changes in technology.  Two hundred million pounds worth of reconstruction work has been generated through the grant schemes.  That will go some way towards allieviating the unemployment problem in the industry.</P>
    <P>I want to commend the Government's flexibility in their approach towards the creation of the various schemes.  While they may have been decried and run down by various speakers they are a genuine attempt to provide an opportunity for young people to do something better than was available to them heretofore. While we would all like to have permanent jobs available for everybody in the morning I, like many other public representatives in this House, know the genuine gravity of the problem in dealing with young people who ask us to get them jobs in a State or semi-State body.  It is not possible to do so.  I want to conclude by supporting the Government amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>This Coalition Government have the worst record on employment of any Government in the history <Col N="2256" /> of the State.  They came into office with a pledge to reduce unemployment but instead after four years it is beyond anyone's worst possible expectations.  The present horrendous figures for unemployment and emigration are directly attributable to the past four years of economic mismanagement.  The latest official figures reveal a total of 237,000 potential workers on the live register, the highest October total on record.  As winter draws in, bringing with it the inevitable seasonal layoffs in what remains of the building trade and in the tourist industry, the dole queues are likely to increase further, taking the number of those officially registered as unemployed close to the quarter million mark.</P>
      <P>But these figures illustrate only a part of the crisis we face.  For while Coalition Ministers have been implementing their high-taxation, monetarist experiments with the public finances, some 100,000 Irish citizens, many of them highly educated young graduates, have left the country so that there is hardly a family in the land which has not been affected and felt the impact and the sadness that emigration brings.  It makes me inexpressibly angry to hear people attempting to claim some beneficial side to emigration, that, for instance, these people will go abroad, gain experience and knowledge and come back to benefit the Irish economy.  We know that is rubbish and nonsense.  The vast majority of these young people go because they have no job here or any prospect of getting a job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to those officially registered, there are another 40,000 potential workers being kept off the official live register by a range of temporary works schemes, training courses and other temporary expedients.  Adding all these tens of thousands together, those who have been forced into idleness and dependence, those who have given up hope and left and those who have been diverted into those largely pointless training courses, it is clear that somewhere between 350,000 and 400,000 Irish workers have been denied employment by this incompetent Government and <Col N="2257" /> have thereby been removed from the productive process.  The value of their contribution to national output, were they at work, would be at least £4 billion annually. Our gross national product at present is £16 billion.  If those people had been given the work they are entitled to, our gross national product would be increased by one quarter and would be £20 billion today.</P>
    <P>Nor can the Government blame the general world recession any longer.  I was interested to hear the Minister for Labour mention the EC.  It is true that unemployment is high all over Europe but whereas unemployment in Ireland between 1979 and 1982 grew no faster than the EC average, since 1982 it has grown twice as fast as in any other EC country even leaving emigration out of account.  The combination of policies pursued by the Government has been quite lethal.  We have had deflationary, high taxation policies, cuts in investment and policies leading inevitably to high interest rates.  There have been no positive, developmental policies designed to increase employment but only temporary schemes designed more than anything else to manipulate the official unemployment statistics.</P>
    <P>Far from providing the 17,000 to 20,000 additional jobs necessary to cope with the annual increase in the labour force the Government have actually eliminated between 60,000 and 70,000 jobs which were in existence when they came into office.  The Government's employment policies and targets have been a disaster.  They have not halted nor reversed the rise in unemployment as promised in the <i>Joint Programme for Government</i>.  The new industrial policy announced in 1984 has been a total failure and has been quite unable to stem the industrial job losses let alone create new jobs.  As a number of my colleagues have said the targets in <i>Building on Reality</i> bear no relation whatever to reality.</P>
    <P>The most compelling evidence of Coalition failure is the mass exodus of young people leaving the country which is now running at at least 30,000 per year. It is my view, and all the indications are, <Col N="2258" /> that emigration is actually accelerating; it is getting worse by the day.  Families and communities are losing young people who have lost hope of ever finding a job at home.  Nearly half of the young Europeans featured in that celebrated IDA advertisement, for instance, have left the country.  The massive investment the country has made in those young people is being drained away.  That is the real black hole in the Irish economy.</P>
    <P>Whatever sector of the economy one looks at, it is the same bleak picture.  The flight from the land is accelerating as incomes are reduced drastically, as investment in manufacturing industry falls off and employment falls.  The recession in the construction industry is unprecedented.  The index of employment in firms employing more than five people has now dropped to substantially less than half what it was in mid-1981. There has even been a fall in the services sector, the one sector that was supposed to be the principal source of new employment under the new industrial policy.</P>
    <P>However, allowing unemployment and emigration to rise has not brought any improvement in the public finances, if that was the policy, and I think it was. The national debt and the foreign debt have virtually doubled in four years and it looks as if the national debt this year will rise to over 145 per cent of our gross national product.  In other words, the national debt will be about one-and-a-half times what we produce in any one year.  Despite all protestations of fiscal rectitude which we are sick and tired of hearing, the current budget deficit this year is heading for an all-time record of about 9 per cent of GNP.</P>
    <P>The most depressing feature of all is that the Government have no employment policy.  Various expedients have been tried and failed.  The National Development Corporation is a farce.  The Cabinet Employment Task Force have done nothing and now the Youth Employment Agency is being wound up. There are no developmental policies, only recently a rush of election expenditures to bolster the fortunes of Fine <Col N="2259" /> Gael and Labour Deputies in marginal constituencies.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil, since the foundation of the state, have steadily pursued policies of economic development.  We have set out on many different occasions the positive action that is required of the Government. We have criticised again and again their bookkeeping mentality, the hostility or indifference in budget decisions to the need for enterprise and the total lack of any developmental philosophy.  A Coalition at war with themselves cannot possibly produce the policies needed for economic recovery.</P>
    <P>Even the Central Bank, which these days seems to espouse a strange kind of optimism, sees no improvement either in employment or unemployment.  The latest issue of <i>European Economy</i> notes that over the 12 months up to June of this year the sharpest fall in industrial production has been experienced in Ireland, with a fall of 5.5 per cent.  If the Government cannot or will not take urgent action to deal with this unacceptable situation, if they acknowledge that they are unable to fulfil their mandate, then they have a duty to bring that mandate back to the people for decision.</P>
    <P>As the unemployed attempt to sort out their lives as best they can, trying to survive from week to week on inadequate incomes, they have to endure lectures from patronising Ministers even to the extent of being actually blamed for what the Government have done.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach recently took time off from his monotonous refrain of blaming Fianna Fáil for his own failures to turn instead to try to put the blame on to the shoulders of Irish workers.  He had the temerity to claim that absenteeism was one of the main reasons why Ireland was no longer attracting foreign investment and that workers were deliberately closing down their own factories.  The Minister for Industry, Trade and Tourism, whose specific responsibility it is to implement a policy of industrial development to provide employment, has now apparently decided that he will do nothing of the sort and that he must not <Col N="2260" /> be expected to provide or create employment. The young people of Ireland now know that they cannot look to this cold, calculating politician for employment opportunities.</P>
    <P>But the real crime of the Government is not that they have let unemployment climb steadily towards a quarter of a million, nor that they have been responsible for such appalling levels of emigration. It is not even that they have consistently stood back and refused to save existing jobs nor that they have failed to grasp obvious opportunities to provide new jobs.  The really serious damage they have done lies in the fact that they have taken away people's hopes and persuaded large numbers of people, unfortunately, that there is nothing that can be done about our economic problems. They radiate a negative atmosphere. They have created a mood of despair and hopelessness up and down the country.  They have spread failure like a contagious disease.</P>
    <P>If the Government had systematically set out four years ago to undermine the productive base of the economy they could not have done worse.  Having devastated the building industry, leaving 50,000 building workers on the dole, they moved on to spread the dead hand into every corner of the land, leaving a trail of destruction highlighted by the failure of Irish Shipping, Verolme, Dunlop and Ford to name but a few of the most important.</P>
    <P>Both public and private sector investment have slumped dramatically over the last four years.  High-taxation policies and the failure to implement any real policy of economic development have created a climate hostile to investment and driven a large volume of the nation's capital out of the country.  A complete lack of confidence in the Government's ability to control the public finances has done great damage in the financial markets and has driven up interest rates.  The much heralded consumer boom has not materialised and does not look like materialising.  How could there be any kind of economic revival when the savings of the people which should be <Col N="2261" /> available for investment have been driven out of the country by the taxation policies of the Government?</P>
    <P>The first task of the next Government will be a psychological one.  It will be a battle to restore the confidence of our people in their ability to tackle their economic problems and to succeed in overcoming them.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil did that job before in the fifties.  At that time an incoming Fianna Fáil Government inherited an economy which was on the floor; there was mass unemployment and emigration and the same sort of air of defeatism that prevails today.  Fianna Fáil faced that challenge and with the right policies and inspired leadership led the country into a new era of economic development in the sixties. Fianna Fáil have the political determination and the experience to do that job again.  We know there is an alternative to permanent mass unemployment and emigration; an alternative to a no-growth economy, rising national debt and crushing taxation.</P>
    <P>The development of high-technology, science-based industry, of food-processing, of our natural resources, of tourism, the dismantling of elements of our tax system that are hostile to enterprise and investment or that are leading to diminishing returns, the revival of the construction industry, these are the sort of policies that the Government should be engaged in.</P>
    <P>We bitterly regret the exodus of top graduates in electronics and electrical engineering and other professions from our country.  Instead of forcing these talented people to go abroad and work for European and US multinationals, we will create the climate which encourages them to stay and satisfies their spirit of ambition here at home.  At every stage we will offer a helping hand to those prepared to build, to invest and to create.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil Governments have always been able to work in close co-operation and consultation with the social partners and, in particular, with the trade union movement.  We were able to secure a broad consensus on the aims of economic and social policy.  A commitment to the <Col N="2262" /> provision of employment was the central objective that enabled us to work together. The present disastrous state of the economy is due to the lack of any such national unity of purpose.</P>
    <P>The countries that suffered least in the present recession and that have had the lowest increase in unemployment are countries where there is co-operation between the Government, the employers and the trade unions.  That will be the approach of Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>Given the recent performance of the Irish economy the Taoiseach, Dr. FitzGerald, could well earn the title, &ldquo;Exporter of the Year&rdquo;.  He has created a new record in the export of both capital and labour.  The labour and capital drained from the Irish economy should have been available to build up the economy and narrow the gap in living standards between Ireland and our neighbours.  Our task will be to bring these resources back to fund future economic growth.  We shall also convince the demoralised young that their energies and skills can be used in rebuilding the Irish economy in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>It is important to get the size and nature of the problem into perspective. We can do this, for example, by looking to the giant market of the EC.  It is true we have the highest rate of unemployment in the EC at 18 per cent of the available workforce, but it is also true that we only account for a tiny 0.6 per cent of total economic output in the Community.  A marginal increase in our market share of that Community would prompt an immediate and dramatic improvement in our economy and we believe that is possible and attainable.</P>
    <P>We do not want to see our young people building up the economies of Britain, Germany and the US with their skills and abilities.  Our grand ambition will be to see the 100,000 who have been driven into exile by the policies of the Coalition return to take their place in and make their contribution to an expanding Irish economy.</P>
    <P>The Coalition have failed the central test.  They have not dealt with unemployment. It has risen and risen and the <Col N="2263" /> figures published last Friday show that it is still rising.  It is now obvious that they cannot deliver on this key issue.  They have therefore, no justification of any kind for hanging on to office and should go.  Even by their own monetarist philosophy, if the management does not succeed it is fired and I recommend that monetarist policy to them.</P>
    <P>One thing is certain.  When this discredited, universally disliked Government are finally driven from office and <Col N="2264" /> replaced by a Fianna Fáil Government with an overall majority, a message of hope will go out not just to the people at home but to New York and Boston, London, Frankfurt, Australia and many other countries around the world.  The message will be that the nightmare is over, the Coalition have gone and the work of national recovery is under way.</P>

      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, I thank you for allowing me time to raise this issue.  At the outset, I want to put on record that I am not against the involvement of voluntary hospitals in the health services.  The question at issue is what seems to be an unfair bookkeeping exercise operated by the Department of Health which has an effect on the funding of health boards.</P>
      <P>We are all aware of the severe cutbacks in the funding to the health boards by the Department over the past number of years.  As a member of the North-Western Health Board, I wish to have the matter clarified in relation to the method adopted by the Department on payment to voluntary hospitals for services carried out by them on behalf of the board.  This issue was discussed at a recent health board meeting and it would appear from information given that the amount being debited against the North-Western Health Board is far in excess of the number of referrals by that board to voluntary hospitals here in Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1985 some 3,500 patients were treated in voluntary hospitals from the north-western region, but only 228 were referred to the voluntary hospitals by the consultants from that board.  Therefore, is it fair that the board should be made to pay for 3,272 patients who had been referred to voluntary hospitals by consultants or their own GPs with no direct contact with the health board?  In view of this, will the Minister not agree there needs to be a better system of accountability and some plan adopted to ensure that, when patients are being referred outside the region for treatment, they would have to be authorised and <Col N="2267" /> cleared through the board's hospital system.  If one were to take the number of patients, 228, authorised by the board for treatment in Dublin hospitals, then we should only be debited with £0.5 million</P>
    <P>Another issue that has created a problem in relation to the current system is that many admissions are unable to be made due to the fact that people are being referred outside the board authority. Therefore, many patients in need of treatment are put on a long waiting list and are unable to get the treatment which they need, despite the fact that many patients are being referred by doctors to Dublin for consultancy and for services which could be provided within the hospital service in the north-western region.</P>
    <P>Tonight I wish to get a commitment from the Minister that he will see to it that the boards will have greater control, that there will be better lines of communication developed between the voluntary hospitals and the health boards in relation to referrals and that a proper bookkeeping exercise will be introduced whereby each health board can identify what they are being asked to pay for.</P>
    <P>I believe the health boards should have an input into making up how much should be paid to the voluntary hospitals for any services given by these hospitals to the health boards.  What would anyone think of any private commercial company who operated a bookkeeping exercise such as this?  Rightly or wrongly, I am inclined to believe the Minister and his Department are using this system in order to hold back extra finances over and above what would normally be owing by the North-Western Health Board or any other health board to the voluntary hospitals. I cannot accept the Minister's statement today that £6 million was not withheld from the North-Western Health Board. I would ask him to clarify that point.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond) Barry Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for the opportunity to put the matter once more in its proper perspective.  It is now the best part of 60 <Col N="2268" /> years since this particular approach was adopted.  The Book of Estimates this year has identified quite clearly on page 211, subhead G.4, grants on behalf of health boards to certain other health bodies &mdash; £296 million.  There are further details on page 215 relating to hospitals and homes other than hospitals and homes administered by health boards.  In that case the amount provided is £238 million.  In the case of homes for the mentally handicapped administered by voluntary bodies the figure is £57 million.  These are very substantial sums of money.  These voluntary hospitals and homes are dealt with directly by the Department of Health.</P>
      <P>If a patient comes, as patients do come, from the North-Western Health Board area to, say, St. Luke's Hospital in Dublin for cancer treatment, the budget of the hospital has an attribution of £767,000 for treating patients from that health board area.  In the same way if patients come from Donegal, Sligo or Leitrim to the Mater Hospital, having been sent there by consultants, there is an attribution of 2 per cent of bed-days for patients from the North-Western Health Board.  In the case of the Mater, £0.5 million of their budget is compiled from that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an alternative.  I am not suggesting that in the short space of time available I could flesh out that alternative. There is the penalty of choice whereby the health board are given the money and they pay the voluntary hospital in Dublin for patients sent from their area.  The question arises: would the health board pay?  I very much doubt it. They would say it is the problem of the voluntary hospital.  They would ask why they should have to pay for people who are referred outside their area.  That is the alternative &mdash; a penalty of choice. The Coalition Government in 1974 and succeeding Governments decided that the Department would accrue those moneys and allocate them into the system in a fair and totally equitable way. For very sound administrative and economic reasons there are no financial transactions between the health boards <Col N="2269" /> and those providing services in the voluntary hospitals.</P>
    <P>I can appreciate that in the North-Western Health Board area there may be a view that only those who are sent up by the health board should actually be paid for.  Would the people of Donegal, Sligo and Leitrim want to devolve that absolute penalty of decision on a health board and take it away from consultant staff who would send people to other areas?  Some people are referred to Portiuncula in Ballinasloe from Leitrim and £33,000 of the Portiuncula Hospital's budget comes from the area.  We attribute the money to it on that basis.</P>
    <P>I assure the Deputy that £6.1 million is given to those hospitals by the Department of Health on behalf of patients from the North-Western Health Board area. It is distributed among the hospitals and it applies to all the health board areas. There is no question of a cut.  That does not arise.  There is no question of taking this money away from the health boards.</P>
    <P>Occasionally a patient from the Inishowen Peninsula goes to Altnagelvin and the health board pay directly.  If the health board wished, we could deduct the money from the allocation for 1987 and pay the money to the Northern Ireland authorities on that basis.  I am sure all hell would break loose if I were to advance that as a solution to the problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>There is still a very good arrangement which I and my counterpart in Northern Ireland recently reviewed and endorsed.  The arrangement is thoroughly understood by health board managements.  The excellent management in the North-Western Health Board area may say they want this money and that they will decide who will go to Dublin or who will not.  All the consultant staff would have to agree.  People would have to be denied referral.  Perhaps this overall problem could diminish if many of the procedures which are referred to Dublin could be done locally.  Frequently, for a variety of reasons, consultants refer people to Dublin.  If more of these procedures were carried out locally there would be a heavier budget burden on the health boards.  It cuts both ways.</P>
      <P>I continue to be slightly mystified by the question because what happens is common knowledge to the health boards. If people want to change it drastically and dramatically, I am open to any proposals in that regard, but there are penalties involved on either side.  I have enough around my neck at the moment without taking on this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12 and 14 together.  Discussions are continuing with the South-Eastern and Eastern Health Boards in relation to St. Dympna's Hospital, Carlow which serves County Carlow and County Kildare and with the Western Health Board in relation to St. Patrick's Hospital, Castlerea which serves County Roscommon. The development of alternative community-based psychiatric services is in progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to County Carlow, it has <Col N="2132" /> been agreed that an acute psychiatric unit, including a day hospital, will be provided in an existing building, Kelvin Grove in Carlow.  A schedule of accommodation has been agreed for this unit and the planning of the necessary adaptation works is going ahead.  This unit should be ready early next year.  When it is in operation it will take all psychiatric admissions from County Carlow.</P>
    <P>The South-Eastern Health Board have set up a rehabilitation unit in St. Dympna's Hospital where a number of patients are being prepared for discharge to community residences.  Community residences are being provided for these patients.  It has been agreed that part of St. Dympna's hospital will be designated as a geriatric unit and part as a mental handicap unit for geriatric and mentally handicapped patients now resident in the hospital.  Plans are being prepared for the provision of further community facilities in County Carlow.</P>
    <P>In relation to County Kildare, a new psychiatric unit, including a day hospital, is being planned as a priority development at Naas general hospital.  It is expected that planning will be completed early in 1987 and that the unit will be built early in 1988.  A building and site have been acquired at Kildare town for use as a sector headquarters and mental health centre for mid-Kildare.  A new building which will be built on this site will be used initially as an acute psychiatric unit and later, when the unit has been built at Naas, as a high-support hostel.  In Castledermot an existing dispensary building is being prepared for use as a sector headquarters and mental health centre for south Kildare.</P>
    <P>Discussions are taking place between the Eastern and South-Eastern Health Boards on the transfer to the Kildare services of patients from County Kildare who are now in St. Dympna's hospital.</P>
    <P>In relation to St. Patrick's hospital, Castlerea, discussions are continuing with the Western Health Board regarding:</P>
    <P>the provision of an acute psychiatric unit at Roscommon general hospital;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2133" /> the designation of part of St. Patrick's Hospital as a geriatric unit for the care of elderly patients who are now in the hospital;</P>
    <P>the provision of day centres and community residences in Strokestown, Ballaghadereen, Castlerea and Boyle;</P>
    <P>the provision of workshop facilities at the Sacred Heart Home, Roscommon;</P>
    <P>the transfer of mentally handicapped patients from St. Patrick's Hospital to the mental handicap service of the Brothers of Charity in Roscommon.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that considerable progress has been made to enable the appropriate transfer of services from the two hospitals and the development of psychiatric services in the community.  These developments will facilitate the closure of the two hospitals as psychiatric hospitals and I do not propose to reverse this decision.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond) Barry Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>At present some 40 per cent of all asthmatics are covered by medical cards, and therefore, receive their prescribed drugs, as well as general practitioner services, entirely free of charge.  Where an individual or a family is subjected to a significant level of ongoing expenditure on medical expenses due to a persistent medical condition, these expenses are reckoned in determining eligibility for medical card cover.  In the case of a family, a medical card can be issued to one member of the family only, where appropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The remaining 60 per cent of asthmatic patients comprise persons and their dependants, including asthmatics under 16 years of age, who have access to the refund of costs of drugs scheme.  That <Col N="2134" /> scheme ensures that net unrefunded expenditure on prescribed drugs does not exceed £28 per calendar month.  There is no income limit for this scheme.</P>
    <P>The possibility of including asthma in the list of illnesses covered by the long term illness scheme has already been considered. However, present financial constraints do not permit this as such general extension of the scheme to those without medical cards would involve an increase of at least £10 million per annum in current expenditure on the scheme. The cost of extending the scheme to children under 16 years without medical cards would be some £3 million per annum.  However, it would be virtually impossible to extend the scheme to young persons without extending it to all who have made a similar case.</P>

      <P>The maternity unit at Bantry General Hospital closed on 16 April 1983.  Prior to the closure of the unit the maternity service was provided by the consultant physician who became ill and was unable to continue to provide the service.  There has never been a consultant obstetrician-gynaecologist based at the hospital.  Since April 1983, 68 births have <Col N="2141" /> taken place at the hospital and these were regarded as emergency cases.</P>

As the Deputy may be aware, this provision became a matter of dispute between the board and certain consultants and was referred to the interpretation committee under the common contract.

While we are certainly guarding against complacency in this area, the treatment and crime statistics <Col N="2144" /> for the last few years would indicate a levelling out of the problem of the abuse of illicit drugs.

My Department's letters of allocation in 1985 required agencies to take action where appropriate to contain expenditure within the approved limits.  However, the annual effect of some of the measures identified did not impact on expenditure until 1986, resulting in some cases in expenditure exceeding the approved level.  In these cases, action has been taken to eliminate the excesses on a phased basis.  In 1986 agencies have again been advised of the need to contain expenditure within the allocation approved.</P>

      <P>Medical cards are only issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer of a health board, satisfy the criterion of hardship in that they cannot provide general practitioner medical services for themselves and their dependants, from their own resources, without incurring an undue degree of hardship. Where an individual or a family is subjected to a significant level of ongoing expenditure on medical expenses due to a persistent medical condition, these expenses are reckoned in determining eligibility for medical card cover.  In the case of a family, a medical card can be issued to one member of the family only, where appropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present some 50 per cent of kidney patients are covered by medical cards and, therefore, receive their prescribed drugs, as well as general practitioner services, entirely free of charge.  The remaining 50 per cent of kidney patients comprise persons who have access to the refund of costs of drugs scheme.  That <Col N="2146" /> scheme ensures that net unrefunded expenditure on prescribed drugs does not exceed £28 per calendar month.  There is no income limit in this scheme.</P>

      <P>I propose to introduce new legislation to replace all the existing Acts governing psychiatric services.  Under existing legislation there are a number of safeguards against the wrongful detention of patients, including (a) a patient has a right to have a letter forwarded to the Minister for Health, the President of the High Court, the Inspector of Mental Hospitals, the Registrar of Wards of Court and certain other bodies.  The Minister and the President of the High Court may require the inspector to visit and examine a patient and to furnish a report; (b) the Inspector of Mental Hospitals has a duty to give special attention to the condition of any patient where the propriety of detention is doubtful or where he is requested by the patient, or any other person, to do so; (c) any detained person may apply to the Minister for an order for the examination of that person by two medical practitioners of the person's choice and, on consideration of their report, the Minister may direct the person's discharge; (d) there is a specific requirement that a patient who has recovered should be discharged; (e) penalties are imposed by the Acts for the detention of a person otherwise than in accordance with the provisions of the Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>New legislation will have regard to the rights of patients.  In practical terms, however, I feel that the implementation <Col N="2147" /> of the plans now being developed for the reorganisation of the psychiatric services will make a greater contribution.</P>

      <P>All E-additives are regulated in this country. I am forwarding a list of my Department's regulations on food additives, under separate cover.  The regulations are enforced by the health boards.  Each health board conducts planned food sampling programmes under which different foods are sampled by the environmental health officers and analysed, each week, to monitor compliance with the regulations.</P>
      <P>An &ldquo;E-number&rdquo; indicates that an additive has been approved for use in the EC by member states.  The EC is advised on such matters by its scientific committee for food, a committee of independent, highly qualified persons in fields such as medicine, nutrition, toxicology, biology and chemistry.  All member states are represented on the committee.</P>
      <P>I am advised on the safety food additives, and on other matters relating to food, by the food advisory committee, a committee of independent experts in areas related to food.  These committees examine additives from the point of view of safety and need, taking into account work done by relevant international bodies such as the World Health Organisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An additive with an E-number is, by definition, approved for use in all EC member states.  The majority of these additives would be approved by the Joint Expert Committee on Food Additives of the World Health Organisation and the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations, and by various non-EC states throughout the world.  Where regulations differ, this may be for reasons <Col N="2156" /> such as differing manufacturing practices, technology needs or indeed trade barriers.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to answer Questions Nos: 64 to 67, inclusive, together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the equal treatment provisions men and women will have an equal right to claim benefit for a spouse who is a dependant or for children who are dependants.  Where a spouse is earning over £50 a week or is in receipt of a social welfare payment he or she will not be regarded as an adult dependant, and as a result some married men will lose the adult dependant allowance and half of any child dependant allowances which they may now be getting.  On the other <Col N="2157" /> hand, married women will now be able to claim adult dependant and child dependant allowances.  The net effect of the changes in the arrangements for adult and child dependant allowances including the cost of enabling spouses earning under £50 to be regarded as adult dependants and of the special temporary payment of £10 where both spouses are on social welfare payments is estimated to be broadly neutral.</P>
    <P>The cost in a full year of the extension from 312 days to 390 days with effect from May last, of the maximum duration of entitlement of married women to unemployed benefit is estimated at £5.7 million.</P>
    <P>The cost in a full year of equalising the costs of payments of unemployment and disability benefits for married women is estimated at £12.3 million.  It is estimated that approximately 18,300 married women gained from the increase in the duration of entitlement to unemployment benefit, and a further 28,000 from the increase in the rates of benefit paid.</P>

      <P>Entitlement to unemployment benefit is subject to the condition that a claimant must have at least 26 contributions paid or credited at the appropriate rate in the contribution year which governs the claim.  The person concerned claimed unemployment benefit from 18 February 1986.  He did not, however, qualify for payment as he had not the necessary contributions paid or credited in the period 6 April 1984 to 5 April 1985, the contribution year which governed his claim.  He had been employed in the United Kingdom in that year but his British contributions could not be invoked under EC regulations for the purpose of his claim.</P>
      <P>Article 67 of EC Regulations 1408/71 allows for the transfer of insurance records from one member state to another for unemployment benefit purposes, providing the last history of reckonable insurable employment is in the country of claim.  The person concerned had not been employed in this country since his return from the United Kingdom and, accordingly, it was not possible to invoke his British record.  He was advised of the position and he then made a claim for unemployment assistance. His claim for unemployment assistance was disallowed in August 1986 on the grounds that his means, derived from the value of capital, a pension and the profit from his holding, exceeded the maximum rate of unemployment assistance payable in his case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He appealed against the disallowance on 6 October 1986 and, arising from contentions raised by him in support of his appeal his papers were returned to the social welfare officer for further inquiries. These inquiries will be completed as soon as possible and his case will then <Col N="2160" /> be submitted to an appeals officer for determination at the earliest available opportunity.  His entitlement to unemployment assistance will be reviewed in the light of the outcome of the appeal. The delay in dealing with the unemployment assistance claim, which is regretted, arose because the social welfare officer had difficulty in contacting him as he changed address subsequent to making the claim.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mrs. Hussey)</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the qualifying conditions for receipt of retirement pension under the Social Welfare Acts requires the claimant to have a yearly average of 24 reckonable contributions over the period from 5 January 1953 to 5 April 1986, i.e. the end of the last complete contribution year before he reached age 65.  He does not satisfy this condition on his Irish insurance record.  The Department's records show that he had a total of 737 Irish contributions in the required period, equal to a yearly average of only 22.</P>
      <P>However, in accordance with EC regulations on social security his British and Irish insurance records may be combined to enable him to satisfy the qualifying conditions.  On this basis he qualifies for a <i>pro-rata</i> retirement pension at the rate of £39.75 per week with effect from 19 June 1986 increased to £41.40 per week from 17 July 1986.  A retirement pension book containing orders payable from 13 November 1986 has been issued to the designated post office for collection by him.  The arrears of pension for the period from 19 June 1986 to 12 November 1986, less the amount of unemployment assistance paid to him for that period, will be issued as quickly as possible.  He will qualify for old age contributory pension under the Social Welfare Acts at the current rate of £49.40 per week when he reaches age 66 on 19 June 1987.  A yearly average of 20 is required for this latter pension.</P>

      <P>Butter sales on the domestic market have shown a substantial decline in the past two years.  This is due to a number of factors including changing consumer tastes and the emergence of newly developed spreads.</P>
      <P>While I am concerned at this development it is primarily a matter for the industry itself to ensure that the market for its product is maintained.  The National Dairy Council who are responsible for promoting the sale of dairy products on the home market have recently launched a new campaign to restore the position of butter.</P>

        <i>(Limerick West)</i> asked the Minister for Agriculture if he is aware that a named food company which is developing a trade in pigmeat products with the United States of America is compelled to import Danish pigmeat because no pigmeat slaughtering premises in this country meets the standards of the United States Department of Agriculture; and if he will make a statement on this state of affairs.</P>

      <P>It is a matter of regret that there is no slaughterhouse here at present up to the licensing standards required for export of pigmeat by the United States Department of Agriculture.  There are however, reasonable expectations that a number of slaughterhouses may attain these standards in 1987.  In that event the pigmeat plant referred to by the Deputy will be able to source its raw materials here and not have to resort to imports of pork from establishments elsewhere approved for export to the US.</P>
      <P>Generous investment grants and other incentives are available to pigmeat plants to enable them to bring their plants up to the highest hygiene standards.  In the absence of such investments trading opportunities are being missed.  There are hopeful signs that this message is getting through to the industry and I am aware of a number of projects currently in the pipeline.  A number of measures have recently been introduced to help the industry and it is now time for the industry to get on with the urgent task of rationalisation.</P>
