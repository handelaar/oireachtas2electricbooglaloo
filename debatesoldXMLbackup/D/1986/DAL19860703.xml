      <P>I wish to express The Workers' Party's disagreement with the Order of Business as arranged this morning.  We objected yesterday in regard to the Building Control Bill.  This morning there is an additional one, the Children (Care and Protection) Bill which is not to be debated in this House but in a committee of which we are not members and which we are told we can get on to if we apply to Deputy Taylor.  I wish to express again to the Chair my concern that this is becoming a familiar method of procedure in the House because we as a party would be excluded from Second Stage debates on various Bills that come before this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We will be excluded from putting down amendments to such Bills and from voting on them which is something that we as a party have done continuously on Bills that have come in here.  We have treated them all seriously, debated them, put down amendments, participated in voting and so on.  Under this procedure I understand we will not have that facility <Col N="2207" /> and we will be allowed in only at the discretion of some other Deputy in the House.</P>

      <P>In relation to the matter raised by Deputy Mac Giolla, I understand that this is the eighth motion put before this House this week for debate.  The procedure apparently is that these motions are brought forward and we are not allowed to debate them.

      <P>I just want to say that on this side of the House we fully approve of these two Bills being referred to special <Col N="2209" /> committees because it is a well known and very effective way of dealing with complicated technical Bills.  We shall participate fully in those committees, as every Deputy in the House will be entitled to.  On the question of allowing people time, I do not think that The Workers' Party have any cause whatsoever to be aggrieved.</P>

      <P>Deputy Mac Giolla, as the leader of a two-Deputy party, is always allowed equal time with the Taoiseach and myself on all important matters where leaders of parties contribute.  He has no grounds for complaint on that score.  In fact, my colleagues in the front bench here have much more ground for complaint on the question of the allocation of time in those areas.</P>

      <P>I should like to make the point that referring Bills to special committees is not something new.  It is an excellent way to order business in the House.  This is rather complex legislation and when put to the special committee it will be teased out as such legislation should be.  We had the Misuse of Drugs Bill, the Family Home Protection Bill and the Wildlife Bill all referred to special committees and the system worked very effectively, making the best use of this House.  Anybody saying that we are abusing this House just does not know what we are about in ordering business. We should follow this system far more than we are doing at present.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £5,632,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending the 31st day of December, 1986, for the salaries and expenses of the Department of the Taoiseach and for payment of certain grants-inaid.</P>
      <P>The referendum is now over.  The people have delivered their decision and it is for all of us in this House to accept that decision.  Deputies, of course, will be aware that it was my heartfelt wish that the Government's proposals be accepted by the people, and my sincere thanks and appreciation go to the very large numbers who voted &ldquo;yes&rdquo;, and who worked with courage and dedication for a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; result.</P>
      <P>The issue and the debate proved to be difficult for everybody.  There was, I believe, serious and honest intent on all sides.  Those who voted &ldquo;no&rdquo; felt that the legitimate claims for minority rights and the call for compassion on behalf of those trapped in hopeless marital situations were, on balance, outweighed by their concern for the effects that they felt even a limited form of divorce might have on the family and our society generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2215" /> Those who, with me, voted &ldquo;yes&rdquo; maintained that those concerns were greatly exaggerated and that the road of pluralism and compassion offered greater advantages for the Irish people in all its present and possible future diversity.</P>
    <P>It was ultimately a matter of finely balanced judgment, a matter of a decision which each citizen had to make in the privacy of his or her own mind and heart, and I am certain it was not an easy decision for many people to take.  Those who voted &ldquo;no&rdquo;, after deep consideration of all the issues involved, have my respect and understanding.  I believe that they did not intend on Thursday to condemn the unhappy victims of failed marriages. Most of them voted rather to reflect their vision of Ireland where the role of the family is central and sacrosanct &mdash; a positive, not a negative, declaration.</P>
    <P>To those who voted and worked for a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote, I say that, while the issue is settled for the present, the size of the support is a sure guarantee that the issue will remain, the debate will go on, the problems will not go away, and will not be solved by spurious subterfuges.  Courage, resolution, patient resolve, conviction in the justice of your cause; these must be your passwords and your guiding lights out of the dark disappointment of these days.  There will be better, brighter days in the future.</P>
    <P>The very large numbers who abstained, almost 40 per cent, have, no doubt, their own justifications and rationalisations. To them I would say that democracy in the modern world is a privilege, something relatively rare, to be treasured, defended and nurtured.  It is better to express an opinion than to sit on the fence; to be in favour of, or against, a proposition, than to try to be in both camps at the same time.</P>

      <P>Democracy confers power on the people and with that power comes responsibility &mdash; the responsibility to participate in the democratic process &mdash; the responsibility to have an opinion <Col N="2216" />&mdash; to choose &mdash; to go out and vote on polling day.  There were too many abstainers on Thursday last.</P>
      <P>For myself, I am happy, proud indeed, that I brought forward the proposition and put it to the people.  This for long has been the policy of the great party it is my privilege to lead, and the referendum was the culmination of a pledge I gave to the Irish people on taking Government.  In this matter I have discharged my duty and honoured my pledge.</P>
      <P>I believe, too &mdash; and this has not been seriously challenged by anyone &mdash; that the whole matter was dealt with in the best possible manner, involving the Oireachtas all-party committee, the Dáil and Seanad themselves, the Government and the Government parties, and extensive consultations with the Churches.  The wording of the amendment was the best we could have devised.  Even the timing was the best possible in the circumstances, as any later would have been too near an election, and any earlier would have truncated the very necessary discussion process.</P>
      <P>The fact that the proposition was defeated does not diminish my belief that it was right to pose it.  It is often the duty of a leader to lead, to put a proposition he believes to be correct and in the interests of the nation and its people.  He should not be content to wait until he is certain of success.  This can be the very abnegation of leadership as I firmly believe it would have been on this occasion.</P>
      <P>I am happy in my conscience that I have discharged my duty in this matter, that I have honoured my pledge, that I have kept faith with the people who elected me to lead them.  I accept the decision of the electorate and propose now to move ahead, putting before the Oireachtas in the next session proposals for changes in the law of marriage and separation, as set out in the Government statement of intent at the time of the publication of the text of the referendum amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Work on the heads of appropriate legislation will begin immediately and will be brought to the Government in the <Col N="2217" /> autumn with a view to being presented to the Oireachtas in good time for full debate and enactment during the session of the Dáil that will end a year hence.  In this connection we shall, for example, have a look at such matters as the preservation of provision for deserted wives where these wives are legally divorced by husbands who have established domicile abroad.</P>
    <P>Clearly legislation to be put forward must be in conformity with the Constitution. It cannot, therefore, include any provision for the dissolution of marriage or for measures which could be constitutionally impugned as having this effect. Moreover, careful examination will have to be made of whether constitutional impediments may stand in the way of the implementation of certain other provisions, such as the transfer of property to a dependent spouse on the occasion of a judicial separation; but, these problems apart, the necessary legislation will be brought forward, and will, we have been assured by the Opposition, be given positive consideration.</P>
    <P>Mention has also been made in recent days of the possibility of changes in the law of nullity.  This, too, the Government will examine, as we have committed ourselves to doing in our statement of intent. But all should be conscious that in this area significant changes could carry with them a number of serious dangers.  Any attempt to disguise as grounds for nullity a condition which was not operative at the time the contract was entered into, would be constitutionally void.  Moreover, a very real concern, expressed both by many politicians and churchmen, clearly also by the people, about the rights of the first family, represents a powerful impediment to significant changes in the law of nullity that would put at risk the rights of dependent spouses and children of first families, which are at present secure under existing law.</P>
    <P>In this area the Government must have due regard to the Constitution, to the rights of the first family, and to the importance of avoiding the casting of doubt on the validity of a wide range of existing marriages.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2218" /> Having indicated the Government's intention to initiate the necessary reforms in respect of marriage and separation, and to examine further the question of improvements to the law of nullity, I may perhaps be permitted to add a comment of my own on this whole matter.  I would not have embarked upon this referendum were I not personally convinced that the proposed changes in the Constitution would make possible changes in the law which would be to the general social advantage.  While, of course, accepting the decision of the people on this occasion, I have not changed the view on this matter to which I have been brought over a long period of years, after careful consideration and deep reflection on this whole issue.</P>
    <P>There are, moreover, broader considerations at stake: the principle of a pluralist society in this State, as in this island as a whole.  And by a pluralist society I mean one in which the different traditions that exist in this State and this island can feel equally at home, not constrained by the predominance of the ethos of any one Church, or group of Churches.  I have always seen that pluralist society not as a secular society, cutting itself off from its deep roots in Christianity, itself founded on Judaism &mdash; two great religions which share in common a vast body of moral values, and both of which, happily, are well represented in this House.</P>
    <P>Of course I respect the fact that there are in this country a growing number of people who no longer belong fully to these traditions and who may in their own minds reject them &mdash; but who, I have often observed, base their own value systems for the most part on the values they have inherited from these religious traditions.</P>
    <P>The pluralism to which I, and many more of our people today aspire, is a pluralism inspired by these religious values, respectful of them, and concerned that they be maintained.  But what I, and others like me, reject is any suggestion that one tradition be subordinated to another.  I believe in, and for decades have worked for, the right of the Nationalist people of Northern Ireland to <Col N="2219" /> be free not only from discrimination, but from the impact of laws based on a particular religious tradition to which they do not belong, and some of whose values they do not share &mdash; for example, the anti-libertarian laws that inhibit them from spending their Sabbath freely in accordance with their own traditions.</P>
    <P>Our society in this State has been free of religious discrimination of the type practised in Northern Ireland &mdash; not perhaps because we are in some way inherently better or more tolerant than our Unionist fellow-Irishmen in Northern Ireland but, more probably, because in this truncated State the size of the minority has not represented for us a threat to which we have felt impelled to respond, in the way in which many Unionists in Northern Ireland have felt impelled to respond to the much larger Nationalist minority in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>While this State has from its inception been free from any form of discrimination, we have not been free from the same kind of attempt to impose the value system of the majority religion here, to which most of us belong, upon those of a different tradition, when it comes to our Constitution and our laws.  If I am to have the right to claim for the Nationalist minority in Northern Ireland not merely freedom from discrimination and a right to have their identity and tradition fully respected, but a system of laws based on common ground between the different Christian traditions of that part of our island, rather than on the tradition of the majority there, then I must, in all honesty and logic, make the same claim on behalf of the minority in this State, namely, that our laws, that our Constitution, will reflect the common ground we share with them, rather than the ethos of our majority religion.</P>
    <P>I would not be honest with myself, nor with this House, if I failed to reassert on this occasion that fundamental principle, which to me, and to many others I believe in this House, to many others in all parties in this House, is what republicanism in the Irish context means.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2220" /> In thus reasserting my own personal belief, to which I have been consistent throughout my political life, and to which I shall remain consistent in the years to come, I imply, as I made clear earlier, no criticism and no recrimination with respect to the result of the recent referendum which I recognise freely was decided in the minds of our people on the basis of different considerations and different issues.  Many, very many, of those who voted against this referendum did so not because they reject in any conscious way the pluralist ideal of which I have just spoken; other considerations, some of them most genuine considerations of social concern, weighed more heavily with them in a campaign which did not, in fact, centre on this issue of pluralism.  What is done is done.  It can, and I believe in time will be undone.  As a democrat I respect that decision.  As a republican I hope to live to see it reversed.</P>
    <P>Voices have been raised, especially by Unionists in Northern Ireland, suggesting that the result of this referendum has implications for the implementation of the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  There are no such implications.  The House will recall that this agreement is itself the fruit of the Forum report, the terms of reference of which addressed themselves exclusively to the problems of securing peace and stability in Northern Ireland.  This, too, is the objective of the agreement, which, in its preamble drawn from the conclusions of the Forum report recognises the major interest of both countries, and above all the people of Northern Ireland, in diminishing the divisions there and of achieving lasting peace and stability. That preamble also recognised that a condition of genuine reconciliation and dialogue between Unionists and Nationalists is mutual recognition and acceptance of each others' rights and that the identities of the two communities in Northern Ireland should be recognised and respected, together with the right of each to pursue its aspirations by peaceful and constitutional means.</P>
    <P>The structures and procedures set up by the agreement are directed towards <Col N="2221" /> these ends, though it has not been easy to secure recognition by the Unionist people of Northern Ireland that these are the objectives of the agreement, and that nothing in the agreement seeks to constrain them to accept any change in the status of Northern Ireland without the consent of a majority of its people.</P>
    <P>The negative vote in the referendum does not in any way affect the implementation of the agreement.  But it is, I believe, something of a setback to the long term prospect of the two parts of Ireland coming closer together politically. It cannot reasonably be denied, and I think we ought to face this fact, that we in this State have a long way to go before we create in this part of Ireland a society that would seem welcoming to, open to, and attractive to, people of the northern Unionist tradition.  The principal Opposition party should face the fact and reflect on the deep seated partitionist attitude implied in a failure by a political party claiming to be a Nationalist party to do so.</P>
    <P>I want to turn now to the recent European Council meeting.  By agreement, my report on the European Council is incorporated into this debate.  The House will have had adequate time to discuss other matters in the last two days.  The main issues discussed at The Hague, on 26 and 27 June were: South Africa; nuclear safety; the internal market; a people's Europe; agriculture; and the economic and social situation.</P>
    <P>In preparation for the Council I had useful discussions in Paris with President Mitterand and Prime Minister Chirac.  I have had the conclusions of the Council on these and other issues laid before the House, in the usual way.  I do not intend, therefore, to go in too much detail into what was discussed.</P>
    <P>I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Dutch Presidency for the hospitality extended to us and to congratulate them on the order and efficiency with which the business of the Council was run.  I should say at the outset that in the absence of contentious issues such as have made the work of earlier Councils <Col N="2222" /> tense and difficult, that is, contentious issues involving the European Community and their internal affairs, the Council in The Hague were able to proceed in the way in which these Councils had originally been intended to act.  In other words, there was an opportunity for Heads of State or Government to exchange views without the disturbing necessity to resolve immediate and intractable technical problems.  In this sense, the Council were constructive, even though their conclusions were not dramatic.</P>
    <P>At the end of the Council, I met separately with the British Prime Minister for a brief discussion on Northern Ireland and other issues of mutual concern.  In accordance with normal practice on these meetings, neither of us goes into detail about the subjects discussed.</P>
    <P>The major foreign policy topic discussed by the Heads of State or Government was South Africa.  The European Council reiterated the Twelve's grave concern about the rapid deterioration of the situation and the increasing levels of violence in that country.</P>
    <P>The Council reaffirmed that the main goal of the Twelve was the total abolition of apartheid and decided to take additional action as follows:</P>
    <P>They declared themselves in favour of a concerted European programme of assistance to the victims of apartheid, encompassing both Community and national action, in order to maximise the effectiveness of Europe's contribution in this field.  In this connection the European Council agreed on an increase in financial and material assistance to the victims of apartheid;</P>
    <P>The Council called on the South African government:</P>
    <P>&mdash;to release unconditionally Nelson Mandela and other political prisoners; and</P>
    <P>&mdash;to lift the ban on the African National Congress the Pan Africanist Congress of Azania and other political parties.</P>
    <P>The Council decided to ask the <Col N="2223" /> future UK Presidency Foreign Minister, Sir Geoffrey Howe, to visit Southern Africa, in a further effort to establish conditions in which the necessary dialogue can commence.</P>
    <P>In the meantime in the next three months the Community will enter into consultations with the other industrialised countries, such as the United States, Japan and the other OECD members, on further measures which might be needed covering in particular a ban on new investments, and on the imports of coal, iron, steel and gold coins from South Africa.</P>
    <P>The outcome of these discussions on South Africa was not as I, and a number of other members of the Council, had hoped.  In particular, I and others had argued for the adoption now of further economic measures directed at the South African Government.  Unfortunately, this proposal was resisted by three States who preferred the weaker formulation than I have just cited involving the commitment to consultations with other industralised countries on further measures which might be needed.</P>
    <P>I was particularly concerned that the vagueness of this formula might leave open the possibility of a veto on such measures at the end of the three month period specified in the draft and I sought clarification on this point, and an assurance that no country would veto the suggested measures if Sir Geoffrey Howe's mission proved unsuccessful.  This proposal for clarification had the support of a number of other member states and it eventually led to the agreement of a slightly different formulation, put by the Presidency of the Council, and accepted without contestation by any member state, namely, that no member state excluded the possibility of sanctions.</P>
    <P>Thus, the agreement reached by the Heads of State or Government is something of a second-best solution for the moment.  But on balance it was preferable to a split in the Community, which would have sent all the wrong signals to <Col N="2224" /> South Africa.  The agreement does represent a modest step forward.</P>
    <P>In relation to nuclear matters, I recalled the formal request which we had made to the Commission, long before the Chernobyl accident, on the establishment of a Community health and inspection force.  Such a force, which would be independent of national Governments, would be important with a view to reassuring the public about nuclear safety but is also in the nuclear industry's own interests as the number of accidents at nuclear plants is eroding sharply the confidence of the public throughout the Community and more widely in the industry.  I emphasise to the Council that it is in all our interests to bring to finality a comprehensive plan of action, and that we looked forward to proposals on nuclear safety and health from the Commission which we hope will include a Community inspection force along the lines which we have proposed.</P>
    <P>One member state disputed our claim that the EC had competence in the matter of nuclear safety and I am particularly pleased that the Commission contested this and supported our view that Chapter III of the EURATOM Treaty provides a clear legal basis for further action in this area.  Incidentally, it was on my proposal that the reference to nuclear safety as well as public health was included in the Presidency conclusions.</P>
    <P>In the discussions on the internal market I joined with a number of likeminded representatives in recalling the provisions of the Single European Act requiring that implementation of the internal market should be paralleled by steps to promote economic and social cohesion in order to ensure that the benefits are more evenly spread throughout the Community.  I availed of the opportunity to remind the Council of the commitments we had been given in March 1985 that the part-financing of the integrated Mediterranean programmes from the structural funds would be from a real growth in the resources of these funds without affecting transfers to other lessprosperous and priority regions such as <Col N="2225" /> Ireland and that we will insist that these commitments are fully honoured.</P>
    <P>On air transport, I drew attention to the limited scope of the proposals at present before the Transport Council.  I said that the Commission should now also introduce proposals on the subject of market access, which would offer possibilities for all Community airlines to operate new services, and that these should be considered at the same time as the Commission's proposals to liberalise air fares and capacity-sharing arrangements. It is only logical and fully in accord with EEC Treaty rules on competition that priority should be given to access by airlines through expanding fifth-freedom opportunities throughout the Community, that is, the right of the airline of one State to carry passengers to cities in two other member states.  This point was accepted and incorporated at my request in the Presidency Conclusions.</P>
    <P>On public procurement, I recalled that at the Stuttgart European Council in 1983 I had drawn attention to the fact that policies in this area were being used by certain member states contrary to Community principles, in order to influence location decisions by investors from outside the Community and that we had been suffering from this practice and had lost a number of industries which otherwise would have come here.  I again emphasised the need for action to eliminate this form of protectionism and urged that immediate consideration be, therefore, given to recent Commission proposals to liberalise public procurement.</P>
    <P>I also drew attention, as I had done last December in Luxembourg, to the serious problems which would arise for us under the Commission's proposals on harmonisation of indirect taxes.  The House might recall that, under the provisions of the Single European Act, proposals in this area are to be decided on by the council on the basis of unanimity and not by a qualified majority vote.</P>
    <P>On the CAP, we discussed the development of the Community's agricultural policy in the international context against the background of mounting food surpluses and increasing EEC/US conflicts. <Col N="2226" /> I stressed the point that the Community is not the only body responsible for surpluses and urged the need for an orderly approach to the problem of their disposal and control.</P>
    <P>I am glad to say that there was full acceptance in the Presidency's Conclusions that adaptation of agricultural policy to changed circumstances is not just a matter for the Community but is a problem to be faced by other countries, such as the United States, as well.</P>
    <P>The European Council also gave specific recognition to a number of other points of particular importance to Ireland and ones which I had emphasised in the discussions.  These included the retention of the objectives and principles of the Common Agricultural Policy, the need to take account of the Community's interests and location as an exporter of agricultural products, the specific nature of European agriculture, and the requirement to safeguard the social fabric in rural areas.</P>
    <P>Overall, the European Council's Conclusions on agricultural policy in the international context were satisfactory from this country's point of view.</P>
    <P>On the economic and social situation, I stressed the inadequacy of present policies in reducing unemployment and that every opportunity should now be availed of to accelerate Community growth and make it more employment-intensive, rather than wait until the end of the year for such a review, as had been suggested.</P>
    <P>The Commission was asked to undertake a thorough study of the black economy. Preliminary estimates by the Commission suggest that this could be as high as 10 per cent or 20 per cent of Community GDP but they emphasise the difficulty of making accurate estimates of such matters as the proportion of registered unemployed who are actually out of work and seeking employment.  The Prime Minister of one country reported that a study carried out by an institute in his country has shown that the actual number of people seeking employment is less than 10 per cent of the registered unemployed.  I would not suggest that the proportion in this country is anything like <Col N="2227" /> that but there is obviously a common problem of gross overstatement of unemployment throughout the Community in every country and many people claiming unemployment benefit are actually at work.  It is not a purely Irish phenomenon, in so far as that gives us any encouragement.</P>
    <P>I laid a particular emphasis on the need to reduce further the level of real interest rates.  And I urged support for the measures set out in the UK/Irish/Italian paper for an employment-creation strategy and, in welcoming the Commission's programme for the liberalisation of capital movements, drew attention to the problems posed for us in this area by the absence of the UK from the European Monetary System.</P>
    <P>I also drew particular attention to the problems of developing countries, particularly the situation in Sub-Saharan Africa, especially in view of the fact that the flow of economic resources to developing countries continued to decline in 1985 for the fourth year running.  In contrast, Ireland's development aid budget was being increased by almost 50 per cent between 1984 and 1987.</P>
    <P>I was struck by the extent to which the Heads of State and Government expressed concern that the recovery &mdash; led by the fall in oil prices &mdash; had not yet really taken off in their countries or in Europe as a whole; and their view that measures were necessary now not next December, to ensure that the full benefits were obtained.  Full implementation of the cooperative growth strategy agreed at the end of last year would, the Commission had estimated, reduce the rate of unemployment in the Community by one third or to a round 7 per cent in 1990.  This is too large a prize to let go by default.  We must pursue this and continue to press that the Commission's proposals for concertation of economic policies designed to achieve this objective will be implemented. The council urged a new sense of urgency on the Commission and it was agreed that the ECO/FIN Council be asked to look at this matter.  The point was also made that they should look at it <Col N="2228" /> more seriously than they had looked at the results of the last European Council when they had seemed to reargue the conclusions of Prime Ministers rather than implement the decisions there taken.</P>
    <P>The potential for a positive economic response in Europe will be of central importance in ensuring that the Irish economy benefits to the full from the new and more favourable circumstances. Indeed economic prospects at home are better now than at any time in the past seven years.  The price of oil has collapsed. Interest rates have fallen sharply and are still coming down, and the annual rate of consumer price increases is set to fall sharply in the months ahead, to something around 2 per cent, and to remain at or below that level for some time thereafter.</P>
    <P>The size of these favourable developments is very substantial, far greater than many people realise.  On average import prices have fallen during the 12 months to April by over 10 per cent.  This is not only due to oil price reductions but also to the decline in the value of the US dollar and sterling.  It means a significant increase in purchasing power for the Irish consumer as these import prices are passed through into the shops.  This has already occurred to a degree, with more to come.  Moreover on Tuesday the VAT rate on restaurant meals and a wide range of labour-intensive services was cut by almost two-thirds.  The estimated impact of this on the cost of living is two-thirds of 1 per cent.</P>
    <P>The decline in interest rates has been equally striking.  For a few months in the spring speculation ahead of the EMS realignment resulted in a temporary increase in interest rates.  But since then money market interest rates have fallen by as much as seven percentage points and this has been translated into lower lending rates for industry and for the house purchaser.  Looking back to 1982, when our predecessors were in office, the prime bank lending rate reached 19 per cent: it is now, in some cases, down below 10 per cent, half the level we inherited. In 1982 the mortgage rate was 16.25 per <Col N="2229" /> cent: it is now down to 10.25 per cent. The next reduction in mortgage interest rates could bring them to their lowest level for 13 years.  This sharp fall in the cost of borrowing must be regarded as one of the most positive features of the present economic situation.</P>
    <P>In saying this, I am not implying that interest rates are yet low enough.  When they are compared with the rate of inflation the real interest rate that emerges, here and in other Community countries and more widely, makes it clear that there is ample scope for further interest rate reductions worldwide, and I am hopeful that these will occur and that the monetary authorities and Ministers for Finance of the different countries can so concert their policies as to achieve this objective.</P>
    <P>This all adds up to the biggest increase in real household spending power in this decade.  For the first time since the traumatic impact of the disastrous policies of 1977 to 1981 began to be felt by our people five years ago, the ability of the average man in the street to improve his living standards by increased purchases of goods and services is becoming a very significant factor.  Both those at work and those reliant on social welfare payments will begin to experience a considerable and noticeable improvement in their standard of living for the first time in many years.  Averaged over the economy as a whole, it has been calculated that real personal disposable income, the purchasing power of people in the home, will rise by between 3 and 4 per cent.  The Government's innovative tax measures of January last will provide a further boost.  These measures were designed to relieve the PAYE sector, while protecting revenue through the retention tax on deposit interest, and although the Government ran, and were willing to run, the risk of unpopularity by introducing this new tax, the very positive effect of the PAYE reliefs on take-home pay are now beginning to be noticed.</P>
    <P>Social welfare benefits were also increased across the board in the budget by 4 and 5 per cent.  These increases will take effect the week after next at a time <Col N="2230" /> when consumer prices may actually be about to fall over the coming months. The benefits of that to people on social welfare will be very substantial indeed.</P>
    <P>What we would all like now is to see this increased spending power being translated into jobs.  That has not yet happened, either here at home or in other European countries which are also benefiting from the decline in the price of oil. As I have mentioned, members of the European Council addressed this question and discussed the danger that some of the additional spending power might be added to savings for the time being instead of increasing consumer demand and investment.  As we rely heavily on a healthy and growing demand in the economies of our trading partners, I am concerned, along with other members of the European Council, to see that, if necessary, steps are taken to ensure that the substantial increase in purchasing power is used to raise demand in Europe. Provided that this is done, the medium term growth prospects thus unleashed offer a good chance for an improvement in employment, after this prolonged depression.  By the time the Dáil resumes in October, we will be in a better position to assess these developments.</P>
    <P>Already the unemployment trend has improved dramatically over the past three years.  In early 1983, after Fianna Fáil's last period in office, we were faced with an unemployment figure which had increased by 30 per cent in 12 months.  In the most recent 12 months, the increase in unemployment was barely 3 per cent. Discounting the short lived summer influx of students and school leavers onto the live register which, if last year's experience is repeated, could be large, there is the prospect at least of continued near stability in the level of unemployment in the months ahead.  I hope and expect that there will be a decline next year.</P>
    <P>If the turnaround in the world economy can be maintained and be supported by stronger demand at home, there should be an acceleration in the growth of employment.  The recent falls in manufacturing and building employment both <Col N="2231" /> seem to be coming to an end.  In the final quarter of 1985 manufacturing employment fell by just 400 persons, when seasonal factors are taken into account, compared with 2,500 in the corresponding quarter of 1984.  In the case of building, the improvement has been helped considerably by the extraordinary success of the house improvement grant scheme which has especially helped the smaller building firms.  Although figures are not available, it is believed that services employment continues to show a strong growth.  Moreover, the social employment scheme &mdash; designed to help the long term unemployed &mdash; has now reached its target of 10,000 participants.</P>
    <P>I am not, however &mdash; nor can anyone be &mdash; complacent about the future of growth and employment.  Tourism this year has been hit by a number of special factors affecting the North American market, and I am conscious of the competitive difficulties which have been reported to us by the Confederation of Irish Industry.  In this connection it is important if these difficulties are not to be compounded that pay settlements take account of the sharp reduction in inflation which is in prospect for the next few years.</P>
    <P>Another factor which is making it difficult to assess just what the impact in timing of these events will be is the complexity of our exchange rate position. Our currency has by and large retained it value <i>vis-á-vis</i> those of other European Community countries &mdash; except Britain, which is still the country with which we trade most.  Since Britain is still outside the EMS, sterling is subject to pressures different from those affecting the EMS countries.  We are, therefore, as far as our trade and financial relationships with the United Kingdom are concerned, at the mercy of factors outside our control. The same is true, of course, in relation to the US dollar.  Thus, with the two countries to which we sell more than 40 per cent of our exports, and from which we buy about 60 per cent of our imports, we are subject to currency fluctuations largely unrelated to the fluctuations in <Col N="2232" /> the currency system of which we are a member.  This creates difficult and uncertain trading conditions for some of our industries, including the tourist industry.</P>
    <P>It remains true that the economic prospects facing the country are better than at any time in this decade.  This position has been reached with a greatly improved external position and without compromising the objectives of containing public expenditure and of reducing, in proportionate terms, the Government's borrowings. Even before the fall in oil prices, there was a trade surplus of £312 million in 1985, the first year since 1944 in which an annual trade surplus was recorded. The volume of exports in 1985 rose by 6¼ per cent compared with an increase of 3½ per cent in imports.  Trade returns for the first five months of 1986 show a surplus of £180 million in this period &mdash; over £300 million better than the same quarter last year.  Our trade surplus is now of the order of £600 million.</P>
    <P>Since January, there have been both favourable and unfavourable budgetary developments.  On the one hand, interest payments on the national debt will be much lower than we had allowed for, but on the other, the collapse of Dublin Gas will have an adverse effect on revenue from Bord Gáis Éireann which will also be diminished by the fall in oil prices.</P>
    <P>Tax revenue has been closely in line with budget expectations &mdash; which were for a level of revenue below that expected in the national plan &mdash; taking account of the lower level of inflation we have experienced and adjusted for some reliefs afforded in the Finance Bill.  Spending, however, and particularly current spending, has been running somewhat ahead of the level projected in the budget.  A combination of factors have been at work here which have been offset only to a very limited degree by the lower than expected level of unemployment in the first half of the year.  The Government have taken some steps to trim expenditure in line with lower than expected inflation in order to hold the budget deficit close to that provided for last January.</P>
    <P>I want to say a few words at this point <Col N="2233" /> about the unrealism of many of the proposals that have come from Opposition parties with respect to our present economic climate.  On the one hand, we have seen the principal Opposition Party proposing time and again, and not just at times of local elections, increased in public spending, both capital and current, which, if implemented, would involve a scale of borrowing that could only have a disastrous impact upon the level of domestic interest rates.  It would have a similar impact on the rate at which we are currently borrowing money abroad arising from the more favourable credit rating which this country has been able to secure in recent years owing to the measures taken by this Government in 1981, and again, when we returned to office in 1983.</P>
    <P>Even at present spending levels it has been only with some difficulty that the Government have prevented pressure coming on domestic interest rates because of the current scale of Government borrowing, which is only barely within the limits those lending to us consider reasonable.  We are still, and will for a long period to come remain, on a knife-edge to a degree that we are inclined to forget, or deliberately to put out of our minds.  We would ignore this reality at our peril.  I have to recall the action of the Opposition Party when they were in Government in raising the volume of public spending by 50 per cent in five years which had the effect of preempting the growth of revenue for 20 years ahead, for an entire generation. That has to be made up.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I need not emphasise in this House that lower interest rates are one of the key requirements for more investment and lower taxation, and therefore of greater competitiveness, higher economic growth, and more and better employment in this country.  Persistent attempts to ignore these realities and to propose spending increases on top of the level of public spending to which we have found ourselves committed as a result of the 50 per cent increase in the real cost of public spending undertaken by Fianna Fáil between 1977 and 1982, are totally devoid of realism.  These proposals demonstrate a degree of irresponsibility that parallels all too closely the attitudes underlying the events of those terrible years &mdash; so closely that one can only fear for the future if our country were to fall once again under the control of those who so mortgaged it to the hilt when they <Col N="2235" /> last had their hands on the levers of Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Other voices too have been raised proposing on the one hand reductions in the level of taxation and on the other hand cuts in public spending, both on a scale that is, quite bluntly, not attainable within any reasonable time-scale. It is frankly irresponsible to talk of cuts of £850 million in public spending without giving any indication as to where these cuts are to fall.  The public are entitled to be told whether it is proposed to cut the costs of social welfare payments, which together accounts for over one-third of current expenditure excluding debt service; to reduce public service pay; to sack large numbers of public servants; to cut the health services, even more drastically than we have found it necessary to do; to sack teachers and reduce pupil-teacher ratios in schools, or to offset the cost of public services, such as education, by re-introducing charges for them.  It is simply no use pretending that sums like £850 million can be secured by &ldquo;greater efficiency&rdquo; in a public service in which the last few years have seen unprecedented improvements in efficiency as a result of reductions in staff numbers at a time when the volume of work to be done has still been increasing significantly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am as sympathetic as anyone in this House to the idea of lower tax rates but I do not think that it is in the public interest to promise 25 per cent tax rates, unaccompanied by details as to how the system would operate, beyond the revelation that it would involve the elimination of personal allowances.  It has been suggested that the appallingly harsh effect that such a measure would by itself have upon people on low incomes who are at present completely exempted from taxation would be met by providing a significant exemption limit &mdash; but of course <Col N="2236" /> if this were to be done there would be a net loss of revenue from income tax on an enormous scale.  The figures do not add up.</P>
    <P>We do no good to politics in this country by producing promises either of vast increases in public expenditure as Fianna Fáil have done, or equally unrealistic proposals for reductions in taxation which any voter can by now see have only the quality of a dream, after the nightmare of 1977 to 1982.  I would have thought that the lessons of the years from 1977 onwards might have been learned by some of those then involved.</P>
    <P>The time is long past when the public can be deluded by those kinds of promises of unlimited largesse, to be provided by unspecified means, as if we lived in some make-believe world instead of in the real world of the mid-eighties.  The public are well aware that past actions of this sort have given us a level of public debt unparalleled in the developed world, twice as high as any EC country in relation to GNP, and have ensured a situation where debt payments alone absorb more than the total revenue from income tax &mdash; Fianna Fáil's legacy.</P>

      <P>I know that there are politicians who believe that times have now changed, that political memories are short, that when the next election comes the same routine of promises incapable of fulfilment will win the support of a short-memoried electorate, but I am convinced that it will not be so.  I am convinced also that people are entitled to a choice between truth and falsehood, between realism and fantasy &mdash; and not between competing sets of look-alike politicians falling over each other to fool the people into voting for them on false premises, and false promises, regardless of the consequences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the meantime, we shall continue to provide the kind of honest, dynamic and imaginative Government that has enabled us to come through one of the worst world recessions since the thirties <Col N="2237" /> to do such things as to improve and expand substantially the education system, 3,000 more teachers than when we took office; to guarantee those on welfare against falling living standards, ensuring that in every year of the recession, irrespective of whose purchasing power decreased, the purchasing power of those on social welfare increased; to house 13,000 people through the Housing Finance Agency; to cut by over 7,000 the housing waiting lists, which for decades had remained a scar on our social fabric; to enable thousands of people hitherto forced regardless of their own preference, to be tenants of public authority houses to become instead owners of their own houses; to help 12,000 people on the live register to become self-employed; to put 10,000 long term unemployed to work part time in schemes throughout every part of the country; to get young people, who otherwise would be left to face the frustration of idleness, into community programmes under Teamwork auspices; to start the process of reviving the inner city areas of our major urban centres which had been allowed to rot and to decay under the preceding Administration. Part of this work has been held up by the opposition of Fianna Fáil but we will deal with that in the autumn.</P>
    <P>This is what Government is about.  It is about politicians getting on top of problems by using a combination of their experience on the ground with their imagination, finding solutions that of their nature are unlikely to emerge even from the most efficient bureaucratic machine. It has been the characteristic of this Government that we have been willing to innovate in all these ways and that these innovations have, without exception, proved many times more successful even than our own most optimistic expectations when we devised these proposals.</P>
    <P>The major tasks that face us during the concluding years of this century will be accomplished only if our people retain their commitment to securing once again the full economic independence and freedom that comes only with the removal of dependence on foreign borrowing and of the burden of massive interest payments <Col N="2238" /> on debt, but especially external debt.  If our people were to relax their vigilance in this respect, if they were, at any stage, to elect a Government which was not wholeheartedly and totally committed towards this objective, but which threatened to repeat the appalling experience of those years after 1977, then our future would be grim indeed.  It is the task of all of us on these benches representing two parties which share a common dedication to the public interest, to ensure that this does not happen, but that in the years ahead, as in the last four years, our country will be governed in the interests of our people rather than in the interests of short term popularity of any group of politicians.</P>
    <P>In the year ahead we will remain true to that commitment, and the policies which our two parties will present to the electorate, while they will no doubt differ in certain respects, according to our separate perspectives, will contain nothing that will put in danger what has been achieved during these four years &mdash; nothing that will prejudice the future prosperity of our people, and nothing that will reduce the quality of social justice in our society or damage the integrity of public life.</P>

      <P>This debate marks not only the Adjournment of the Dáil but it is also a parliamentary wake for the Coalition Government.  It has been evident for several months that the Coalition have been living on borrowed time.  The policy splits at the Cabinet table where the national interest has come a poor second to the ideological slogans of competing Ministers are now a matter of public record.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach's own credibility has been damaged again and again.  Not only are Government policies failing but they are no longer believable.  Not only is Government policy failing to regenerate the economy but it is compounding a <Col N="2239" /> sense of hopelessness in our people, employed as well as unemployed, young as well as old, married as well as single. When I talk of the Taoiseach's credibility being damaged, of course we have to look at his partner, the Tánaiste.  Where is his credibility when we see him quoted in the today's edition of <i>The Irish Times</i> speaking of the Leader of Fianna Fáil as being involved in craven connivance with the anti divorce group?  May I suggest that the Tánaiste is totally out of touch with public opinion, as was recorded by the people.  He totally misjudged the views and the feelings of the people in recent weeks.  I suggest that the Tánaiste would be far better off if he listened to the group with which he continuously claims to have a special relationship, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, who yesterday at their annual conference in Belfast called on him and this Government to resign when they discussed the economic situation, jobs and taxation.</P>
    <P>I want to ask the Taoiseach and the Government, who is out of touch?  The Taoiseach, the Tánaiste, the Cabinet and their parties are totally out of touch with what the people are thinking and feeling at this time.  That is not just our view. The Taoiseach's backbenchers tell him the same thing.  This Government would be out of office in the morning if the other group which the Taoiseach attacked in his speech, the Progressive Democrats, the third silent partner to the Coalition, were to take their courage in their hands and vote the way they speak.  They would then vote out this Government and take a load off the shoulders of the people.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>After three and a half years of Coalition bungling it is now more apparent than ever that what this country urgently needs is decisive leadership, a strategy for national recovery which will recognise <Col N="2240" /> the great and proven potential of our people, and a Government that can develop a true partnership with all the people and give them hope and confidence in the future.  This is impossible under the Coalition because their economic policy has fixed itself on an intransigent line which does not allow it the flexibility either to encourage enterprise and initiative or to take advantage of improvement in the world economy.</P>
    <P>It is government by remote control, out of touch with people on the ground. If proof were required of this we received it again in the statement of 1 July from the Minister for Finance on Exchequer returns when he showed that the proportion of the full year deficit outturn incurred in the first half of the present year is 76.5 per cent, and this from a Government who lectured the Irish people and all political parties in the three general elections of 1981 and 1982 on the essential need to eliminate the current budget deficit.  Again the Minister on 1 July said the indications are that there will be some overrun on the targets for the budget deficit for the year as a whole and that savings under a number of headings are unlikely to be sufficient to balance expected shortfalls.  This, if further proof was needed, indicates clearly that the 1986 budget introduced by the Minister, Deputy Dukes &mdash; who, by the way, was immediately fired and moved to the Department of Justice &mdash; is now totally off course.</P>
    <P>This Government in their three and a half years in office more than doubled the national debt and borrowed more than all the Fianna Fáil Governments put together since the foundation of the State.  Those are the facts, unlike the bogeyman stories we have just heard from the Taoiseach.  This &ldquo;carry on regardless&rdquo; attitude is undermining the whole basis of our parliamentary democracy. The very institution of Government is being affected by it.  Therefore, in the greater national interest this Coalition should go.  They no longer have any credibility. They are a lame duck Government, nothing less, nothing more. National recovery can be brought about <Col N="2241" /> only by putting people first, only if the people are given a chance to contribute. As it is, the extension of our dole queues to the lines of young people outside the American Embassy should tell the Government that their policies are failing abysmally.  The forced emigration of an increased number of our people, especially young people, cannot be the answer.</P>
    <P>On the question of emigration, this Taoiseach consistently over the past 12 months evaded answering questions addressed to him in this House and delegated them to the Minister of State.  Time and again figures were given by his Minister of State on behalf of the Government which indicated that emigration was running at a level of about 5,000 to 7,000, but the real story has now emerged, thanks to a question addressed to the Taoiseach by Deputy John O'Leary who was given a written reply on 1 July.  Deputy O'Leary asked the Taoiseach the total number of persons who had (a) left Ireland and (b) entered Ireland by sea and by air during each of the years ending 31 May 1984, 31 May 1985 and 31 May 1986.  The reply indicated clearly a tidal wave of emigration from this country.  In 1984, the figure was 10,000; in 1985, it was 38,000; and in 1986, it was 64,000.</P>
    <P>The national handlers yesterday attempted to argue away the significance of those figures, but every Deputy in this House is aware of the curse of emigration in his or her constituency to the extent that in some parts of the country the local football clubs are finding it impossible to field a team because the young people have left.  I can give the House an example in my constituency of North Dublin. I was at a meeting in the village of Garristown there about a fortnight ago and I was told by the residents I was meeting that night and by mothers there that ten young people from that small village had emigrated in that week.  Then this Government tell us emigration is not a problem.</P>
    <P>There are many ways in which national recovery can be brought about, and over the past three years Fianna Fáil have suggested several both in policy documents and here in the Dáil.  We have <Col N="2242" /> pointed to the pivotal role which the construction industry can play, because this industry is unique.  As has been said many times in the past, it is a barometer of the economic health of the country.  It reflects a whole range of support services and employment areas over and above those directly involved in the construction industry.  However, under this Coalition this industry has all but been brought to its knees.  The statistics tell us that the number of houses completed in the private sector in the past three years has fallen by over 25 per cent.  In the current year the trend suggests that this decline is at an even faster rate.</P>
    <P>In the Dublin area the number of new house starts during the first quarter of this year alone is 13 per cent down on the 1985 figure and 43 per cent below the corresponding figure for 1984.  This decline is also marked in local authority completions, despite the Minister's undertaking in December 1982 to the contrary.  What can one expect when in the current year Government expenditure on local authority housing has fallen from £200 million in 1984 to £170 million? Another example is that cement sales have fallen by 17 per cent in the past two years alone.  For the first three months of 1986 the Construction Industry Federation figures suggest that there has been a drop of 15 per cent in cement sales over the same period in 1985.  Then the VAT rate has been topped up consistently by this Government, rising from 3 per cent in 1981 to 5 per cent in 1982 and in the 1985 budget increased to 10 per cent.  As a further example, we have seen a 26 per cent volume cut in the public capital programme since this Government came to power.  A further example in 1986 is that the public construction investment is down £34 million even on the level projected in the Government's discredited plan <i>Building on Reality 1985-1987.</i></P>
    <P>These statistics tell us that investment in the construction industry is drying up. This began to develop when the Coalition withdrew from the capital programme the £200 million which had been allocated to the industry by the last Fianna Fáil <Col N="2243" /> Government.  It is no wonder that An Foras Forbartha reported last May that investment in the construction industry in 1985 was only 10.6 per cent of GDP, the lowest since the sixties.  The result of this suicidal policy is twofold.  Firstly, it has obvious effects on employment.  At the moment nearly 50,000 people are unemployed in the construction industry, a figure which represents an increase of almost 100 per cent since 1981.  Secondly, this figure tells only part of the story, because the deliberate scaling down of the industry has also meant a dramatic increase in unemployment among carpenters, plumbers, engineers, surveyors and all types of skilled tradesmen and women.  This will not be reversed until the Coalition recognise that there is a problem in the construction industry.</P>
    <P>A very good start, indeed, would be for the Minister for the Environment, the Minister directly responsible for the construction industry, to build on reality and retract his remarks made in the debate on the Estimate for his Department that: &ldquo;Last year was the best year for the industry since the present recession began.  While there was a further marginal fall in the volume of output it is encouraging to note that by the end of last year unemployment had stabilised and, indeed, began to show an improving trend in the early part of the year.&rdquo;  This is a classic example of the level of unreality which permeates this Government.</P>
    <P>From the CIF report 1985-86, I quote:</P>
    <P>Unfortunately the state of the industry continues to decline.  The industry's position is far worse than might appear to the public e.g. unemployment has remained static for the months December 1985, January, February, March 1986.  What is not generally realised is that there is a massive haemorrhage of emigration at all levels of the industry &mdash; manual workers, managements and the professions. There is also an increasing number of people working in the Black Economy assisted by the doubling of VAT some of whom are not drawing the dole.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2244" /> The decline in cement sales reached 12 per cent for the first four months of the year and other indicators, such as the decline in housing starts and the number of firms closing down in all sectors, is further evidence if evidence is needed....  It is unfortunate that some politicians and economists foresaw an upturn this year and this assists in preventing action being taken.</P>
    <P>Instead of the Minister for the Environment closing his eyes and hoping that the problem will go away, he and the Government should take action.  The Construction Industry Federation have denied the Minister's assertion that last year was the best for the industry since the present recession began.</P>
    <P>Investment in the construction industry must be encouraged as a renewed and reinvigorated industry is central to lowering unemployment and to national economic recovery.  It is also socially desirable that house buyers, particularly young couples, are given the incentive to buy their own homes.  Private investment can be encouraged through the development of section 23 type incentives such as those introduced by the last Fianna Fáil Government but thoughtlessly discarded by the Coalition when they assumed office.</P>
    <P>There is also a need for a more creative Government policy in other areas such as joint venture housing and, of course, fundamental to all the aids needed in the construction industry is a re-evaluation of VAT levels.  It is absurd to have VAT at a rate of 10 per cent with the stated aim of bringing in extra revenue when it is obvious that such a rate is discouraging construction.</P>
    <P>I also appeal to the Minister to take a more practical and realistic look at the operation of the reconstruction grant schemes.  Fianna Fáil had been promoting these schemes for months as a way of reducing unemployment in the construction industry.  However, when the scheme was taken up by Government last October it became obvious that there is a massive difference between the ideas <Col N="2245" /> promoted by Fianna Fáil and the Government scheme and its operation.  In terms of the 1986 estimate, only £24 million has been allocated to these schemes.  Based on Dáil replies from the Minister for the Environment on 12 February and 19 March, it is clear that this budget will be totally inadequate to meet the volume of applications.  The Minister also stated in March that it would cost £45 million to fund the applications which had been approved without inspection and they are only a proportion of the applications. Bearing these facts in mind and in view of the budgetary allocation, it is no wonder that there is a great difference between the intent and the reality of the scheme. Householders say that the letters of approval are not worth the paper they are written on.  They speak of delays in approval and of financial hardship caused by inspectors deliberately undervaluing projects, apparently with the aim of keeping the level of the grant down.  As the scheme is operating, it may well prove counterproductive as householders are lulled into a false sense of security.  The allocated budget is insufficient and householders may find themselves on the financial rack.  This is a matter of fact and it is misleading of the Government to suggest otherwise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Coalition mishandling of the Housing Finance Agency is also putting some householders in an untenable position.  The Government are deliberately trying to run down the agency with the result that they are losing credibility with the banks and leaving many householders unable to dispose of their houses due to increased debt. Government policy is no longer believable adding a psychological malaise to economic and industrial mismanagement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As employers and representative institutions, local authorities are also being forced into Limbo.  How can they provide the necessary services when the Coalition <Col N="2246" /> use every opportunity deliberately to frustrate them?  In particular, the Government are trying to undermine the decision taken by the Fianna Fáil Government to abolish domestic rates. Local charges are a form of taxation and they constitute double taxation on an already overburdened taxpaying public. Fianna Fáil do not see the provision of local services in terms of reintroducing creeping local taxation.  Instead we again call on the Government to put local authority finances on a firm and solid footing by establishing a statutory annual contribution from the central Exchequer.</P>
    <P>The backhanded way in which local authority finances have been treated by Government is matched by their attitude to local democracy.  In 1984 local elections were postponed on the premise that local government was to be reformed. Two years later we still have no clear idea of what central Government have in mind for local authorities.  Perhaps that is not entirely correct, two weeks ago a streets' commission was announced and, while I welcome that, the reality is that the Government are trying to subvert local democracy.  If this is an indication of the way they are approaching local government reform, it does not augur well for local authorities.  The Minister should be encouraging people to participate in local affairs instead of putting a gulf between them and the Government.</P>
    <P>The Government have failed in many areas, especially in the construction industry, the operation of the Housing Finance Agency, home improvement grants and local democracy and finance. Their failure in one area is unforgiveable. I refer to Sellafield.  If they had taken firm action they would have given leadership which would have unified the people.  On two occasions we had a debate in Private Members' time on the question of Sellafield and nuclear power.  Last May we had a Fianna Fáil motion that Dáil Éireann, in view of the serious menace represented by nuclear power installations which in the event of an accident could cause serious injury and longlasting contamination in Ireland, should request the Government (1) to demand the closure <Col N="2247" /> of the Sellafield complex in the light of its deplorable safety record and (2) to undertake a complete review of plans and arrangements for the protection of the civilian population in the event of fallout from a nuclear accident; to take whatever steps are shown to be necessary by this review and report back to the Dáil within three months on the current state of these plans.  The Government, Taoiseach and the Minister for Energy took a craven approach to this motion to the extent of being afraid to disturb Mrs. Thatcher and the Conservative Government.  They were prepared to put at risk the health, safety and security of our people in regard to this menace on our doorstep.  They voted down the motion in this House instead of taking the opportunity to unite the people in calling for a closure of Sellafield. They argued that calling for closure is not sufficient and would not have caused Sellafield to close.  We believe that a proper approach would have been to unite the people and that a call for closure from the Government would have put great moral pressure on the British Government to take seriously the threat to the Irish people and their own residents of Sellafield and the nuclear stations along the west coast of Britain.  But this Government were not prepared to send out a united call from this House. Compare that with the Danish Parliament who suffer a similar threat from the nuclear power station in Malmo.  The Danish Parliament were not afraid to send out a united call to their neighbours, the Swedes, to close down the power station in Malmo.  But we have these knee-walking Minister led by the Taoiseach, afraid in any way to disturb the Conservative Government in England. They are prepared to put the health and security of the Irish nation at risk rather than call on the British Government to close Sellafield.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that it took the Taoiseach until about the twentieth page of his speech to get to anything about the economy and the condition of those who are unemployed, and then it was only a passing reference.  He claimed the <Col N="2248" /> present level of the sterling/punt relationship is a great thing because it allows imports to be bought by our people at a cheaper rate than would have been possible in the past.  The reality is that because of the present value of sterling and because of the policies being followed by Government, our exporters and manufacturers are crippled and our traditional industries are very badly hit in regard to our export potential because of the value of sterling at the moment.  It is essential that the Government take action in this regard.</P>
    <P>It is interesting also that for the first time the Taoiseach referred to the collapse of Dublin Gas when he said that on the one hand interest payments on the national debt would be much lower than they had allowed for but that on the other hand the &ldquo;collapse&rdquo; of Dublin Gas will have an adverse effect on revenue from Bord Gáis Éireann which will also be diminished by the fall in oil prices.  That is the first time there has been a recognition of the collapse of Dublin Gas and I would suggest that he talk to the former Minister for Trade about that matter.</P>
    <P>As a representative of Dublin North constituency I must mention the problems being faced by the horticultural industry.  I take this opportunity to make a plea to the Government, which will probably fall on deaf ears, to do something in regard to the Irish potato crop which is now coming on stream. Imported potatoes have had a clear run on the Irish market for the last six weeks. Would it be asking too much of the Minister for Agriculture at least to allow our potato farmers the opportunity to have some small period of sales into the Irish market for Irish potatoes free from imports so that they can survive &mdash; and it is a matter of survival?  They need the opportunity to get decent prices and fair competition in the market rather than being subject to the unfair competition from imports that are at the moment being dumped on the market.</P>
    <P>As I stated at the outset, the reality is that Government are pushing the people away from them.  They are living in a vacuum having lost all touch with the <Col N="2249" /> reality of Ireland today.  They have shattered the confidence of the nation.  This confidence must be restored and this is the only way towards national recovery, the only way forward.  The Government cannot provide it.  One of the Fine Gael backbenchers is reported in <i>The Irish Press</i> today as having said to the Minister for Education &mdash; that was until she was fired, now Minister for Social Welfare &mdash;&ldquo;Madam, you have had your day; you were rejected by the people&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I say to the Government that they have been rejected by the Irish people: they have had their day and have been rejected.  Fianna Fáil will, hopefully, have a chance within the next few months to raise the confidence and the belief of the people in themselves.  Let the Taoiseach get out and give the people an opportunity to go forward.</P>

      <P>Deputy Burke must have graduated head of the class in the Brian Lenihan school of political blather.  I have never heard a more predictable, robotproduced, automated lot of featureless rant as I have in the last 30 minutes. There is not a light note struck in it, not a trace of generosity, no give of any kind. It is just the old sort of thing which sickens people who come into this House, who wander in, perhaps sit in the Public Gallery for 20 minutes and go home again and say they were in the Dáil but did not think much of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problems that this economy wrestles with and that Governments in charge of the country have to wrestle with in their turn are confronted in a framework which we inherited.  This is a theme which the House will have heard from me before.  It is a framework both psychological and organisational which is essentially British and we have never succeeded in getting away from it and we have never had the courage or the inventiveness to revolutionise it and to dig the spade, so to speak, deeper into the Irish soil and turn up a landscape, a governmental and psychological landscape, somewhat different in shape from that which the British left behind.  We have a governmental structure which in <Col N="2250" /> all essential respects is the same as the British have themselves or would have left behind here if they had a full political structure in the country.  We have an industrial relations ethos and industrial relations practices which are, as far as my inexpert eye can judge, indistinguishable from those which prevail on the other side of the Irish sea and are a major factor in the progressive impoverishment of the British economy, and we have a public psychology as to the role of the State, as to the duty of the State, being continuously to expand its systems of social support, continuously to provide jobs whether the jobs are wealth producing or not, and continuously to assume responsibility for the prosperity of individuals. These are the things that are making it impossible for a Government here ever to be able to render an account to this House or to the people of success, and make it impossible for any Taoiseach of any party ever to be more than defensive when presenting his accounts at the end of the year.</P>
    <P>We are going to have to revolutionise some of the elements I have mentioned and I am not altogether pessimistic about our doing that because I have seen some signs of it.  I must &mdash; and I do it gladly because he is a party colleague &mdash; give credit to the Minister for Finance, Deputy Bruton, for having the guts and the inventiveness to try something new and to try some new thought and to try to get others to share new thought that would not indeed seem very revolutionary in Switzerland or Scandinavia but is very revolutionary in these Islands.  I salute Deputy Bruton for trying to turn the psychology of the people around.  I notice that he is now beginning to speak, and has been for some time speaking, about the concept of the wider diffusion of ownership.  He is absolutely right in that, in the strategic perception that the material happiness of people lies in their having a personal stake in and a personal share of the property of their country. He is absolutely right.  It contradicts and, of course, flies in the face of the Marxist dialectic and the Marxist perception that is necessary to the revolutionary thesis <Col N="2251" /> that there is a ruling class which pre-empts and preoccupies all sources of wealth and that that is something which only revolution can displace.</P>
    <P>I am very keen on avoiding revolution and all the horrors and tyrannies which result from it which one can see in many unfortunate parts of the world.  I am keen on doing this by timely reform, the kind of reform which Deputy Bruton is trying to undertake by spreading the idea of wide diffusion of ownership.  In his own field by inducing the greater participation of employees of firms in the share capital of their enterprise he is going on absolutely the right track.  I hope he will be well supported for doing so.  The Government's older schemes with regard to assisting tenants of local authority dwellings to purchase them and become owners of them have proved very popular, as indeed they have in other countries. That, even though not so advertised, is another dimension of the notion of diffusion of ownership, giving people a stake and a sense of property in the country which they can pass on to their children.  This is something which gives them perspectives of life other than those which lead them always to be articulating demands on other people.</P>
    <P>Apart from revolution in thought of the kind of which Deputy Bruton has given an example in regard to diffusing ownership, we need a much wider diffusion of control and government, economic management and an economic initiative.  When we identify a problem here, we tend to set up an authority or board, to find some Irish name for it and hope that will take the problem by the throat and deal with it.  The authority is only another aspect of the centralised State and does not mobilise the emotional support, commitment and co-operation of individuals in frames and on scales which they are able to understand and which they feel are modest enough for their own individual contribution to have some impact.  We had an opportunity to do that, and in theory we still have, via the promised local government reform. That was the one part of Deputy Burke's <Col N="2252" /> speech with which I could not disagree. I am disappointed that it is taking so long to do anything serious in connection with local government reform.</P>
    <P>The only reform we have seen so far which has reached the Statute Book has been a jiggling of a frontier here and a juggling of frontiers there, an increase in the number of councillors in Dublin city, leading to work for theatrical costumiers, an increase in the number of county councillors in various places and the upgrading or uptitling of a body, if these farces impress you.  I do not believe they do impress you, Sir.  If the farce of calling one impotent authority by a name grander than that which it already has impresses you, well that has been impressive legislation.</P>
    <P>Anything in regard to transforming the actual function and character of local government is still awaited.  I am afraid I cannot dissent from Deputy Burke's expression of disappointment.  Nothing in that Deputy's operations on Dublin County Council leads me to suppose that he has any higher conception of local government than that it might give him personally and his party a chance to pull more strings and operate more levers. That is not what I am talking about.  His general complaint that there has been no sign of any conceptual or structural local government reform is correct.  That is an area in which it would have been possible, and still in theory is, for organisms to be devised, I hope based on relatively small communes or community units of a dimension such that an individual can see the impact of his own input into it.  I hope it would operate on the co-operative principle which transformed the very poor economies of Northern Europe at the end of the last century and the beginning of this.</P>
    <P>This country was notoriously the most wretched of all the European countries in the middle 19th century &mdash; traveller after traveller attests that.  However, it was not, an objective criteria, all that much more wretched than the countries of Northern Europe with poorer land and exploding populations like our own.  The <Col N="2253" /> populations of Sweden, Northern Germany and Denmark were nearly at the same level of wretchedness in the early and middle 19th century when they also emigrated in large streams to the North American continent, as our own did.  But these economies are now among the richest in the world and reached that degree of richness, I think I am right in saying in the case of Denmark and Sweden certainly, although I am less well instructed about other countries, largely by the deployment of the co-operative principle and the operation of modest localised schemes for the improvement of agriculture, of stock, the better use of land and so forth.  The problems of each country are different.</P>
    <P>I do not say that in every respect solutions which worked very well in poor parts of Sweden in the 1890s would work equally well in the very different conditions of Ireland in the 1980s.  I do say that there was an instance of a new principle, because it had not been known before then, being consciously introduced and seen within the space of two or three generations utterly to transform the existence of the people among whom it was being operated.  That possibility is open to us as well.  It needs a bit of a start from the State.  I have very many times written letters, minutes, memoranda and made speeches about this, and submitted the idea to Minister after Minister.  I am still waiting to see something happening.  I do not say that it should, merely because I say so &mdash; far from it &mdash; but I do think that is a route which also could be described as putting the spade in deeper, revolutionising some of the inherited and now petrified structures in which the economy and political life here operate, doing something new and likely to be effective by mobilising the enthusiasm of individuals, giving individual people the feeling that they can do something for themselves and their neighbours.</P>
    <P>A third way &mdash; and I have spoken many times about this here before &mdash; is to intensify our contact with the outside world.  I get depressed, I must admit, at the sight of the long queues which I can see every day outside the American Embassy. <Col N="2254" /> They were so small once that they were scarcely noticed, but now they look like demonstrations because they are so large.  One begins to wonder if it is something about Nicaragua again.  However, it is only many people queuing up for visas.  I am distressed by that if it is the case, as I assume it is with many of them, that economic circumstances have forced them to go.  I have never advocated that we should simply welcome emigration as a safety valve, but the mere decrying of emigration even if it is only temporary, as being a loss and a disaster is wicked and there is something positive to be gained from intensifying the contact of this country with the outside world.  That must be done at every level, in the schools by increasing linguistic skills which at the moment are lamentably low, at a later stage by encouraging cyclical migration of Irish people to the outside world so that they can become accustomed to outside standards and, in particular, the standards of the people in whose markets we are going to have to sell our goods.</P>
    <P>We need to push our people out &mdash; I do not mean onto the emigration ships and I am sick of expressing the hope that I will not be misunderstood when I say that.  We should encourage young people to get out for a couple of years if they can.  I do not want to raise a silly hare, but it is not all that foolish to suppose that we might perhaps gain benefit if we could find placements in training schemes somewhere abroad for people for whom no work can be found at home.  We could send them postal orders representing the amount of unemployment assistance they would have been getting had they stayed here, to top up whatever pittance of pocket money they might be getting as trainees abroad.  That would pay us as well as pay them.  When they came back they would be people of a training, experience, breadth of vision and a set of perspectives of a kind we desperately need here.  We also need to overcome the ideology which is nibbling away like rodents at the foundations of whatever bits of psychological health are still left in the country.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton has had to put up with <Col N="2255" /> much of what he called a lukewarm reception.  He has not complained about it because he has to stay on good terms, naturally, with all sides, but it is clear that he has been getting a lukewarm reception from some sections of the trade union movement in regard to his proposal for share ownership.  Many trade unions although they may not perhaps express it to themselves like this and might be shocked at my saying so, appear to have a vested interest in keeping their members poor and dependent.  I hope I am wrong in that, but sometimes it really seems so. I think things are beginning to change, but that has seemed to be the case.</P>
    <P>I saw an exquisite example of what I am talking about in a very interesting article by Maev-Ann Wren in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 13 May.  I must frankly admit that I do not understand the mechanics of these concerts too well but a concert was launched on the model of the Geldof one for Africa, which was first to be called Jobs Aid but was subsequently rechristened Self Aid.  The whole operation was intended as a source from which to fund jobs.  Mr. Peter Cassells, Assistant General Secretary of the ICTU, is quoted by Miss Wren as saying the following about the retitling of the concern into Self Aid.  He said that they were annoyed at the change and would be totally opposed to the ideological connotation that it is up to people to create their own jobs and that it is not economic and social policies generally that are creating our problems.  Are these people living on the moon?  If I am to follow the logic of that, he would sooner destroy the prospect of a job if it is self-created rather than have the principle that the State is the provider in any sense impaired or diminished.</P>
    <P>At another stage Ms. Wren reports as follows: Despite the ICTU's reservations about the renaming of the project, Congress remains involved although the labour youth movement, journalist, Eamonn McCann, and musician, Paul Cleary, have all adopted positions of active opposition to the concert in protest against the Self Aid philosophy.  Have these people not got the independence to <Col N="2256" /> put on their own trousers in the morning without help?  Mr. Peter Cassells of the ICTU said &mdash; let me interpolate my own word &mdash; very grudgingly that the Congress still sees it as a useful mechanism for focusing attention on unemployment. The reason he gives for focusing attention on unemployment is in order to make people start asking questions about what the Government and political parties are doing.  That gentleman figures in many dimensions of Irish life.  I do not mean to offend him but not doubt he is typical of a whole slice of opinion in the trade union movement and at the senior and most important levels of it.  This same gentleman was recently appointed by the Minister for Industry and Commerce to the board of the National Development Corporation. I do not mind there being a statutory input.  Naturally I would welcome it.  It has to be there from the trade union side of the industrial field.  This individual thinks that it is a pernicious ideology that people should make work for themselves.  What part has he got in the National Development Corporation?</P>
    <P>The National Development Corporation is a reflection of the kind of psychological rut we have been stuck in ever since the British left from which the very first Government made some innovative efforts to escape but into which we have since sunk back.  The National Development Corporation was wished upon this part as part of the Coalition deal.  I asked repeatedly in the House and elsewhere over the years what it was going to do.  I am still waiting for an answer.  The first answer I ever got was not a direct answer. I got the newsletter of the National Development Corporation called <i>Venture News</i>.  It is a very humble and modest little sheet.  It is the first bulletin since the appointment of the new board.  <i>Venture News</i> gives details of one venture which they have engaged in, the only one since the establishment of a corporation which is to create tens of thousands of new jobs like the jobs that Fianna Fáil said were only waiting to be created.</P>
    <P>The only venture detailed in this bulletin is an enterprise for making Irish bog oak souvenirs.  The chief executive said <Col N="2257" /> that this venture is backed by a skilled team of talented individuals and they welcomed this addition to the portfolio.  I would like to clear the leprechauns out of the national portfolio and also clear out of the State's portfolio redundant agencies of which the NDC, I am sorry to say, seems to be one.  If I turn out to be wrong about it and if it is able to exploit areas of the economy that it never occurred to private enterprise to exploit, I will eat my words cheerfully and gladly.</P>
    <P>I want to move to the recently evolving political situation.  I have just been dealing with how we need a much more revolutionary and deep-reaching reconstruction, psychological and organisational, if we are ever going to get clear of the economic problems we have.  I have often said that before and I am not going to waste my time talking about it now.</P>
    <P>Because of the referendum result we are faced with the indefinite postponement of any divorce legislation.  I am not going to explore the question of whether if the Government had postponed it until after the next election or some other time, it might have had a better chance of getting through.  For better or for worse and for reasons good or bad, the whole divorce option has been pushed out of the way for a considerable number of years.  We need not speculate how many.  In that interval, as the Taoiseach quite rightly said, there is a strong and urgent obligation on the Government to see what can be done within the constraint of a legal and constitutional system which does not contain divorce. It is important and urgent to do that, and I fully support the Taoiseach.  He is right to eliminate any illusions people may have about the law of nullity.  I said a word or two about it recently on a radio interview &mdash; I did not expect to be asked about it &mdash; but I think I have been misinterpreted by some people to judge by a couple of letters I got about it.</P>
    <P>Nullity is not a substitute for divorce and cannot be a substitute for divorce. The Taoiseach is absolutely right in saying that any attempt to expand the nullity jurisdiction in such a way as to <Col N="2258" /> make it a substitute for divorce would be unconstitutional.  It cannot be that.  All I am saying, and all the Taoiseach means, is that there are some areas of matrimonial law &mdash; I am not an expert on matrimonial law, Deputy Shatter knows infinitely more about it than I do &mdash; e.g. the law of nullity in which some little improvement might be effected by statute. It will not solve the problems of the vast majority of people in broken marriages.  No one ever pretended that it would.  It will only solve the problems of people in whose marriage there was a flaw at the very beginning.  That area has been untouched by statute.  There may be room for statutory improvement in order to help what will only be a limited number of individuals.  That should be done.  In regard to the law on separation, the status of children and so on I hope the Government will vigorously push ahead with their proposals.  I heard press mutterings about whether or not the Government will have difficulties with that.  I do not believe that there will be any dissent from the Government's programme in that regard.  If there is, I have not become aware of it.</P>
    <P>The attitude of the Opposition to the referendum is unique in the annals of this country.  I cannot remember anything corresponding to it.  There was one occasion on which a party leader was involved in opposing a referendum but his heart was suspected not to be in it.  I am referring to Liam Cosgrave who made no secret of the fact that he would have preferred a straight vote to PR.  He said that before he became party leader and I do not know whether he has changed his mind since.  He most vigorously opposed the Fianna Fáil proposal in 1968 and gave a marvellous and fighting lead to his party in so doing.  These positions were not inconsistent.  It was not inconsistent to say: &ldquo;We refuse to let the country be tied down in this way&rdquo;.  There was tolerance by Fianna Fáil in regard to electoral boundaries Mr. Boland was proposing. Although the theory appealed to Liam Cosgrave he made no bones about leading a campaign to vote &ldquo;no&rdquo; and he won his campaign by a massive landslide. <Col N="2259" /> What have we got from Deputy Haughey?  His own personal opinion, he simpered modestly, six weeks ago was irrelevant.</P>
    <P>The press need to be lectured by someone who is less dependent on them than I am.  I do not want to be blacked by the press, but I must say they get very stickin-the-mud about certain cliches and the way they operate.  We have the conventional photograph of the Minister for Finance grinning foolishly over what is supposed to be the Hibernian equivalent of a battered despatch box.  We have the equally conventional and superfluous pictures of the party leaders casting their votes, posing fittingly until all the cameras have been lined up, and dropping their ballot papers in the box.</P>
    <P>There was one last Thursday showing the Taoiseach and his wife casting their votes.  I take it the Taoiseach voted &ldquo;yes&rdquo;.  There was one showing the Leader of the Opposition, prettily posing with his voting paper over the box.  No one knows what was on the paper.  He is a party leader.  The vote is supposed to be secret for all voters.  It is secret and, damn it, a politician is not in the business of refusing to say how the country should be run.  He is not in the business of saying, &ldquo;I would like to be Taoiseach, the man in charge, but I will not tell you my opinions about anything that will interest you&rdquo;.</P>

On the radio the other day I heard Deputy Haughey say why he did not want to take a line and why his party did not want to take a line on the divorce campaign.  He said that they did not want to politicise a social issue.  Think of the niceness of it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>This is amazing.  On 5 November 1982, coming up to the last general election, Deputy Haughey's first act when the whistle blew was to proclaim that the pro-life amendment which he had taken under his wing would go through under Fianna Fáil.  He was making it a political issue.  I refer to Olivia O'Leary's article on that day:</P>
      <P>Fine Gael could not be trusted to proceed with the anti-abortion amendment in Government, the Taoiseach, Mr. Haughey, said yesterday.  He would be making the anti-abortion amendment a major campaign measure on the basis, he said, that he believed only Fianna Fáil were genuinely committed to bringing it forward. Despite Fine Gael's welcome for the amendment last night and their commitment to support it in an amendment, Mr. Haughey claimed that there was still a difference between the Fine Gael and the Fianna Fáil attitude to the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is the man who, when it suits him on different occasions, does not want to <Col N="2261" /> bring politics into a social issue.  He knew that the pro-life amendment, if put to the people, had to win, that there was no possible way it could lose, and so he made it a political issue hoping to wrong foot Deputy FitzGerald who might have been hovering around or foostering about trying to decide whether to vote &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  Deputy FitzGerald rightly brushed the thing off the table and said: &ldquo;We will do the same&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It was quite different in regard to the divorce referendum.  From opinion polls, Deputy Haughey might have had a hunch one way or the other but he could not be clear or certain.  There was always the chance of antagonising the trendy-boots in the country who would be an easy target for the idea that Fianna Fáil were a republican party.  He would still like to have a certain section of the crowd at Bodenstown believing in that dimension of the party's operations.  So, he sat on the fence.  I suppose the whole thing is a shambles but there is one silver lining in it, a very substantial one, for the Government and the party I belong to, that is, that I believe Fianna Fáil's leadership by taking that line has irreparably damaged itself with a significant section of thinking people.</P>

      <P>I have not patience with the noise coming from the North of Ireland about this.  In the North of Ireland anyone who is honest and open minded must see that there is a huge change going on in this State.  Twenty years ago no Irish Government of any complexion would have dared to bring forward a referendum on divorce.  They would have fallen over backwards to conceal the fact that the thing had even been discussed among them.  Had a document so suicidal been introduced in 1956 or 1966 as to put such a thing up it would not have been <Col N="2262" /> beaten 63 to 36, or whatever it is, but by 96 to 4 or thereabouts.  Not even 5 per cent of the people would have been willing to vote for it.</P>
      <P>There has been a huge turn around in opinion in this country under our eyes, as there was in the decade from 1974 to 1984 when the contraception law was dragged out of the 1870s and people are now willing to live with it.  I have no patience with those who go on about this State being priest ridden, about nothing ever changing.  Many times I have spoken here begging for understanding for Unionists, begging for a little sympathy for their position, but they are the ones who do not seem to change.  They do not seem to have shown an inch of give in their attitude to life in the last 60 years. They have learned nothing from their experience and they have brought all the horror and sorrow and bloodshed on their own heads by their grotesque selfishness and shortsightedness at a time when they might have reformed had they followed the lead of somebody who had a bit of perception, like O'Neill.</P>
      <P>We are now into what is called the &ldquo;Marching Season&rdquo;.  What in the name of God do they want to be marching for?  Would they ever close down their marches for a couple of years as a gesture to reconciliation?  No, that is not negotiable, but everything down here is supposed to be negotiable.  I defend the Unionists.  I try to make their case and I try to get better understanding for them and for us to keep in touch with reality in regard to them but I will not take this sort of stuff from them about the episode we had last week.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach commenced his speech on the referendum and I am sure we will have a continuation of the same speech by other speakers trying to defend the indefensible.  The hard fact is that the Government got it wrong.  They should now spend some time and money trying to solve our economic problems.  The referendum result showed that they were not in touch at any level with our people.  This morning we had this charade of justification when <Col N="2263" /> we have mass unemployment, collapse of industries, agriculture in a stagnant position and when the temporary emeployment schemes, funded almost entirely from the EC social fund, are collapsing around our feet.</P>
      <P>The idea of an Adjournment Debate at the end of a Dáil session is to provide an opportunity for a general look at the state of the country.  It is a necessary opportunity to cover the field widely without the limitations applying to most other debates.  It is particularly necessary at present to indicate to Government how isolated they have become from reality, how inappropriate and inadequate their actions have been.</P>
      <P>Our employment figures are given as 230,000, but the true figure is nearer to 250,000.  One would think the figure was only 25 per cent of that judging by the absence of constructive comments from Government.  The usual solution trotted out by the Labour Party is that we should turn to State enterprises.  We have the reverse from Fine Gael, who sit back and say that when the book-keeping comes right the jobs will pop out of the woodwork. Have the Government not grasped the fact that the unemployed are not interested in ideology; they are interested only in jobs?  Jobs do not appear, they have to be created.  The phrase &ldquo;nobody earns a personal living, but they owe them the opportunity&rdquo; is true of a government. While they cannot create jobs Government can create the conditions. In that area the Government stand condemned. They have made no effort to create the atmosphere where jobs can be created.  The attack on the jobs front should be from all sides, for example, State projects, private projects, co-operative and community projects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problem of emigration was highlighted yesterday by a Parliamentary Question.  Emigration is more apparent in the region I come from than in most others.  We are very concerned about it. Almost 12 months ago I tabled a question asking the number who had emigrated from the RDO region of Cavan, Monaghan and Louth.  That question was <Col N="2264" /> tabled following the local elections as a result of a canvass through the area in which it was found that two to three young people of many houses had gone to America, most of them illegally on temporary visas.  They left themselves very vulnerable.  If they suffered health problems or the loss of employment, they had no benefits.  It is a serious problem.</P>
    <P>In reply to the question of yesterday the Taoiseach admitted over 100,000 have emigrated over the last three years. For the year ended May 1984, 10,000 more people left the country than returned.  For the year ended May 1985, 38,000 more people left the country than returned.  In the year ended May 1986, the number was 64,000.  In one of today's newspapers it was suggested that these figures were not necessarily accurate as a person could leave from Belfast on a business trip, fly to Dublin, travel onward from Dublin and return to Belfast.  It is ridiculous to try to base an argument on that being a general trend.  I can say without any fear of contradiction that those leaving in massive numbers from the constituency I represent and from along the Border region are leaving from Belfast.  They would not be included in the figures which the Taoiseach gave.</P>
    <P>Factories and industries are closing down.  People are becoming redundant. The social employment scheme was introduced in February 1985.  It did not operate in many local authority areas to any extent until late 1985.  There is one project in my area by a community committee who were quick off the ball.  They were the first in the region.  They had two men employed in an old world village doing very necessary work.  This was in line with the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Boland's announcement of tidying up the country.  Their 12 months have expired.  They have been told that due to financial constraints they cannot be re-employed.  I have appealed to the Department to give serious consideration to cases such as this one.  These workers were carrying out work for a community organisation.  That type of work is vital at present.  When there are many demands on the State that type of effort <Col N="2265" /> is much needed.  That scheme should be allowed to continue.  It is regrettable that the social employment and temporary employment schemes should now suffer the fate that other industries have suffered over the last number of years.</P>
    <P>Many of us believed when industry was finding it hard to compete that agriculture should have taken up the slot in different areas.  On the agricultural front, there has been a miserable performance from Government.  I am not denying there are serious obstacles in the EC, which will remain.  The Government's approach has been one of conceding defeat early on. They have bemoaned the changed situation. All other member states seem to be able to manipulate the rules to their own advantage.  They succeed in buying time by these tactics and on many occasions improve their own situations.  There seems to be little effort to adjust our tactics in the circumstances of limitations on production, for example, on butter and meat et cetera.  The Department should apply their skills to identify and develop alternative enterprises, for example, utilisation of foreign produce for industrial applications.  It is conceded that there is substantial scope in this field. Little effort is made to promote it at any significant level.  What the farm sector want at present is the courage and enterprise shown by the late Seán Lemass in the industrial sector.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil were the first to recommend the EC to the public in 1972.  They did not promote it as money for old rope. The EC was promoted as a huge marketplace with opportunities to be grasped. If we sit and bemoan our lot, we will deserve what we get, which will not be a lot.  The time has come for an imaginative approach, especially now that there are surpluses and where so many areas remain underdeveloped.  Many believe that afforestation should be inter-linked with land usage.  This is an area where we have potential.  There is the suitability of land.  We have about 3.5 million acres of wet mineral lowland soil which is particularly suited to forestry.  It has been proved scientifically that returns from forestry are better than from mainly dry stock <Col N="2266" /> enterprises by 28 per cent to 117 per cent depending on assumptions for price rises for timber.  The recent ACOT corporate plan clearly indicated that there was no financial return from a livestock enterprise unless it could be developed from one's own resources.</P>
    <P>The lack of income while forestry matures and the unfamiliarity with forestry techniques are still major deterrents.  There is need for support during the development period while the trees are growing and planting grants are not sufficient. There will have to be some type of payment similar to headage payments to provide an income over the years.  A very interesting article published recently states that in some European countries people depend entirely on forestry farming for a living.</P>
    <P>The biggest problem here is the securing of land reserves.  In my constituency there is a very large acreage of suitable land but only 587 acres have been reserved. This is completely inadequate for development, in spite of the great opportunities provided by the wet mineral land, especially in west Cavan.  We must be more positive in our approach.</P>
    <P>Some time ago I asked the Minister if his attention had been drawn to the UK method of private forestry and his views on whether this system would be effective in Ireland.  He replied that the incentives here were more attractive, yet private enterprise in the UK and the Six Counties has made a success of these undertakings. We had hoped that afforestation would have contributed greatly to the economy of the Border region through the creation of jobs.  However, most of the products of the forest are taken into County Fermanagh and come back in the form of log and pallet timber.  All we are gaining is a few jobs for men felling timber and hauling it to the roadway.  That is the extent of the contribution of that forest to our economy.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the area of health.  I am a member of a health board and it has been sad to witness the amount of time devoted during the past year to a slanging match with the Minister.  He chose to <Col N="2267" /> close a number of hospitals and put forward his views in a way which was almost guaranteed to generate opposition to his proposals.  The function of the health boards is to provide the best possible service for the public from the finances available.  A greater effort to achieve consensus should have been made.  The Minister wants to set up a good community health service.  That idea is acceptable to all of us but it must be achieved progressively and not through panic action. There were panic decisions during the year to close a number of hospitals.</P>
    <P>The report of the General Medical Services Board, published today, shows a staggering increase in costs of 10 per cent, in spite of the current low rate of inflation. During my 12 years as a member of a health board I have constantly criticised the increase in these costs.  The cost of medicines rose by 8 per cent in the past year and doctors fees rose by 12 per cent. After all the efforts that have been made in the health field, the consultation rate is increasing again, although it had levelled out in 1982-1983.  Another serious aspect is that the increase last year was accounted for by those in the 45-60 age group.</P>
    <P>I have raised questions here and with the health board regarding drug prices. The use of generic drugs can greatly reduce costs and in England the Minister has made an order that generic drugs of good quality should be used instead of branded drugs.  The health authorities in America have also demanded that generic drugs should be used.  I take a very serious view of this matter.</P>
    <P>The Minister has been harsh and uncaring in his attitude to the county I represent. A few years ago a letter from his secretary announced the closure of hospitals.  The people of Monaghan decided to contest the decision to close the maternity hospital and successfully brought their case to the Supreme Court. About two months ago the Minister came again to the constituency and tried once more to create that type of fear, with complete disregard for the decision of the highest court in the land.  He is a man <Col N="2268" /> who does not know when he is defeated and he wants to ensure that his decision will be imposed, irrespective of the wishes of the people and the efforts they have made to retain a service which they paid for years ago through the rates and will continue to maintain, regardless of the Minister's efforts.</P>
    <P>On the subject of housing, we welcome the increased grant aid for reconstruction but there is no point in announcing plans and schemes without the personnel to carry out inspections.  There is a scarcity of housing inspectors in our region. Despite having brought this matter to the attention of the House and the Minister, there is still a delay in inspections, leading to a delay in payment.  This, in turn, delays the payment of the loan subsidy to which people are entitled.</P>
    <P>A task force of Ministers of State was set up to consider the question of import substitution, of fruit and vegetable production and other matters but there does not appear to have been any feedback. We have heard nothing from that committee to indicate any improvement in what has been happening.  In the past month I asked a parliamentary question about the deliberations of that committee with regard to fruit and vegetable imports and it appears that imports have been reduced by only 1 per cent.</P>
    <P>In my constituency the footwear industry was a major employer for many years.  It operated in Cavan and Monaghan and the industry had been given assistance by successive Fianna Fáil Governments.  In October 1983 imports of footwear were worth £67.3 million but now the figure has risen to £95.5 million. Imports accounts for 93 per cent of the footwear bought by people in this country. Craftsmen working in the shoe trade are now in the dole queues or are looking for other jobs.  This whole problem should be examined by the Department. If the industry could adapt itself to new trends and designs work could be available.  In my constituency we had a number of tanneries that gave good employment but now our hides, which are of excellent quality, are being exported at an alarming rate.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2269" /> I have constantly commented on the lack of attention given to the Border region.  Three different reports have been carried out and the areas in need of help have been identified.  It has been generally accepted that the climate is right for cross-Border co-operation and it has been recommended in all the reports. An EC office in Belfast was established recently with Mr. Dennis Kennedy in charge.  I should like to quote from a report in the <i>Derry Journal</i> regarding EC aid.  It stated:</P>
    <P>At a special meeting of Derry City Council this week, councillors were told that grant aid from the EEC could only go so far in solving the unemployment problem here.  At the meeting, arranged for councillors to be advised on what grant aid was available.  Mr. Dennis Kennedy of the European Commission Office in Belfast, stressed that more money would be on the way if the British and Irish Governments could agree on cross-Border projects.</P>
    <P>Since 1981 the various reports identified the areas in need of help.  The Social and Economic Committee reported on the matter also and they identified the agricultural and industrial projects that should be set up in areas where there was sufficient goodwill to ensure the success of the undertakings.  However, we have now been told that agreement cannot be obtained with regard to cross-Border projects.  This is happening at a time when the Government tell us there is co-operation and when they talk about the agreement reached between Ireland and Britain.  However, it appears they cannot even agree on such basic matters as the projects.</P>
    <P>Cavan County Council appealed to the Taoiseach to ensure implementation of the report dealing with the Erne catchment drainage scheme.  He replied to them that the Government were reviewing the question of arterial drainage and he spoke about the availability of funds and so on, but at the end of the day nothing was done.  A few weeks ago the Minister for Foreign Affairs visited the <Col N="2270" /> constituency.  He explained what could be done but it is not being done.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Government at least to honour their commitments.  They must be positive in their approach.  It is no use talking about goodwill when they will not do anything to have the projects implemented.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. G. Birmingham) George Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. G. Birmingham)</NameTxt>
      <P>Government is about leadership, courage and vision, and this Government have shown that leadership, courage and vision.  They have shown it in the way they have approach the economy, in the approach to Northern Ireland and in their willingness to address different social questions.</P>
      <P>We have been in office for three and a half years and in that time the political agenda has been changed.  Three and a half years ago politics in this country reeked with the stench of corruption. Ministers of an Irish Government behaved with all the sensitivity of Interior Ministers in a South American banana republic, prepared to use the Garda force as their own personal fiefdom and prepared to treat decisions of the courts established under the Constitution as simply the first word to be reviewed at their leisure and for their own purposes.</P>
      <P>The real measure of the quality of this Government has been that those issues no longer surface.  The political integrity of the Government and of the system is taken for granted.  No longer does arrogance or failure to appreciate the essential distinction that exists between party interests, personal interests and the interests of the State hold sway to such an extent that, for example, State security and charges of anti-national behaviour could be used to justify the bugging of a free press.  What is of interest is that all of those things happened under a Government whose existence was precarious from the day they took office with the support of Deputy Gregory and The Workers' Party.  From that day there was a doubt about the length of their tenure in office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I raise these points not to open up old <Col N="2271" /> sores but because I think there may be lessons in it for the future.  Even the most dumb of crooks in this city know one does not commit offences when one is likely to be found out.  That Government behaved as they did in the full knowledge that at any time their term of office would end and their activities would be exposed to public scrutiny.  Now, if the opinion polls are to be believed, it is no longer inconceivable that that party opposite may secure an overall majority.  If in seven short months they were prepared to behave in such a way that they filled 396 pages in a best seller with their misdeeds, what will they do given four years with an overall majority and the expectation that they could obfuscate their misdeeds and bury the evidence during those four years?  Anyone who is concerned about civil liberties or about the wellbeing of the body politic has to think long and hard.</P>
    <P>I have said I believe the leadership this Government have provided is to be found in a number of areas.  It is to be found in our approach to the economy.  When this administration assumed office they found this State in the most difficult economic situation ever.  We found ourselves looking into the abyss of economic ruin while the rest of the world looked on and wondered if we were prepared to work ourselves out of this situation or if it would be a matter for the international receivers in the shape of the IMF.  Were we to go the way of other banana republics?</P>
    <P>The fact that we were in that situation was not the result of well intentioned policies knocked off course by international pressures.  We found ourselves in that awesome situation as a result of sheer unadulterated cowardice.  The remedy needed was known to all.  The then Taoiseach, now Leader of the Opposition, within days of assuming office, went on television to tell the country what was required and to offer a prescription. Having analysed the situation and having drawn himself to his full height, he then skulked away, afraid to face up to the issues.  Instead he sought to buy a lease on power with taxpayers' money, and <Col N="2272" /> not just the money of taxpayers of that generation but the money that is to come from the taxpayers of generations to come.  Industrial disputes were settled without regard to the cost or the merits of the dispute but with every regard to the political climate of the day.</P>
    <P>This Government have restored stability to finances.  There is confidence in this Government's economic projections and we are on the road back.  On other occasions I have put on record the comments of economists as independent and as distinguished as Dr. Whitaker on Fianna Fáil's performance on budgetary matters during those years.  He said it was an abuse of language to refer to Fianna Fáil budgetary projections, so little resemblance to reality did they bear, and what was expected to happen in the real world.</P>
    <P>The stock answer from Fianna Fáil is that balancing the books is cold comfort to those struggling to make ends meet, but what they do not seem to accept is that failure to have the books in order guarantees misery, high taxation and high unemployment for decades to come. That is something we are not prepared to inflict on people but we have been concerned about the plight of those who are struggling to make ends meet and we were determined in Government to assist those in need and to help those who can to help themselves.</P>
    <P>Under this Government the Dickensian wall that existed between the world at work and world of welfare has been breached.  Until this Government took office a pre-condition of receiving any support from the State was that one remained idle.  That cruel dilemma has been ended.  We have offered thousands of people through the enterprise allowance scheme &mdash; 12,000 at the last count &mdash; the opportunity to reject unemployment and to strike out for self-employment, enterprise and entrepreneurship.  Many of those projects which were set up in the early days, some of them in my own constituency, have already taken off to the extent that they are employing a number of people.</P>
    <P>The Government were concerned to identify those sections of the community <Col N="2273" /> which had previously been ignored and neglected &mdash; the low paid worker for example.  That particularly reflects the philosophy of my party.  Our concern is that those at work who are seeking to support their families should not be worse off under any circumstances than those who are not at work.  The family income supplement scheme was introduced to support the low paid and particularly the low paid with family responsibilities.</P>
    <P>The same sense of flair, style and imagination was to be found in our response to the housing problem.  When I entered politics seven years ago, every Saturday I could expect many people to come to me with housing problems for which there was no relief.  It was simply a question of standing and suffering in the housing queues.  We have been talking a great deal lately about marriage breakdown, but no step taken by an Irish Government in recent times has done more to support the family and to lift the unbearable pressures that were being put on so many marriages, than the efforts of this Government to address the housing problems, which they have done with remarkable success.  In part, this success was due to the £5,000 grant introduced by the Government which fulfilled two objectives. First, local authority tenants with aspirations to become home owners, something very dear to the Irish ethos, were given the opportunity to acquire their own homes.  Secondly, thousands of people were taken off the housing list and were offered a home from the local authority.</P>
    <P>With all the economic indicators coming right, are we to set at nought all that has been achieved?  Are we really prepared to spend ourselves out of a recovery as apparently is proposed by the Opposition?  At the Fianna Fáil Ard Fheis we heard a remarkable series of proposals running into hundreds of millions of pounds &mdash; something like £800 million on the specifics and other proposals which were so vague, so general and all embracing that it would be impossible to put a price on them.  This would involve £800 million of taxpayers' money for no particular purpose that one could identify.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2274" /> The recipe that failed in 1977 and in 1979 is all that is on offer.  We will not buy that.  We will not forfeit the sacrifices that have been made in recent years and tell the people they have suffered in vain. That road would be suicidal and would not hold many attractions for the Irish electorate.</P>
    <P>I mentioned at the outset three areas in which the courage and vision of this Government were to be seen &mdash; our approach to the economy, our approach to Northern Ireland and our approach to the social issues.  Perhaps no area shows the contrast between the Government and the Opposition more clearly than the area of Northern Ireland.  What role have the Opposition played?  At best they have been petty and carping and, at worst, to use their own much favoured phrase, their conduct has been anti-national.  In the days before Hillsborough when those long sensitive negotiations were coming to a head, Deputy Haughey was to be found addressing Fianna Fáil women's conferences warning them about the need for great viligance, warning them that the Irish people must not again have a treaty imposed on them or be asked to accept some dubious settlement entered into in response to the short term political needs of those involved.</P>
    <P>How shameful, how petty, how carping; but how much worse, how anti-national the behaviour of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition who travelled to the US in October last year to canvass opposition to the efforts of a democratically elected and sovereign Irish Government who were seeking to advance a solution to an historic problem?  Successive Irish Administrations have valued the support of the Irish-American community and in particular have valued the support forthcoming from the leaders of Irish-American political opinion.  Yet in October 1985 the Deputy Leader of Fianna Fáil, Deputy Lenihan, visited Washington to seek the backing of the influential Friends of Ireland group for the rejection of the Anglo-Irish Agreement which at that stage had not even been signed and the contents of which he and they were unaware of.  In doing so <Col N="2275" /> he sought to undermine an agreement that was then being negotiated in the interests of all Irish nationalists.  Only history can judge just how base that treachery was.  The only thing that can be said in mitigation is that apparently Deputy Lenihan was not taken too seriously, and that is not altogether unusual.  He was apparently sent off home with his tail between his legs.</P>
    <P>That shabbiness was to continue after the agreement was signed.  It was to be found in vilification of and pique at the SDLP in the debacle at the European Parliament when the Leader of the Fianna Fáil Party there outraged Ireland's friends in every one of the member states by that scurrilous and scandalous attack on the leader of the SDLP, John Hume.  However, John Hume's efforts for reform, his promotion of reconciliation, his striving for reunification will be remembered long after those mean, petty people will have been forgotten.</P>
    <P>What Opposition was it that was engaging in that process?  Let us recall the background to the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  Let us recall when that process began.  The process that led to the Anglo-Irish Agreement began six years ago when the now Leader of the Opposition, the Taoiseach of the day, met the British Prime Minister and issued a communiqué with her in which he declared that any change in the constitutional status of Northern Ireland would come about only with the consent of a majority of the people in Northern Ireland.  There was nothing new in that for some of us. That was the view which the Fine Gael Party had committed themselves to long before then, away back as far as September 1969.  The view that the then Government adopted in 1980 was the right one. Unfortunately, it was not a view, a road, to which they were going to stay attached for very long.  It is, of course, the road to which this Government and in particular the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Taoiseach remain attached, and it was they who displayed the openness and generosity of view, the patience and the sheer hard work which were necessary to <Col N="2276" /> bring about the Anglo-Irish Agreement. I do not need to say that exactly those qualities of patience, generosity and commitment are required now as the agreement is implemented.</P>
    <P>When in 1980 the present Leader of the Opposition agreed that unity would come about only with the consent of a majority of the people of Northern Ireland he accepted then the concept of consent but in Opposition he has found it politic to change.  In this House on 19 November he said, &ldquo;When we speak of the need to secure the agreement of the Unionist population that agreement applies to the new arrangements for, but not to the concept of, a united Ireland&rdquo;. What arrant nonsense.  What cheek. What impertinence.  In other words, he was saying to Unionist people, &ldquo;So long as you agree to a united Ireland we will hear your views afterwards on the arrangements for it&rdquo;.  That is no kind of consent.  If the Unionist people of this island ever give their free consent to a united Ireland they will do so on the basis of their appreciation of the nature and intentions of society in the South.  That society will have to have demonstrated to Unionists the sincerity of its intentions before people sit down around any table or are presented with any papers to sign. I say with real regret that nothing in the record of the Leader of the Opposition suggests that he is aware of that necessity, let alone capable of conveying it to Unionists.  The manner in which the Opposition have tacked backwards and forwards on Anglo-Irish relations and relations with the North since 1980 has been determined by the uncertain whims of opportunism and not by serious intent. Opportunities were available.  It was Deputy Haughey who seized the interest of the British Prime Minister, and he blew it.  He and Deputy Brian Lenihan between them blew it.  They put politics before results.  They were so concerned about the short term publicity opportunities that they were not prepared for the long road.</P>
    <P>What are Unionists to make of such a figure?  What are Unionists to make of a political leader in this House who will <Col N="2277" /> give no leadership in this?  What are they to make of his statement that they will be surprised &mdash; mark this &mdash; by his generosity when he has failed so completely to show generosity to a small minority in the South?  They are not impressed, and is it any wonder?</P>
    <P>This Government have secured by the agreement a framework which will work for the benefit of all the people of the North and of this island.  Progress has been made in the vital areas of security and relations between the security forces and the community, the administration of justice, the reform in civil rights in one area and another, special legislation for the greater protection of civil rights and economic rebuilding by assistance through the international fund the first sign of which was the contribution signed into law yesterday by President Reagan. We are not fudgers.  We are not easily pushed aside.  This Government will stick to their steady course and will bring results which the Irish people want and need so very badly.</P>
    <P>This tendency towards rushes of blood to the head, towards irresponsibility laced with a fair dash of xenophobia is to be found in other aspects of foreign policy.  It is to be found in the approach of the Opposition to our relations with the EC.  Notwithstanding the fact that we have been such a substantial net beneficiary since membership, the Opposition appear content to seek for some kind of second class citizenship on the other periphery.  Is it any wonder that the former leader of the party opposite, the former Deputy Lynch who led this country into the EC, should have found it necessary to express publicly his disappointment with that party when he spoke recently at a function of the Irish Council for the European Movement?  Nowhere has this mischievousness, this frankly mendacious approach been more obvious than in the approach taken to the Single European Act.  That Act represents no threat to this country.  It is not the major step towards European union that I, Ireland and a number of our fellow member states would like to see, but it represents a significant step forward.  But no, the <Col N="2278" /> benefits are not to be seen.  Instead we have the red herring that somehow our neutrality or our sovereignty is undermined. That is just not so.  Our concern about security aspects were met very fully during the negotiations.  The Single European Act provides for closer co-ordination of the political and economic aspects of security.  On the other hand, the military aspects of security are expressly left to be developed by member states that wish to do so within the Western European Union or within NATO.  Ireland is not a member of either.  So those conditions do not apply to us nor will we be bound by them.</P>
    <P>The term &ldquo;security&rdquo; has a connotation which is far wider than military questions. Questions relating to international security in general and European security in particular have always been central to European co-operation.  In the past discussions on security issues have not compromised our neutrality.  We participated fully in perhaps the most urgent question of the day, disarmament, when we attended the conference on security and co-operation in Europe.  We are now actively participating in the Stockholm conference on disarmament.  That wide concept of security, and not the much narrower one of military security, is quite clearly demonstrated in the preamble to the Single European Act in which it is spelt out that the commitment of all states is o the maintenance of international peace and security.  That phrase is taken from article 1 of the United Nations Charter and to suggest that the word &ldquo;security&rdquo; later on could have a different meaning is mendacious.</P>
    <P>This debate is taking place just a week after the referendum.  Again, the contrast of the approach between the Government and the Opposition is clear.  The Government saw a problem &mdash; and everyone accepts that there is a problem although we might disagree about its dimensions.  Some people suggest that 70,000 people are affected and others say only 30,000 or 50,000 are condemned to the misery of an unhappy marriage. However, we agreed that there was a problem and we considered how best to <Col N="2279" /> approach it.  We did it painstakingly and carefully, we sought a consensus and we set up an all-party committee to look into the problem.  We had long debates in both Houses, consulted the Churches and deliberated on it within the party rules. But then it was time for us to make up our minds.  We did so, and the Taoiseach chose to lead in this matter.  Any other action would have been a shameful abdication of leadership.  Of course, the cute ones will say that we would have been wiser to leave the issue until after the next election and the really cute ones will say &ldquo;Look at your man on the other side, the way he kept quiet and by saying nothing kept in with both sides&rdquo;.  How shameful, how miserable, how pathetic, how dishonest.  That course of action was never open to us because we believed that we should seek the deletion of the constitutional prohibition on divorce.  We took our courage in our hands and went to the people.</P>
    <P>I very much regret the fact that the referendum was defeated by a quite disparate coalition of many people who recognised the arguments for but felt that, on balance, social good would not be served by voting yes.  That was fine, but it included others for whom I have somewhat harsher words, whose enthusiasm for the sixth commandment and all that goes with it was not matched with any equal enthusiasm for the obligation to tell the truth.  Certainly, the religion I learned at school told me that a lie was always sinful, but that did not bother some of those who lobbied for a no vote.</P>
    <P>Fundamentally, it was a question of leadership and courage.  For the moment people have said no; we must live with the decision and make the best of it.  In the next session we will introduce reforms in the area of marriage, just as we will introduce reforms in the family law area to end the scandal of illegitimacy, which will free the thousands of children in institutions because of our unchristian prohibition on the adoption of legitimate children.  We shall also introduce reforms in regard to family poverty and we will <Col N="2280" /> not be deterred by the undoubted setback of last week's decision.</P>
    <P>Anyone who says that we would have been better off to leave difficult questions alone will find no sympathy from the Government or within Fine Gael.  The road of moral cowardice has no attractions for us.  In a year's time, perhaps longer, the electorate will be making a direct choice between the parties.  It will not be simply a question of expressing understandable frustrations with the Government.  They will be putting their money on the competing teams, especially on one or other of the competing captains.  When the choice is presented to them between leadership and stroking, between courage and cowardice, vision and the philosophy of &ldquo;the cute hoor&rdquo;, I have no doubt as to whom they will choose.  The people have enough confidence in themselves to respond to leadership which is and will be on offer in 15 months' time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with interest to the Minister of State, Deputy Birmingham, when he told us that the Government had courage in three specific areas &mdash; the economy, Northern Ireland and social issues.  Let us start with the economy. The main economic task of the Government on coming to office was that they would eradicate the current budget deficit in four years.  However, the budget deficit is now as high as ever and will reach 8 per cent in 1986.  So much for the courage of the Government in telling the people what they intended to do in relation to the budget deficit and then allowing it to increase every year.  I thought we might have heard why this was allowed to happen.  I know that the Minister for Foreign Affairs and his Minister of State are immune to the economic area and that was demonstrated by the last Coalition in 1973-77 when the Taoiseach, then Minister for Foreign Affairs, came into the House and praised the level of borrowing which was being indulged in by the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Ryan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1975, in the budget debate, it is clear from the contribution of the Taoiseach <Col N="2281" /> that borrowing was at its highest percentage since borrowing began.  I share the concern of the Minister of State in regard to the taxpayers of future generations having to shoulder the interest created by borrowing.  However, it is important to look at when and where that borrowing started on a grand scale.  It started in 1973 under a Coalition Government and rose to its highest percentage in 1975.  It continued unabated through 1977.</P>
    <P>It was interesting to note this morning that the Taoiseach did not refer to the level of borrowing since the Government came to office.  The national debt at the end of 1982 was £12 billion and it is now over £21 billion, £9 billion of an increase since the Government came to office.  We were not told those figures this morning. If we are discussing figures we should be told what is happening.  What the people of the country are interested in is the performance of the Government since they came into office, not what statements were made in the past.  I would have thought the Adjournment Debate was an opportunity for the Government to tell the House what they had been doing in case we had missed something. We are not being told about the level of borrowing, when it started, and the serious situation that has been created by the last Coalition and continued by this one who came into office on the promise that they would eradicate the current budget deficit altogether.</P>
    <P>The Minister also referred to the Anglo-Irish Agreement and was critical of the Leader of our party.  It is true that in 1980 the present Leader of our party raised the issue of the Six Counties between the British Government and the Irish Government to an international level.  The statement which he made here in November last, when the Anglo-Irish Agreement was signed, was a very positive contribution to the debate in this House.  Deputy Birmingham, the Minister of State, referred to the difference between Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael regarding the position in the Six Counties. He is quite right.  I can never see a situation where we on this side of the House would legitimise Partition or <Col N="2282" /> indeed support the guarantee to the Unionists, and the Leader of our party was quite right when he said they should have a say in any new arrangements in a unitary state.</P>
    <P>The other point he referred to was the European Act.  The only comment I have to make is that I would like to have seen that Act debated in this House before it was signed and I do not know why it was not done.</P>
    <P>The referendum on divorce was held last Thursday and the people made their decision.  Yet the Taoiseach came in here and devoted one-third of his speech to this, with all the serious problems we have.  He devoted two pages to unemployment, none to emigration.  He did give us some figures about the currency exchange rates.  He expressed concern about the level of borrowing but he did not give us the figures I have quoted here; he did not give the figures by which the national debt has increased since 1982 when this Government took office.  At the end of 1982 the national debt was £12.8 billion.  It was over £21 billion at the end of March.  The Taoiseach, as he has done on Adjournment Debates since he took office, told us about the economy turning, about the recession moving away.  But there is no evidence of that boom; there is no evidence outside of an improvement.  I wonder when and where we will see that evidence.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach referred to taxation.  He said:</P>
    <P>The Government's innovative tax measures of January will provide a further boost.  These measures were designed to relieve the PAYE sector, while protecting revenue through the retention tax on deposit interest and although the Government ran the risk of unpopularity by introducing this new tax, the very positive effect of the PAYE reliefs on take-home pay are now beginning to be noticed.</P>
    <P>The PAYE workers do not notice the positive effects.  As regards the suggestion that the retention tax on deposit interest will in some way protect revenue, I fail to understand that because, as I <Col N="2283" /> understand it, when that tax was announced there was a run on money out of the financial institutions; people were not prepared to invest, and those who had invested removed their money from the agencies because they did not want to find themselves paying this exorbitant tax which militates against the poorer people who normally would not be eligible to pay tax anyway.  I fail to understand how the Taoiseach can tell us that the retention tax will protect the revenue in some way.</P>
    <P>In my own constituency, right along the Border throughout Monaghan and Cavan, we have suffered as a result of the Government's economic policies.  Let us take petrol as an example.  In the years 1983-84, 57 filling stations closed along the Border.  In 1982, 81 million litres of petrol were sold in the Border counties; in 1984 that had dropped to 50 million litres, a drop of 30 million litres.  That is a direct result of the Government's economic policies.  In January 1983, their first month in office, the Government increased the price of petrol on two occasions. That had the effect of encouraging many people living along the Border areas to go across the Border for petrol with a great loss of revenue to this State &mdash; the loss of the tax and VAT on the petrol itself and that incurred because people took their families along to do their shopping in the Six Counties.  It became so attractive for people living in the Border areas that, after a few months, people who did not need petrol were going in busloads across the Border because they thought they would get better value there.  Apart from one or two items, by the time people travelled and changed their currency, the value was not as great as had been expected.</P>
    <P>Having increased the price of petrol and widened the gap between the price of petrol in the Republic of Ireland and in the Six Counties, the Government continued in that vein and this year they increased the price of petrol in the budget and retained the first major reduction in the price of petrol for the Government Exchequer, so aggravating the situation <Col N="2284" /> in the Border areas.  It was interesting to hear the Taoiseach say this morning: &ldquo;I was struck by the extent to which Heads of State and Government expressed concern that the recovery &mdash; led by the fall in oil prices &mdash; had not yet really taken off in their countries or in Europe as a whole&rdquo;.  If other Governments behaved in the same way as our Government behaved, the Taoiseach should not be surprised that there is no recovery visible because the Government retained what should have been rightly passed on to the consumer which would have stimulated the economy, reducing the price of petrol and reducing the cost of the services and transport, and this would have been well worthwhile.  Rather than that, the Government decided to retain this money for the Central Exchequer, as they have done on so many occasions since this session of the Dáil began.  We had an example of this last week in the Malicious Injuries Bill which has now been passed through the House.  It is purely a measure to add another £20 million to Exchequer funding.</P>
    <P>The Border areas, particularly the 12 western counties where the land is not so good as that in the Leas-Cheann Comhairle's constituency, but also the country generally has suffered from a severe fodder shortage.  After an extremely bad summer farmers found themselves in dire straits.  They realised that they would not have sufficient fodder to feed their animals during the winter months.  Their plight was highlighted in this House on numberous occasions by our spokesman on agriculture, Deputy Noonan, and by many other members of this party.  When the Government did move with food vouchers they did too little too late, using a very unsophisticated method of determining who was entitled to these vouchers.  It was proved towards the end of the winter months, when animals were dying in all parts of the western and northern counties, that many people who should have been entitled to this assistance did not receive it, mainly because of insufficient funding <Col N="2285" /> being allocated by Government for the scheme.</P>
    <P>The Government then went to Brussels to negotiate agricultural prices.  I quote the Taoiseach this morning:</P>
    <P>I am glad to say that there was full acceptance in the Presidency's Conclusions that adaptation of agricultural policy to changed circumstances is not just a matter for the Community, but is a problem to be faced by other countries...</P>
    <P>He goes on to say:</P>
    <P>Overall, the European Council's Conclusions on agricultural policy in the international context were satisfactory from this country's point of view.</P>
    <P>I do not know how any Taoiseach could say that.  Perhaps he could say nothing. We are the producers of mainly milk, cereal and beef.  We accept that the European Community has an oversupply of those products.  We make a very small contribution to that over supply &mdash; 5½ per cent of the total milk in Europe. Nevertheless, we, with our smaller herds of 15 to 30 cows fed mainly on grass and with a productivity half that of the European countries, have to pay the same penalties in terms of the super levy as big factory farms in Germany and the Netherlands.  They import cereal from the Far East.  Indeed, it is interesting that the amount of cereal in intervention is about the same as that imported into the European Community &mdash; 15 million tonnes.  The same applies to butter which is imported from New Zealand into the European Community.  Surely there is a major area there where the Government could have negotiated to protect the interests of the Irish farmers?  I would have expected the Government to do so and having failed to do that, I would not expect the Taoiseach to come into this House and say that the results were satisfactory from this country's point of view. Nobody in farming, or who sees farmers working or has to work among them would accept that.  This applies to farmers not only in the western counties but throughout Ireland.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2286" /> On the Anglo-Irish Agreement, I am disappointed that there has not been more progress in a number of areas.  The Minister of State said that there was progress in security, but I fail to see it.  We still have supergrass trials and still have the UDR running rampant through the Six Counties.  They are supposed to have a RUC officer with them, but there is no evidence of that.  They are still harassing the nationalist people of the Six Counties. We would have expected that to stop immediately on the signing of the agreement.</P>
    <P>On this side of the Border there has been an increased Garda presence since the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  One day there was a front page headline in <i>The Irish Press</i> to the effect that Garda overtime had been reduced and that the number of gardaí on the Border would be reduced considerably.  This was denied the following day by the Government. What is interesting is that during the 24 hours in which the newspaper carried the two different stories, landladies in the various towns in Monaghan who accommodated gardaí on temporary Border duty were told that the gardaí no longer needed that accommodation.  The gardaí had left and in the 24 hours the landladies received telephone calls that accommodation was needed again.  Obviously there was some change of thought there.</P>
    <P>Local authorities are suffering particularly badly under this Government, this year worse than any other year since the Coalition came into office.  One has only to look at the condition of the roads, main and county, to see the serious deficiency resulting from not having proper funding from Government.  The social employment scheme was taken up by a number of local authorities.  Unfortunately now, halfway through the year, no more people can be employed under that scheme, again because of insufficient funding.  That scheme was supported by the European Social Fund.  The Minister for Labour, in answer to a question from me last year, told me that two-thirds namely £20 million of approximately £30 million would come back to the Government by way of savings in social welfare <Col N="2287" /> payments and the amount of tax that would be collected.  If that scheme is supported by the European Social Fund and if the direct cost to the Exchequer is only one-third of what is allocated, surely the Government should be in a position to maintain that scheme until the end of the year?</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to the Malicious Injuries Bill and am concerned that should courthouses in Monaghan and such places be destroyed as a result of riot or the work of unlawful organisations the local authority will not be compensated in the same way as other bodies are compensated that may suffer damage to their property.  This is a serious discrimination against local authorities.  I regret that the Minister did not use the opportunity in that Bill to rectify that serious situation.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach this morning admitted that the Government found it necessary to curtail health services.  The Minister for Health has never really admitted that. He has told us that the level of service has been maintained.  The Taoiseach admitted here this morning that the Government did find it necessary to curtail the level of the health services.  The Government are responsible, of course, for health policy although the Minister for Health articulates the policy.  Indeed, he carries a responsibility as a member of the Cabinet.</P>
    <P>It is important to point out that the effects of the Government's health policy are the responsibility of the Government. It is not fair to lay all the blame on the Minister for Health because it is the Government's responsibility.  This was clear when on 30 January the Minister for Health announced to the House that the Government made a decision to close eight hospitals half way through the current year.  That decision was taken on the eve of the budget, presumably for budgetary reasons, without any reference to the need for these hospitals in terms of patient care.  That was not the criteria by which that decision was made.  No negotiations were held with the staff, the unions or the health boards concerned. <Col N="2288" /> It was an <i>ad hoc</i> decision.  The Minister for Health had to take the objections of the people even though it was a Government decision.</P>
    <P>That was only part of the Government's cutbacks.  Half way through the year we are now told that some of the hospitals which were to be closed will not be closed, that they will have a change of use.  This is causing serious concern.  The nearest hospital to us, Sir Patrick Dun's, which was to close in 1989 and to be moved to St. James Hospital, is now to close on 29 August 1986.  Again this is without proper consultation and negotiation.  Services are being taken away from them and transferred to St. James's Hospital without proper attention to the needs of the people in the area and without proper consultation with the staff, the unions and the Eastern Health Board.</P>
    <P>The cut-backs in hospitals are having very serious effects particularly where there is a highly specialised unit such as a heart surgery department or a kidney department.  Some hospital wards were closed last year.  We all accept what the Minister said, that wards close because they need to be painted and for maintenance. That is not what is happening. Wards are being closed for an inordinate length of time.  Some are open for a couple of months and are closed until the end of the year because there is insufficient funding available.  This is having disastrous consequences.  It increases the waiting list for out-patients and for admissions to hospital.</P>
    <P>This morning we were circulated with a report of the general medical services. We must all be concerned with escalating costs in the health service as in any other service.  Concern is being expressed at the increased number of times that patients visit their doctor.  It was announced in the report that in 1985, the year the report refers to, patients visited their doctors on more occasions than in any previous year since the general medical service was introduced.  The reasons for that are fairly obvious.  One reason is that if you cut back on hospital services, on out-patient services and on admissions to <Col N="2289" /> hospitals, somebody has to look after the patients.  The family doctors have to look after patients who would normally be seen earlier at the hospital out-patients department or who might be kept a day or two longer in hospital and who have now been discharged earlier.  Inevitably the visiting rate has to increase.  There is nothing extraordinary in that.  I cannot understand how Government Ministers can complain when it is a direct result of their action.</P>
    <P>Another reason which is obvious from the report, which shows that the visting rate increased for persons in the 40 to 60 age group, is the result of unemployment which comes from the Government's economic policies.  It is well recognised that there is more morbidity where there is unemployment.  This is something the Government are not conscious of.  They accept the structured unemployment that should be totally unacceptable.</P>
    <P>The drugs bill is expensive.  We referred to that on the Health Estimate two days ago and to the whole question of prescribing generics.  The Government have a role to play in that they must ensure good quality control so that doctors know exactly what they are prescribing. It is not enough for a doctor to write the base name of a product on the prescription. The doctor does not know exactly what product his patient will get.</P>
    <P>This morning the Taoiseach spent about one-third of this time speaking about the divorce referendum which has already been decided.  We would have liked to hear more about his plans for economic development in whatever few months are left to him.  He said that he is going to up-date the family law in a number of ways.  This is to be encouraged. One area that interests me is the area of nullity.  What is being said about up-dating the laws on nullity is something that was agreed by all the members of the all-party committee on health, including Government spokesmen.  We are now at the end of this session of the Dáil.  I ask the great democrats on the Government side to go to the people and have a real referendum in order to give the people an opportunity to change the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>If they did that it would be a bit premature.  I do not see any objective or anything that would prevent them from bringing in any legislation during the remainder of the term.  Even though there is a tight majority in theory, in practice it seems to be fairly comfortable in passing through legislation in the House.  As there is a very full programme remaining in the pipeline we should deliver that.  I do not see why we have to go out for a second mandate before that term is up.  I have been hearing that for the last four years by spokesmen on the other side of the House, particularly in the first, second and third years of the Government.  They should give up thinking along those lines.  If you are running a race with four laps and you have run three of them and still have plenty of energy left, you will try your best to win in the last lap.  I have no doubt that that is going to be the intention.</P>
      <P>There are a number of things I wish to talk about in the areas of justice, social legislation, education and career opportunities, Irish society, some of the legislation that has gone through and some that has yet to go through and the effects of some of the things we are doing which are both beneficial and damaging to our society, even though the intention is good.  There is an unfortunate element in the way legislation is put through the House, as was demonstrated last night when we passed the Lotteries Bill.  We used the House to pass legislation which has a clause in it enabling the Minister to make regulations under the legislation without having to come back to the House.  That is going away from democracy, and it is getting worse.  We have reached a stage when by resolution a Minister can reserve to himself the power to change Acts.  The Act has to conform to regulations, and not withstanding anything in the Act, if it conflicts with the regulation it is the regulation that holds. This proves that this House is merely a rubber stamp.  I am sick to death of Ministers coming in with legislation and they are prepared only to make cosmetic changes in words but not to accept amendments of any substance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2291" /> Most Bills never are discussed in detail in Committee.  Such Bills have not been discussed by the parties to decide whether the legislation is good or bad.  Whatever the nature of a Bill, it is taken for granted that it will be passed when we go into the lobbies.  As far as I am concerned, it is frightening.  I have been posing a question and I think I have the answer now about who is running the country.  We are not running it.  We have very little say on it. We are just here to put the stamp on legislation when we go through the lobbies.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed to see Ministers going along with that.  They often take the Bill that is handed to them and get the heads from their Department.  I doubt very much if the details of Bills are gone into properly, and we got an example of that last night.  It was noticeable that nobody seemed to know anything about it and Deputies on the Government side or in opposition did not seem to know what they were talking about.  Yet we were passing legislation which will be very damaging to society.</P>
    <P>We are doing that on a daily basis.  The same thing happened with the Gaming Bill.  It was rushed through as emergency legislation, without much thought being given to it, at the eleventh hour.  It increased stakes and payouts, and even though it has been stopped, the evil has been proved and we have not managed to bring in legislation to reverse the position.</P>
    <P>Recently we discussed the Estimates for the Department of Justice.  I was concerned very much at the effect the Department and the Garda have been having in the fight against crime during the past number of years.  Four years ago, when the Committee on Crime, Lawlessness and Vandalism were set up, we began by talking about the management of the Garda and criticising its inefficiency and saying we could do much more. I was immediately tagged as being antiGarda and Deputies got up here on their hind legs and swore fealty to the Garda Síochána and asked how dare anybody even question what they were doing.  The <Col N="2292" /> same thing happened when I criticised the IDA.</P>
    <P>At the beginning of the first meeting of the crime committee the Garda Commissioner came along and I asked him how he deployed members of the force.  He said he did not understand the Deputy's question.  The answer came to me last week on the &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo; programme on RTE.  I had said to the Commissioner that there were 11,400 members of the Garda and I asked what they did all day.  At that time I identified what I thought to be the main problem, that of management.  I suggested that there should be a more scientific system of management of the Garda.  I agree that the men and women in the Garda are very sincere about what they do; but we are in a different age, in a different society, with different problems to tackle, and they can only be tackled successfully in a modern scientific way.  That was shown up clearly in the &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo; programme.  Retired members of the Garda pointed that out.</P>
    <P>We have a real crisis in the force and it has all to do with management: the problem lies at the top, not the bottom. It is frightening to realise that few of the 11,400 men and women in the Garda do duty in the streets, combating crime, making allowances for the numbers on leave or on court duty at any given time. We have the highest number of police officers per head of population of most countries in the world.  We should be able to do a much better job.  I hope that the penny has dropped and that both the Minister and the Commissioner will realise the job they have to do and that they will set about changing management.</P>
    <P>A startling thing about the Garda is the few civilians employed.  I understand there are only a couple of hundred, whereas the proportion of civilians in other countries is very high.  If we increased the civilian complement in the Garda we could release many more for patrol duty.  Above all, we need an effective modern system of management which will have the respect and support <Col N="2293" /> of members, who will then have a higher morale.</P>
    <P>We should look at the adversarial system as opposed to the inquisitorial system.  The latter does not work very well here.  In criminal cases we rely too much on statements and when it goes wrong individual gardaí become scapegoats. That is because of our faulty system and it is grossly unfair to gardaí who are carrying out their jobs in a professional manner in accordance with the training they receive and their experience over the years.  I think particularly of two recent cases which showed up the faults in our system.</P>
    <P>We should also look at our judicial system, particularly the manner in which we appoint judges and others, having particular regard to their backgrounds and experience.</P>
    <P>We have managed to get a considerable lot of social legislation on the Statute Book in the past number of months.  We had a setback in regard to the divorce legislation, which I regarded as social legislation.  It was defeated, thankfully without the help of the Pope this time.  I do not intend to speak at any length about it except to say that we should recognise ourselves for what we are.  We have a tendency to think we are something other than what we are.  At least we now know what the attitude of the country is.  We should lead from in front, not from behind.  If there is one thing worse than narrowmindedness it is intolerance.  I hope we all have learned from recent experience and that we will start afresh and build and educate from our experience of the tragedy of marriage breakdown. It should be part of an education process in the coming years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Labour (Mr. Kenny)</NameTxt>
      <P>No distinction is made between full and part time workers in much of the legislation administered by my Department; for example, all occupational safety and health legislation, the Conditions of Employment Acts, 1936 to 1944, the Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Act, 1974, the Employment Equality Act, 1977, and the Payment of Wages Act, 1979.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is no doubt aware, provision was made in the Protection of Employees (Employers' Insolvency) Act, 1984, to reduce to 18 hours the threshold for qualification for the protection of the Unfair Dismissals Act, the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act and the Redundancy Payments Acts.  I intend to keep the position of part time workers under review with a view to considering what further improvements may be desirable and feasible.</P>

      <P>I am sure the Minister is aware that there are an estimated 54,000 people designated as being part time workers.  A very high proportion of these are women.  Would the Minister not agree that there is a need for them to be brought in under the Unfair Dismissals Act to ensure that they are not exploited, as many of them are at present?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is correct in his remark with regard to the number of workers.  Of the estimated 57,000 part time workers, 41,000 are females.  There is no distinction between part time and full time workers in the context of much of the legislation operated by the Department.  There would be difficulties in bringing all workers into the protection for all kinds of employment.  There would also be cost implications.  It will be kept under review to see if any further improvements are desirable or feasible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that <Col N="2295" /> the Minister of State has given a fairly good reply in regard to the existing position, but would he not accept that there has been a significant increase over the past nine years or so from around 39,000 part time workers to the present figure of 57,000?  A significant number of those are women.  Would he agree that there is a significant trend in the direction of part time work and that part of the attraction for employers is the fact they can escape from the effects of the unfair dismissals and minimum notice Acts by employing people for less than 18 hours a week? Would he not agree that the legislation should be amended to ensure they are covered?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is no doubt aware that ICTU, the Employment Equality Agency and women's organisations are urging that Ireland should support the proposals for the draft EC directive on voluntary part time work.  If an extension of all labour legislation to all workers, irrespective of the number of hours worked, were to be brought into operation, it would give rise to administrative costs and problems.  I accept that there is a trend towards part time work but the position will be kept under constant review to see if any improvements can be brought about.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. F. Fahey Mr. F. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Labour if he will give a progress report on the operation of the social guarantee scheme and the Teamwork scheme; and if he will outline his response to this week's Youth Employment Agency report on long term unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The Youth Employment Agency have responsibility for the implementation of the social guarantee.  The NMS, AnCO, CERT, ACOT and the Department of Education are co-operating with the agency in the delivery of <Col N="2296" /> the guarantee and local liaison units representatives of these bodies are operating out of the local offices of the NMS.</P>
      <P>The agency decided to concentrate initially on the 1984-85 school leaver cohort.  By the end of January 1986 some 650 young people had availed themselves of the opportunities available under the social guarantee and it is hoped to accommodate in the near future most of the remainder of those who have indicated an interest in participating.  Arrangements are now in train to identify and accommodate those from the 1985-86 cohort of school leavers who will be eligible for consideration under the social guarantee.</P>
      <P>There are 124 Teamwork projects in operation at present giving employment to 946 young persons and 118 supervisors. This scheme is designed to provide employment opportunities for young people on projects of benefit to their local communities.  The demands for assistance under the scheme are such at present that it has been decided to increase the 1986 allocation from £5 million to £7 million.</P>
      <P>The findings of the Youth Employment Agency survey confirm that those with low levels of education and training and those from deprived backgrounds are most likely to experience long term unemployment.  The findings underline the appropriateness of existing policy decisions such as the implementation of the social guarantee which is the responsibility of the Youth Employment Agency, the expansion of youth levy funded programmes participation from 22,500 in 1981 to nearly 50,000 at the end of 1985 and developments in the educational area such as the introduction of the vocational training and preparation programme which will play an important role in the implementation of the social guarantee.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>There have been serious funding shortfalls with regard to the social guarantee scheme and the Teamwork scheme.  How much money has been expended on the social guarantee scheme?  The Minister said 650 people were employed by the end of January <Col N="2297" /> 1986.  How many people are in the category who should be employed in view of the fact that last week's report stated that there were up to 20,000 young people long term unemployed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the numbers, first of all, under the social guarantee scheme the number of early school leavers notified by schools in October 1985 was 8,000.  Of that number the total number identified as eligible for participation within the category of the scheme was 6,400 or 80 per cent.  The total number who replied and were called for interview was 2,600.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. F. Fahey Mr. F. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister accept that, in view of the fact that the schools notified that 8,000 young people were eligible for this scheme and only 650 benefited, there is a very serious shortfall? According to the report of the YEA last week 20,000 have been unemployed for two years or more.  This scheme has been a massive failure in attempting to tackle the problem.  What scheme has he got to get those 20,000 young people off the unemployment register?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is well aware, there are a variety of schemes in operation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The YEA's proposals with regard to the social employment scheme were approved in February 1985.  They included as a priority school leavers at or before intermediate or group certificate level and other school leavers without qualifications and unemployed.  The scheme has only been in operation for a <Col N="2298" /> short time.  The Deputy can rest assured that it is being monitored very carefully. The fact that 2,600 responded to the call for interview speaks for itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. F. Fahey Mr. F. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>While the Teamwork scheme has been successful and has elicited a good response, my understanding is that the scheme has been almost completely brought to a halt because there is no money available to fund applications before the Department.  The information given is that 124 schemes are in operation but how many others have applied unsuccessfully for assistance?  Are there any proposals to increase funding in view of the popularity of the scheme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have the actual number of new applications since they are coming into the Department on a continuous basis.  The extra allocation of £2 million this year will be allocated according to the conditions of the scheme and on individual merit.  A very substantial amount of money could be allocated to Teamwork schemes in general but the situation is being closely monitored and I expect that the most meritorious schemes will be enabled to continue.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Statistics on the social employment scheme are currently compiled on the basis of National Manpower Service regions.  Details will be available on a county by county basis, as soon as the records of the scheme are fully computerised.</P>
      <P>Kildare forms part of the east region of the NMS which also comprises Counties Meath, Wicklow and Dublin.  There are 1,825 persons employed on 658 projects in the region at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The materials grant for projects under <Col N="2299" /> the social employment scheme is dependent on whether the sponsors of the project are in the public or the voluntary sector.  In the case of public body sponsors, a total of 53 per cent of the wages grant for the project may be available towards supervision and materials.  For voluntary body sponsors the materials grant amounts to a maximum of 15 per cent of the wages grant and a further 13 per cent is available towards supervision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>Would that have to be an exceptional case?  Is it possible that on-going schemes could be forced to <Col N="2300" /> discontinue due to lack of funding for materials?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume that the approval given for a public body sponsor would have to take into account the planning of the scheme.  If the scheme were to come to a halt, the option would be to apply for an extension which would involve further payments for materials and wages.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the principle of the scheme is to give employment?  We are drifting into the position where people might try to use any device under the scheme to get finance for materials and not for employment, which is the purpose of the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Ireland was approved for assistance totalling £192 million from the European Social Fund in 1985.  The amount actually received in 1985 was £141 million, consisting of £93 million in advance payments for 1985 operations and £48 million for operations carried out in previous years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For 1986 operations, Ireland has been approved for £170.8 million.  Receipts to date in 1986 amount to £89 million, consisting of £79.8 million in advance payments for 1986 operations and £9.2 million for operations carried out in previous years.  A further amount of £4.66 million in respect of advance of 1986 grants is expected imminently.  Finally, balances of payment claims relating to <Col N="2301" /> 1984 and 1985 operations, amounting to approximately £33 million, have been submitted to the European Commission. The extent to which these claims are paid in 1986 depends on the adoption of a supplementary budget by the Commission, which Ireland is strongly supporting.</P>
    <P>The reduction in the amount approved for this year compared with 1985 is due to the general Community budgetary situation, the effects of the accession of Spain and Portugal and an increase in the level of demands on the fund from other member states.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister explain the effects of the very severe reductions in 1986 and state the proposals the Government have to continue the level of services and courses that benefit from the fund?  Are the Department instructing various organisations to cut their services?</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>What does the Minister mean by the word &ldquo;broadly&rdquo;?  Already there is widespread concern in a number of agencies and talk about cutbacks in various areas.  Bodies who care for the handicapped benefit greatly from the fund and are extremely concerned.  There are also cutbacks affecting trainees and apprentices.  There is concern about the funds paid to trainees in the 15-18 age group.  What proposals have the Government to deal with this position?</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The levels of approvals and receipts in any year do not necessarily tally since 50 per cent of grants approved is paid in the year of operation and the balances are not paid until following years.  While we have been notified of a balance of £4.66 million to be paid shortly, we may also receive payment this year in respect of 1984 and 1985 <Col N="2302" /> operations.  A £33 million claim is involved which depends on a supplementary budget, which Ireland is strongly supporting, being passed by the EC.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister confirming that the reason we are surviving on broadly the same level is that we have outstanding balances approved for previous years and that in 1987 there will be a massive cutback for AnCO and other voluntary agencies because of the cutback in the ESF?  Is it the position that we are living this year on balances due from previous years?</P>

Of that amount, £79.776 million has been received already and the balance is expected shortly.

      <P>As I have indicated in reply to various Dáil questions on this matter, the question of declaring 1 May as a public holiday continues to be under active consideration by my Department. That consideration takes into account all relevant factors, including those outlined in this question.

With regard to the Deputy's comment about our position <i>vis-ávis</i> the EC, Ireland ranks at the bottom of the list in terms of the number of public holidays.  We are one of a minority of EC countries where May Day is not a public holiday.  For instance, Belgium has ten public holidays, of which 1 May is a public holiday; Denmark has 11; France has ten; Germany has nine; Greece has 15; Ireland has eight; Italy has ten; Luxembourg has ten; The Netherlands has ten; Portugal has 12 as has Spain; the UK has eight holidays, including the first Monday in May.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Labour if he will enter into early discussions with the former staff of Lemons Sweets in relation to salaries, wages and other entitlements which they lost owing to the closure in 1983 and which are not covered by the Protection of Employees (Employers Insolvency) Act, 1984.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>As I explained in a reply to a previous question by the Deputy &mdash; No. 21 of 3 December 1985 &mdash; certain outstanding entitlements of employees are protected under the Protection of Employees (Employers' Insolvency) Act, 1984, if the insolvency of the employer occurs on or after 22 October 1983.  However, as the company concerned, Lemon and Company Limited was put into receivership on 5 September <Col N="2305" /> 1983, it must be deemed to have become insolvent from that date.  Accordingly, as the date of insolvency was prior to 22 October 1983, I explained that it was not possible to consider applications for payments under the Act to former employees of the company.  As there is no other basis on which payments of outstanding entitlements could be made to the former employees, I regret that I would not see any useful purpose in entering into discussions on the lines suggested.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Protection of Employees (Employers' Insolvency) Act was going through this House a few companies were outside the limit and this side of the House made the argument that they should be given some consideration afterwards.  The fund has more than sufficient resources and the Minister could give some consideration to helping those affected.  Only four or five companies are involved and the money involved would be small so far as the fund is concerned, although it would be large for the individuals concerned.  I ask the Minister at least to look at the matter.  The Department have failed to do so.  About 90 per cent of the people in this case who lost their jobs because of the closure of Lemons Sweets are still unemployed.  The Minister could amend the Bill to cater for some of the companies who were outside the limit at the time.  Such an amendment would get through this House in five minutes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is quite right in that the only method of making payments would be to amend the 1984 Act. As the Deputy is aware, that Act implements EC Insolvency Directive No. 80987 which stipulated the cut-off date as 22 October 1983.  The only method would be to amend that Act but I think it would raise false hopes if a meeting were to take place on that basis.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The situation regarding the implementation of the social guarantee in west Cork is that 84 persons were identified as being early schoolleavers and were contacted.  Eventually, provision had to be made for 55 persons who were still unemployed and were available.  Of these, the National Manpower Service placed three on their work experience programme, one on another special programme, and six in full or part time employment.</P>
      <P>Of the 45 young persons remaining, the actual number is likely to be considerably lower as many of that number will already have found employment, or will have returned to full time education, or will be unavailable for placement for a variety of reasons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ideally, these young persons should be accommodated on suitable training programmes such as a community training workshop, an AnCO skills foundation programme or a suitable vocational preparation and training programme in a local school.  The agencies concerned are <Col N="2312" /> exploring how they can be accommodated as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>I would point out that this is the first year of national implementation of the social guarantee and that the brief of the YEA is to phase it in over a five-year period.  It is only to be expected that some problems would emerge which would require attention and action in future years &mdash; this includes the better matching of sufficient places to meet demand. Overall, on the basis of the information I have received, I am pleased with the progress to date of the implementation of the social guarantee.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that this scheme applies to the most disadvantaged young people in the country, young people leaving school without any qualifications?  This is another example of this uncaring Government's attitude to disadvantaged young people.  In west Cork 49 places were identified, the National Manpower Service informed local people that 45 places would be allocated and on 29 May they decided that they had no money to allocate and they scrapped the 45 places.  Will the Minister of State give an assurance that those unfortunate young people will be granted places under that scheme?</P>

AnCO are being asked to make a special effort in that regard.  They replied to the effect that they were unable to find the resources to provide the places required in the locations of Bantry and Clonakilty, but AnCO have provided social guarantee places in east Cork and in Kerry.  ACOT and CERT seem to have made no contribution in that context.  Far from waffling around, I assure Deputy Walsh that AnCO are being asked to make a special effort to secure additional places in west Cork.</P>

      <Col N="2314" />&mdash;Employment Equality (Amendment) Bill</P>

      <P>I think I got that answer last year.  I know that one of those Bills has been published; and another one in draft form, which the Minister of State did not mention, gives AnCO powers in relation to external training contracts. Whoever prepared the brief is not up to date.  Those two Bills are published.  Will the Minister of State tell the House when the other Bills will be published?  In regard to some of the Bills he mentioned I got the same answer in 1984 and 1985, although that is not his fault.  What is the real position?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The conditions of the social employment scheme specify that participants may be normally employed on the scheme for a maximum period of one year.  The Deputy will appreciate the need to give an opportunity to the <Col N="2315" /> greatest possible number of persons to obtain employment on the scheme, and that it would be unfair to allow some persons to continue on a project beyond this period while others in the locality were anxious to participate but unable to do so.  However, where in particular areas the workforce available is adequate, the National Manpower Service will consider the re-employment of eligible persons who have completed a year on the scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Since I tabled this question a group on a project have been notified of its termination.  I am concerned to ensure, where work is in progress on a scheme, that work will be continued even by taking in other employees on that project.  I am concerned about the continuation of the work rather than the continuation of the individuals on the job.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">

      <P>I would like the Minister of State to repeat the last part of his answer because I missed it.  If employees are doing well on a scheme and their skills cannot be replaced easily, is the intention to allow a 12 months' extension of the scheme for those employees?</P>

      <P>The Department of Finance decision with regard to the 12 months' period of employment for participants under the scheme was appealed <Col N="2316" /> on 17 June of this year and the Department have given approval for a percentage rollover to cater for cases such as either the Deputy refers to in terms of skills or because of an inadequate number available for the workforce. He is aware that since the changes with regard to unemployment assistance rates were introduced any applicant is eligible for the scheme irrespective of the length of time the applicant is drawing unemployment assistance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. F. Fahey Mr. F. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Labour if he will give details of the number of temporary youth employment or training schemes at present in progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two temporary employment schemes available to young people &mdash; the Teamwork scheme operated by the National Manpower Service and the Environmental Works (Special Projects) Scheme operated by the Department of the Environment.  There are 124 Teamwork projects in operation at present providing employment to a total of 946 young workers and 118 supervisors. Sixty-two young people are currently engaged on the environmental works scheme.  This scheme is being phased out.</P>
      <P>In addition, under the work experience programme young people are placed with employers for up to 26 weeks to gain experience of the world of work and some knowledge of the skills necessary to help them secure employment.  There were 2,000 young people participating in this programme at the end of May 1986.</P>
      <P>The following is a breakdown of the training programmes available to young persons which are funded wholly or partly from the proceeds of the youth employment levy:</P>
      <P>AnCO</P>
      <P>&mdash;Specific employable skills courses</P>
      <P>&mdash;apprenticeship training</P>
      <P>&mdash;enterprise training</P>
      <P>&mdash;community workshops</P>
      <P>&mdash;travellers workshops.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2317" /> There are 12,321 young people in training on these AnCO courses at present.</P>
    <P>CERT provide training for young people in two areas:</P>
    <P>&mdash;Training for the unemployed</P>
    <P>&mdash;School based training.</P>
    <P>At the end of May 1986 there were 375 young people attending CERT training courses for the unemployed and 1,072 young people in receipt of school based training.</P>
    <P>The ACOT Certificate in Farming Programme is partly funded from the youth employment levy.  At the end of March 1986 there were 3,247 young farmers on this programme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. F. Fahey Mr. F. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that £300 million has been contributed by the taxpayer in the 1 per cent youth employment levy since the imposition of the levy, much more of this money should be spent on the creation of sustainable economic jobs.  Let me put it to the Minister of State that, while the temporary schemes within their narrow confines are desirable, what has been happening in his Department is that all of the expenditure is now being used on temporary employment schemes and much of the money is being used on training schemes which heretofore were financed from the central Exchequer?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I have given the details which the Deputy requested in regard to the number of temporary youth employment and training schemes.  We would like to see all jobs sustainable and economically viable but the value of these temporary courses and training programmes speaks for itself in terms of permanent employment which young people often get afterwards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. F. Fahey Mr. F. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>Recently the Department said that 45,000 young people are on training or temporary work schemes but the Minister's figures indicate that fewer people are availing of these courses.  Does the Minister agree <Col N="2318" /> that there are far too many people on temporary employment or training schemes and that there is too little emphasis by his Department on the funding of sustainable jobs?  Can the Minister give any indication that there will be a change in policy in regard to waste of money in this regard?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not consider that the money is wasted on training schemes. The figures to which I referred relate to the Teamwork scheme and the environmental works special project scheme about which the Deputy inquired.  A change of policy is a matter for the Government and, naturally, constant reviews are carried out by the Department concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. J. Leonard Mr. J. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Looking at these schemes with hindsight, it was a great pity that a set percentage &mdash; say 20 per cent &mdash; was not used towards creating sustainable or permanent jobs.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>AnCO run courses in timber harvesting and the next such course is due to start in Ballinrobe in September next.</P>
      <P>AnCO are also considering whether it would be appropriate for them to become involved in the training of people intending to become involved in other aspects of private afforestation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. J. Leonard Mr. J. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that, because of the scarcity of forestry stock, there is a great opportunity for development in this area which would be a positive approach towards developing the timber industry?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, tree felling is listed as an appropriate activity under the construction designation of AnCO and the next course will be run in Ballinrobe. These courses are run in conjunction with the Department of Tourism, Fisheries and Forestry who supply instructors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. J. Leonard Mr. J. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it is a good idea to have courses on tree felling at present because there is a scarcity of trees.  Recently, people in a group water scheme wished to have a shelter belt of a few hundred trees and they had to go outside the country for them.  As trees are so scarce I ask the Minister, in conjunction with AnCO, to examine the possibility of running courses for people who are interested in private afforestation but who are unable to make any progress at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">

    <P>17.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Labour if four weeks or more annual holidays have become the norm in most employments; if he intends to amend the Holidays (Employees) Act, 1973, to provide a minimum of four weeks' annual <Col N="2320" /> holidays to all employees; and, if so, when.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the first and second national understandings of 1979 and 1980, provision was made for the negotiation of annual leave entitlements of up to 19 days.  Such entitlements would have been negotiated in most employments and in some cases additional entitlements would have been negotiated more recently.  In view of this, four weeks' annual leave would be fairly widespread in employment at the moment.</P>
      <P>When the review of the Act takes place, the question of increasing the statutory minimum entitlement will, of course, be considered.  I had hoped to have such a review completed early in 1986, but this has not been feasible given the resources available to my Department for legislative work and the priority I am giving to more substantive legislation relating to areas such as occupational safety, offshore oil, employment equality and worker participation.  I propose that the review of the Holidays (Employees) Act, 1973, should now be undertaken when work is completed on some of the legislative items at present on hands.  I hope the review can be commenced before the end of the present year.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have information on whether surveys have been carried out in relation to this matter.  Most State employees are excluded from the provisions of the Act because, generally, they have more liberal entitlements.  From staff officer up to secretary, the range is from 21 to 31 days per year and from clerical officers downwards to cleaners, the range is from 18 to 19 days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it the Government are standing over the commitment <Col N="2321" /> given in the national understanding of the late seventies that 20 days will be the norm when the Act is reviewed?  Lower paid people are not getting 20 days leave; they usually work in sectors of industry which are non-unionised and they deserve 20 days.  The fact that the Act will not be reviewed in the life of this Dáil is taking a week's holiday from the people who deserve it most.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Labour if it is his intention to make employers' liability insurance compulsory so as to avoid the situation where workers do not receive compensation due to the fact that certain employers are inadequately insured for employers' liability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no immediate plans for legislation relating to employers' liability insurance or other matters relating to compensation for injury at work.  Currently I am having legislation drafted which is based on the main recommendations of the Barrington Commission of Inquiry on Safety, Health and Welfare <Col N="2322" /> at Work relating to the prevention of occupational accidents and diseases in all workplaces.  I intend to introduce this legislation in the Oireachtas this year. Existing legislation in the preventive area is clearly inadequate in many respects and I am, therefore, tackling that problem as a matter of priority.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the many problems that exist for both workers and employers in relation to employers' liability insurance cover and compensation matters.  The Barrington commission, as well as other bodies, examined the problem and, while recommending limited short term changes in the existing system, recognised that the long term solution of the problem should be studied further.  As I already informed the Oireachtas, the issues involved are complex and will need to be examined thoroughly by the relevant Departments of State, and by all the other interests concerned before legislative initiatives in this area can be brought forward.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I noticed last week that some of the employer bodies entered into a public debate on this matter, when the ICTU conference was taking place.  Am I to take it that the talks are not proceeding at the rate the Minister would wish or that the FUE are not talking to ICTU? Perhaps the Minister would give some details on the talks.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The talks are ongoing on the basis of a discussion document that was prepared and circulated initially.  Following the reactions to that discussion document a definite set of proposals was published earlier this year to which there was an initial mixed response, positive to certain aspects and not so positive to other aspects &mdash; that is the kind of reaction one would expect to get to any set of proposals.  These proposals have been circulated and are in the public domain. Discussions have taken place with both sides to clarify, to the satisfaction of both ICTU and the FUE, what our intentions are and the impact the various components of the proposals will have.  Those discussions are ongoing and different <Col N="2324" /> views have been expressed by people on both sides &mdash; trade union members, employer groups and such people as, for example, the President of the Institute of Personnel Management.

      <P>If we complete our discussions in the next few weeks we will be in a position to meet our timetable.  There is obviously a certain degree of reluctance on both sides for fear of the consequences of change.  I have consistently said that the community at large will be better served by a reform of the industrial trade disputes system because our trade disputes law is out of date and delays that arise in setting industrial disputes because of this are unsatisfactory.  We have an obligation to try to reform them.  My view is that the institutions ultimately have to be made to work by the people who participate in them.  So, I am anxious to get as much agreement as is possible from both social partners with regard to the changes I hope to bring before the Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>The draft heads of the Bill have been cleared by Government.  I have established, with the agreement of the Government, an interim board which represents both employers and workers on a nominated basis and individual civil servants from various Departments with an independent chairperson.  The total number is 11.  They are looking at the draft legislation and are being consulted about its final from before it is brought to the House in the autumn.  Work is in progress and I am confident that early in the next autumn session we will be in a position to bring the legislation forward. When we do so it will have gone through the normal governmental process of consultation at departmental level where employers' concerns, such as the one the Deputy mentioned, will be addressed and the nominees of the FUE on the interim board will have been able to look at the proposals.  I am confident that this Act, which will be a framework Act, will have <Col N="2326" /> had ample and constructive consideration in consultations with the relevant bodies who have the right to have their say in relation to it.</P>

In that context factors such as PRSI, taxation, protective legislation, insurance, unfair dismissals of one kind or another and all the other worker protection items were taken not exclusively but in the context of all of the factors that would be considered by an employer in deciding whether he or she would take on an extra person.  That is broadly what the study was about and it was conducted at our request by the ESRI.  It is virtually complete and I would prefer to issue it in its entirety.

      <P>asked the Minister for Labour if the Government have any proposals to make in the area of manpower agencies, in the light of the conclusions published in <i>The Young Long Term Unemployed</i> by the Youth Employment Agency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The findings of the Youth Employment Agency survey confirm that those with low levels of education and training and those from deprived backgrounds are more likely to experience long term unemployment.  The findings underline the appropriateness of existing policy decisions such as the implementation of the social guarantee which is the responsibility of the Youth Employment Agency, the expansion of youth levy funded programmes participation from 22,500 in 1981 to nearly 50,000 at the end of 1985 and developments in the educational area such as the introduction of the vocational training and preparation programme which will play an important role in the implementation of the social guarantee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All the manpower agencies together <Col N="2328" /> with the Department of Education are co-operating with the agency in the implementation of the social guarantee both at national and local level.</P>
    <P>The Departments of Labour and Education with responsibility for the co-ordination of training and education activities vested in the Minister of State are actively considering what additional steps can be taken to assist those likely to fall into the long term unemployed category because of their leaving school early and without any qualifications.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume the Minister is as shocked as anybody else at the number of people who are now in the category of long term unemployment. Apart from the social guarantee fund schemes, has the Minister or his Department any recommendations or even thoughts at this stage on what can be done to improve the position, apart from all the courses we have at present?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not shocked by the large numbers of people on long term unemployment; frankly I am appalled and have been from the time I became Minister for Labour.  I am appalled at the numbers not just in this country but throughout the European Community where there are in the region of six million to seven million people who have been unemployed for more than a year and in some cases for more than three years.  The tragedy is that in all probability those people will not be able to avail of any upturn in the economy such as was indicated by the Taoiseach in his speech this morning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All the evidence that we have had to date indicates that when the economy starts to grow in any country&mdash;and it is beginning to do so now in this country&mdash; it is people who have only been out of the employed labour force for a short period of time who get first chance to be taken back into employment.  If somebody has been off the pitch and, indeed, out of the stadium for an extended period of time, he or she just does not have time to get back into employment.  It was for that reason that we introduced the social <Col N="2329" /> employment scheme which now, as the Deputy knows, is targeted specifically at the long term unemployed.  There are now nearly 11,000 people employed on that programme.</P>
    <P>We have introduced a series of measures in relation to the enterprise allowance scheme, targeted in part at the long term unemployed but not exclusively. We are looking at other measures to try to see if we can get the long term unemployed back into the work pattern and work method, either by a system of training or by a system of temporary employment. That is not to suggest in any way that they are an alternative to full time and paid employment but as a necessary re-introduction into the paid labour force.  The last scheme we introduced in that area is run by AnCO.  That is known as the alternance programme, in which there are 2,500 people involved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Minister to review the way expenditure is used in the various agencies to take account of the long term unemployed.  Many of the schemes originally were based on people under 25 years of age.  I know that the European Social Fund had restrictions on that.  Is the Minister arguing in Europe to try to use the resources we are spending to help the long term unemployed, as they are obviously the most needy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department, which have a very good record&mdash;and I say that with respect to the civil servants who have been extremely good agents of the State in relation to this matter&mdash;have at all times the operation of the Social Fund in Europe under review and the way in which the labour market is changing, and the composition of unemployment is altering relative to age and duration.  We do so with the knowledge that any changes that take place will affect the fund not just for Ireland but for all the other states as well.  I know there were questions on this subject on the Order Paper earlier on.  We do so conscious of the fact that it is our obligation and task to maximise the amount of money Ireland will get from that fund.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>For 1986, Ireland has been approved for £170.8 million from the European Social Fund.  At this stage last year we had been approved for £187 million and supplementary grants of £5 million were approved towards the end of 1985.  The reduction in 1986 is due to a number of factors&mdash;the general EC budgetary situation which has affected the size of the ESF budget; the accession of Spain and Portugal and increased demands on the ESF from other member states.</P>
      <P>The position for 1987 and thereafter is difficult to forecast as it depends largely on the ESF budgetary situation which depends, in turn, on the position relating to the general Community budget.  In the view of the Irish Government, the budgetary problems will be eased only if agreement is reached on the raising of the 12.4 per cent VAT ceiling which provides the Communities' own resources.  Ireland is pressing to have the ceiling raised from 1.4 per cent to 1.6 per cent.  If this change can be introduced from 1988, it would provide a significant increase in Community revenue which would ease the pressure on the ESF.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Adjournment I was speaking on the area of justice and <Col N="2388" /> social welfare.  Due to a lack of time during the recent debate on the Estimate for the Department of Defence I was unable to flesh out my contribution, which was to question the role of the Army.  I only succeeded in attracting towards myself a lot of criticism.  I tried to stimulate thought on the political responsibilities of the Dáil regarding the role of the Defence Forces and I should like to continue along those lines.  To an outsider it would appear that this question has not been examined in detail for some time.  The Defence Forces have evolved based on needs of the War of Independence and the Civil War.  Today the State is attempting to maintain, on a miniature scale, a traditionally organised military force which parallels those of much larger and richer states such as the UK, France and Germany.  What purpose such a force is to serve is not very clear, especially in light of our policy on military neutrality.</P>
      <P>There do not appear to be any recognisable experts on defence policy in the Dáil, at least, none that I can think of. The apparent lack of interest on defence matters may be due to two commonly held assumptions about the Defence Forces; that they must be maintained in their current traditional form to combat terrorism and that they only consume 1.5 per cent or £252 million of the GNP, which is acceptable to us.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State at the Department of Defence recently described the activities of the Army during the last year during his explanation of the budget estimates for the year.  It is apparent from reviewing the activities he chose to explain that the Government see the primary role of the Defence Forces as containing terrorism.</P>
      <P>There are 11,000 parties for Border duties, 9,500 checkpoints, 15,000 patrols, 900 escorts for transporting explosives and blasting operations, 4,500 escorts for transporting cash and 150 bomb disposal team requests.  It is extraordinary that we accept these statistics without questioning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is remarkable that a force of only <Col N="2389" /> 16,000 members, 750 of whom are serving overseas with the UN, could provide 11,000 parties for the Border, man 9,500 checkpoints and send out 15,000 patrols in the year.  It should also be noted that all the functions listed by the Minister are properly police and not military functions in other countries, such as France or Spain.  If the primary role of the Defence Forces is to contain terrorism, are unarmed jet trainers, artillery batteries and tanks essential to succeeding in such a role?  If not, why do we have them?  Was their purchase reviewed by the Dáil?  I never get an opportunity to consider them.</P>
    <P>While it is true that the Defence Forces consume only 1.5 per cent of the GNP and 70 per cent of their expenditure goes toward pay and allowances, this sum of £252 million represents 36 per cent of the interest we pay on the foreign debt which amounts to £700 million.  Surely these questions merit serious discussion here.</P>
    <P>The role or mission the military are to play must be clearly defined in order for the military to procure material and establish manning levels to accomplish that mission.  The determination of the role they are to accomplish is a political decision.  Only after the political decisions have been taken should the military establishment, the Department of Defence, be asked how they would go about implementing these decisions. They should tell us what specific equipment is needed, what manning levels are needed and what skills are required to operate and maintain the equipment.  The failure of politicians properly to define the role of the military will result in unstructured growth, perhaps in support of totally unrealistic roles or missions.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, military establishments tend to maintain a momentum of their own, procuring some specific items of equipment such as tanks or unarmed jet trainers simply because their professional pride demands them.  Everyone else has them so we must have them too.  The critical question to be considered is what purposes do the Defence Forces serve in 1986?  Have these purposes been determined by the Dáil or are they rooted in the <Col N="2390" /> historical events of 1919-23?  Could these purposes be achieved by an alternative force under the Department of Justice for considerably less than the £252 million per annum that we spend?  Some functions the military are expected to perform at present include defending the neutrality of the State in the event of another war, combating terrorism and providing fishery protection.</P>
    <P>I would like to put forward four conclusions I have come to in this regard for the consideration of the House.  First, we will never have sufficient resources to prevent any State from occupying Ireland should they wish to do so.  Why do we maintain an Army for this purpose if the outcome is inevitable?  We should have very serious moral qualms about asking 16,000 soldiers to die for their country for no purpose.  Secondly, our existing needs for defence against terrorism and for fishery protection can be achieved much more efficiently and cost effectively by abolishing the Department of Defence and creating in their place a force of gendarmes and a coast guard.  These quasi-military organisations would come under the purview of the Department of Justice.  As an example, Costa Rica did this in 1948.  It has been very successful even though they also face very active terrorist threats both internally and from adjacent states.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, all military establishments have a voracious appetite for new equipment. We would do much better to concentrate our efforts on essential goals which are both attainable and affordable instead of squandering very limited resources.  Fourthly, abolishing the Department of Defence would give us immense moral standing internationally. Our total rejection of the use of military force as a legitimate means to achieve national goals would give tremendous reinforcement to our voice as a neutral nation, lending great credibility to our criticism of those who abuse their power.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to recommend that a committee be formed to examine the role of the Defence Forces and determine if that is the politically desired role. If any productive result is to be obtained from this examination it is essential that <Col N="2391" /> this question be addressed with an absolutely open mind.  Every mission must be justified entirely on its own merits.  Trite expressions and the fact that everyone else does it should not suffice.  The committee should examine all the budgets for the Department of Defence simultaneously, most especially the 30 per cent or £76 million concerned with procurement. They should also address the ratio of civil servants in the Department of Defence to military personnel which, as far as I can gather, is about one to every 18 soldiers.  I mentioned this before but did not get a great welcome from the people who have high regard for the Army and Army personnel.  It was nothing personal on my part.  I was just looking at it as I think all Departments should be looked at from time to time.  I thought it necessary to do that research in order to place it on the record in the hope that it would be considered.</P>
    <P>I participated in and read the Estimate debates on the Department of Defence over the past few years.  It is embarrassing to read them when we consider the contributions from spokespersons on Defence as well as from the Minister.  We have an Army occupying 27 buildings around the country with huge staff and personnel gobbling up money which we cannot afford.  I do not like armies because soldiers can get killed.  That should not be a long term objective.  I hope it will be maturely picked up at some time in the future.</P>
    <P>At a time like this I am tempted to review two things.  The first is our society and where we are going.  I would like to have time to talk about job creation and emigration, to remind us of how awful it is to have high unemployment.  I would also like to have time to talk about the environment.  Obviously I will not be able to talk about any of them in detail.  I am very disheartened that the gaming problem has not been sorted out.  We brought in a Bill recently to increase the stakes in gaming.  I am also disheartened that the National Lottery Bill has been brought in.  It will encourage gambling. It is a tax on the poor.  We will not find <Col N="2392" /> this out for a few years.  Other countries have got out of that situation.</P>
    <P>If anything is worth doing, it is worth taxing people for it.  It it is not worth taxing people for, it is not worth doing. The lethal combination of gaming, lotteries, gambling and drinking and the young population we have in this country will have a devastating effect.  This Government are encouraging that.  I know their intentions are good but that is the way it will work out.  I feel very badly being a part of that.  I have tried to show my objection to it during the course of the debates.  When we have a situation such as that, we should not be surprised that we have marriage breakdown, battered wives and a need for divorce legislation which we tried to put through last week. Last week's result will enable us to see us as we are and not as we think we are. We still believe that this country is better than other countries.</P>
    <P>Irish society has a tendency to sweep things under the carpet and not to face up to them.  People live in a cloud.  The valley of the squinting windows has been replaced by something equally as sinister, as narrow-minded and as intolerant as that.  Yet the great thing in society is sex. That is all we worry about.  We face the 21st century, albeit not depending as much on cling as we used to.  We managed to pass legislation on contraceptives because we did not have to have it passed by referendum.  At least there are enough mature people to see the social need for that in our society.</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Environment made a good start in trying to tackle environmental problems.  The Minister of State at the Department of Finance with responsibility for the Office of Public Works recently launched a policy programme for the Phoenix Park.  The Phoenix Park was set up for the people of Dublin.  It is being eroded by giving pieces of it over to buildings.  The memorial park already has a school; a new school is proposed for it; and a highway runs through it.  At a cost of an extra £5 million an unnecessary highway has been laid through the long meadows part of the memorial park which was once part of <Col N="2393" /> the Phoenix Park.  There are too many buildings in the park.  Lodges were allowed in the park as a way of getting around the Act which prevented buildings in it.  The President, the American Ambassador and the Nunciature take up one-third of the Phoenix Park, about 400 acres.  That is a disgrace.  Those grounds should be opened up to the people of Dublin.</P>
    <P>The four-lane highway that was supposed to go past St. Patrick's Cathedral, and the enabling Bill that was supposed to be introduced, have been held up, but they should give us room for thought. The new streets were to cost £10 million, and I do not know how much the highway would have cost, but I suggest that money should be put into job creation, giving a great boost to the capital city.  I said before that the city is like a doughnut with an awful hole in the middle.  That hole could be turned into the jewel of Dublin.  We could do that by investing in the city's infrastructure, but that is not being taken up though we are prepared to spend something like £20 million cosmetically to beautify the city at a cost of 4,000 or 5,000 new jobs.</P>
    <P>It is disgraceful that we are allowing emigration to solve the unemployment problem.  It does not solve any problem but it takes the cream of our youth out of the country once again because we are not creating the necessary jobs.  I have put forward schemes of job creation linked with the rebuilding of Dublin and other centres throughout the country, but they have fallen on deaf ears.  I am sorry to see the plight of middle aged professionals throughout the country having to skimp and try to contain large overdrafts in order to survive in their professions as engineers, architects and designers.  They were all employed in the construction industry but they cannot get going even though we provide money through CTT. Any pleas we make fall on deaf ears because the Government and those in the top echelons in the Civil Service do not have the perspicacity or the wit to see ways to help them.</P>

      <P>Anyone looking for a measure of the economic performance of the Government need look no further than the publication this week of the Exchequer Returns for the first half of 1986.  They make grim and appalling reading and underline the continuing pauperisation of the country by uncontrollable Government spending.  They are the most forceful indictment of the Government's failure to rescue the economy from the pernicious recession which is sapping employment and the incentive to work or to invest in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Six months after the collapse of world oil prices and long after the fall in the value of the dollar, and with the continuation of falling international interest rates, the economy still shows no sign of improvement and the imbalance of public finances appears to be worsening.  As recently as May, inflation here was running at 4½ per cent annually, much higher than in most other European countries and most of the countries with which we trade.  As a result, living standards here at best have been static and the retail sales index for the first quarter of the year <Col N="2395" /> continues the standstill of the previous nine months.  Awaiting the consumer boom is now akin to listening for the first cuckoo and I expect the Minister for Finance to write to the newspapers when he finally sights it.</P>
    <P>Meanwhile, Government finances are continuing to deteriorate as Government spending makes a mockery of budget targets. Already, more than three-quarters of the current budget estimate for this year has been spent and current dayto-day spending by the Government has risen in the first half of the year by 7 per cent in real terms, nearly twice the rate of inflation.  With the excuse of rising interest rates and unfavourable exchange rates no longer available to the Government as a defence for not achieving greater progress with expenditure control, how can the Coalition explain the massive increase in spending that occurred in the first half of this year?  What hopes are there of moving in the general direction of reducing the budget deficit without even more increases in the crippling level of taxation?  All in all, it is a sad and a sorry mess.</P>
    <P>The public should not imagine for a moment that a realistic alternative policy is available from the main Opposition party.  Against the background of the ever worsening of public finances in the past six months, one of the most nauseating feature of events in this House in recent times has been the weekly demands by Fianna Fáil for millions and millions more to be poured into nearly every area of State activity.  On top of their Ard Fheis promises of more than £800 million extra in State expenditure, we have witnessed a power lust fuelled by the irresponsible notion that, if you continue to throw borrowed millions at the nation's problems, they will somehow go away.</P>
    <P>Let the public be warned about such a cynically irresponsible alternative.  Let us all remember that since 1980 successive Irish Governments have borrowed £16 billion.  Yet in the same period, unemployment has risen from 91,000 to 232,000.  The policies of high public <Col N="2396" /> spending, high taxation, high debt and appallingly high unemployment simply have not worked and must be reversed.</P>
    <P>All the longer established political parties have pursued these policies of high expenditure and high tax in the belief that such policies would yield additional employment for those out of work and higher living standards for those in work.  In reality, the growth in public spending and taxation has been accompanied not only by rising public service debt but by rising unemployment.  Keynesian type demand augmenting policies simply cannot work in small open economies because the initial impetus is lost through the balance of payments while the excess demand generated by Government overspending crowds out the productive private sector through losses in competitiveness and high interest rates. Present policies, therefore, have failed to deliver.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats are offering a wholly different approach based on releasing the creative and productive potential that has been suppressed in the Irish economy through a combination of high taxes, excessive bureaucracy and the crowding out of the private sector.  The established political parties have concentrated almost exclusively on pumping up the level of domestic demand, on Keynesian type demand management policies, but the Progressive Democrats are looking to the supply side, seeking to bring dormant factors of production out of retirement to produce output and to add value.  Lower income tax encourages potential workers to participate in the orthodox economy, to work overtime and to accept promotion.  Lower taxes on capital invested in industry attract cash into productive employment and away from sterile speculation, reducing the size of the State's crowding out the private sector and giving the latter more room in which to flourish.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats favour improving the Irish market mechanism by eliminating barriers on the supply side, whereas the long established political <Col N="2397" /> parties continue to concentrate on an outmoded demand oriented approach to the economy.</P>
    <P>The dreadful social and economic problems which result from this approach will not be solved either by the ideological irreconcilables who sit on the Coalition benches or the Santa Claus politicians in Opposition who believe that a country dangerously addicted to excessive public spending can be cured by one more lethal fix of foreign borrowing.  The ability to curb excessive public spending has not been achieved because, it seems to me, the Government have been overcome by some sort of paralysis which suggests to them that, even though they recognise in a vague way that the position is very serious, there is simply nothing that can be done about it.</P>
    <P>While short term flexibility may be limited in certain areas, for example, in debt servicing, this does not mean that spending is not discretionary for a government. Even in the case of debt servicing, lower levels of borrowing by the State to finance lower levels of public spending automatically take the pressure off domestic money markets which, in turn, lowers domestic interest rates which, in turn, reduces the cost of debt service on domestic borrowings.</P>
    <P>The most significant breakthrough in this area would be the introduction of zero based budgeting in annual departmental Estimate consideration.  At present, departmental budgets are indexed up on the level negotiated for the previous year.  Departments should be made to justify their annual expenditure plans, not by reference to what happened last year, but from a zero base. Nothing should be taken for granted. Making departmental spending plans explicit in this way will provide great scope for discretionary cuts.  The real problem is that public spending operates with a ratchet effect; it goes up but it cannot come down.  An excellent example is provided in the present year when the downward revision of the inflation rate for the year as a whole from 4½ per cent of 2½ per cent to 3 per cent produced a response from the public service and, <Col N="2398" /> accordingly, from the Government that the consequent savings on £7,000 million of current public spending will be approximately £10 million.</P>
    <P>The problems of this economy will only be solved by renewing economic growth. In order to do that, positive policy changes need to be made.  The most recent performance, as reflected in the Exchequer returns, starkly underlines the fact that an improved external environment alone is not sufficient to revive economic activity here.  That will require more than anything else the establishment of incentives to workers and producers and the rolling back of much of the bureaucratic red tape and regulations which have strangled the vitality of Irish enterprise.  The first step in that direction must be a radical simplification of the income tax structure to remove the diabolical situation where the return from work spent on tax avoidance is greater than the return from additional productive work.</P>
    <P>That is why the radical proposals of the Progressive Democrats to reduce income tax over four years to a standard rate of 25 per cent and to abolish PRSI, which is a pernicious surtax of nearly 20 per cent on work in an economy with record unemployment, have captured so much popular acclaim.  It is interesting to notice that in the United States over the past month a set of taxation proposals, not unlike that which I enunciated some months ago, has been passed by the Senate and passed in a somewhat different form by the House of Representatives. At present, legislative work is being undertaken in the Congress to try to amend both Bills to bring them together so that they can be expressed in one Bill which would be common to and passed by both Houses.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to find that, even in the United States, it was thought essential by an overwhelming majority of the members of both Houses of Congress to simplify the tax structure, to lower the tax rates dramatically and to do away with many of what are called the deductibles which are a traditional part of the taxation regime.  The proposal which has <Col N="2399" /> now being agreed to by a substantial majority in the Senate is to have two rates of income tax, one at 15 per cent and the other at 27 per cent.  We should all look with some interest on what is happening in the United States and what the developments will continue to be.  Perhaps the most successful economy in the world feels it necessary to change in that direction. I ask this House: why should one of the least successful economies in the world, which we represent, not do something along those lines?  Why should we condemn ourselves, as we do for all time, apparently, to a belief that we must retain the crippling system we have at present?</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats are the only party with a realistic programme to tackle the present debilitating economic malaise and the dreadful social problems which flow from it.  The barrenness of positive proposals from either the Coalition or Fianna Fáil was starkly revealed in the panicky, ill-considered and blundering response from them to our radical taxation and economic proposals as enunciated at our first national conference in May.  Are we to take it that none of the political parties other than the Progressive Democrats sees that drastically reducing the burden of taxation is an essential step to rescue our society from the abyss of economic despair?  In turn, this is the key to tackling the rampant black economy and getting rid of a 20 per cent surtax on employment at a time of such scandalous high unemployment.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats are offering the Irish people the only practical alternative to our present dire economic problems.  It is a workable alternative, provided that the country and political parties have the political will to implement it.  Let me make it clear that our alternative is no magic formula.  It is not full of pleasant problem-free solutions.  It will involve getting rid of many of our present tax breaks and deductibles.  It will involve significant reductions in overall public expenditure and a merciless onslaught on the black economy and the tax avoidance industry which is so totally demoralising to the PAYE sector.  We in <Col N="2400" /> the Progressive Democrats are committed to a simplified taxation system, easy to administer, easy to police and to comply with; a taxation system which is fair and not penal on the compliant; a rolling back of the State apparatus to a level consistent with the country's ability to pay for it from its own and not from borrowed resources, a drastic revision of the universality of much of our welfare services and their concentration on the needy in our society.  We are committed to raising the efficiency of the public service through contracting out some appropriate activities to the private sector by establishing a competitive environment in the State enterprise sector and by undertaking only those capital projects which are productive or infrastructural.</P>
    <P>I want to say a few brief words on the situation which exists in Údarás na Gaeltachta.  I was no admirer of Údarás na Gaeltachta's predecessor.  I was often very critical of them.  Because of the change which has been wrought in recent years within Údarás, it is right that something should be said in their support and in an effort to assist them in their present difficulties.  In view of the urgent need to create employment, it is extraordinary that the Government should choose to stifle the successful work of Údarás na Gaeltachta by deliberately withholding grant payments from projects which have already been formally approved.  At a time when the IDA, through no fault of their own, are recording few successes in new industrial developments, it is heartening to see the Údarás succeed in attracting projects to the remoter areas where they have responsibility.</P>
    <P>I understand that up to £2 million in grants due for payment in 1985 have not yet issued and that projects involving 875 permanent jobs requiring grant payment of £9 million have been approved since 1 January this year but cannot be paid because the grant money is withheld by the Government.  This is a serious action on the part of the Government and will affect our credibility as a nation.  What is the point of a new National Development Corporation if we already have viable projects for which the Government are <Col N="2401" /> refusing to pay grant aid?  It is interesting that when savings have to take place because of financial constraints it is payment to companies such as this or to others in the productive sector which is withheld.  I can think of vast areas of State expenditure where it would not be remotely contemplated that those due certain sums would not get them.  It is always outside the public sector that such payments are traditionally withheld.</P>
    <P>Last Monday our national newspapers carried an interesting contrast between efficiency on the one hand and ideology on the other hand.  Guinness Peat Aviation announced the purchase of 181 Boeing aircraft.  On the very same day a number of trade unions objected strongly to a study by a Dublin firm of economic consultants on the replacement of the Aer Lingus fleet.  The trade unions sought assurances from Labour Ministers in the Government that the study of the fleet replacement programme would not lead to any private financing of the airline. This kind of pressure has been exercised in the past and if successful it would lead to the financing of the fleet replacement programme, estimated in the Green Paper on Transport to cost £700 million, being borne in its entirety by the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>As the leader of a party committed strongly to lower expenditure and therefore to lower taxes, I support the initiative of the Minister for Communications in commissioning the study.  The leasing option should certainly be considered, given its popularity with airlines worldwide. The option of financing the fleet replacement, in part at least, by counter trading should also be fully considered since it is used successfully by many countries but unhappily not used at all in this country.  The private sector finance option should equally be considered because the expertise of the lending institutions would be brought to bear on the programme and its cost effectiveness would be appraised.</P>
    <P>In this regard we should remember that the private airline Ryanair has recently halved the Dublin-London air fare with a capital employed of £2 million, or less <Col N="2402" /> than one-third of 1 per cent of the £700 million which the Aer Lingus fleet replacement is estimated by the Government to cost.  The possibility that people who get free capital will use it less economically than those who have to pay for their capital should be part of this proposed study.</P>
    <P>For most of the last two years I was the only Deputy in Dáil Éireann to oppose the Air Transport Bill and to make the case that market forces should, within limits, be allowed to begin to operate in aviation into and out of this country.  I have been happy to make a few converts, including the Minister for Communications. The success of the Ryanair service to London and the imminence of further competition in Europe generally because of the work of the Commissioner for Competition Policy, Mr. Peter Sutherland, are further signals of the way ahead. In this new environment old attitudes and operations must go.  This includes the traditional way of financing airline fleets. This aviation development coincides with a popular preference for lower taxes.  In order to reduce taxes, Governments must look at functions which they will have to shed.  Good aviation and good public finance in this case coincide.  Ideology must not be allowed to determine the vitally important fleet replacement programme.</P>
    <P>I was interested in the Taoiseach's reference this morning to his suggestions to the meeting of EC Heads of Government that the Commission should now introduce proposals on the subject of market access which would offer possibilities for all Community airlines to operate new services.  He said this should be considered at the same time as the Commission's proposals to liberalise air fares and capacity sharing arrangements.  Whether the Taoiseach realises it or not, this Aer Lingus suggestion that they have totally changed their attitude of recent years and that they are now in favour of the liberalisation of air transport &mdash; since, as I forecast, it has come upon them anyway &mdash; is rather illusory.  In suggesting that there should be total market access and full fifth freedom rights throughout <Col N="2403" /> Europe, Aer Lingus and the Government are fairly safe because they know perfectly well that it will never be taken up and is quite unrealistic.</P>
    <P>We should not be seeking something which is impossible and unattainable, using the opportunity to get into a sulk when it is not attained, but rather we should be encouraging access to routes over which we do have control and allowing competition to be gradually introduced there.  What has happened on the Dublin-London route in only six weeks has been quite spectacular and I do not think Irish aviation will ever be the same again as a result.  The tourism, industrial and commercial sectors of our economy will benefit enormously.  What is now happening is the direct opposite of the policy contained in the air transport legislation which was passed some months ago and is now entirely redundant.</P>
    <P>Of the many things that are happening in this country, the most significant one can see each day is the queue of young Irish citizens outside the American Embassy.  Those people are voting with their feet just as assuredly as those of us who go through the lobbies of this Chamber.  The vote that is taking place outside the American Embassy every day they are open is the most significant vote of all.  Those people are voting to leave an economy that is not allowed to work and to move into an economy that is encouraged to work and that works.  My final appeal to this House is for us to get down to the basics that are necessary to allow this economy to work.  We must stop tying ourselves in knots.  We must stop paralysing ourselves by persuading ourselves we can never get out of our difficulties.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughCoveney" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate is primarily an opportunity to comment about the economy, although not exclusively.  I should like to talk about some of the matters Deputy O'Malley mentioned but I think we have a slightly different perspective, although not very different, on some of those events.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not assert nor do I believe that <Col N="2404" /> this economy is really on the move and, to that extent, I am as concerned as he is to ensure that it begins to roll sooner rather than later.  Until it does we will not solve the greatest political, economic and social issue that confronts us, namely, the unemployment problem. Nevertheless there has to be a lead-in time.  We have been through a very difficult recession.  We had and still have a great fiscal difficulties but there is a favourable set of indicators which should ensure that the only question is not whether the economy will recover but when it will recover.  Incidentally, I do not claim that all the favourable indicators are the result of Government action but rather are due to international affairs, although I accept that some of the indicators are due to what the Government have done.</P>
    <P>First, the inflation rate will be of the order of 3 per cent this year and we have not had such an inflation rate since 1966, a long time ago.  It is churlish to keep saying that if we have an inflation rate of 3 per cent Germany probably has a rate of 1½ per cent and, therefore, we are twice as bad.  However, we have to consider what has happened with regard to inflation in the past five years and by any standards what has happened here represents dramatic progress.  Of course, we must keep on with the job.  We must do better and we must get in line with our main competitor trading nations.</P>
    <P>There has been a dramatic improvement with regard to our balance of payments. This year it is expected to be of the order of 1-2 per cent of our GNP. That must be contrasted with the rate of 15 per cent in 1981.  Interest rates are falling, although not quickly enough.  I accept that the Government are only one factor in this but all their resources and thought should be concentrated on taking the necessary measures to push down those rates.  That is a necessary prerequisite to get the private sector to have the confidence to borrow more to invest and to create jobs.  At the moment the difference between bank interest rates and inflation is not acceptable.  The drop in the mortgage rate has been of benefit to <Col N="2405" /> many families.  In 1982 the mortgage rate was 16.25 per cent and today it is around 10 per cent.  I hope that within days or weeks it will be under that figure and that has not happened for 13 years.</P>
    <P>There has been a drop in oil prices and in the dollar and obviously they are part of the reason for some of these developments. That presents us with opportunities. In making selective cuts in VAT, the Government have provided a stimulus to tourism and other service industries and there should be an improvement in job creation and a growth and expansion in those industries.  Real growth in the economy in 1986 is expected to be about 2½ per cent, the highest real growth rate since 1980.</P>
    <P>I mention all these things because their net effect will provide for the first time an increase in the spending power of people.  In this connection I am talking about people in work: I shall talk about people who are out of work later. Because of all the factors I have mentioned, people will have more money in their pockets and this will give a powerful stimulus to the domestic economy, and not before time.  I hope all these factors will ensure the commencement of a pattern of growth that will begin to impact on the serious social problem of unemployment. That will start to happen in the latter half of this year, although I accept it will be a long haul.</P>
    <P>There are four problems facing us in the economic area: first, there is unemployment; secondly, taxation; thirdly, public expenditure and, fourthly, borrowing and debt.  The one ingredient all of those have in common is that they are too high.  It goes without saying that unemployment is too high and taxation also is undoubtedly too high.  In consequence, public expenditure is too high in relation to our ability to pay for it, although I accept it is not too high in other respects and, finally, borrowing and the cost of borrowing are too high.  This week the current budget deficit figures were disappointing.  While there will be an improvement as a result of the increased stimulus to the economy, public finances and the current budget <Col N="2406" /> deficit continue to be intractable and difficult problems that must be solved.</P>
    <P>One of the theories widely expressed in this country is that you either get public finances in order or you create growth in employment and that the two are mutually exclusive.  I am happy to note that view is not accepted everywhere else. Getting the public finances under control and having a growth in employment are not mutually exclusive positions in another small European country, Denmark. In that country unemployment has fallen by 18 per cent in the past 12 months, at a time when the Government there were facing and tackling problems in the public finances, problems that were very similar to our own.  We should not get bogged down in the argument of either going for growth and jobs or, alternatively, trying to solve the financial problems of the country.  In my opinion that is not a tenable position and is a fruitless and time wasting argument.</P>
    <P>It is true that if our financial position were better and if we could afford to borrow more, in certain circumstances that would help job creation, but borrowing can also contribute to job losses.  That may seem a strange comment, but I would like to explain why.  One of the biggest problems facing the private sector is the question of interest rates.  Interest rates are affected dramatically by the level of domestic borrowing by the Government.  If the Government were to borrow several hundred million pounds on the Dublin money market tomorrow to invest in job creation, interest rates would soar and that would have a more serious affect on job creation and growth than any good those several hundred million pounds might do in the short term.  If the Government were to consider further foreign borrowing there is the currency risk to be taken into account and finding the taxes to pay for it.</P>
    <P>We should begin to realise that we must deal with both matters together. This Government have been trying to do that but they need to do it with greater urgency, skill and belief.  If another small country similar in many respects to ourselves, in a huge market, with powerful <Col N="2407" /> neighbours, can reduce unemployment by 18 per cent and at the same time bring its finances under control, I believe there is a message of hope there.  I do not believe we have to look outside this country for all the solutions, but it would be foolish not to recognise that other countries have faced similar problems and had the will and ability to deal with them.  We must do the same.</P>
    <P>I want to stress that I do not believe the Government can ever be, or ever have been, the primary or main creator of jobs.  The public sector has a very important role to play, but the main job of the Government, as I see it, is to create the climate for the expansion of the economy, mainly by the private sector, by people taking risks, investing their money to make profit, to expand their businesses and to create jobs.  This Government, and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Bruton, in particular, have been addressing themselves to matters within limited fiscal constraints and they have been trying to create that climate in the private sector.</P>
    <P>Employment and economic growth are synonymous.  Economic growth in itself will not solve the crushing level of unemployment which we have, but without economic growth of a very high order the prospects of making any dent on the figures are gloomy.  We need to address ourselves to what we should be doing to stimulate economic growth.  Manufacturing industry is the hub around which economic growth can develop because service industries spin off manufacturing industry and it can then snowball.</P>
    <P>This means we must first talk about manufacturing industries.  There are three sectors involved.  First, there is foreign industry which in the sixties and seventies was the primary engine of growth in our economy and was a huge success.  It changed the face of Ireland from a rural lower income economy to an industrial country with all the aspirations which that leads people to have, some of which have been satisfied but others have not.  This success should not be downgraded or denigrated for some idiotic <Col N="2408" /> ideological reasons which I hear in my city and elsewhere when people speak about foreign multinationals.  Those companies were the backbone of our industrial growth in the sixties and seventies, and they continue to play a significant role in the future of our economy.  I want it to go out loud and clear from this House that these companies are welcome here and I support the efforts of the IDA to convince international companies against enormous competition that they are welcome in this country, that this is a country where they will find a spirit of enterprise, a fine, young, well trained labour force who want to work and that they can make a profit here.  We need more of these companies.</P>
    <P>Second, there are the indigenous larger industries which need careful stimulation. The Government's industrial policy has given some attention to identifying the prime larger indigenous industries which could be targeted for expansion, marketing growth and so on.  Flagships like Waterford Glass and companies of that size and eminence still have enormous potential for growth and development. Third, the new concept of growth and the creation of a large number of jobs rests very heavily on the development of small businesses.  In the United States and elsewhere it has been shown that the largest growth in job creation has come from that sector.  This Government, and the Minister, Deputy Bruton, in particular, have been extremely active in attempting to create a climate for enterprise, the development of risk taking and the establishment of small businesses with a view to creating good sound businesses and providing good employment, but there are problems.</P>
    <P>We are not traditionally an industrial country.  Our industrial growth has been artificially stimulated by the State but very often people's attitudes have not kept pace with that.  I do not believe we always have the right attitude to enterprise or that we have a welcoming attitude for a person who is successful, who is motivated by the need to get on and make a profit, but there is a certain stigma on failure here.  We have to get over <Col N="2409" /> these attitudes because they are impeding progress.</P>
    <P>Let me give an example of what I mean.  In a number of the States in America which have been successful in creating new jobs through small businesses, for every three new small businesses created, two others went broke.  Nobody spoke about the companies which went broke; they spoke about the successes.  Many of those new companies were formed by people who had experienced business failure and learned from it.  There is no stigma on failure in the United States, but there is here.  In Ireland there is too much emphasis on one's child becoming a civil servant, a banker or whatever. People are discouraged from getting into business because, perhaps, an uncle went broke and the same might happen to the nephew.  Then the family would be ruined, not financially, but there would be the shame of somebody in the family whose business went bust.  We need to change our attitude to failure and success. We should welcome success, and we should be tolerant of failure and encourage people to try again.  Many of them will have learned a lesson which they can usefully apply to successful endeavour and successful businesses.</P>
    <P>Another not so small issue in that area is the tragedy of so many young people leaving school too soon.  Very often they are seriously misled, perhaps by parents &mdash;hardly by teachers.  There is a cliché about the poverty trap and, unfortunately, a feature of parents who themselves were not given the opportunity of a better education is that sometimes they do not realise the importance of that for their children.  I can think of nothing worse than a 15 year old, reasonably intelligent schoolgirl or schoolboy leaving school on the basis of picking up a temporary job rather than remaining there and getting the kind of education without which jobs in future will be difficult if not impossible to get.  We should have a much more positive policy of convincing parents, the whole education system and people in school that it is imperative as a <Col N="2410" /> minimum to complete second level education in order to qualify for the best opportunity of employment.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley spoke about the taxation proposals of the Progressive Democrats Party.  It would be true to say that nobody in this House on any side would not be delighted to offer to our people the prospect of a 25 per cent tax rate. However, I was disappointed &mdash; and I have a high opinion of Deputy O'Malley, as he knows &mdash; that he dodged the issue of how to produce the reduction in public expenditure necessary to do what he was talking about.  That has been a failure of politicians in this country certainly for a decade.  I know that he mentioned zero budgeting, which certainly would be helpful.  But if anyone thinks that changing the system of budgeting will produce the £800 million which I understand his tax proposals would require &mdash; by reductions in public expenditure or some of it could be taken up in growth &mdash; let me say that it is not credible for somebody of his eminence and experience to continue to talk about this magical income tax formula without addressing the simple question of how to deal with public expenditure in the light of that proposal.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to a very interesting speech by Tomás Ó Cofaigh of the Central Bank last Monday in which he addressed this issue.  He said that nowhere is there to be detected a willingness to say that the necessary reductions in public expenditure should start and where they should start.  He said that, if rhetoric could solve the problems of public spending, balance would have been restored to the public finances by now.  Therefore, proposals being made for a serious reduction in tax, which everyone would like, must be accompanied by a total package of how it is possible.  It is significant that the Fianna Fáil Party have not made proposals of that kind, although I am sure they will make some attractive proposals between now and the next election.  I hope that they will resist the temptation &mdash; as I hope our party will &mdash; to respond to a reduction in a tax juggling match between the parties, whatever about the Labour <Col N="2411" /> Party.  We cannot and should not confront the people with that kind of expectation without telling them the other side of the coin.  They might accept the other side of the coin of significant reductions in tax, but it is not credible to make that proposal without accompanying it by a reasonable list of options about public expenditure.</P>
    <P>Having spoken about the national economy, I would like to say a few things about the economy of the Cork region and to refer to a few specifics which are very important for the upturn which I hope we will see nationally shortly and which I hope to see as soon or sooner in the Cork context.  There are a few fundamental things about the Cork region which are not always understood in Dublin.  One is that the absolute lifeline for the region rotates around better communications links.  We have a good train service and I have nothing to say about that except that it is satisfactory.  We have a fine airport which now requires an extension to the runway in order to open up options for tourism and for larger charter flights and to extend the whole range of options for business people to travel on larger planes to a wider sector of areas in Europe and elsewhere.  Therefore, we need an early commitment from the Government to that.  I know that public expenditure problems arise, but in sorting out priorities in expenditure next year in the Estimates that presumably will be tackled in the autumn the extension of the runway in Cork is an important infrastructural investment for the Cork area that needs to be done.</P>
    <P>The same is true of the ferry.  The GB sign on motor cars in west Cork, and I presume in Kerry, which used to cause a traffic jam ten years ago is now notable for its absence.  That is not all due to the ferry by any means, but there is no doubt that that is a significant factor.  For example, if you were living in Birmingham and had the prospects of driving from there to Pembroke, taking a short ferry run to Rosslare and driving out to Dingle, and repeating the exercise on the way back, I think you would not do it.  I would not <Col N="2412" /> do it.  There must be a great many Irish &mdash; and English &mdash; people in England who would like to come to the beauty spots of west Cork and Kerry and want to bring their car but feel that it is simply not worth the effort.  That is damaging to the region.  The efforts being made by the private sector on this and the other side of the water to provide a ferry for 1987 will undoubtedly require some stimulus, some start up assistance from the Government.  I do not subscribe to the notion that it should be subsidised permamently. Probably that is not on, certainly in the present climate, but it will need a stimulus in the early years and should get it.</P>
    <P>I would like to say something about Verolme Cork Dockyard.  As I understand it there are two serious bidders for this dockyard who have put their money where their mouth is and at the request of some arm of Government are providing proposed business plans so that selection can be made for a purchaser for that dockyard.  I urge all those involved in that &mdash; a receiver and the Department of Industry and Commerce in some way are involved &mdash; to get together quickly to announce this.  I understand that the repair season for ships generally starts in the autumn.  We in Cork &mdash; and, I hope and believe, the Government &mdash; want to see an early start to that activity.</P>
    <P>The IDA have served Cork well, but Pádraic White, manager of the IDA, made a very significant statement about a year ago.  He may have qualified it slightly, but he said that he would undertake to announce one major new industry for Ringaskiddy during this decade.  I remind him that we are half way through 1986 and we have not heard that announcement.  Everything in Ringaskiddy now must be conducive to the creation of industry, and the world economy is improving.  I hope that the IDA can get a major industry for Cork and announce it this year because we need it badly.</P>
    <P>Lastly, a new spirit is born in Cork. There is new industry.  Young people are developing small businesses.  You need not take my word for that.  I was informed <Col N="2413" /> about it recently by Professor Wrigley who runs the MBA course at UCC.  He tells me that he detects a new spirit in Cork.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the opportunity to raise this matter and I should like to make a direct appeal to the Minister to accede to the request of the City of Dublin VEC that a second level facility in the vocational area should be provided through Irish in the Ballymun area to serve the north County Dublin area as a whole.</P>
      <P>This project was first mooted 18 months ago and the former Minister, Deputy Hussey, met a delegation from the area.  It goes back even further to when a group of people in Ballymun got together and decided to form a scoil lán-Ghaeilge at primary level.  The school proved to be a great educational success in the area.  Most schools are marked by a pattern of teacher transfer at a rapid rate and the turnover of the pupils can be very high.  However, this school managed to provide a wonderfully stable education with an environment which involved the parents substantially in their children's education.  It spread into the community and a Ballymun community festival was held as a result.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recently the school hosted a major concert in the National Concert Hall which was supported by Irish artists in the traditional music field.  They have established a record of success at primary school level which is second to none. Their students were doing remarkably well and at sixth class level were competing very favourably with students all over the country.  However, as time went on and pupils left that facility, it was found that students who had shown remarkable promise were dropping out within a year or two of moving to other schools.  They had a choice if they wished to continue <Col N="2414" /> in an Irish environment of two excellent schools, Coláiste Mhuire for the boys and Scoil Caitríona for the girls.  While these are excellent schools and have great and long traditions of very high academic standards, they have a middle class environment, attitude and approach and their curriculum is almost entirely academic. The students coming from the all-Irish school were dropping out very rapidly, even those who had been excellent at primary level.</P>
    <P>Parents identified the need for a different type of education through Irish for their pupils.  They formulated a request to the City of Dublin VEC to see if they would undertake the provision of a vocational type education through Irish for students for whom the academic environment was unsuitable; they wanted one which would retain the high level of involvement of parents which existed at primary level.  With that in mind they approached the VEC who were happy to take on this project as they were very anxious to have an educational outlet in the Ballymun area.  They also approached the other schools in the area, the junior and senior comprehensives, and identified a suitable site between the Irish school and the comprehensive which provide an excellent education through English. The comprehensive school welcome the development and are willing to share facilities with any school developed on that site.</P>
    <P>In putting the case to the Department the school were very conscious that the Department could only accede to the request if there was sufficient need for it on the north side and that there would not be undue duplication.  I am not committed in any way to the Irish language &mdash; I have a limited competence in it &mdash; but I recognise that many people have a great love for it which is central to their lives.  Recently there has been a phenomenon in Dublin with regard to the development of a scoil lán-Ghaeilge on the fringes of the city.  There are seven such schools on the north side from Ballymun out as far as Swords and they could all potentially provide students for a second level school based on the northside.  A <Col N="2415" /> survey has been done on these schools which indicated that there is a substantial interest in them which would be adequate to supply a population for a second level school without unduly interfering with the population of Scoil Caitríona, Coláiste Mhuire or other existing educational facilities.</P>
    <P>The other major issue is whether these schools should develop a greater range of educational facilities.  Indeed they should and are doing so at present.  The Minister of State might mention to his Minister that he more than anyone should realise that things change slowly and that traditions do not die overnight.  In the interim, schoolchildren are leaving the mainline educational system and moving from Irish schools to vocational schools operating through the English language.  This should not happen and we should try to transform their existing options.</P>
    <P>The matter has now been considered by the post-primary advisory council who advise the Minister on suitable locations for schools.  Having considered the matter over a series of meetings, the council have given their blessing to the development of such a school.  This is a very important development and all that is required now is for the Minister to give the go-ahead.  Initially we require a commitment to commence, perhaps in a prefab or two, on the site adjacent to the school which is willing to share the facilities to which I referred earlier.  The senior comprehensive has a full range of laboratories and specialist workrooms which could be used immediately by the school without great expenditure by the State.</P>
    <P>Such a facility already exists on the south side of Dublin and was developed by the County Dublin VEC.  They had only 15 pupils to start with in a school in Clondalkin.  It has been extremely successful and people on the north side have travelled to it to examine the kind of education provided.  They identified it as being a continuation of the kind of education they provide in their primary schools and it has the educational atmosphere in which they would wish their children to <Col N="2416" /> be educated.  If such an environment is not provided their children will not continue with their education.</P>
    <P>The Government have shown a commitment to primary schools and recently the Taoiseach visited Ballymun to give the go-ahead to a project that would not have got under way without his assistance and that of the job centre for the Ballymun area.  If it had been left to the forces of normal bureaucracy, it would have been impossible to open the school but, because of the direct commitment and involvement of the Taoiseach and a local committee, the problems were solved and a new experiment is starting in Ballymun. The same happened in Darndale, another area of high need on the north side of Dublin.  The Taoiseach has been involved in a major commitment to a total redevelopment in that area which is very much needed and it would be very much in the spirit of that commitment to these areas that this Government should give the go-ahead to this development to commence in the autumn of this year as requested by the city of Dublin VEC.</P>
    <P>In doing so they would be giving recognition to one of the very outstanding successes this community can boast of, and would be recognising and supporting that achievement and, therefore, supporting the stabilisation of a substantial part of that community, because this school has no problem filling its places but has waiting lists of people anxious to come in. That is exactly the kind of stabilisation we need in the Ballymun area.  This project could be a way of developing that through to a second generation and ensuring that the young people who get an excellent start at primary level can continue to have that support and opportunity for development when in second level schooling.</P>
    <P>The Minister may or may not be aware that the site we are talking about, the area we are talking about, is one which is bounded by the National Institute of Higher Education, the two comprehensive schools and another primary school. So it is an ideal educational cluster an area where there is a good deal of travelling to and from the north side and <Col N="2417" /> throughout the north side by people for their education.  As such it is well located to draw in from a catchment area and, indeed, there would be a transport entitlement as a result of existing Department of Education policies for those travelling to avail of Irish education. There is such a travelling arrangement operating close by to Scoil Caitríona.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that this is very much needed, that it could be an immense boost to the area.  I ask the Minister to consider the points I have made, to consider the record of the group involved, the success of the educational venture they have already undertaken in the primary area, the great need in the area and the fact that I am absolutely certain that with the trend towards all-Irish primary schools, which seem to be spontaneously mushrooming all over this city, one way or another it is only a question of time before this facility is provided.  The younger generation now are anxiously awaiting a decision on this; young people are anxious to commence their education in such an environment which is not available to them on the north side of the city and would be available to them were they on the south side.  That is an entirely inquitable situation that cannot be allowed to continue.  I ask the Minister to undertake to resolve it quickly.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom ar dtús mo bhuíochas a ghabháil leis an Teachta Flaherty as ucht an cheist seo a chur ar an chlár.  Cuireadh iarratais isteach chuig an Roinn Oideachais a mí Aibreáin 1985 ó Choiste Ghairm Oideachais Bhaile Atha Cliath ag lorg cead scoil comhoideachas a bhunadh i mBaile Munna.  Séard a bhi i gceist ag an gcoiste ná scoil nua a bhunadh i bhfoirgreamh nua agus go mbeadh cainteanna idir an Roinn agus an Coiste Ghairm Oideachais ó thaobh an suímh agus an áit in a gcuirfí an scoil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Séard a bhí i gceist ag an gCoiste Ghairm Oideachais go gcuirfí ar fáil dhá sheomra ranga go sealadach ag an bun scoil lán-Ghaelach i mBaile Munna atá ann faoi láthair.  Bhí siad ag súil go mbeadh 50 <Col N="2418" /> daltaí ag freastal ann agus go mbeadh suas le 300 ag freastal ann i 1990.  Is cinneadh an-tábhactach é bunú scoil nua mar seo in áit ar bith agus go deimhin bheadh gá le neart airgid a chaitheamh go leanúnach agus bheadh neart airgid le caitheamh ar fhoirgneamh nua as seo amach freisin agus caithfear é sin a phlé ó thaobh an mholadh atá os ár gcomhair faoi láthair.  Freisin, caithfear é seo a iniúchadh go géar agus go hiomlán. Caithfear smaoineamh freisin ar na hionaid atá ann faoi láthair sna meán scoileanna i mBaile Munna ón taobh seo de: is féidir liom a rá go bhfuil ionaid ann le 2,200 daltaí sna scoileanna cuimsitheacha atá i mBaile Munna faoi láthair agus níl ag freastal iontu ach 1,600 daltaí.  Is léir mar sin go bhfuil 600 ionaid breise san áit. Caithfear smaoineamh freisin an mbeadh sé oiriúnach meán scoil lán-Ghaelach a bhunú dá mba rud é go méadófaí líon na n-ionad sna bunscoileanna lán-Ghaelacha ar an dtaobh ó thuaidh den chathair. Caithfear smaoineamh freisin ar na torthaí a thiocfadh as agus cé chomh feiliúnach nó cé is a bheadh Baile Munna ó thaobh bunadh scoil mar seo.  Tá dhá meán scoil lán-Ghaelach ar an taobh ó thuaidh den chathair faoi láthair.  Is iad siúd ná Coláiste Mhuire i gCearnóg Parnell agus Scoil Chaitríona i nGlasnaín.  Ní raibh ag freastal ar Scoil Chaitríona ach cailíní go dtí seo ach ó mhí Mheán Fhómhair i mbliana beidh buachaillí ag freastal ann freisin agus beidh ábhair phracticiúla ar an gcuraclam inti.  Tá ionaid bhreise de thuairim is 250 ann faoi láthair agus freisin tá ionaid bhreise i gColáiste Mhuire.  Is sa chomhthéacs sin go gcaithfear an t-iarratas seo a phlé.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom a rá go bhfuil deis faoi scoileanna lán-Ghaelacha curtha ar fáil i mBaile Átha Cliath ar an taobh ó thuaidh den chathair i Scoil Chaitríona agus Coláiste Mhuire, mar a dúirt mé cheana.  Ar an deisceart tá Coláiste Eoin agus Coláiste Iosagáin, agus in iarthar na cathrach tá Coláiste Chillian, scoil ghairm oideachais i gCluaindolcáin.  Táthar ag lorg meán scoil lán-Ghaelach freisin amuigh i dTamhlacht ach is féidir le Coláiste Chillian freastal do riachtanais an cheantair sin go <Col N="2419" /> gearr-théarmach.  I mí na Nollag 1985 bhuail toscaireacht leis an Aire Stáit.  Bhí mé sa Roinn ag an am sin agus bhí an Teachta Flaherty ar an toscaireacht sin agus tá a fhios agam go maith an tsuim atá aici san rud seo.  Bhí tuismitheoirí ag freastal ar an toscaireacht sin agus freisin bhí muintir ó Choiste Ghairm Oideachais Bhaile Átha Cliath.  Dúradh ag an dtoscaireacht nach raibh na daltaí ó Bhaile Munna sásta bheith ag freastal i dtimpeallacht na háite meán-aicmeach a bhí i Scoil Chaitríona agus Choláiste Mhuire agus go mbeadh sé i bhfad níos oiriúnaí dóibh réim cuimsitheach ábharach níos oiriúnaí dóibh a chur ar fáil in áit eile. Pléadh an rud seo ag dhá chruinniú den chóiríocht meán scoileanna i mbliana, an chéad cruinniú ar an 10ú lá de mhí na Márta agus ag an gcruinniú sin bhí toscaireacht <Col N="2420" /> ó Ghaelscoileanna Chomhchoiste Náisiúnta agus labhair siad siúd go tréan i bhfábhar meán scoil lán-Ghaelach Bhaile Munna agus ag an dara chruinniú ar an 17ú lá de mí Aibreáin glacadh cinneadh ag an gcóiríocht meán scoileanna agus cuireadh chuig an Aire é seo agus bhí sé sin i bhfábhar an iarratais a luaigh mé cheana.  Anois, níl an scrúdú seo críochnaithe ag an Roinn Oideachais go fóill ach deirim leis an Teachta go gcaithfear é seo a phlé go hiomlán agus go gcaithfear na nithe go léir a thabhairt i gcrích sula ndéantar cinneadh dearfa faoi.  Ach, bí cinnte go bhfeicfimid go hiomlán agus go báúil ar an iarratas atá curtha isteach.</P>

      <Col N="2332" /> Maidir le taiscéaladh ola agus gáis, mar adúbhras le déanaí nuair a bhí Meastachán mo Roinne á phlé sa Dáil, cuireann an cliseadh i luach ola isteach go mór ar taiscealadh, agus dá bharr san, d'fhógair cuid de na comhlachtaí ola mór-ghearradh in a gcáin fhaisnéis taiscéalaíochta.  In ainneoin sin ba chóir go mbéadh leithbhéal réasúnta obair taiscéalaíochta ar siúl in Uiscí na h-Éireann i rith na blianta seo chugainn, ag cur san áireamh an méid a thagann as an dTríú Eisiúint Foirmiúil de Cheadúnais.</P>

      <P>The principal United Nations instruments in the area of race relations <Col N="2333" /> are the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination.  Ireland has signed both of these instruments and is committed to the ratification of both at the earliest possible opportunity.  Before doing so however the Government, as has been the practice of successive Irish Governments in this area, is concerned to ensure that domestic legislation and practice are in conformity with the obligations which would be accepted consequent on ratification.</P>
      <P>It has been decided in this regard to give priority to the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.

      <P>The Government is concerned that international volunteers engaged in humanitarian work in Nicaragua should not be subjected to attacks by armed forces.  I am happy to say that eight German volunteers kidnapped on 17 May 1986 were released on 10 June as a result of sustained but quiet diplomatic pressure. I am satisfied that this approach to the safety of volunteers in Nicaragua is a productive one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The personal safety of all individuals in any part of the Central American region will continue to be hazardous as long as a political settlement to the problems of the region remains outstanding. In common with our European partners we have in the past given active support to the Contadora process for peace and reconciliation in Central America.  The <Col N="2335" /> Community will continue to support and encourage the Contadora process which in our view offers the best possibilities of securing a just and durable peace in the region.</P>

      <P>There seem to be at least two main aspects to the Deputy's question. One would relate to advice and assistance abroad to Irish citizens who may face problems.  The other is advice and assistance to those contemplating emigration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the problem for those already abroad, I am aware of the problems faced by young Irish people who go abroad to seek work.  Many go unprepared, and with no prearranged employment or place to stay.  Where any citizen gets into difficulties, the consular advice and help of our embassies and consulates are available to them.  In the embassy at London, in addition to the normal consular services, there is a community liaison officer who maintains contact with all Irish organisations in Britain.  An officer of the Department of Labour is also attached to the embassy.  He maintains <Col N="2336" /> links with Irish bodies which provide welfare services for emigrants in Britain.</P>
    <P>He also chairs an advisory group which advises the Minister for Labour on questions relating to the welfare of Irish citizens in Britain, and on the distribution of a fund allocated to the Minister for Labour to help Irish welfare groups.  This fund has been increased yearly by the Government from £38,000 in 1983 to £155,000 in 1986.  The fund is used to assist 12 groups, of which ten are based in Britain and two based in Ireland to advise and assist emigrants.</P>
    <P>With regard to advice to young people who may be contemplating emigration, I would draw attention to the reply to the House on 28 May 1986 by the Minister for Labour and the Public Service, Deputy Ruairí Quinn.  In that reply he gave information on the role of guidance staff in the National Manpower Service in regard to people who seek advice on work abroad, on the fact that the National Manpower Service is preparing a booklet for those seeking work abroad, and on other aspects of this problem.</P>
    <P>In addition to the steps being taken by the Minister for Labour in Ireland I can say that the consular role of my Department and its overseas officers, that is to say, their role in helping Irish citizens abroad, is one to which I attach the highest importance.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> I propose to take Questions Nos. 31 to 33, inclusive, together.  Wine sold by the glass must be sold in one of the standard measures approved by the Department of Industry and Commerce for use in trade. In February 1985 the Government approved, under the Weights and Measures Acts, 1878 to 1936, the addition of the standard of 125 ml to the list of approved standards to cater specifically for the sale of wine by the glass.  Legal questions relating to the requirement of pattern approval under the weights and measures legislation of this standard are at present under examination.  Resolution of these questions will help clear the way for effective enforcement of the Retail Price (Beverages in Licensed Premises) Display Order, 1976, which applies to all beverages, including wine, offered for sale in licensed premises.</P>
      <P>It is obligatory to sell all intoxicating liquor, including liqueurs, (when not sold in an unopened container) in one of the standard measures approved by the Department of Industry and Commerce for use in trade.  No particular sizes are specifically prescribed for the sale of any particular spirits.  Traditionally, whiskey, brandy and gin are sold in the half gill (71 ml) and quarter gill (35.5 ml) measures.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> There is no evidence in the available trade figures to support the suggestion in the Deputy's question of an increase in imports arising from recent exchange rate movements placing indigenous industry under considerable pressure.  I am aware nevertheless of concerns which have been expressed by the CII and others on this subject regarding the competitive disadvantages which confront and may confront some Irish producers.  The pace of recent exchange rate movements against the pound sterling and the dollar are considered to have contributed to these problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The situation, however, must be viewed in the context of the advantages which can also be expected to accrue over the longer term from cheaper inputs, lower domestic inflation, stable exchange rates with our other EC partners and the prospect of further reductions in interest <Col N="2339" /> rates.  I would point out that the Government has acted to ensure that these positive aspects, together with the fall in dollar oil prices, are reflected in industry's costs.  Interest rates have been reduced since the EMS realignment and there are prospects of further falls.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the difficult budgetary situation, the Government has ensured that the benefits of cheaper oil have flowed through to reduce industry's costs and to boost domestic demand.  The House will be aware that the ESB recently implemented a reduction in the price of electricity to industry.</P>
    <P>Exchange rate fluctuations are but one of a variety of elements of total costs such as those associated with wages, quality, marketing, delivery and after sales service. Indeed I would suggest that constant reappraisal by firms themselves of these elements is the best approach to combating such changes and challenges as can arise in the marketplace consequent on currency movements.</P>

        <i>Limerick East):</i> A draft order is being prepared under the Consumer Information Act, 1978, which will require any advertisements or notices that make reference to the cost of credit to show the true cost of that credit by means of an annual percentage rate of charge (APR).  The APR is the total cost of the credit expressed as an annual percentage of the amount of credit granted.

      <P>(a) The competitive position of Irish exporters in the UK market <i>vis-à-vis</i> those in other EMS countries has not been eroded since the other EMS currencies have also strengthened against sterling.</P>
      <P>(b) Not all fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies outside the EMS are disadvantageous.  In addition to considerable benefits reaped from the high value of the dollar the present exchange rate of sterling has enhanced the position of many Irish firms in that imports from the UK such as basic raw materials and capital goods, which are significant, are now cheaper and help to reduce manufacturing costs.</P>
      <P>(c) Exchange rate fluctuations are but one of a variety of elements of total costs such as those associated with wages, quality, marketing, delivery and after sales service.  Proper business practice requires that the balance of these be constantly reappraised.</P>
      <P>As regard the effect on competitiveness of interest rates, I would point out that since the recent EMS realignment, Irish interest rates have fallen sharply.  The prime overdraft rate of the associated banks is now 10 per cent, its lowest level in eight years.  In real terms, that is after allowing for latest published year on year inflation rate, Irish interest rates compare very favourably with those of our competitors.</P>

However, if the Deputy has any particular case in mind I will look into the position, on receipt of particulars.  Inspectors are deployed on a regional rather than on a county basis; in the region which comprises Counties Cork and Waterford 19 inspectors are employed, some of whom also do new house inspection work.</P>

      <P>A sum of £4.5 million approximately has been allocated in the Vote for Forestry for the construction, up-grading and repair of forest roads in the current year.  It is expected that approximately 140kms. of new roads will be constructed and about 30kms. of existing roads up-graded to cater for the increasing volume of timber extraction traffic.  On-going minor repairs will also be effected, as required, to the existing network of approximately 6,650kms. of roads at the various forest centres throughout the country.</P>
      <P>The provision of a suitable road system constitutes part of the on-going forestry operations of the forest and wildlife service of my Department.  The programme involves firstly the provision of the necessary roading to facilitate the management of newly planted areas in their formative years, secondly the provision of access roads for harvesting and extraction of timber from plantations and thirdly maintaining and up-grading forest roads as required until all thinning cycles have been completed and the crops clearfelled. All roads are designed to carry the maximum load consistent with the conditions obtaining in the relevant sites.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Minister for Tourism, Fisheries and Forestry (Mr. Kavanagh) Liam Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Fisheries and Forestry (Mr. Kavanagh)</NameTxt>
      <P>Protection of the wild birds referred to by the Deputy was determined by EEC Council Directive No. 79/409 which provides <i>inter alia</i> for the regulation and control of the hunting and killing of wild birds naturally occurring throughout the Community. The implementation of this Directive in Ireland was deemed to be effected by the Wildlife Act, 1976, and the EC Commission was so informed at the time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recently, however, the Commission ruled that the protective provisions of the <Col N="2357" /> Wildlife Act contravened certain provisions of the Council's Directive in that the bird species mentioned in the Third Schedule to that Act were not protected. These included the carrion crow, greater black-backed gull, herring gull, hooded (grey) crow, house sparrow, jackdaw, jay, lesser black-backed gull, magpie, pigeons (other than racing homing pigeons or doves) rook and starling.</P>
    <P>Following prolonged discussions between the Commission and officials of my Department and the Attorney General's Office, it was decided in order to meet the Commission's ruling to amend the Wildlife Act by removing the 12 species from the Third Schedule.  This was done by means of the European Communities (Wildlife Act, 1976) (Amendment) Regulations, 1985, which came into operation on 6 December 1985.</P>
    <P>I would like to explain, however, that the Council Directive permits derogation from its protective provisions in the interests of public health, public and air safety, the prevention of serious damage to crops, livestock, forests, fisheries and water and the protection of fauna and flora.  This derogation is given effect by certain provisions of the Wildlife Act which enabled persons to apply to my Department for permission to take appropriate action to protect property of the kind mentioned.  Also in circumstances where urgent action is required to prevent damage, the Act includes a &ldquo;good defence&rdquo; provision.</P>
    <P>In so far as gun club members are concerned they may apply to the Department for permission or take urgent action as indicated where their property i.e. pen reared game birds, are being attacked, or where they act as agents of landowners whose livestock or crops are being damaged.</P>
    <P>My Department is currently examining what further steps may be necessary in order to ensure that the terms of the derogation permitted by the Council Directive are operated fully and in a reasonable manner.</P>

      <P>Entitlement to unemployment assistance is dependent on the claimant being the holder of a qualification certificate and in order to obtain a qualification certificate a person must satisfy certain conditions including an assessment of means.</P>
      <P>The person concerned claimed unemployment assistance from 19 May 1986 and his papers were referred to a social welfare officer for investigation of means. This investigation will be completed as soon as possible and his case will then be submitted to a deciding officer for assessment of means as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>The entitlement of the person concerned to unemployment assistance will be determined in the light of the means assessment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While every effort is being made to process all claims received in the Department with the minimum of delay, nevertheless, due to the large volume of claims received there is an inevitable <Col N="2367" /> delay in dealing with some cases.  Delays are more likely to arise where means testing is involved as in the case of unemployment assistance.  In such cases a social welfare officer must visit the claimant's home to investigate the means and in many such cases, especially in relation to farmers, he must obtain details or confirmation of certain items of means from other bodies.  For instance in this case the social welfare officer is awaiting a reply from the Agricultural Credit Corporation regarding a loan made to the claimant before he can finalise his report.</P>
    <P>It is understood that the person concerned is at present receiving supplementary welfare allowance from the health board.</P>

He is, accordingly, in receipt of unemployment assistance of £66.25 weekly, being the appropriate maximum rate payable in his case of £67.05 less means of 80p.  The person concerned did not appeal against the means assessment although he was advised of his right to appeal and he has not subsequently requested a review of his case.</P>

    <P>Arrangements have now been made with his local office to issue a form to him on which he can apply for a review of his case.

      <P>These inquiries, which proved to be protracted, were recently completed and his claim has been allowed at the weekly flat rate of unemployment benefit of £74.50, being the maximum rate payable to a claimant with an adult dependant and one child dependant.

      <P>Following investigation of the unemployment assistance claim of the person concerned he was assessed with means of £40 weekly, derived from selfemployment and from the value of capital. He appealed against the amount of means assessed against him and, arising from contentions raised by him in support of his appeal, his papers were referred to the social welfare officer for further inquiries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These inquiries were recently completed and his case was submitted to a deciding officer who assessed him with means of £1.55 weekly from 24 January <Col N="2370" /> 1986 and 70p weekly from 23 May 1986. The means are derived from the value of capital.</P>
    <P>He is, accordingly, entitled to unemployment of £78.80 weekly at present, being the appropriate maximum rate payable in his case of £79.50 less means of 70p.  Arrears of unemployment assistance due will be paid to him this week and further weekly payments of £78.80 will continue to be made as they become due.</P>
    <P>As regards the time it has taken to decide this case the general position is that in many cases where an appeal is lodged, including this one, additional inquiries are necessary where certain contentions are raised in support of the appeal.  Such cases are referred to a social welfare officer and in view of the large workload these officers have to contend with there is an inevitable delay in dealing with certain cases.  However, every effort is being made to minimise delays as much as possible.  Any inconvenience caused to the person concerned and to his family as a result of the delay in this case is regretted.</P>

      <P>He appealed against the means assessment and an appeals officer, on 16 June 1986, also assessed his means at £15 weekly after considering all the facts and evidence in the case available to him. He was informed of the appeals officer's decision.  He is, accordingly, in receipt of £43.35 weekly, being the appropriate maximum rate payable in his case of £58.35 less means of £15.</P>

      <P>The person concerned was paid disability benefit to 4 February 1986 when payment was disallowed following an examination by a medical referee who expressed the opinion that he was capable of work.  He appealed against the decision to disallow benefit and was examined by a different medical referee on 9 April 1986 who also expressed the opinion that he was capable of work.</P>
      <P>His appeal was referred to an appeals officer for determination.  The appeals officer decided that he was incapable of work within the meaning of the Social Welfare Acts during the period from 5 February 1986 to 16 June 1986 (the date of the latest medical certificate before him at the time) and is entitled to be paid disability benefit in respect of that period.</P>

      <P>Following an oral hearing held in July 1985 an appeals officer assessed the means of the person concerned at £30.75 weekly, derived from the profit from his holding.</P>
      <P>He applied for a review of his case in January 1986 and his papers were referred to a social welfare officer for reinvestigation of means.  This investigation was recently completed and a deciding officer, on 2 July 1986, assessed him with means of £30.75, derived from the profit from his holding.  He will be notified of this decision by his local office shortly.</P>
      <P>As there is no change in his means assessment he continues to be paid at £3.05 weekly, being the appropriate maximum rate payable in his case of £33.80 weekly, less means of £30.75.</P>

      <P>Flexi-milk is the term used to denote the quantity of milk available in any co-op or dairy area from suppliers who do not fill their complete quota.  It is allocated according to guidelines drawn up after consultations with the farm and co-operaative organisations to reduce the levy liability of those suppliers who have exceeded their quotas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The distribution of flexi-milk, therefore, only arises in the case of co-operatives and other purchases which exceed their quotas.  In the case of purchasers who do not exceed their quotas such distribution does not take place because none of their suppliers is liable for superlevy. <Col N="2379" /> The details of the amount of flexi-milk available and its distribution to the eligible categories of suppliers by those purchasers who exceeded their quotas for 1985-86 will not be available for some time.  As the quotas are allocated on a purchaser basis, details of the amounts allocated to each individual farmer are not collected.  Officers of my Department are, however, empowered to examine purchasers' records to ensure that the guidelines for the reallocation of flexi-milk together with the other provisions relating to the quota system are being observed.</P>
    <P>The Department do not have details of the number of farmers who ceased milk production or of the number of quotas that have changed hands.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that, taking account of the constraints which it imposes, the system is working reasonably well and that the purchasers are operating within the guidelines laid down.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Deasy) Austin Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Deasy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Since public intervention is available only on a Community-wide basis it is not open to individual member states to introduce it on the basis of market conditions prevailing in their own areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Pigmeat production by its nature is particularly susceptible to market developments so that the system of intervention buying-in of pigmeat is rarely used since it does not offer prospects for long term stability in the market.  The most commonly used form of market support in this area is aids for private storage which, by temporarily removing excess supplies from the market, facilitates the adjustment of supply to market requirements. The other market mechanism resorted to is the system of export refunds which <Col N="2380" /> helps to take supplies off the internal Community market.  In recent times both of these market support measures have been available to member states in an attempt to improve the market situation and in fact an improvement has occurred in continental markets.</P>
    <P>The particular difficulties of the industry in Ireland will not, in any case, be solved by market supports alone.  I have frequently stressed the need for structural improvements at the manufacturing level.  Rationalisation of slaughtering capacity and modernisation of processing plans are urgently required if the industry is to be able to withstand the growing competition on home and export markets.  Generous grant aid for suitable investment projects is available from both the IDA and FEOGA.  At marketing level, a more aggressive approach to selling and the allocation of more resources to the areas of product quality and diversification are also required.</P>

      <P>The person in question was awarded £300 under the terms of the Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977, by the Employment Appeals Tribunal.

      <P>asked the Minister for Labour if, in view of the fact that a social employment scheme to surface dress the main road in Inis Meáin cannot proceed without an additional £4,000 grant for the purchase of bitumen tar, he will allow the Department of the Gaeltacht to make this grant available so that the scheme can proceed.</P>
