    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not easy to enjoy it, considering the hour at which we left here this morning.  The taximan was a man from Inchicore and the moment I sat in he said, &ldquo;I know who you are and where you are going and for Heaven's sake will you reflect not my view but the view of every customer I carried last night and of every pal I have in the taxi ranks around Dublin?&rdquo;  He said that he was a married man with five children, that the taxi business could not be in a worse position, but despite that the Government had put another 10.8p on the price of petrol and had put up car tax and that this was bad coming from a Government who three years ago told us that we would have a couple of rough years ahead but that there was a light at the end of the tunnel.  I recall that phrase being used many times in the House and outside by the Taoiseach, by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Peter Barry, and many others.  As the taximan said, the tunnel is getting darker every day.  He <Col N="1194" /> told me that it reminded him of when he was growing up in the fifties under a former Coalition Government when his four brothers had to emigrate to London to set up their homes.  It was a sad reflection on the country, he said, that of his five children two had already emigrated. He had no doubt that, if things continued as they were, the other three would find themselves in the same position.  History repeating itself, he added.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>Was he chairman of the local Fianna Fáil Cumann?</P>

      <P>Deputy Harte should cease interrupting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I never saw the man before but his views were a true reflection of what ordinary people feel about the budget.  The taximan told me that last night his wife tried in her own way to make up the family budget.  They have two children under 18.  She told her husband that she could not understand why Government speakers, the Minister for Finance in particular, were trying to convince her that she would be better off after yesterday's budget.  That lady was told that children's allowances went up by £3 each for her two children or £72 per year.  Her husband pays his taxes, works at night starting his shift at 1 p.m. and does a few hours extra work in the morning to supplement his income.  That is the effort he is making to rear his family, but he lost the £100 tax allowance on each of his two children.  He pays tax at the 35 per cent rate and has a mortgage on his house.  How can one convince his wife that she was any better off as a result of the budget?  I have not taken account of the fact that the cost of this man's petrol will rise, that his car tax will cost more and that he will have to pay more for ESB charges, telephone charges and his wife will have to pay extra for bread, butter, milk and so on as a result of the decision to do away with 50 per cent of the food subsidies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The taximan asked how the Minister <Col N="1195" /> for Finance could go on television yesterday evening and say that the food subsidies had not been reduced.  Technically the Minister was correct, but he was wrong in trying to convey the impression that there was no reduction in the food subsidies.  I have just related the story of the taximan from Inchicore in his blue Granada this morning and if I did no more this morning than just relate that story the message should be loud and clear within the Chamber of the real hardship, distress and despair that is rampant in Irish society because of the serious problems we have got ourselves into.  I will ignore the other adjectives he used to describe the budget and the expletives he uttered, but the message he asked me to take to the House was that he felt betrayed by the Government, betrayed by the message that was poured out to him three years ago when he was told &ldquo;Tighten your belt, you will have a couple of rough years, but at the end of the day all will be well&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>That family, like all families in the country, made sacrifices; but at the end of three years what have they discovered? They have found out that the cure is worse than the disease.  Not alone have we not seen any improvement but we have witnessed a continuous slide deeper into debt daily.  Every day the Government borrow £3.5 million to pay for the day-to-day expense involved in running the country, which is contrary to what we were told by Coalition spokespersons three years ago.  They told us then that the country was on the verge of bankruptcy. If it was on the point of bankruptcy then how closer is it to that position today?  If, as we were led to believe then, the international bankers were knocking on our door, I wonder where they are today.  Why is there not a scare running through the Irish economy, as happened three years ago?</P>
    <P>There are valid reasons why there should be a scare in the economy but we do not hear or read about it to the same extent that we witnessed three years ago. Yesterday was a day of lost opportunities. It was a day when the country looked to <Col N="1196" /> the Minister for Finance to give them some hope, some guidelines, as to where we were going in the future if we were to get out of the morass we are in.  People lived through yesterday afternoon in the forlorn hope that something positive to show a way forward would emerge from the Minister for Finance.  It was too much to hope for, because all we got from him was a fiction in figures.  They were delivered by a Minister for Finance whom, I regret to say, has lost all credibility inside and outside the House.  Time and again in interviews yesterday evening hard-pressed housewives said they would not believe a word the Minister says any more.  He is the same Minister for Finance who last year introduced a budget that was sold in a flurry of excitement and hype the like of which we have seen for a long time, but the net result was that he only flattered to deceive.</P>
    <P>Thankfully, the same hype was not attached to this year's budget.  I never sat through a budget that did not provoke a spontaneous clap from Government backbenchers, but that was the position yesterday.  That is a reflection of the negative attitude and thinking that has engulfed the Government.  They do not seem to be able to find any way out of our difficulties.  I do not underestimate the problems facing the country and Governments in the future, but the Coalition seem to have accepted that there is no way out and that they must stay as long as they can, keep the ship from sinking, in the hope that a new man on a white horse will deliver us from our problems.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that the Minister for Finance was not able to use some imagination to point us in the right direction, to give the right signals to those who were looking to the House for guidance. Is the Minister such a negative thinker that he could not bring himself to put out the right signals even though he does not have all the answers?  I would be the last to say that we have all the answers, but we certainly have positive thinkers on our side.  We realise that there are not instant solutions to the country's problems but <Col N="1197" /> we know that a start must be made.  A start will not be made as a result of yesterday's budget.</P>
    <P>The Government have ignored the two major problems that face our economy. There are 240,000 people unemployed but there was not anything in the budget to help some of those people get a job.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The budget does not hold out any hope for the thousands of young people who are part and parcel of that figure.  In fact the signal is in the opposite direction as far as they are concerned. There is nothing in this budget to give incentives for employment creation and it is also evident from looking through the Estimates that there will be 10,000 fewer places for young people in training next year.  The number of unemployed will rise from 240,000 to 270,000 next year if we are to rely on the few bits and pieces cobbled together in this budget to tackle unemployment.  That is the reality which will face people looking for jobs, including the many young people who will be leaving third level education next June.</P>
      <P>One banner headline this morning calls the budget a juggling act.  The Minister for finance is a very bad juggler in a second-rate show to which the general public do not have the admission price, despite the fact that he lowered VAT on fun palaces and whatever, It is a total juggling act, ignoring the fundamental structure of problems and going for a bit here and a bit there, taking one step forward and two steps back, trying to convince the PAYE sector that the Minister has done a marvellous job for them. That is only one of the illusions which form part of the presentation yesterday, but if anybody is foolish enough to believe it I would refer him to the income tax figures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The outturn for income tax in 1985 was £2,103.1 million.  The post-budget estimate is £2,356.4 million.  Anybody who does simple sum will find that £536 <Col N="1198" /> million extra taxation will be paid in 1986. If we take PAYE tax on its own, we substract £2,103 million from £2,356.3 million, giving a figure of £253.3 million. I welcome the abolition of the 1 per cent income levy.  As I would welcome any steps in that direction, but there is no point in trying to sell such steps for what they are not.  It is better to look at the reality and to do the sums in time rather than have the PAYE sector doing their sums later on, as happened last year when they did not believe people like us who tried to point out the reality immediately after the budget.  When they got their pay packets and did all their sums they found they were to be the losers.  The real figure for income tax this year is £213.3 million &mdash; £253.3 million less £40 million taken off by way of income levy.  The £231.3 million will have to be paid by a smaller number of people because undoubtedly the budget will create more unemployment; thus fewer people will be paying a larger amount of money.</P>
    <P>When I made this argument last year people laughed and scoffed.  I said the figures were phoney, that the Minister was fiddling around with figures and using bits of funny money here and there. There is some funny money in this budget too.  This is the reality of the fiction of figures given to us yesterday.  There was a shortfall in revenue of £128 million. Was it any surprise when 240,000 people are unemployed, while the average projected in last year's budget was 217,000, a totally unrealistic figure?  A supplementary estimate for £50 million had to be brought in and inevitably before this time next year the same will have to be done again.  There will be 10,000 fewer places for training.  Emigration will account for some of this number but the balance will remain here to be paid by this Government. It is not the future that young people want.  They prefer to be doing something.</P>
    <P>The sooner the better the Government realise that the policies they have continued to follow are a dismal failure. What more evidence do they need than the reality of the figures staring them in the face?  For three years they have <Col N="1199" /> imposed high penal taxation, totally contrary to what they said when they came into office.  They have failed to tackle the expenditure side.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Where would Deputy Reynolds cut?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the first year that some attempt has been made.  Leaving aside capital expenditure, current expenditure has risen every year.  This year some attempt is being made but I wonder how true the Estimates will be at the end of the day.  The Government have relied on penal taxation to solve the problems of bringing down the current budget deficit, yet it has risen from £988 million when they came into office to £1,284 million and we are starting with an Estimate this year of £1,250 million.  I wonder how real that figure is.  What kind of illusory figures are they trying to get the people to believe?  All the Minister is doing is moving the goal posts each time.  He changes the rules of the games when he finds he cannot reach his targets.  He will explain it away in the usual manner which has become synonymous with this Minister by saying that the increase is not as bad as it would have been if he had not done this or that.  This is the sort of phraseology which runs through his speeches in an effort to convince people that he is really doing the job he is supposed to do. He is trying to con them.</P>
      <P>As the taximan from Inchicore said this morning: &ldquo;Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me&rdquo;.  The con trick played on the Irish people will not be repeated, despite all the talk about percentages of GNP and current budget deficits.  That is not the language that the ordinary people understand; they understand the reality of life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fictional figures presented by the Minister yesterday may have satisfied his own ego and his technocratic instincts.  He is so concentrated on figures that the House could fall on top of him and he would hardly realise it.  That budget represents no more than putting figures <Col N="1200" /> together and moving them here and there.  An economist from Trinity College described it on television last night as like moving the deck chairs around the Titanic.  Moving figures around will do nothing to create employment or help the hard-pressed housewife or the young person trying to get a job.  It may satisfy the ego of some people opposite who are happy that they will be able to present in a conjured-up fashion figures which will help to defend their last stands of credibility.</P>

      <P>If I were Minister Bruton I would concentrate on the agricultural <Col N="1201" /> industry.  I read through the long budget speech but there was nothing in it for the farmers.  The farmers in Meath will not be very happy about the way the agricultural industry is being treated by this Government.  Each year since this Government came into power there has been a reduction in investment in agriculture. There is one thing you will be able to say quietly, out of the side of your mouth&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The one thing the Minister will be able to say to the big ranchers with the plush fields in Meath is that the land tax will not be coming in. We said that last year.  But, if this Government continue to adjust the acreage at the present rate, the plan will not be finished by the year 2000.  This land tax was a response to a political problem. They had to take something out of the hat to calm the political waters.</P>

      <P>The waves are on the way down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>They will engulfed by the waves if they are not careful.  We said that the land tax as proposed by the Government was not workable.  We also said that, whatever chance the Exchequer had of getting more money out of the farming community, this was the wrong year to introduce a land tax.  Whom in the farming community does the land tax suit?  It suits the intensified dairy farmers, people who for the last four or five years have been using capital allowance writeoffs, purchase of machinery and so on. The Minister, Deputy Bruton, knows how the game works.  This year even on 80 acres of intensive dairying these farmers would be paying £30,000 or £40,000 tax.  When these people were paying £800 they laughed all the way to the bank.  Is it any wonder that we have heard a great eruption in favour of the land tax from the south of Ireland?  This will be the first year this type of money will be coming into the Exchequer simply because all the ways of alleviating the tax liability under <Col N="1202" /> the accounts system have been used up. That is the reality of the land tax the myth which was mentioned here to try to keep the Labour Party happy in Coalition.</P>
      <P>In yesterday's budget we had the economic requirements on the one side and the political realities on the other. The Taoiseach and many of his spokesmen say from time to time that Fine Gael always put the country first and Fine Gael second.  We all know the reality. When it comes to political realities in Government, Fine Gael put Fine Gael first and the country second.  That has been happening for the last four budgets. I will not make the comparison with what was said about Rome burning while another man was doing something else, but the position here is not so very different.</P>
      <P>This budget shows no imagination, no creativity, or no understanding of the problems facing us.  The Minister for Finance brought in a budget which I can only describe as anti-business, anti-saving and anti-family.  This budget and the thinking behind it clearly reflects the collective wisdom of this Government who seem to believe that they should continue to penalise thrift, to despise success and to promote the politics of envy.  By their actions you shall know them.  That is the only way I can judge this.  No matter which section in this budget one looks at one realises that it is anti-saving.</P>
      <P>It was sold as a transfer of the burden of taxation from the PAYE sector to the financial corporate sector.  That is a nice slogan to sell to the Labour Party and their members, but that is not the reality. It is not the banks who will be paying the £75 million but the depositors &mdash; 35 per cent will be deducted from the interest due and passed, by cheque, to the Exchequer.  This is certainly a simplified way of collecting tax because there are no administrative overheads.  I appeal to the Government not to try to fool the people into believing that the corporate banking sector will pay the £75 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us look at the make-up of depositors. There are not many companies with money on deposit for long periods.  The backbone of bank depositors &mdash; about 70 <Col N="1203" /> per cent &mdash; are small savers and small depositors.  These are the people the Minister will hit.  These are the people the Government have been encouraging to put their money in financial institutions and not to leave it under their beds.  What are the depositors doing this morning? They are taking the money out of the banks and putting it under their mattresses. Unfortunately, this means that many more old people will be attacked. These people are not liable to income tax, but the Government will take 35 per cent from them under the label of getting at the banking institutions.  The Government are upsetting the traditional saving position.  This budget is clearly anti-saving. The Minister should not try to tell me that this money will be collected from the corporate banking sector, because it is clearly the depositors who will have to pay.  This applies to residential depositors.</P>
    <P>Non-residential deposit holders are all right at the moment, but when they read the underlying message in yesterday's Budget Statement, many of them may decide that Ireland is becoming a very dangerous régime in which to lodge money.  Despite what is said that money will move out of the country.  Double taxation agreements exist between here and the UK and most of the non-residential banking deposits in the banking system have come from the UK.  When the people concerned are asked to declare their UK address they know they are only a step away from the British authorities approaching them for their money.  Many Irish people went to Britain and made their money in the building and construction industry in the good days and also in other areas of activity. They have put their money back into this country to let us benefit from those deposits.  As we all know, for every £1 deposited with the banks they can lend £4.  If one interferes with that system one is on a very dangerous road.  There is a most uneasy silence in the financial world in Dublin this morning but behind the scenes there are doubts about what may develop.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1204" /> By adopting their proposal with regard to the insurance companies and their managed funds the Government will get at some of the profits of those funds but at the end of the day it is the policy holders who will suffer.  The only reason the insurance companies will pay in respect of their managed funds is that they have already guaranteed a return on those policies and also in respect of growth funds.</P>
    <P>What the Government are proposing will kill that kind of saving.  It will kill the small saver and it will affect the Post Office, the ACC and other institutions. There is one glaring exception, namely, that the Government have positively discriminated in favour of Government gilts.  I do not know where the savings will be moved but I do not want to hear the foolish argument that because exchange control operates here the money will not leave the country.  It is a nonsense to suggest that.  We have a land border and where such a border exists there is no way one can stop the transfer of money.  I accept that occasionally a person will be caught &mdash; this happened two weeks ago when a man was caught with £500,000 but that was only the tip of the iceberg &mdash; but for that one person caught thousands will get away.  I hope the Government have not done long term deliberate damage to the pattern of savings here.  If they have, as bad as we are at the moment for developing capital we would be much worse in the future.</P>
    <P>As I pointed out, the Government have discriminated positively in favour of Government gilts but this system is not one used by small savers.  On many occasions Deputy Bruton has said that one of the greatest requirements of Irish industry is more capital and more equity and I agree fully with that sentiment. However, there is nothing in this budget to encourage that kind of development.</P>

      <P>On balance, there is very little.  Does the Minister believe that <Col N="1205" /> the 12 per cent levy in respect of section 84 is a positive incentive for future investment? If he does he is only fooling himself. If he or the Government think that the levy in this case will be paid by the banking sector they are fooling themselves again.  In every legal document drawn up under section 84 tax-based lending here is a condition at the end which states that if the financial institution concerned is charged any tax on the transaction it will pass it on to the person concerned.  This is what will happen. There are many industries that are just hanging on: they are like somebody balancing on the top of Niagara Falls, they could tip over and be gone forever. Where will such industries find the money?  I am not putting forward a poor mouth for Irish industry.  I simply know how hard-pressed they are.  The Minister need not accept my word only.  A recent report by Stokes Kennedy Crowley on behalf of the IDA showed clearly that the return on sales for native Irish industry is down to 1 per cent.  Yet, there is the sector this Government appear to think has a lot of money to hand over to them.</P>
      <P>Stock relief has been abolished totally and capital allowances have been reduced.  One question that needs clarification is whether the relief for accelerated corporation tax has been removed this year.  The Minister is not saying anything, so I assume that relief is gone.</P>

      <P>This is an area of interest to him and he would know the sitution. I notice that he is smiling now.  I must assume that relief is gone also.  He and the Minister for Finance should realise what ACT has done and will continue to do to Irish industry.  What is happening is positively discriminating in favour of foreign industrialists.  This Government do not know what will be the repercussions of their decisions.  They should discriminate in favour of Irish industry but the reverse is happening. The multinationals will not be affected in <Col N="1206" /> any way by proposals with regard to this tax.  It is one of the reasons why Irish industrialists have joined the corporate emigration to the US, the UK and the Far East.  No longer can they earn a return for their shareholders' money.  The Smurfits, Roadstone, the Rohans, the McInerneys, the Durkans and many other have taken the corporate emigrant ship abroad.  Yet, here we are foolish enough to think we can carry on in the same way and hope for some resurgence in the Irish economy.  It is simply not on.</P>
      <P>There are many other examples of an anti-business bias on the part of the Government.  I see Deputy Allen is leaving the House.  Many positive things could be done and if the Deputy remains I will list them for him.</P>

      <P>That Deputy never goes down to west Cork.  A sum of $45 million has been taken out of west Cork and they did not even get the interest on what that money would earn over the next four years for Bantry.  He will get his answer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1207" /> The Minister could have taken some positive steps by way of this budget that would have been in favour of jobs and job creation. The business expansion scheme, as I said at the time of its inception, was a good idea but it is surrounded by far too many restrictions.  Obviously, the Government took note of what was the case across the water in this area but, unfortunately, as always, we took the worst of the British scheme.  Their business expansion scheme was not restrictive. It was very successful.  As time passed the Treasury plugged various loopholes and added the odd restriction but the scheme continues to be very successful. By contrast, we began at the other end, that is, with the maximum restrictions thereby leaving it virtually impossible for the scheme to succeed. Consequently, only two or three funds have been established in the couple of years of the scheme's operation despite the fact that such development is badly needed by Irish industry.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's efforts to shake up the Stock Exchange.  Dublin Stock Exchange is probably the second oldest in Europe and were it not for the fluctuations in oil shares and in Government gilts in recent years it would hardly be in business at all.  It is one of the most conservative régimes in Dublin.  I trust that the Minister's efforts will prove successful in this area because in this way we would be filling a void in the matter of attracting capital to industry.  However, in terms of this budget there is no positive incentive for anyone to put money into industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy must not have read the statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister would not wish me to point to what is not being said by the Government in so far as the budget is concerned.  Of course we welcome any positive aspect of the budget but I challenge the Minister to deny the fact that the best return for investment is by way either of Government gilts or the Post Office, the areas <Col N="1208" /> that are also the safest and without risk. People cannot be expected to invest their money in high risk situations and when there is very little return.  Risk capital is usually money that has been hard earned and people will not be prepared to invest their profits for a very low rate of return. There seems to be no recognition that business must make profits in order to survive.  There seems to be no acceptance of the fact that the profit of today is the capital of tomorrow and that tomorrow's capital will provide the next day's jobs. If the profit motive does not exist, the capital will not be available either and consequently jobs will not be created.</P>
      <P>The Government could have used the budget to provide incentives for people to provide jobs.  Because of the taxation system industry was forced for too long into using heavy capital instead of labour and the situation is not that much better today.  This is because the employer with a number of staff finds that with levies and the other contributions he will be paying an additional 20 per cent.  Was it any wonder that in the past Irish industry moved towards the use of machinery as opposed to labour when the cost of labour was out of all proportion?</P>
      <P>Another factor in this regard is the effect of social legislation introduced in the seventies.  Any honest trade union official will admit that that legislation is having the opposite effect to what was intended.  I refer in particular to the Unfair Dismissals Act which was introduced by Deputy O'Leary when he was Minister.  It is time that that legislation was reviewed.  Good trade unionists have admitted to me that that legislation is a deterrent to employers to employ people. It appears that we are not prepared to even begin to do anything to help create employment for the 240,000 people who are out of work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government have followed their own roots in relation to how they believe the country's problems should be solved but it is time they asked themselves whether they were on the wrong road.  I do not understand the kind of logic that is trotted out here day after day to the effect that it is good economic policy to <Col N="1209" /> borrow money in order to pay people for doing nothing while a significant amount of that money could be devoted to paying people for doing work that is very necessary. Some of the money would find its way back to the Exchequer anyway.</P>
    <P>I challenge the economic theorists in the Government to deny that if we are ever to make any dent in unemployment or in the serious financial position of the nation we must change our direction. Only two weeks ago, with a county manager I calculated the differential in the income of a county council labourer and of a man with three children on average and depending on social welfare.  The difference was £17 a week.  What kind of logic is that?  We are leaving our people on the unemployment list while, for instance, the county road infrastructure deteriorates daily.  Sooner rather than later some Government will have to invest considerable amounts in restoring the county road network.  Our roads are riddled with potholes that result in breaking springs or the shock absorbers of our cars.  People are wandering around with no purpose in life while for an expenditure of another £17 per week a man could be put to work and even some of that £17 would be recouped by way of taxation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the source of that figure?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>We will not solve our problems if we do not accept that there is another way of dealing with them.  We cannot continue, with a decreasing number of taxpayers, to pay the huge numbers who are out of work.  The Government's economic policies will not work.  After three years they should realise the foolishness of their policies. There are many schemes which could be used to absorb our labour resources.  Such a policy would help towards restoring some confidence into a demoralised workforce.  Our people do not wish to be out of work but the Government do not appear to understand the hardship, the frustration and the despair that goes with unemployment.  If the Government continue to count the cost in terms of pounds, <Col N="1210" /> shillings and pence, they are following a recipe for disaster and perhaps even a challenge to the institutions of the State.</P>
      <P>There is not much time left for the Minister to do something about the problem.  This budget is anti-family, anti-business and anti-saving.  I have demonstrated clearly that it is anti-saving, that it will upset the traditional savings mechanisms. I have also demonstrated that it is anti-business at a time when the manufacturing and commercial sectors are crying out for leadership, guidance, direction and positive thinking.  I wonder if the Government are aware of where the industries of the future are and where investments should be made.  They should recognise that there is a growing future for the financial services based in Ireland.  We made an investment in the communications network some years ago which ensures that we can develop our financial international services market here but we are not doing anything about it.</P>
      <P>Our existing industries have barely been mentioned.  In the macro-economic sense any good businessman could contrast running the country with managing his own firm.  I run my own business and I know what is involved.  The first thing any good businessman would do is to ask himself what assets he has and what use he is making of them.  We have plenty of assets here &mdash; green fields and one of the best climates for producing agricultural products &mdash; but we lower investment in agriculture year after year.  Our seas are full of fish but they are not exploited to the full either.  The Government have been talking for three years about the development of a food industry but nothing has been done about it despite the fact that we import millions of pounds worth of fruit and vegetables.  We are pursuing an industrial policy which needs an urgent review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The life cycle of products in the high tech area is getting shorter and shorter. It used to be three to four years but it is now down to one or less.  Is it right to be putting so much of our resources into that type of industry when the market is changing so fast and the product cycle is <Col N="1211" /> so short?  We will have to devote more of our resources to building up our native industries based on our own raw materials and if we cannot do that the future is very bleak.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>It will not bring a response in jobs overnight, but the Minister will be doing a good job long term if he tackles the problem.  He has been in office for three years now and it is time that there were positive results.  Fundamental structural problems must be tackled and we cannot afford the luxury of one Department saying to another &ldquo;That is my area, keep your nose out of it&rdquo;. Those barriers are no longer acceptable when there is a crisis in employment and where there is so much need to replace imports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I wholeheartedly agree with the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the long term view, but it will not give an immediate return in jobs.  Somebody, sooner or later, must grasp the nettle and start on the road to setting up native Irish industries which will last.  I am not casting any reflections on international investment but it is getting scarcer and more risky all the time.  We should be able to excel in the areas in which we have the raw materials.  I know it will take a big effort in the marketing fields, that there will have to be group marketing efforts on behalf of small industries who would not have the resources to do it themselves and that there will also have to be group distribution.  There is always a place in the market for a high quality product. The price is not always the determining factor &mdash; service, continuation of delivery and excellence of the products will ensure its place on the international market.</P>
      <P>Any businessman looking at Ireland Limited would have to approach it in the manner as I outlined today.  If you are running an industry in a recession and find that your sales are dropping and your overheads increasing, what do you do?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1212" /> You make one of two choices.  You either cut your overheads and stay in business, or leave them as they are and go out of business.  There must be a positive attempt to go for increased production and sales, to reduce unit costs and to preserve the industrial place.  The same logic applies to the economy; but at present it is merely being fiddled around a bit, moving a few figures from here to there.  Government policies and strategies have produced an endless list of business failures and factory closures &mdash; 932 in the first year, 687 in the second year and around the same figure for last year.  That is a terrible indictment of the management of the economy.  You cannot stand aloof and see the industries which should be providing jobs fall apart. If you accept that logic, there will be no base from which to rebuild.  Admittedly, some industries did not move with the times but many good businesses went because they did not receive the attention they deserved when they needed it.  It will take a long time to replace them. Is it any wonder that the Minister for Finance is called the national liquidator? He seems cold-hearted and unresponsive to the crisis which exists.</P>
    <P>The construction industry was hardly mentioned although it is the one industry which can respond fast in creating jobs. It has probably got the hardest knock of all in the recession, with over 50 per cent of building workers previously employed now out of work.  It uses native raw materials for the most part and keeps its money in circulation.  Other small industries depend on it and they are also affected.  Inner city development is not the answer to the problems of the construction industry because there will be no tenants to take up occupancy if the economy does not improve.  Previous Coalition Governments also discriminated against the building and construction industry.  Some people describe it as politics, but I cannot accept that every builder is a Fianna Fáil man.  Some of them must support other parties.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>They are not all Fianna Fáil men.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1213" />
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister could tell the people in the building and construction industry why they are so positively discriminated against.  Do not tell me that there is no work for them to do.  They believe there is something wrong in the Government's thinking in relation to the industry.  The Government should do something about it.  There is plenty of work to be done.  I am not contending that the Government must provide all of the money.  There is plenty of private money available willing to be put, in partnership with Government, into improving our infrastructure in order to improve our road network, to reduce our industrial costs, because they are a factor in our export business.  Why is nobody doing anything about it?  Why do the Government positively discriminate against them when they could respond very quickly to the unemployment crisis obtaining.</P>
      <P>A so-called energy policy has been pursued for the last three years.  That being said one wonders sometimes whether there is an energy policy at all.  We have the natural resource of Kinsale gas.  There has not been even one spur taken off that national pipeline which I started and on which the Minister carried out the weld in 1982.  Nothing has happened since.  The Minister was not sufficiently long in that office to ascertain whether he would have moved better than the man who replaced him.  But the facts are that not a single spur has come off that line in three years. That would have provided an opportunity to create jobs, to earn more revenue for the Exchequer and reduce industrial costs.  For three years the Government have remained inactive with that resource staring them in the face.  They have done nothing with it.  I fail to understand why.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I fail to understand also why the Government have put themselves into a corner with regard to oil exploration. Although the Minister may not admit it, I know that deep down he would agree with what I am saying.  We have followed a policy here for ten years in relation to oil exploration.  But we still have the ideological hang-ups of the past that have <Col N="1214" /> produced nothing for us to date because 50 per cent of nothing is nothing and we end up with nothing.  Until we find oil, prove that it is there and have it commercially explored once, we cannot be bold in regard to what we want or expect from it.  For heaven sake would the Minister rethink in the national interest and endeavour to reach a situation in which we produce oil from one well, then move the terms along on a sliding scale, quite acceptable in the international oil business but which is not acceptable in our situation obtaining, in that we want the oil companies to undertake all the risks without knowing what would be their return at the end of the day.  There was a convoluted response to this situation earlier last year.  We will have an opportunity to elaborate on this matter in a Bill to be introduced shortly in this regard. There is still an attitude of: do nothing, adopt a negative approach, negative thinking.  We tend to think that somebody will solve the problems for us but nobody will.  Therefore there are negative policies in the energy, industrial and taxation areas while we hit the places that might produce the wealth, goods and services on which we are so heavily dependent.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of the anti-business approach of this Government &mdash; in addition to those already mentioned &mdash; is the Valuation Bill before the House.  Its provisions constitute another severe imposition on the business and commercial sector.  From where do people think all this money needed from the industrial and commercial sector will come to keep paying for everybody?  It simply is not there.  It is time we sat down and took a realistic view of ourselves.</P>
    <P>For a start, looking at this budget we should realise that the whole of our concentration has been in the wrong direction. When one examines how expenditure will be allocated and financed in 1986 one is struck by a couple of figures.  For example one sees that the economic services and infrastructure area represents 9 per cent only of total expenditure while service of the public debt represents 21 per cent.  Social services, health, education, social welfare, <Col N="1215" /> housing and subsidies represent 55 per cent with security rising to take up 7 per cent.  We are devoting 9 per cent of our total expenditure in this budget to economic services, the engine of our economy.  Surely we have gone way out of balance?  It is time we began to row back because we are on the road to nowhere.  Therefore is it any wonder that we must borrow £3,500,000 daily to pay for our day-to-day expenses when we allocate money in that fashion?  If we are not prepared to put money into areas that will produce the wealth, employ people who in turn will pay the necessary taxation to maintain all of the other services, then we are merely fooling ourselves.</P>
    <P>We have got ourselves into a situation that is far worse than that of any of the socialist countries in Europe, in which two-thirds of our GNP is being spent by the Government.  There are many socialist countries throughout Europe that do not have that level of intervention on the part of the State.  I have no ideological hang-ups about who does the job best.  I know there is here a role for the private sector, that given the right climate and incentives, the right return on their money, they will undertake that role. There is a role for the State also.  There are many areas in which the State is involved which the private sector could do more efficiently and effectively, thereby saving taxpayers' money.  A combination of both, so that our economy would operate in a mixed fashion, not relying solely on the private enterprise sector and certainly not relying solely on the public sector, but in which both can perform the task they do best and at which they have been most successful in the past.  Regrettably, we have not been that successful in State management with regard to projects or commercial undertakings in the past.</P>
    <P>I repeat: when we accept that we need the best people in the top jobs, that we must pay for them, getting away from the politics of envy that obtains, then only will we get a good job done.  We must realise that we will not achieve that aim with a mediocre man on a mediocre <Col N="1216" /> salary.  That does not obtain in the hard world of today.  We must get rid of the Devlin impositions.  We should not give people a job for the rest of their life. Rather give them a limited contract, they realising full well that if they do not deliver, that will be the end of their job and in the full knowledge that if they do deliver then they will share in the benefits accruing.  Let us adopt an enlightened approach to the management of our public sector enterprises, giving people incentive and opportunity so that they are rewarded for their hard work.  I believe it will be through a combination of incentives that this economy will be seen to work properly.  We must remember that the Irish characteristic is: do not force him to do anything, dangle a carrot in front of him.  Unfortunately, too few people have proved themselves in this country.  Yet we see their magnificent contributions abroad to the development of other economies.</P>
    <P>Until we realise what makes our economy tick, until we fully realise the make-up of the Irish character, then we are wasting our time.  We have seen its fruits over the last three years.  Let us turn the clock back, let us get back on the right road to recovery and incentive.  If this Minister for Finance doggedly holds on to getting his few little figures in place, then our economy will continue to suffer. The sooner he realises that the better.  If he does not realise it now he will if he goes out, as I did this morning, and takes a taxi into work, when he will get the same message I got from the taximan from Inchicore.</P>

      <P>Yesterday's budget was designed to tilt the balance in favour of job creation. While I agree with many of the sentiments expressed by Deputy Reynolds, it would appear to me that he has not read the speech&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Three times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in order to see some of the important measures in the <Col N="1217" /> budget which will assist job creation.  I propose to list ten separate measures in the budget which are designed to tilt the balance in favour of job creation.</P>
      <P>It has been done, firstly, by selective cuts in VAT in employment intensive services which will reduce their cost to the consumer by 13 per cent.  These sectors benefiting from VAT reductions of 13 per cent employ between them at the moment 70,000 people.  The reduction in VAT and ultimately in the price of those services by 13 per cent will, I am confident, lead to thousands of additional jobs being created in this part of the service sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Minister is right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Secondly, the Government have given a further boost to tourism by VAT reductions additional to those already conceded last year on accommodation and car and boat hire. This year the reduction from 23 per cent to 10 per cent is on meals taken in restaurants and a major VAT rebate scheme has been introduced for coach tour operators to which I will refer later in my contribution.  A comprehensive package has been put in place to improve tourism. I might mention that the VAT on meals in restaurants in Ireland at 10 per cent will now be significantly below the European average, giving us a competitive edge where previously we had a competitive disadvantage in that important part of tourism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>It will help them to survive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It will help them to grow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>They have to survive first.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should not promulgate from his influential position the notion of surviving as being the object of business.  Growth is the object of business. Thirdly, major cuts in income tax <Col N="1218" /> have been introduced which are equivalent in value to double what would have been justified by simple indexation of existing allowances and bands.  This will reward effort at all levels.  Fourthly, a substantial additional incentive has been given to people on social welfare, to whom Deputy Reynolds referred, to take up available jobs where previously that was not done.  This is being achieved in two ways in the budget, first by an increase in the family income supplement payment which is available to low paid working families, giving them an advantage over those on social welfare and, secondly, by an increase in children's allowances of 25 per cent to benefit all, while at the same time freezing child allowances on social welfare payments at their 1985 level.  The more generous level of the allowance for children in social welfare payments as against those available to low income families at work with the same number of children had been identified by the NESC as a disincentive to work for some families with a large number of children.  The change in the budget will tilt the balance in favour of work for those families by giving them an increase regardless of whether they are on social welfare.</P>
      <P>Fifthly, a major boost has been given in the budget to both worker or employee shareholding and individual personal shareholding in industry by two methods, first, a new income tax relief on dividends on shares in industry &mdash; I am surprised that Deputy Reynolds did not refer to this&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>While there is anything positive in it, but I said it is only the tip of the iceberg.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;second, a reduced long term capital gains tax rate which will create an active market for shares sold by either individual or employee shareholders in industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>That is only 5 per cent. There is nothing at all in many European countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1219" />
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>This incentive to worker and individual shareholding in industry is in addition to incentives already created, namely, by the introduction of the business expansion scheme and the tax concessions for worker shareholding, and it is alongside restrictions on tax benefits in this budget for saving in certain types of financial institutions. The effect of the budget should be that savings will shift resources from some of these financial institutions where they were not perhaps used to the greatest benefit from the point of view of manufacturing into the direct holding by savers of shares in manufacturing companies themselves where the money will have a much greater job creation than it would in a building society of a life insurance company.</P>
      <P>Sixtly, the budget by a combination of tougher penalties and an amnesty in regard to both tax and social welfare will get people from the black economy back into legitimate trading.</P>
      <P>Seventhly, the budget contains a special tax scheme to promote investment in research and development.  This is accompanied by an increase in the provision by the IDA for research and development grants within their internal budget and will help bring forth a stream of new products to provide extra jobs in the nineties.  Research and development is crucial to the development of indigenous Irish-owned industry.</P>
      <P>Eighthly, the budget by phasing out the excise duty on motor spare parts will help the most labour intensive and domestically beneficial segment of the motor industry, namely the repair market.  By giving an incentive to people to repair their cars rather than replace them we will on the one hand reduce our import bill and on the other hand create employment for people in the motor trade in the repair area where previously those jobs would have been created in car factories in Tokyo or Osaka or some place further afield.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Fords in Cork.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Ninthly, by a restriction <Col N="1220" /> in capital allowances to industry combined with the employment incentive and the recent PRSI concessions for employers taking on additional employees we will shift the balance as far employers or manufacturers are concerned towards meeting any extra demand for goods by additional employment rather than by additional machinery.  Over the last 15 years we have seen evolve a tax code which encouraged employers to replace people by machines by giving grants and tax concessions to the machines and placing income tax on PRSI contributions on the employer if he employed people. This budget by restricting these capital allowances on the one hand and by giving PRSI and incentive concessions for employment on the other is tilting the balance back towards encouraging more employment and less capital substitution for employment.</P>
      <P>Tenthly, we have put a restriction on section 84 financing to industry, which was essentially an incentive to borrowing, combined at the same time with incentives to invest directly in industry, such as the income tax concession on dividends, the special partnership scheme and the business expansion scheme.  By, on the one hand, restricting section 84, which encouraged borrowing, and by giving concessions like the business expansion scheme, the dividend tax relief and the special partnership scheme, we are encouraging people to take in equity and replace borrowing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are improving the financial profile of our industry more in favour of equity and against undue and unhealthy reliance on borrowing, on which such high and volatile interest rates must be paid. We are restructuring our industry in the specific direction signalled in the White Paper on Industrial Policy.  Unfortunately, none of the Deputies opposite has heard the entire list as they have been changing the guard, but these measures are combined with the job creation provisions already provided for in the Estimates for current and capital spending.  For instance, the Estimates provide for a 300 <Col N="1221" /> per cent increase in financial aid for holiday accommodation under the Tourism Vote.  This will ensure that the extra tourists coming to Ireland, as a result of the reductions made in this and in the last budget in value-added tax on meals, accommodation and car hire and boat hire costs, will be able to stay in hotels and guesthouses that are up to the very best international standards.</P>
    <P>Likewise, on the jobs front I am glad to say that there has been a fantastic response to the new house improvement grants introduced last October.  So far 30,000 applications have been received and arrangements will have to be made to take on additional inspectors to deal with all these cases.  I am happy to be able to say that arrangements were made two days ago by the Government for the recruitment of temporary inspectors to deal with the outstanding number of applications, a much greater number than was expected, clearly indicating the wisdom of the Government in introducing a scheme of this kind.  This will give a major boost to employment in the building industry all over Ireland and that boost will be confined solely to those sectors of the building industry that are complying with their taxation responsibilities.</P>
    <P>Nor, as Deputy Reynolds seems to suggest, is the natural resource sector of our economy being neglected in this budget. Since this Government came to office the amount invested in forestry had been significantly increased &mdash; I think by almost 80 per cent &mdash; and we expect a 10 per cent increase in output from the nationally owned forests in 1986 as against 1985 as a result of the investment by this Government.</P>
    <P>The food industry is also a major priority.  Here the Government's aim is to develop new products, based on our farm output, which can be sold direct to shops and restaurants here and in Europe, without the need for subsidy or intervention.  The National Development Corporation will have a lead role in this and institutional arrangements are being made to co-ordinate an overall Irish food <Col N="1222" /> strategy between all the Departments concerned.</P>
    <P>On that issue, our biggest problem as far as our agriculture is concerned is that we are producing far too many goods which languish in cold stores at the expense of the European taxpayer.  The European taxpayer is running out of patience.  There is no long term future for our farmers producing goods for intervention. The pressure on the Common Agricultural Policy is increasing year after year.  If our agricultural and food industry continues to depend as it does to such an unhealthy extent, on intervention and export subsidies to third countries, irrespective of exports which could not take place without a general subsidy from the European taxpayer, then there is no future for food and agriculture in this, what should be the most agriculturally dominant country in Europe.  We must change radically the direction and thrust of our food industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>That means producing products and organising our farmers in such a way that they are able to produce products that can be sold direct or after processing, without the intervention of any EC aid of any kind, to a retailer for sale to the consumer.  I have taken a special interest in this since I became Minister and, with the aid of the Irish Goods Council, I have organised a series of meetings with the major retailing groups here to get them to help Irish food manufacturers to develop products that can be sold direct to the Irish consumer. Surely, if you cannot please the Irish consumer with your food products, you have little chance of pleasing the British or continental consumer.  I am glad to say that as a result of these initiatives one of the major food retailing chains, one of the largest of our supermarkets, have been able to tell me that since I initially raised this matter with them and since they engaged in intensive consultation with the food industry at my request, they have been able to treble the number of Irish products that they are carrying <Col N="1223" /> under their own brand lable &mdash; in other words, reduce substantially the amount of goods that were previously being imported because they were not being produced to adequate quality here.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, it is pointed out by many that there exists a degree of duplication and or confusion of objective between a number of State agencies and Departments in the food area with, I believe, three Government Departments being directly involved and a larger number of agencies.  I am glad to say that agreement has been reached, as a result of consideration of a report prepared by a group of Ministers of State in respect of the food industry, on new arrangements to ensure that maximum value is achieved from all Government activity in the food area and that total co-ordination of effort is obtained.</P>
      <P>These two initiatives, on the second of which details will be announced later, will, I believe, prove to give very great hope and new direction to the food industry.  I would urge, as I have already done, the farming organisations to devote their attention to the economic organisation of farmers, to finding out how Irish agriculture can be re-orientated towards producing goods direct for the supermarkets here and in Britain and away from engaging in personality style politics which are typified by the current spate of resolutions reflecting on the person of Deputy Austin Deasy, Minister for Agriculture. That type of personality politics may achieve short term headlines in the local press but it does nothing for the true cause of farmers.  That cause will properly be furthered if farming organisations, in a co-operative vein with politicians of all colours, seek to develop their interests to the full and put us in a position where we can compete with the rest of the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Small industry is more effective in creating and sustaining jobs than large industry &mdash; this is true, too, in other countries. The measures in the budget, which are synchronised with the existing business expansion scheme and the launch next month of an over-the-counter market, will provide a whole new source <Col N="1224" /> of equity funds to boost investment and expansion by small industry.  Additionally, the IDA are putting more staff into the small industry effort all over Ireland. this is all consistent with the shift in emphasis in the White Paper of Industrial Policy from external to indigenous industry.  The provision through the BES the OTC scheme and the dividend and special partnership concessions in the budget of a large new source of private funds for industry will enable State grants from the IDA to be gradually reduced.  I want everyone to own a share in industry so that the savings of the Irish people, rather than the Government, will be the main investment source for new manufacturing activity.</P>
    <P>I hope that the activities of the Government, of me and my Department, and of the Minister for Finance, during the last three years, will be seen to be part of a consistent trend in policy development. To digress from my prepared remarks, I wish to refer briefly to this.  We want to see a position where no longer will any industrialist wanting to expand his business consider two things only: borrowing money from a bank or getting an IDA grant; in other words, capital on which he must pay interest whether he makes money or not.  I would prefer to see a reduction in both bank borrowing and reliance on State grants.  I should like to see these being replaced by private equity provided either by workers in industries or outsiders who want to invest in productive capital.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Or by the NDC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Or the National Enterprise Agency.  Equity is put in on the basis that, if there is a profit, there will be a dividend.  Therefore, in a good year money will be paid out when an industry can afford to pay it out; but, if there is no profit, of course there will be no dividend.  There are bad years in any business activity, like the electronics industry at the moment.  In bad years there would not be a drain on a business: no dividend would be paid, the money would stay in to help the company to survive through <Col N="1225" /> a bad patch.  Patient money that will be left there to wait for its return is much preferable to reliance on borrowing at high interest rates.  Unfortunately, that has been the short term, unwise route taken by our manufacturers.  All statistics indicate that overreliance on bank borrowing increased steadily during the last 17 or 18 years.  This is beginning to be reversed as a result of Government measures and I will illustrate what we have done.  First of all, we introduced a tax concession for worker shareholders: we permitted them to allow some of their wages to stay in the company so that they could get dividends later on.  We introduced a business expansion scheme to encourage private investors with some income to spare, to put it into industry: we gave them complete freedom from paying any income tax on that money in the year in which they put it into industry. In this budget we introduced a scheme so that if people invest in industry, which is paying only 10 per cent corporation tax, the individuals who receive dividends from that company will get a substantial tax concession in regard to their personal income tax.  Previously, the company paid 10 per cent but if it declared a dividend the private investor had to pay the full 60 per cent tax on it.  That meant that individuals did not bother to invest in industry because of the high rate of tax on their dividends.  Because of this budget, individuals will have a direct income tax incentive through the business expansion scheme: they will pay a lower rate of tax on dividends than on any other form of income.  A major shift is being sought away from bank borrowing and towards investment in industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are some who will claim insufficient progress has been made in reducing borrowing by the Government.  It will be claimed that public expenditure is too high.  I do not dismiss these criticisms, but it is worth recalling some facts.  This year the current budget deficit will be 7.4 per cent of GNP as against 8.2 per cent last year.  Yet, if the cost of servicing debts from previous years did not have to be met this year, we would actually have a budget surplus of about 3 per cent <Col N="1226" /> of GNP in 1986.  Without debt servicing we would have a budget surplus.  This illustrates how much present budgetary strategy is constrained by two things: past borrowing and dramatic increase in real interest rates since 1980.</P>
    <P>Back in 1980 interest rates were lower than the rate of inflation, so those who borrowed made gains at the expense of those who saved.  Interest rates were negative and borrowing was effectively subsidised.  Now, as a result of international trends, and as every householder knows, interest rates are much higher than the rate of inflation.</P>
    <P>Those who save are gaining at the expense of those who borrow.  Saving is subsidised and borrowing penalised.  This has hit the Exchequer in the same way it has hit thousands of ordinary householders with mortgages.  The Government have had to pay a hugely increased interest bill just to remain at the same level or at a level of spending on items other than interest.  Many of those who make sweeping statements about cutting spending fail to realise how much of what we send is interest and is therefore beyond any short term control.  No amount of analysis can get around that reality.</P>
    <P>The Government's options for cutting spending are also narrow in other areas. The only area, apart from interest payments, to show a significant increase in Government spending as a share of GNP since 1980 is in social welfare payments. Increased spending on social welfare is mainly due to an increased rate of entry of young people to the labour force in the last few years.  This increase in the number of young people seeking jobs is not the result of Government policy but was predetermined by the increase in the birth rate in the early sixties long before most of us were Members of this House.</P>
    <P>The real scandal in relation to unemployment is what happened in the seventies when it was entirely foreseeable, because of the numbers then in primary school and those entering secondary school being much greater than had been the case ten years previously, that we would have an employment crisis in the <Col N="1227" /> eighties.  What did we do then?  I was a Member of the House and a junior member of the Government for much of that time so I am not exculpating myself. In the seventies when we should have been running a budget surplus and setting aside a sinking fund to be available to meet the foreseeable unemployment crisis in the eighties, we ran substantial budget deficits culminating in the 1977 election manifesto, where we rapidly dissipated any money we would have had and ran up debts that would have to be met in the eighties.  Instead of passing on resources to the generation of the eighties, to deal with the foreseeable unemployment problem, we passed on debts much greater than those that were passed on to the generation of the seventies to make it even more difficult than it would otherwise be to cope with an entirely foreseeable unemployment crisis.</P>
    <P>When I hear Opposition Deputies expressing mock surprise and wringing their hands at the unemployment problem and at the difficulties the Government now face and at the large increases in social welfare payments, I would remind them that it was foreseeable ten years ago and that many of them did nothing about it and only condemned the Government of the day when they made any attempt to rein in Government spending so that money would be available for the eighties.</P>
    <P>The Government have little room for manoeuvre in relation to the rate of increase in social welfare payments which has substantially exceeded the rate of increase in take-home pay.  For instance, since 1980 the old age pension has increased by almost twice as much as the take-home pay of somebody at work yet that pension is being met out of the income of those at work.  Many people will concentrate their criticism of social welfare on those who are unemployed.  It is recognised in the budget that single people drawing unemployment assistance are least benefited by this budget.  I have no idea how a single person living alone, can live on the present rate of <Col N="1228" /> unemployment assistance.  While there are areas where we are probably spending more than we can afford on social welfare, certainly long term unemployment assistance is not one of them.  Within the very modest resources available to the Government we have given a slightly larger increase to those who are long term unemployed than to other beneficiaries. That was a reasonable thing to do.</P>
    <P>Many look at public sector pay as a major determinant of public spending and assume that the Government pay policy is responsible for much of the tax that must be raised.  Since this Government took office they have kept public sector pay at a reasonable level by comparison with experience in the past and with outside employments.  We have also achieved a reduction of 8 per cent in public service numbers, a greater reduction in public service numbers than was achieved in Britain by Mrs. Thatcher and a Conservative Government who have been campaigning against the public sector and in favour of reductions in public sector numbers and services since 1979, well before this Government took office.  We achieved that reduction as a result of the embargo I introduced in July 1981.</P>
    <P>As a result of the reduction in numbers and the successful restraint on pay, while public expenditure grew by 12 points as a proportion of GNP since 1980, pay only represented 0.7 points and interest on social welfare payments represented 5 points for each of the 12 points increase in public expenditure.  When people talk about the increase in public expenditure they should recognise that the biggest single increase has been in interest payments and in social welfare payments. Yet most of the debate about cuts in public spending is concentrated on the little portion that has only represented, since 1980, a total share of national income of less than 2 points &mdash; subsidies non-pay services, and pay.  Those who make sweeping and trite statements and applause-drawing calls for reductions in public spending should not only be asked to say what they have in mind but should <Col N="1229" /> recognise where the main increases have been and not concentrate all their attention on areas where relatively few real increases occurred.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the introduction of a VAT rebate on the cost of coaches. To date foreign coach operators in Ireland have been gaining a competitive advantage over Irish based operators because a lower rate of VAT applied in their countries.  Consequently, they were able to take business from Irish operators in Ireland.  I am glad to say that the rebate scheme introduced in the budget will remove VAT.  As a result of this concession to the tourist industry and the reduction of VAT on meals I had discussions last night with the Irish Tourist Industry Confederation with a view to ensuring that they would use these concessions to the full.  I said two things to them.  First, I told them that I wanted restaurant owners who will benefit from the VAT reduction this year, and the hoteliers, car and boat hire operators who benefited from a VAT reduction last year, to use some of that money to put together attractive package holidays for people coming here.  We do not sell enough package holidays into Ireland.  We expect people who come here to make their own arrangements.  Unfortunately, many people when faced with the choice of going to Ireland where they would have to make arrangements themselves or going to another destination where everything is packaged for them and where they will get a reduction, will choose the easier option of going to the place where there is a package holiday available.</P>
    <P>I hope, now that VAT is lower on meals in Ireland than it is on average in European countries, now that VAT is lower on hotel accommodation, car and boat hire than it is in many countries in Europe, that the operators who are benefiting from this will offer package holidays overseas.  I hope they, or their representatives, will go overseas to sell the Irish tourist market.  The notion that Bord Fáilte can do all the selling out there and that all the people in the business here have to do is to sit in their hotel or guest house and wait for tourists to come <Col N="1230" /> to the door is one that will not lead to maximum success in tourism.</P>
    <P>One of the big points stressed in the White Paper on tourism &mdash; the first White Paper on that industry to be published by a Government in the history of the State &mdash; is that hoteliers, guesthouse owners and others engaged in the tourist industry should join together in marketing groups. If they cannot go overseas to meet foreign tour operators they at least should send a representative of their group to all the major tourist workshops overseas.  They should start promoting Ireland themselves rather than relying, as they have done in the part, on Bord Fáilte to do that job for them.</P>
    <P>The second point I made to the Irish Tourist Industry Confederation was that I would be monitoring with extreme care what happens to the price of meals in restaurants from 1 July.  I want to see the entire 13 per cent reduction&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be doing it through my agents who, luckily, as a result of an order I made, do not have to go into the restaurants to see the price charged.  As a result of an order I made 18 months ago restaurants are now required to publish their menu at the door.  One knows what one will have to pay before one goes in.  That facility will be available to my inspectorate and there will be no need to give them a more generous eating out allowance to carry out the price survey that is necessary to ensure that restaurant owners pass on in full the entire benefit of the 13 per cent VAT concession to the consumer from 1 July, the peak of the holiday season.  I have no doubt that that move will be of great benefit to the tourist industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish Tourist Industry Confederation fully supported the points I made and undertook to give their 100 per cent co-operation.  We are very lucky to have now, unlike some years ago, a confederation representing all the interests in the tourist industry to speak with one voice for the industry.  The result of that single <Col N="1231" /> voice can be seen in the fact that in the last two budgets there were unprecedented concessions to that industry.  Its case is much better understood than it was when it was represented by numerous groups.</P>
    <P>Many have argued that the high rates of capital gains tax have been a disincentive to people to invest and that people who invest in manufacturing appreciate very much that the corporation has a 10 per cent corporate tax rate and that under the business expansions scheme they can put in up to £25,000 and not pay any tax on that in the year in question.  I am sure they also appreciate very much that as a result of the budget they will get a tax concession on the income they receive in dividends from the investment in manufacturing when previously they had to pay at the full marginal tax rate.  They may appreciate all those things but one of the things that motivates people to invest in a share in a manufacturing company is that when they need to they can sell it without having too much capital gain, the increase in the asset value, clawed back in the form of capital gains tax.</P>
    <P>I am glad to say that the budget, in addition to the concessions I have mentioned, also contains a provision reducing the maximum capital gains tax rate on long term gains from 40 per cent to 35 per cent.  That will make it attractive to people to invest in manufacturing industries and to realise their gains.  Buying a share in an industry and leaving it in the same company for years is not the best way for one to use one's money or for industry to benefit from it.  We must have a market in which people are prepared not only to buy but also to sell shares, to move money from less successful to more successful companies so that a process of selection ensures that those with the best possible prospects get the most money. That implies not creating an undue penalty on people at the time they sell a share.  I accept that there is roll-over relief but we must encourage shares to be turned over from one use to another. <Col N="1232" /> I am glad to say that the reduction in capital gains tax will assist in that direction.</P>
    <P>Much comment which was justified has centred on the difficulty as far as industry is concerned of attracting sufficiently talented personnel to work at senior level in Irish companies in view of the high level of income tax obtaining there.  We have reduced the maximum rate of 65 per cent to 60 per cent and, in yesterday's budget, that was reduced further to 58 per cent.  Obviously, that will be of help in attracting senior personnel to the country. That is of benefit to everybody whether they are engaged in a productive sector or not.  There are limits to the benefits, as far as top tax rates are concerned, that one can give without creating a sense of inequity at lower levels. Many of the beneficiaries will be people in protected sections of the economy, perhaps in some of the professions, where it is hard to argue that they are making any net wealth contribution.  They are, perhaps, assisting people to survive a little longer but it is hard to say that they are always contributing to the wealth generating sector of the economy.  That suggests that perhaps something should be done to give a special concession or attraction to people directly involved at senior management positions at internationally acceptable salaries in wealth generating companies.  Failure to do this has, it is argued, and I am sure it is true, contributed to a brain drain of some of the better managers of our companies. People who were working at a high level in an Irish subsidiary of a multinational have in some cases been attracted to work for that multinational somewhere else in the world thereby creating some loss as far as Ireland was concerned.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the Government have decided &mdash; and this will be dealt with in the Finance Bill &mdash; to clarify the position in regard to stock options for such employees.  In the recent past there has been a degree of uncertainty as to how the Revenue would interpret the law in regard to stock options and this uncertainty has let to a underutilisation of this <Col N="1233" /> instrument which is ideally suited to the encouragement and the provision of additional remuneration for people in key positions in industry because it is related to the performance of the company.  The value of the stock option depends on whether the company are making a profit.  If the company are simply paying a high salary but losing money the stock option is not worth anything.  If, however, as a result of the expertise and work of the manager the company are making a lot of money, the stock option will be worth more.  That means that there is a selective system for rewarding successful managers of successful companies.  I am looking forward to the provision in the Finance Bill which will make such systems more attractive for use in this country and will address one of the problems we faced whereby people tended to leave this country when they reached very high positions of management in industry.</P>
    <P>Deputy Reynolds criticised the operation of the business expansion scheme.  I should like to point out that since this scheme was introduced in 1984 more than £4.5 million has been invested in industry in 30 companies qualifying under this scheme.  That is a significant investment for a scheme which was entirely new and in respect of which tax practitioners were relatively unfamiliar.  The scheme has been improved; and when people become more familiar with it much larger sums will be invested, thereby replacing grants and bank borrowing by equity in industry.</P>
    <P>There has also been some doubt expressed about how the business expansion scheme would interact with the soon to be launched over-the-counter market for shares in the Stock Exchange, something which, as Deputy Reynolds acknowledged, I pressed the Stock Exchange to introduce in order to provide a suitable means of attracting share capital for smaller industries who could not afford the expense of a full quotation which would be suitable for a large company like Carrolls.  Doubt had been expressed as to whether companies raising finance on the over-the counter <Col N="1234" /> market would be eligible to do so under the terms of the business expansion scheme.  This is because the scheme stated that in order to qualify for business expansion schemes, companies must be unquoted companies &mdash; in other words, not companies fully on the Stock Exchange.  People were uncertain as to whether unquoted as a qualification would exclude companies quoted on the over-the-counter market.  I am pleased, therefore, to inform the House, and through it the industrial community, that the Revenue Commissioners have assured me that their interpretation of the meaning of the term &ldquo;unquoted&rdquo; in the legislation does not exclude companies raising finance under the Stock Exchange's new over-the-counter market.  That should mean that the business expansion scheme will now take off because it will be linked to a global market, namely, the over-the-counter market, whereas previously people had to invest in individual schemes or companies without any overall body promoting the entire concept of equity investment under the scheme.</P>

      <P>Last October the OECD published a special study carried out, at my request, into innovation policy in Ireland today.  They suggested that there should be a more selective industrial incentive, that State resources should be shifted from fixed asset investment to the acquisition of technology and marketing development.  Generally speaking, they endorsed what was already in the White Paper.  I have been further examining this report &mdash; I set up a small group chaired by the Secretary of my Department to examine it &mdash; who came up with a number of recommendations arising from the OECD innovation study.  One of these recommendations was the introduction of a special partnership scheme for investment in research and development in companies. That was announced in the budget yesterday and is a direct result of the suggestion of the group which I established to study <Col N="1235" /> the innovation report prepared by the OECD.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also expect to be able to announce certain other initiatives during the year arising from the OECD study, initiatives which can be achieved within the existing budget of my Department.  One initiative on which I expect to be giving more details in the near future is a major review, independently carried out, of the way the Government assist research and development in industry at present.  The Industrial Development Authority give a quite substantial amount of money each year for research and development.  I should like to find out whether this and other money devoted to research and development in industry is achieving a sufficient level of autonomous self-regenerating research and product development in Irish industry; or are these grants simply being used to top up a package of financial assistance to make it acceptable to a promoter?  Are research and development grants merely residual, or are they the driving force behind product development?  It should be a driving force rather than a residual force.  I hope that the independent study of the IDA's research and development grant scheme and other State aid to research and development which I have just announced will lead to a significant improvement in the level of research and development activity in Irish industry.  I am convinced that it is through research and development in Ireland by Irish companies that we can get into a situation where we will not have to reply, as in the past, to an undue extent on foreign companies who have done their research and development elsewhere and then established plants here which have no autonomous life of their own and which, as soon as the product they produce goes off the market, are liable to close.  If, on the other hand, we have Irish companies based in Ireland conducting their own research and development and developing new products all the time &mdash; and this is true of multinationals here &mdash; then we will have the basis for continuous self-regenerating growth in industry.  That must and will be one of <Col N="1236" /> the major aims of the independent study of our research and development activity in industry to which I have just referred.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I find myself very often agreeing with sentiments expressed by the Minister, Deputy Bruton, and I agree with many of the specific suggestions and initiatives which he mentioned this morning.  I wish him success with them.  I often wonder why a lot more is not coming through and if he is getting the assistance and support he deserves in some of these schemes.  I have no hesitation in welcoming the over-the-counter market and business expansion scheme which he has just announced.  This is exactly the kind of thinking we need but there will be difficulties with it because the legislation says the investment has to be for five years.  The Minister said it is important to be able to turnover investment to get a lively market, but the legislation says the investment has to be locked in for five years and, without amending the Finance Bill, the Minister will find it very hard to get over that difficulty.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned a new deal in the area of research and development.  I have no difficulty in welcoming that but there is a dilemma there because there are substantial grants available for technology transfer, that is basically buying in technology.  We have to make up our minds: are we going to buy in the technology or R and D it at home, or is there a contradiction there?</P>

      <P>The Minister mentioned stock options for successful managers.

I look forward to seeing detailed proposals on that and examining this matter further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1237" /> The budget also mentioned the reduction in tax on dividends for manufacturing companies, but it did not mention how much the reduction would be. Before the Minister for Finance decides on that, it would be very important that we have the fullest details because it is only putting back something which was there before.  Before the 10 per cent manufacturing tax came in, if a person got a dividend from a manufacturing company it was tax free.  I grant that was unduly generous, but when the 10 per cent came in, there was full income tax on the dividend paid by the manufacturing company.  What the Minister is doing here is putting things back to where they were two years ago.  One of the key ways to get manufacturing industry going is to make the investors' return reasonably satisfactory.  If that is done, he will give manufacturing industry a substantial boost.  I wanted to make those few positive comments and suggestions on the points the Minister raised because if they can be included in the Finance Bill they will give us a bit of a lift off.  I digressed in case the Minister has to leave the House but I will now deal with the budget.</P>
    <P>I want to quote what the Taoiseach said in 1984 immediately after the publication of the national plan, <i>Building On Reality</i>.  He said that for too long successive Governments tended to promise what they could not deliver.  He went on to say that the present Government plan did not do this.  He said it was a sober, realistic and thorough statement of what is possible. On the next page he said that the aims of the national plan are to halt and reverse the upward spiral of unemployment &mdash; I do not have to remind the House what happened in that area. Unemployment has increased by 60,000; to halt the rise in the burden of taxation on the community at large &mdash; I do not have to remind the House that that figure has been increased by £270 million in this budget; to bring our public finances under control so that public debt and its remuneration no longer appropriate and increasing share of our natural resources.  It is clear from these comments that the <Col N="1238" /> Taoiseach felt successive Governments had promised too much but had not delivered. He went on to suggest that his plan would deal with unemployment, taxation and the public finances.  Under each of these headings today it is clear that none of those targets has been reached and none of those promises has been fulfilled. I do not make that point with any satisfaction because this country belongs to all of us and it is sad that we have not met those targets.</P>
    <P>This is a vulnerable budget.  It is vulnerable to oil costs, interest rates and exchange rates.  It is that very vulnerability which has given the Government the breathing space to give some tax reliefs. This is welcome.  I warn the Government that if this budget's vulnerability has allowed them to make a little break in that area, that vulnerability can go wrong very quickly and suddenly &mdash; interest rates can change, oil costs can change and exchange rates can change.  If that happens, and if we are all standing here in January 1987, I think we will be saying that this budget, and the premise on which it was founded, will be thrown out of gear completely.</P>
    <P>The income tax take has increased by £217 million over what was intended. This budget clearly budgets for higher unemployment &mdash; a figure of £9.2 million. I take from that that the Government are saying there will be 3,000 extra people unemployed over the figure predicted.  I have to remind the Government that they did this last year also.  What happened was that instead of increasing by 3,000, the unemployment figure went up by 15,000.  The Government came back to this House a few months ago looking for a Supplementary Estimate of £50 million for unemployment.  Therefore, I sincerely question this figure of £9 million for unemployment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will go into figures another time but the figure I have is for a total of £48 million in the Supplementary Estimate.  The budget spoke about an extra 3,000 to 4,000 unemployed, but the figure increased by 15,000 more than was budgeted for.  Last year the Government budgeted for an average of 215,000 unemployed.  The figure is getting close to 250,000; that is a long way from 215,000. Clearly provision had to be made for these higher figures and there must have been a Supplementary Estimate for a substantial figure.</P>
      <P>This budget signified the final abandonment of the targets in the national plan. I do not have to stitch that in because it has been said many times from all sides of the House.  This budget shows a total borrowing of £22 billion, which will be approximately £24 billion by the end of 1987, £26 billion by the end of 1988 and increasing at the rate of almost £2 billion a year.  A sum of £800 million additional borrowing has come from abroad.</P>
      <P>The budget also shows that current expenditure is continuing to rise to nearly £8 billion this year.  Despite all the planning, analysis and commitment, which I accept is genuine, current public spending is heading inextricably towards £8 billion.  It is clear that, as a nation, we have not made any progress in that area and we will have to try to do something about that.  I would be extremely critical of this budget in the area of capital spending. It is proposed that capital spending this year will be £987 million.  In 1982 the figure was £700 million.  At this stage of our development it does not make sense to cut capital expenditure.  It is bad economics and is depressing activity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People accuse Opposition Members of being reckless when they call for additional spending but independent authorities support this proposal.  For example, the 1985 annual report of the EC Commission on the Irish economy made the following comment with regard to <Col N="1240" /> capital spending.  They recommended that the Irish budget be restructured so as to increase public investment particularly in infrastructure, in environmental control and in urban renewal.  The report also said that a considerable backlog of needs have been built up in recent years that could be met with spare capacity in the building industry.  That independent and respected source advocated to the Government not to cut capital expenditure but to find projects that had a payback element.  Studies have shown that in the three areas mentioned by the EC the projects pay for themselves, that there is a reward for investment and that they are not a drain on the taxpayer. Many independent sources have reiterated this view.  Therefore, I am not taking the easy Opposition line of advocating additional expenditure.  I am taking the practical line of agreeing with the EC that we made a major policy error in cutting capital expenditure.  Today's cut in capital expenditure will be tomorrow's unemployment; this year's cut in capital expenditure will be next year's dole queues.  I strongly urge that the policy be reversed and that the advice of the EC be taken.</P>
    <P>I can see why the Government acted in this way.  Politically it is easier to cut capital spending because sometimes it takes generations before anyone notices what has happened.  However, if one cuts current expenditure one has a mob outside the gate within hours and the telephone rings constantly with complaints. In this instance the Government took the easier course.  Where is the political courage about which we have been lectured by the Minister for Finance?  It is necessary that we keep a tight grip on current spending while increasing the amount of capital spending at least to the level of four years ago.  I put this forward as a constructive suggestion to the Government.  It is important that we make the investment now so that the Government of the day will not have to face major problems in 1988 and 1989.</P>
    <P>A fresh approach is needed to tackle the critical economic problems facing the country.  It is all the more disturbing that <Col N="1241" /> in the budget the Government are committed to adhering to the assumptions and targets of the economic plan which all independent commentators now agree is way off target and should be abandoned. There is a reasonably positive alternative.  World economic conditions now favour a new direction in our economic policy.  For example, oil prices are lower and, assuming that the Government allow Irish industry to benefit from that fall, this should be most beneficial to the economy.  Lower oil prices will help to reduce inflation.  Economic growth in the United States has resumed again and this should be of assistance to us.  I want us to take full advantage of this favourable external environment by implementing creative and imaginative policies in the areas of employment, Government spending, debt management, industrial and energy policy, agricultural development, the promotion of service industries and taxation policy.</P>
    <P>A major part of our economic problem is the growth in Government spending in the past ten or 15 years.  That spending now exceeds 60 per cent of GNP, a degree of interventionism for which there is no mandate from the taxpayers.  In turn, this has necessitated even larger increases in taxation but even they have not been sufficient to prevent recourse to borrowing which is without parallel in any other western industrial country.  We owe £22 billion, more than the entire output of the economy in a full year.</P>
    <P>Interest payments to the rest of the world are absorbing about one-third of total PAYE tax receipts.  It is futile to try to tackle all these problems in a piecemeal way.  It is not possible to reduce the current budget deficit without simultaneously tackling tax reform and implementing pro-employment policies.  The Government tried to do this but unemployment has risen by some 60,000 and this year the deficit is larger than ever at more than 8 per cent of GNP.  If the Government had merely contained unemployment at the level obtaining when they came to power they would <Col N="1242" /> already have achieved a target of a deficit equivalent to 5 per cent of GNP.</P>
    <P>We need a new economic direction and we need to re-establish confidence.  I have always stood for a pro-enterprise, wealth creating philosophy as the basis for implementing the social policies we must have. We need to hold back Government intervention. We cannot afford the size of Government we have built up over many years.  It has led directly to a high tax level and excessive debt.  It has pushed out the private sector from the productive high ground of the Irish economy, it has led to the Government monopolising the financial markets, pushing credit out of the reach of many domestic firms.  Most of all, Government itself is inefficient in terms of achieving national economic and social goals.  We must examine existing expenditure programmes, devolving responsibility where possible to the private sector and holding, and then reducing, the numbers employed in a smaller but in perhaps a more highly organised and motivated public sector.</P>
    <P>The one sure way to a better balance in public finance, and consequently to a lower tax and debt ratio, is by means of high growth.  We need to grow out of this crisis.  It does not make any sense to try to reduce the deficit when the only effect is to push up public spending on unemployment benefits.  Resources are lying idle.  Our young people who are our greatest resource are emigrating in record numbers.  We must use all our resources and in so doing we will help to reduce our debt.  We must give priority to obtaining growth in the economy and the fruits of that growth must be used to reduce indebtedness rather than for consumption.  In practice, this means increasing investment that will lay the basis for future prosperity.  That is why I am so worried about this cutback in capital spending because it runs contrary to the philosophy I am outlining today.</P>
    <P>We need specific measures to tackle our debt problem.  We should emphasise to people the relationship between our excessive levels of debt and associated problems, such as high taxation.  For example, I should like to see a separate <Col N="1243" /> fund to manage Government and semi-State external borrowing, a fund which would be charged with devising a programme to reduce external debt and in respect of which there would be a report to the Dáil every six months specifically on the progress made in regard to that debt management.  Future borrowing should be limited to productive purposes and mainly to capital purposes and there should be a prohibition on increasing debt at a rate in excess of the projected growth in GNP.</P>
    <P>It is important to point out that a number of the states in the US have made amendments to the Constitution in recent years rendering it unconstitutional for the Government of the state concerned, of whatever colour, to increase borrowing beyond a certain percentage of growth in the economy.  This has been done in five or six of the states and seems to be progressing reasonably well.</P>
    <P>I urge the Government to take note of that experiment with a view to deciding on whether it might work here also.  We need a new style of industrial policy, one that will be consistent with reducing Government expenditure.  We need less intervention.  We need a drastic pruning of tax incentives for capital spending and tax expenditures.  These would be taxes that would be foregone.  Foreign industries here would much prefer it we had a better managed economy and fewer grants as opposed to an economy that is weighed down by debt.  The major thrust of policy should be towards generating employment and fostering domestic entrepreneurship rather than the making available of capital grants as such.  If we are to give grants they should be for people and not for machines.  If we are to reward firms the reward should be for their employing more people.  We need to encourage domestic industries based on developing our natural resources and using the technology developed in other countries that can afford to spend large sums on research and development.  In that regard I welcome the IDA's new emphasis on technology transfer.  This should be of assistance to the economy.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1244" /> We need also a proper expansion of the venture capital scheme because there remain far too many firms who have been saddled with bank debt from their inception and who have no chance of survival because of that position.  We need measures to encourage multinational firms to reinvest their profits here, not in Government debt but directly in Irish industry. It is worth pointing out that something of the order of £1 billion was repatriated in the past 12 months from foreign multinationals operating in Ireland.  That is an enormous sum of money for the economy to lose.  There must be a way of attracting these corporations to leave their money here instead of removing it to their headquarters elsewhere.  But the Government scheme whereby foreign companies are urged to lend money to the Government here in return for a special deal is not the answer.  I understand that, though announced about six months ago, that scheme has not been put into operation yet.</P>
    <P>We need, too, greatly increased resources into marketing.  Even a small increase in our share of world markets would result in thousands of additional jobs in this economy.  We have access only to one quarter of 1 per cent of the total world market.  If that were increased to even ½ of 1 per cent our economy would be transformed in a few short years.  That is why we should invest much greater resources in that area.  If we cannot bring down our costs we must increase our sales and we do that by putting this new emphasis that I am urging on marketing. There are plenty of new markets to be conquered.  The Chinese market, for example, has not been touched yet so far as this country is concerned.  That is an area of substantial opportunity.</P>
    <P>In addition, we need new investment in the food industry.  I support what the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism had to say in that regard. There is no justification for continued discrimination against some types of service industries.  I have in mind, for example, medical, finances, information and services of that nature.  It is in this area <Col N="1245" /> as much as in manufacturing that lie our hopes for meeting the employment challenge. Why can we not have a similar type of tax regime for the service industry as we have for manufacturing industry?  I am not saying that this should apply to every service industry but it could apply in the case of a broad range of useful service industries.  I am putting that forward as a suggestion because any such change would go a long way towards paying for itself by way of increased employment.</P>
    <P>We cannot continue to pay out £600 million or £700 million a year in unemployment benefit and assistance.  Since the Government came to power almost £2 billion has been paid out under this heading.  We would not have an economic crisis if we had that money working in the economy together with the PAYE revenue that would accrue from the employment that the money would generate.  We cannot afford unemployment. That is why we must assist particularly service industries, those that are labour-related and labour-intensive. That is how we put people back to work and subsequently reduce our budget deficit.  This, in turn, would result in lower taxation levels which would mean greater investment but we must start with the problem of unemployment.  I suggest that we begin by launching an imaginative taxation regime for the service industries. I am not convinced that the long term benefit of this nation lies in manufacturing industry.  Neither am I convinced that the lower cost countries will not wipe us out in the next decade or so in terms of manufacturing industry but I am convinced that what will continue will be the service industries, those industries that will service the new industries springing up throughout Europe.</P>
    <P>It is typical of the negative thinking of recent years that discussion on farming has focused on taxation rather than on the creation of wealth within farming.  Of course, the farming community must pay their fair share of taxation.  That is what we all support but it must happen in an organised way.  However, at the same time let us have some wealth creating, <Col N="1246" /> employment policies in regard to agriculture and in regard to creating jobs from our land resources.  I wholeheartedly support what the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism had to say in this regard.  It is not good enough anymore that one of our greatest assets, our agricultural land, is used merely for the purpose of making a living for those directly involved in it.  Our land is a natural resource of the nation and we must ask ourselves how we turn that resource into jobs.  I say that we proceed along the lines the Minister is talking about in trying to take the food processing industry off its knees though we have not succeeded in that respect up to now.  I do not understand why, with all these schemes of successive Governments down through the years, we have not had success in that area.  It is an area of tremendous scope and opportunity.</P>
    <P>Along with the other areas I have been pointing to, I include this area in my efforts to be positive in my criticism of this budget because these are the areas in which I believe there is room for movement. The Government would have the support of this side of the House for any leaps they might take in the area of services, agriculture, marketing or venture capital.  I strongly advocate that the Government take those leaps and that they take note of the comments I have been making about capital spending.</P>
    <P>I am committed to an immediate and comprehensive programme of tax reform along the lines set out by the Commission on Taxation.  The present system is inequitable and inefficient and blocks the economic growth we need to break out of the vicious circle in which this economy is trapped at present.  Average and marginal tax rates on both single and married people are at levels that cannot be justified on economic, let alone on social grounds.  All of the parties in this House will have to work on producing properly costed policies which will finance a reduction in tyhe PAYE tax level while the transition to the Commission on Taxation reforms are under way.  I do not think there are any free lunches.  I do not believe in the politics of promise any <Col N="1247" /> more than does anybody else in the this House.  I am convinced of the need for immediate tax reform as an integral element of the total package of measures I have set out here this morning and which I believe to be necessary to get the country off its knees into a wealth-creating situation.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the situation in regard to financial institutions which was covered substantially in the Minister's Financial Statement yesterday.  We must await the Finance Bill to see quite clearly what is in mind here, but there are a number of initial comments worth making.  First, the building societies now find themselves facing a tax rate of 35 per cent whereas before the budget they faced a tax rate of 29.75 per cent.  Clearly that represents an increase.  In addition to the bank levy, the bank will also face this new imposition, although in a slightly different way.  It is quite clear also that there will be less money available for mortages in that the cash flow of the building societies will be severely disrupted. It is important to point out that this constitutes an extra tax on building societies.  In the case of banks, it is not an extra tax; it is the bringing forward of tax which would be paid anyway.  As it were, their compensation for that move is that they have been allowed a degree of confidentiality.  But, in the case of building societies, it is a new tax and that has not been made sufficiently clear in this debate so far.  This tax is increased from 29.75 per cent to 35 per cent.  Therefore it constitutes a new tax on building societies, whereas in regard to the banks it is a case of as they were, except that it is bringing forward the amount that had to be paid.</P>
    <P>I want to make another point about this, that is, that this 35 per cent taxation of interest on deposits at source is very much a double blow.  If one thinks of the average person who may have some money on deposit in a bank, to date the system that obtained was that an assessment was issued.  I understand that on average they paid about one year afterwards, <Col N="1248" /> that is, by the time the assessment had been gone through and so on.  Therefore, somebody with deposit interest in 1984-85 would be paying it on assessment in 1985-86.  This new decision means that they will pay it immediately, in the year in which it is credited.  Therefore what will happen this year &mdash; and there should be some transitional arrangements devised for this &mdash; is that there will be two bites taken.  They will pay tax on the deposit interest of last year, by assessment, which is running a year late; and now there will be this quick grab, which means that they will pay tax on the interest earned today.  They will pay it this year.  Therefore they will be caught for two lots of tax on approximately the same amount of deposit interest in the one year.  For example, if one had earned interest of £10,000 one would be paying tax of £3,500 on that.  If that was carried forward from a previous year &mdash; and the new scheme will mean that one will have to pay another £3,500 &mdash; that would mean that one's tax bill this year would be £7,000.  That is unacceptable and is a kind of Robin Hood approach to taxation. There should a be a transitional arrangement devised to level out its effect on such people.</P>
    <P>It has been said before, but should be repeated, that the elimination of the small saver's allowance is quite a critical blow at this time.  There are people who for years and years have been saving with banks, placing small amounts of money on deposit, week in week out.  In the case of a single person the first £50 interest earned or, in the case of a married couple, the first £100 earned was tax free.  As such, one could save without having to worry about any tax on interest earned above £100, in the case of a married couple.  As a result of these budgetary provisions that is gone completely.  There is no longer that benefit in the banking system for small savers who formerly reaped that benefit.  Indeed, that benefit has obtained for, I believe, 20 years or more.  Suddenly yesterday it has gone, which must come as a disappointment to small savers.  It is a very marginal change. It would not have cost very much to have <Col N="1249" /> left it there.  The trauma it will cost many small savers today is not worth the money the Government will get out of it.  It would have been a nice gesture to have left it there as an exemption limit for people with small savings, earning interest of less than £100, which is very small indeed.  I am sorry the Government saw fit to attack a very small measure like that, which in any case was not a big revenue earner for them.</P>
    <P>Still on the financial institutions, it is important to question the Minister or the Government in regard to the non-resident account business.  The Minister in his Financial Statement yesterday claimed that there was no danger of an outflow of funds, that non-resident accounts are still protected in the sense that, while we want to get our hands on our own hot money, we do not necessarily want to get our hands on the hot money of other countries that might be lying in our financial system.  Quite patently, under this and other Governments for many years we have quite deliberately not tackled that because it is not our problem as such.  In fact, it is of major benefit to us if such money is on deposit in the nation here and can be left undisturbed for some time.  In the course of his Financial Statement the Minister said:</P>
    <P>However, in the case of banks, notices of non-residence exempting interest on existing accounts from inclusion in returns by the banks for tax purposes will, for a period of one year, satisfy the requirement for a new declaration.</P>
    <P>In other words, there is no need for a new declaration for one year.  I have to ask as strongly as I can: what will happen after one year?  The clear implication in those remarks of the Minister is that after one year there will be a requirement for a new declaration.  Therefore, there will have to be a new declaration after one year in regard to non-resident accounts.</P>
    <P>I thought it was a little bit silly to include in a Financial Statement the fact that a year from now one might be looking for a declaration in regard to non-resident accounts.  Why give people a year's notice if one is going to tackle that <Col N="1250" /> kind of money?  It does not make any sense to include it in a Financial Statement, letting the whole world know that they have one year in which to get their money out, that they have one year in which to make arrangements in, say, the Isle of Man, Jersey or somewhere else. As far as I can see, that is clearly what those remarks do.  The Minister is telling them: &ldquo;We will take the banks' word for it this year, but next year we will be seeking a new declaration.&rdquo;  That is very short-sighted and clearly will lead to an outflow of funds from the country within a very short time.  Almost as if in an effort to pull back from that, the Minister went on to say:</P>
    <P>The requirements will operate only in respect of deposit accounts, the balances on which at 29 January 1986 are reduced by more than 25 per cent at any time between that date and 5 April, 1987.</P>
    <P>In other words, if one dips into one's non-resident accounts tomorrow and takes out 24 per cent of the funds, there will be no difficulty, that does not have to be reported to the Revenue Commissioners. If one dips into one's non-resident accounts tomorrow and takes out 26 per cent of one's deposits, then the Revenue Commissioners have to be told.  I pose the question: in heaven's name, what would one do?  Would one dip in and take out the 24 per cent at present, spending the next 12 months endeavouring to find a home for the remainder of the non-resident funds lying on deposit in Irish banks?  In case anybody is under any illusion that that represents very marginal money, I should say that various figures have been produced but the general impression is that it is of the order of £500 million, approximately half a billion pounds of money, belonging to non-residents in Irish financial institutions.  What did the Minister do yesterday?  He told them they are all right for 12 months, but in 12 month's time he will want a declaration.  Quite simply, that is the Minister saying: &ldquo;You have 12 months to get your £500 million out of the country.&rdquo; That is a crazy, shortsighted economic <Col N="1251" /> policy.  If one takes that side by side with the billion pounds of repatriated profits from this country &mdash; with no counter attraction to maintain them here &mdash; the raid on the financial institutions in this way will frighten away wealth and money.  It is an extremely mobile international commodity which floats around and finds the most attractive home.  The Minister is saying that there is no home here for it.  He is implying that he would prefer such people to contact the Isle of Man, the United States or Bermuda and make other arrangements for their money because we are clean and pure and do not want their money in our banks.  If that is the kind of message we are sending out, the multinationals will soon pick it up.  If that kind of stink gets around the financial communities of the world, on top of the way we handled Irish Shipping, we will find it extremely hard to attract wealth to this nation.  Why not send out the signals that it is welcome, that we will protect its confidentiality, that it is not money belonging to Irish people and that there is a system here which favours foreign investment?  I am not talking about anything illegal but funds belonging to non-residents in Irish banks which I would assume are legally held funds.  It may be money which is available internationally so why should not Ireland have it?  Instead the Minister tells these people that they are not particularly wanted.  The way in which financial institutions have been handled in this budget is a major mistake.</P>
    <P>The additional 6 per cent tax on building societies has to put the mortgage rate up.  One cannot put a 6 per cent tax on them today without an increase in mortgage rates following almost automatically. I predict that within two weeks there will be an increase in the mortgage rate as a result of the 6 per cent imposition. As if the building industry did not have enough difficulty with the VAT last year, it now has to cope with funds being more difficult to obtain for the building of houses.  I cannot see any logic in that part of the budget.</P>
    <P>It has been said that at the end of <Col N="1252" /> the day the depositor will pay, not the banking system.  If depositors are getting a smaller return for their money invested they will put that money elsewhere.  I will not speculate about what they will do with it but there is no limit to the ingenuity of Irish people when it comes to money.  I feel reasonably certain that if deposits and small savings are attacked and investment is made less attractive, they will find some other way to realise their investment.  Ours if a small open economy and people will be extremely imaginative.  Unfortunately the Irish nation will lose because the Government will not think in an imaginative and creative way about hanging on to such funds.</P>
    <P>Let us try to make everybody pay their fair share of taxation but let us stop scaring away investment, wealth and savings which are the life blood of this country. If was put to me yesterday that having attacked the PAYE people for so long and the fruits of investment, the Government are now attacking investment itself. I am worried about this crude attack on investment, especially when capital spending has been cut drastically against the advice of the EC.  I see a picture of money taking flight and investment slowing down.  That will build up a legacy in 1987, 1988 and afterwards for whoever is in Government.</P>
    <P>I made a telephone call before I came into the House and discovered that there has been a 1.5 per cent drop in yield on guaranteed income bonds on the Stock Exchange, one of the biggest drops ever. It is due of course to the 15 per cent levy on the insurance companies.  These are income bonds which are used by people who want some secure income for their savings.  When people get a lower yield they stop investing and find something else.  I heard the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism saying that the something else would be Irish industry but I wonder about that.  I fear that this type of investment will be lost to industry.</P>
    <P>Do we really know what that 15 per cent is?  It is a 15 per cent tax on the investment income of insurance companies. <Col N="1253" /> What is the investment income of insurance companies?  It is not some mythical fund which can be raided and taken into the Exchequer.  Those funds have been invested in Government funds &mdash; the Government are attacking their lending base &mdash; and property, but most people who have invested in property in recent years have lost very heavily because of its devaluation.  About 30 per cent of the funds of insurance companies are in equities, shares in Irish companies on the Stock Exchange.  The Government are making it more difficult to get a return on investment in industry generally.  The Government want 15 per cent, so we are into a spiral: a smaller return of investment will lead to less investment, fewer jobs and more unemployment.  It may have seemed a painless way of bringing in £38 million but it will be very painful indeed.  In this budget we are going into the very heart of the financial institutions and demanding a bigger share.  That means the investor gets a smaller share and will invest less rather than more.</P>
    <P>We will not feel the results of these policies this year or between now and the election but we will feel them in 1988, 1989 and 1990 and we will be very sorry that we made this crude attack on the financial institutions and did not increase capital spending in the areas I have suggested. The EC have also put forward the view I share on capital spending.</P>
    <P>Prior to the budget income tax was estimated to bring in £2,260 million.  As a result of changes yesterday, that will rise to £2,477 million.  That is an increase of £217 million or almost 10 per cent in taxation.  It is clear that yesterday's budget took more out of the tax system into the Exchequer, and the sums are there.</P>
    <P>Secondly, the share of income tax in relation to total tax has been increasing from 36 per cent in 1982 to 40 per cent yesterday.  This shows that the burden of income tax has risen and continues to rise.  We have a lopsided system with an excessive burden on the income tax section of the community.  Let me be more specific.  Exchequer returns show that out of every £100 spent in income <Col N="1254" /> tax in 1985 the PAYE pays £87.  This compares with £85 in 1984 and proves once again, as if it needed to be proved, that the PAYE sector is supporting the tax system and that the budget in this regard is only making that matter somewhat worse.</P>
    <P>The abolition of the 1 per cent levy is welcome.  I welcomed that yesterday and have no hesitation in welcoming it again today and in complimenting the Government on taking that step.  However, in the current year it will still bring in some £36 million and even with its abolition the burden of income tax on income tax payers and, more specifically, the PAYE sector will increase.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the higher income tax burden, the rise in the petrol price, higher VAT and the abolition of the £100 child allowance must all be borne in mind when considering this budget and particularly when considering the benefit of the income tax concession given out by the Minister in the budget yesterday.  An average person on, say, £10,000 with three kids would be better off, according to the Minister's figure, to the tune of £2 a week.  I have shown that the petrol VAT and the abolition of the child allowance alone would more than gobble up that £2 pretty quickly.  There is no great net benefit to the average householder in that.  I am much more concerned, as I think the average householder will be, about the bigger question that I have been talking about: the cut of investment in capital spending and the attack on the investment sources in Ireland.  Nevertheless, that £2 shows what a tinkering little system we are getting into.</P>
    <P>On that point it is worth nothing that the State budget is now £9 billion aproximately. Yesterday we played around with about £250 million of it, so we played around with 2.5 per cent of the total spending of the country.  Yesterday's budget was all about 2.5 per cent of the lot.  The other 97.5 per cent trundles on, left untouched with no great changes in it.  The budget is a very marginal thing on the fringe of economic planning and development.</P>
    <P>The VAT is proposing to yield £76 <Col N="1255" /> million, a net £60 million.  While I welcome the concessions to the tourist industry and the motor industry which have been advocated for many years, VAT as a percentage of GNP is up to over 9 per cent from 8 per cent a couple of years ago.  Looking at that it is quite clear that the burden of VAT is increasing substantially as a percentage of the total wealth of the country.  I suggested to the Minister last night that the new tax of 10 per cent on takeaway foods will be difficult if not impossible to enforce.  I predict that there will be a net loss on that scheme.  I did this a couple of years ago with the Minister in regard to residential property tax.  I suggested to him that we would get £3 million from it.  He argued that it would be £10 million and we ended up with £2 million.  This is spending where the bother and the trouble in taxing the bag of chips is just not going to be worth it.  So much will be spent on form filling and policing the system that we would be as well off to let the youngsters have their bag of chips without chasing them for 10 per cent of it.  Again, that is a niggardly approach to economic planning.  Leave them their couple of chips and let the civil servants and the tax commissioners and so on go and chase something more valuable.  Let them deal with capital spending, investment in banks and so on.</P>
    <P>In the VAT area particularly the major disappointment must be that the building industry did not see a reversal of last year's doubling of VAT.  Do the Government know that housing starts are running at 16 per cent below previous years and 20 per cent below the previous year's in Dublin?  Do they know that the decline in output in the building industry is now in its fourth year running, that employment in that industry is down 12,000 in three years, and is running at approximately 40 per cent now compared to a national unemployment rate of 17 per cent?  Will they reduce VAT on the building industry in an attempt to lift the economy in some way before it gets into any more difficulty?  Add that to the fact that the building societies have been raided <Col N="1256" /> for 6 per cent.  Who in their right mind would attempt to go near the construction industry, our second biggest industry?  It leaves no room for that industry to manouevre.</P>
    <P>There is no longer the major instrument for economic policy, particularly when national economic plans and so on are falling apart and the 2.5 per cent I have talked about is extremely marginal. We should have a two or three year budget, preferably a major budget every second year with some longer term figures in it.  The budget tinkers with 2.5 per cent of the total finances of the State and virtually ignores the rest of it.  I appreciate the difficulty any Government have when we have £9 billion spending clocked up.  Half of that goes in the three Departments of Health, Education and Social Welfare, another £2 billion goes on interest and the public sector pay bill is about £2.5 billion.  You can see how little room most Governments have to manoeuvre.  Having said that, let me say that the way out of our difficulties is not so much to manoeuvre within the 2.5 per cent but to break out of it, to think bigger and more broadly, stop the attack on investment and lift the country in a real way rather than fiddle around with the edges of it.</P>
    <P>Let us adopt a fresh economic philosophy. Why not have a new venture capital scheme?  Why not increase capital spending which will pay for itself in the way I have shown?  Why not increase the exploration programme for oil around our shores?  Why not bring in a similar tax on services to that for manufacturing? Instead of the banks levy, why not instruct our banks to give small interest loans to companies who cannot afford to pay the enormous interest rates we have today?  Why not take on the Chinese market and other such markets in the exporting field in a real national sense? Why not create a business environment in agriculture so that we get jobs off the land instead of just chasing them for tax? Why not get the European Community to agree to positive discrimination towards Irish goods?  Overall, why not give this country a chance to invest by stopping <Col N="1257" /> the attack which has been going on on the source of investment wealth in order to create jobs?  Why do the Government not concentrate on creating those conditions and adopting the kind of suggestions I have been putting forward instead of fiddling around at the edges with some 2.5 per cent of our total problems?  The direction I have put forward this morning is a reasonable, fresh economic philosophy and I encourage the Government to take it.  If they do, they will have my support.</P>

      <P>It is now over three years and four budgets since the Labour Party joined in Government. In 1982 the alternative which faced us was five years of a reckless and divided Fianna Fáil Government under Deputy Haughey.  The prospect was for serious political instability, more Gregory-type deals, more budget borrowings, more tensions in Anglo-Irish relations and greater strife in Northern Ireland &mdash; that was one thing which appalled the Labour Party then and still does.  We took the decision to join in Coalition in Government to avoid the then feared economic collapse of our country and the imposition of even greater hardship for all our people and that situation has not changed, by and large, in terms of our then decision.</P>
      <P>Since December 1982 the Labour Party in Government have succeeded in maintaining a relatively high level of public expenditure on essential social services such as health and housing.  We have more than protected social welfare beneficiaries and, in particular the long term unemployed against inflation and I shall come to that later.</P>
      <P>For that record I do not offer any Deputy in this House any apology.  To implement that record and to avoid excessive foreign borrowing we have maintained our relatively high level of taxation, defective as that system still is in many areas.  We are not a party of soft options.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have listened to Deputy Séamus Brennan for the past hour.  He is quite <Col N="1258" /> magnificent on the upmarket clichés of economic thought and that is disastrous. I very much regret having to say that because he is a Deputy in the constituency in which I live.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>We as a political party sought that and have no apology to make for it.  That is a policy decision which was taken by the Government in 1983, to have a relatively high current budget deficit, not to deflate the economy as much as some economic commentators would have wished.  Because of the changing circumstances of our economy and the recession lasting far longer than we thought it would, we agreed that the deficit would be phased out over a longer period.  It is the function of any Government to balance out the conflicting needs of the return to financial stability and security through reducing our external indebtedness and balance of payments deficit as against the needs of a population with high unemployment and with <Col N="1259" /> high requirements for public expenditure on health, education and social needs. Even the very limited steps taken so far to reduce our current expenditure towards a better balance with Exchequer income have been greeted, as we know, with massive hostility by many interests, be they in education, health or in professions. We know how difficult that exercise is.  With respect to the Fianna Fáil Party and even greater respect to the new right of the Fianna Fáil Party, the Progressive Democrats, when they talk about reducing public expenditure they run like scalded cats from being specific as to where the expenditure should be reduced.</P>

      <P>We have the new undiluted objectives of the right wing society typified by <i>The Way Forward</i>.  The Fianna Fáil intention when last in office was to reduce the current budget deficit to zero.  1986 was zero current budget deficit year.

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;we would have an unemployment level of 310,000 people at least, in my estimation, not 240,000. That was the Fianna Fáil proposal.  If we had decided to go along with that proposal in 1982, the level of deprivation in our society and the total neglect of both capital and current expenditure, particularly in the education and health sectors, would have been quite unbelievable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1260" /> When all the mood of public euphoria and simplistic political concepts, particularly about the new political party, the Progressive Democrats, evaporates, people will face the reality and the real policies behind that party, such as selling out our oil resources to a number of companies. Every speech made by Deputy O'Malley advocates getting oil ashore and forgetting about the question of any take for the State in this.  The Government and the Minister for Energy and I know, that we could do that tomorrow morning provided that we sold out the rights of the Irish people in relation to oil exploration and our national resources.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley knows what he is doing.  He has that group of business people in his pocket for their political and other support and he will milk them dry between now and the next election.  He says it is £300 million a year to the Irish people but, of course, it is also £30 million a year for half a dozen people in terms of the rake-off that they will have from it.  We know that and so do the Fianna Fáil Party, but they never had the courage to stand up to that.  We know what it entails in terms of destroying our national resources by milking them dry prematurely at a give-away price to Irish and multinational oil interests.  We will not stoop to that, having regard to the economic situation facing the country.</P>
    <P>I challenge Deputy Séamus Brennan, the supreme word-smith of waffle in this House, and his party to specify the more stringent cuts in public expenditure which they feel should now be considered and what the reality of this would mean.  For those depending on social welfare payments, I pose the question, should their present relatively low level of income be reduced further, should hospital outpatient and clinic waiting lists, with resultant delays, be permitted to become longer than at present?  Is that their policy?  Should the old school buildings be used for even longer despite all their inadequacies?  Should incentives to employment and production be further diminished?  They are the questions that must be answered.  There are no soft options when you get down to public <Col N="1261" /> expenditure.  As Minister responsible for 40 per cent of gross public expenditure, I know down to the last £100,000 what those options are, how they are fashioned and proposed and how they have to be dealt with.</P>
    <P>Equally, many of the Fianna Fáil Párty former Ministers &mdash; and, indeed, Deputy O'Malley &mdash; know perfectly well what these options are in terms of approach.  I submit that one of the great achievements of my party in Government is that social welfare payments have kept pace with inflation, and well above inflation, despite the crippling burden of additional unemployment numbers and that the unavoidable reduction in other public expenditure has been kept within reasonable bounds, with every single cut discussed and debated at great length in Government, as are improvements in efficiency and effectiveness of expenditure. We have striven for that all along.</P>
    <P>Here I come to the reality of any budget discussion.  Because the country has become a sectionalised society, a fractured one, dog eats dog and nobody cares about anybody else.  If one is concerned with education, with health, with the public service, one wants one's pound of flesh.  The farmer wants his pound of flesh.  The manufacturer and the industrialist wants his pound of flesh.  Nobody is prepared to yield: all want their thing now because with recession our society has become mean, selfish, intolerant and vicious.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley has been going around the country saying he will reduce public expenditure, that there will be no embargo in the public service.  He is speaking about the Commission on Taxation favourably, but not about the VHI or mortgages or loan interests.  Here we have a system of proportional representation whereby if one is all things to all men on all issues one is capable of scraping a quota.  None of us knows the clear truth, which is that the public debt must be paid for ultimately by the taxpayer or it will be left for our children to repay out of their wages.</P>
    <P>Our national plan was never intended <Col N="1262" /> to be something with pinpoint accuracy. Of course Deputy Haughey has said he does not believe in planning at all, that things happen anyway, that employment will be created.  When we formulated the national plan, or its framework, we did not expect it to be accurate down to the last digit.  Any economist would accept this.  Our position is subject to fluctuating interest rates in the world and a volatile balance of trade.  Industries come and go because of the explosive nature of technology.  Therefore, it would be arrogant and foolish to think that in such a small open economy it is possible to give a totally accurate prediction for several years ahead.</P>
    <P>However, in so far as we planned, our targets have been well within the framework set down.  We had an overrun last year of £50 million on the current budget deficit, a very modest figure when you consider that £21 million was spent on a Christmas bonus for social welfare recipients. That money was not included in the 1985 budget.</P>
    <P>I will deal with social welfare first, and the improved payments in 1986.  We are providing a general increase of 4 per cent in social welfare benefits with an additional 1 per cent for the long term unemployed. Some Deputies have disparaged that provision.  The latest post-budget estimate of the Department of Finance for mid-July 1986 to mid-July 1987 is an inflation rate of 3 per cent.  If Deputies over there do not want to accept this I will introduce them to the economists in the Department of Finance and the senior officer to discuss the matter.</P>
    <P>Our fix on inflation for 1985 was too high.  We gave increases in social welfare benefits of 6½ per cent though the inflation rate worked out at only 5 per cent.  In 1986 the average inflation rate for the whole year is estimated now at between 4 per cent and 4½ per cent.</P>
    <P>When inflation goes down nobody is particularly pleased, but when it goes up all hell breaks loose.  The low rate of inflation here is one of the great economic benefits this Government have managed to fashion in the past four years.  I remember that social welfare increases of 25 <Col N="1263" /> per cent were given when inflation was running at 27 per cent, and the increases were not worth a damn to anyone.  Therefore, this year, when one takes account of CPI figures, the position of social welfare recipients will continue to be well maintained. Though social welfare rates are too low, and I do not in any way suggest that they are sufficient for anybody to live on, I am the only Minister for Social Welfare in Europe in the past three years who managed to take from our national resources sufficient money to give social welfare recipients increases above inflation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I have met them all during the past three years and they have marvelled at what we have been able to do.  I have always insisted on high taxation, high social welfare expenditure and sensible reductions in public expenditure when I see waste.  My philosophy is that those who can afford to pay should pay, just as the financial institutions, under this budget, will pay what they should pay.  Deputy Séamus Brennan comes in to cry crocodile tears all over them because at long last they are asked to make a contribution towards the running of the country.  We must avoid tax evasion which was rampant in those institutions in recent years.  For that we have no apology to make.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The total cost of the social welfare increases provided in the budget will amount to £69.6 million in 1986 and £122 million in a full year.  These are no small sums of money and, whether we like it or not, the amount which we can provide is constrained by the overall difficulties on the public expenditure front.  Anyone who is serious about tackling the enormous problems which face this country in the area of public finances must recognise that providing additional resources for any area of public expenditure, whether it is public service pay, social welfare services, the health services, or whatever, presents considerable difficulties both for the Minister for Finance, the Minister <Col N="1264" /> for Social Welfare and other Minister concerned, no matter what Government are in power.</P>
    <P>If we take mid-1983 to mid-1987, present projections are that there will have been real increases of about 5.25 per cent in short term social welfare payments, a 7½ per cent real increase in persions and more than 13 per cent in payments to the long term unemployed. That is a major achievement by any standard.  That is well in line with the commitment in the national plan.</P>
    <P>In regard to disability benefits, we must be conscious of the need to ensure that social welfare benefits will reach those who really need them, and no part of the scheme can be allowed to be abused by any section.  In recent years much attention has been focused on disability benefit schemes.  Expenditure on this scheme, including pay-related benefit payable with disability benefit amounted to some £202 million in 1984 and £230 million in 1985, and in 1986, expenditure for disability benefit alone will amount to around £237 million.  This represents a sizeable chunk of overall social welfare expenditure.  There are around 77,000 payments each week and around 250,000 separate claims each year.  It is a major problem facing the Government.</P>
    <P>Obviously in such a scheme there is a clear obligation to ensure that only persons who are suffering or who would suffer a loss or interruption of earnings because they are genuinely incapable of work actually benefit from the scheme. There have been numerous complaints in recent years to the effect that the scheme is being abused and that there is an incentive for workers to go sick, particularly at certain times of the year, in order to avail of social welfare benefits and tax rebates.  Much of the evidence which has been presented in support of this type of argument has been anecdotal and it is an area where hard information is difficult to come by.</P>
    <P>The Government however have been concerned about the possible effects of the scheme on the levels of absenteeism and has been reviewing a number of options for reducing problems to which <Col N="1265" /> the scheme in its present form may give rise.  One obvious area is in the overlap which occurs where employees are covered by sick pay arrangements in their job and complicated arrangements must be made by employers to ensure that such employees, when they fall ill, are not paid on the double.</P>
    <P>One option to deal with this problem would be to transfer to employers part of the responsibility for payment of disability benefit to employees in respect of short term illnesses.  Many European countries already have arrangements of this kind whereby employers support their workers fully for the initial period of illness and the State scheme only then steps in.  Prior to taking any further action in this matter, however, the Government have consulted with the National Economic and Social Council and I am awaiting with interest the council's views.</P>
    <P>The Government have also been looking at other aspects of the disability benefit scheme with a view to taking whatever measures are necessary to ensure that the scheme meets its essential objectives.  A number of measures are already being taken to tighten up on the control of the scheme.  The appointment of five additional medical referees and clerical support staff in the Department have been approved by the Government in the context of the 1986 Estimates.  In addition legislation will be introduced to discontinue payment of disability benefit in respect of periods of holidays paid for while in employment.  There has been an abuse whereby people go on holidays and simultaneously claim disability benefit.  I cannot stand over that any longer.  I must end it and I propose to end it in the Social Welfare Bill coming up.  Nobody could object to this measure.</P>
    <P>A further measure which the Government have approved is an increase in the penalty where a person fails to turn up for an appointment with the Department's medical referee.  At present where this happens a person is disqualified for receiving disability benefit for six weeks. This period will be increased to nine weeks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>We now have 25 medical referees, a substantial increase in the number, and I suggest that the measures brought in are reasonable.  We cannot have a situation where a person is asked to go before a medical referee, he does not turn up, he looses benefit for six weeks and can then claim again.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that and I together with the secretary of the Department of Social Welfare have taken measures to ensure the more expeditious working of the medical referee system. There is also a problem in that two out of every ten people who are asked to come before the medical referee do not come and do not notify anybody, so time scales can get into a terrible tangle and most people resume work rather than go back to the referee.</P>
      <P>The measures proposed are reasonable ones and I will be prepared to consider any further reasonable proposals for amendments to the scheme to ensure that it is seen to be operating in a fair and reasonable way as far as insured people and the general contributing and taxpaying public are concerned.</P>
      <P>There is one other aspect of the scheme, however, to which I would like to draw attention and that is the area of medical certification.  I have referred to this on numerous occasions before but it is worth repeating, that nobody can qualify for disability benefit unless he or she is certified by a doctor to be incapable of work.  This is the first point of control as far as the scheme is concerned.  I would renew my appeal to the medical profession to ensure that in all cases they are fully satisfied as to the genuineness of an incapacity before they issue a medical certificate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>We will be dealing with that also and I certainly intend to be up front with the IMO in this matter. I will no longer stand for receptionists signing people's names on to a certificate so that fellows can simply casually drop in and pick them up and hand them in to the Department and get £80 or £90 a week for them.  It is not correct.  It is not what the scheme was designed for.  I appreciate that there are grey areas in individual cases.  I do not want to impose hardship on anyone under the disability benefit scheme but the scheme is now costing £230 million a year and we must contain the enormous impact of the scheme on our social welfare payments. To provide a scheme of this nature is why people are paying high rates of PRSI and income tax.</P>
      <P>Unemployment expenditure is the biggest element of social welfare expenditure now accounting for some 29 per cent of the total budget of the Department of Social Welfare.  In 1985 it amounted to £630 million and in 1986 we are providing £697 million in this area.  This year the Government are giving an increase of 5 per cent to the long term unemployed. As Deputies know there are substantial numbers of such persons on the live register, 110,000 people, including small-holders. In keeping with our concern for this group of unemployed people additional help is being provided over and above the standard increases.  Last Christmas, for the first time ever the long term unemployed were included on the Christmas bonus provision and once again in the budget, provision has been made for the additional 1 per cent.  This is of considerable benefit and has generally won the approval of Members of the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>We are spending more money all the time.  As in the case of disability benefit, however, there is an <Col N="1268" /> attitude in certain quarters that a large proportion of people are receiving unemployment benefit or assistance who are not genuinely qualified.  Again, much of the evidence is hearsay and uncorroborated. There is no doubt, of course, that there are people who are intent on misusing the system and who see the unemployment payment schemes as a ready source of additional personal income.  The Government are determined to ensure that adequate measures are taken to combat abuse of the system and in this connection the role of the special investigation unit of the Department of Social Welfare is being strengthened.  The success of the unit to date has been very evident in a number of well-publicised cases where the unit was responsible for uncovering major frauds.  It takes two to commit a fraud.  There must be an employer and an employee and we must always bear that in mind in that area.  The unit will continue its policy of selecting and investigating particular areas where there is a suspicion that fraud may be occurring.  The Government have approved the appointment of five additional officers to the special investigation unit and this will enable the unit to step up its surveillance activities.</P>
      <P>On the general question of abuse of the social welfare system I should like to underline the offer of an amnesty which was made by the Minister for Finance in his budget speech.  This will apply to persons who in the next six months come forward and make a clean breast of existing or earlier irregularities in relation to the social welfare system, whether it is an employer who has not paid his PRSI or a worker who has over-claimed.  The amnesty will take the form of a freedom from prosecution and therefore from the penalties provided for defrauding the social welfare system.  There will of course be no waiver on the obligation of those persons to repay in full all sums irregularly received by them.  I would hope that this amnesty proposal will encourage people who may be defrauding the system to come clean and put themselves in the right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like now to turn to another <Col N="1269" /> aspect of the budget proposals which, apart from its own merits, is an important element of the Government's policy of encouraging employment by tackling the possible disincentives associated with taking up employment as against being on the social welfare system.  I refer to the child benefit scheme announced by the Minister for Finance in his budget speech.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the schemes will be provide as much direct cash support to mothers as possible through one single payment, with the greatest benefit to families on the lowest incomes.  It will not, however, be possible for administrative and technical reasons to introduce, as originally intended, a fully taxable scheme in 1986.  As a first step, therefore, the Government have decided to introduce a non-taxable scheme of child benefit with effect from April 1986.</P>
    <P>Under this scheme a child benefit of £15.05 per month will be paid for each of the first five children.  This rate will be increased to £21.75 per month for each subsequent child.  These payments will not be taxable.  This represents an increase of £3 per month per child over the existing rates of payment under the children's allowance scheme, which will be replaced by the new scheme.</P>
    <P>The new scheme replaces the existing children's allowance scheme and also involves the abolition of the child tax allowance of £100 per child under the income tax code.  Furthermore child dependant increases for social welfare recipients will remain at their present levels.  The new scheme, therefore, involves a redirection of child support.  I do not mind confessing that in my case I lose £200 in child tax allowances.  I am on the 60 per cent marginal rate with the result that I will lose £120 tax benefit.  My wife will get an extra £3 per month or £72 per year for our two children who qualify.</P>

I will suffer a net loss and the money saved from B. Desmond, a higher income earner, will be passed down the line to social welfare recipients who will get an increase of £3 across the board.  The people with no tax liability and on the low tax bands will gain from the increment saved.  It could not be simpler.</P>

      <P>Deputies are aware that families paying tax at the higher rate will suffer some net loss arising out of the abolition of the child tax allowance and that the intention of the scheme is to bring about a redistribution of resources in the direction of families most in need. Three-quarters of all families in the State will be at least as well off under the new scheme as under the existing scheme and many thousands of families, including families depending on social welfare payments, will in fact be better off.</P>
      <P>Under the family income supplement scheme the new rate is being increased to 33? per cent compared to an existing rate of 25 per cent.  We are spending £1 million extra in that area.  It is money well spent on those who have a very low income.  It will substantially improve the FIS scheme.</P>
      <P>In the near future I expect to receive the report of the Commission on Social Welfare and following that I intend to bring proposals before the House.  With regard to the self-employed I should like to point out that at the moment employees, via PRSI contributions, are contributing to the cost of their own contributory old age and retirement pensions. They are also contributing, through general taxation, the lion's share of non-contributory pensions, which are mainly of benefit to the self-employed. We will have to deal with that and it is why I established the national pensions board.  I will be announcing the membership of the board in the next week or so and I look forward to the board advising me on how to deal with that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the health services I should like to point out that the non-capital budget provision for 1986 is £1,095 million which represents an increase of £37 million on the 1985 provisions. Yesterday the Minister gave the gross figure, £1,200 million.  By any standards that represents a very substantial outlay on the maintenance and development of <Col N="1272" /> our health services.  Many of the comments on the budget imply that major cutbacks in health expenditure are taking place.  That is not the case as the figures I have just given amply demonstrate. Naturally, as the Minister responsible for two major spending Departments, I would like to be able to announce that we could find the necessary finances to meet all demands I get daily in the House. However, we do live in the real world and the extent to which services can be provided must be consistent with the willingness of the community to provide the necessary resources.  In the health services we have been making an effort to change the general framework of strategy.</P>

      <P>Provision has been made in the 1986 Estimates for the rate of capitation grant for national schools to be increased by £2, to £24 per pupil, in respect of the 1985-86 school year.  This grant is paid on condition that a sum equal to at least 25 per cent of the State grant is lodged to the school account from local sources.</P>

      <P>I am not aware that the capitation grant for primary schools is insufficient for the running of schools.  As I said, the grant has increased substantially over inflation in the last few years, taking account of any increases in the cost of running schools.  There are some areas of particular deprivation where schools are in a rundown condition and we have a disadvantaged fund which we established on coming into office which helps these schools with their running costs.  The increase of 60 per cent has helped to solve many of the problems which those schools encountered.</P>

The figure of £34 which the Deputy mentioned is the amount spent by the school to which he referred on heating and maintenance costs, etc.  There could well be a different figure in another area. However, I will certainly inquire into the possibility of arriving at an average cost for running schools.  It is also a question of the kind of management put into the running of schools.</P>

      <P>I would appreciate if the Minister could make whatever information she has on costings available. Would she also investigate the anomaly in disadvantaged areas where, because the area is disadvantaged, numbers are falling and schools are losing teachers as a result?  Even though these schools are getting £2,000 or £3,000 by way of additional funding it does not overcome the problems caused by the loss of teachers in areas which need a low pupil-teacher ration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of schools in disadvantaged areas which are losing teachers, in the last year we appointed 92 extra teachers to retain teacher numbers in these schools which enjoy a very much more favourable pupil-teacher ration than schools in less disadvantaged areas.  It is very important to stress that we have a very definite policy in this area.  I could not accept the Deputy's contention that the extra funding for the running and maintenance of these schools has something to do with losing teachers because we have made very big strides in genuinely helping with teacher numbers in schools in disadvantaged areas.  As I said, 92 extra posts were created, apart from the extra remedial posts which we have created in the primary area.</P>

      <P>There is a very clear anomaly arising in disadvantaged areas.  I am talking about not just the areas which the Minister has designated as disadvantaged, but areas which have not been so designated and which are clearly disadvantaged.  Because parents are not anxious to send their children to schools which they perceive as being disadvantaged, the numbers are falling, <Col N="1277" /> the parish contribution is falling, and there is difficulty in collecting that contribution from other parishes.  Therefore, there is not only, relatively speaking, a poor capitation grant, but they are also short of money by way of parish contributions. They are losing teachers because of the fall in numbers and the £1,000, £2,000 or £3,000, whatever it is, special grant under the disadvantaged scheme, where they get it &mdash; and they do not all get it &mdash; is not making up for those losses and those difficulties.</P>

      <P>The Government's Green Paper &ldquo;Partners in Education&rdquo; stated that consideration might be given to the transfer of responsibility for the Public Library Service to the proposed local education councils.  Because the library service is very much an educational one, it is appropriate in the context of establishing local education councils, to consider bringing the service under the aegis of those councils.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am slightly at a loss to understand why the Deputy refers to this as piecemeal.  The Green Paper was most carefully designed and included several new concepts, including that of possibly linking the library service more closely to the education service, as is done in <Col N="1279" /> Northern Ireland where the local education boards are known as the Local Education and Library Boards.  I do not think this is piecemeal, but it is worth considering whether the library service might be more logically and closely involved with the education service.  I did not intend it to be piecemeal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education if she will elaborate on the proposal in the Green Paper &ldquo;Partners in Education&rdquo; on the granting of more operational autonomy to regional technical colleges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>Under existing arrangements, the regional technical colleges are run by boards of management which are sub-committees of the local vocational education committees.  Under the terms of the Vocational Education Act, 1930, the acts of such sub-committees are subject to confirmation by the VEC <Col N="1281" /> unless the VEC decides otherwise with the consent of the Minister.  On the other hand, there is a strong body of opinion which suggests that each RTC should be an autonomous institution in the same way as, for example, the National Institutes for Higher Education.  The future position of the RTCs was considered by my Department within these parameters. The proposals in the Green Paper suggest a compromise between those positions, namely, that in future boards of management would be sub-committees of the LECs or VECs but would not be bound by the necessity of having their decisions confirmed by the parent body.</P>
      <P>Under such an arrangement the boards of the RTCs would have control over the administration of their own colleges and would be responsible for the recruitment and appointment of staff.  I would see this arrangement as being consistent with the nature of the RTC as substantial educational institutions in their own right but which have a special responsibility to respond to local and regional educational, training and economic development requirements.  On the other hand, the RTCs have been developed by and have strong historical links with the VEC system and, for that reason, it has been suggested that they should continue to be funded through the VEC/LEC system, so as to maintain those links with their roots to which I have just referred.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not satisfied as to the clear distinction between full autonomy which is one way in which the problem might be solved or a fuller operational autonomy which could happen to an RTC under the proposed LEC system or under the VEC if that system were to remain.  First, how does the Minister envisage membership of the changed board of management of an RTC? Secondly, is this the reason the Minister's Department announced a 20 per cent rise in student fees?  Is this what is meant by operational autonomy for RTCs, or am I premature in seeing a clear link between operational autonomy and massive rises in RTC fees, as announced yesterday by <Col N="1282" /> the Minister of State at the Department of Education?  Is the Minister serious in saying this is to bring the fees for RTCs into line with university fees when one cannot compare the facilities in a university and the facilities in an RTC?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposed board of management of an RTC will consist of a chairman, principal and 20 members as follows: five members nominated by the appropriate LEC; one member nominated by each of the LECs, if any, in the RTC catchment area; two academic staff; one non-academic staff, two students; one nominee of the Minister for Labour and six appointed by the Minister.  In the Green Paper we point out that the Minister would have regard to the extent to which industry, commerce, the professions and the trade unions should be represented.  The second part of the Deputy's question concerned fees.  This does not concern the matters in the Green Paper.</P>

Quite rightly this proposal will be viewed with suspicion by all the representatives concerned and the public generally.

They are meeting the Irish Cycling Federation and I have no doubt that their discussions and recommendations will be taken into consideration. With regard to whether resources have been made available this year for a cycle track, the answer is no.  The Deputy asked if I could arrange to have some track made available in the interim but my answer is no.  My view is that as we are accommodating all the sporting interests in a national sports stadium it would be unwise to do anything on an interim basis.</P>

      <P>A committee have been established by Cospóir, the National <Col N="1287" /> Sports Council, to examine the requirements of a national sports centre.  The national governing bodies of sport have already been consulted on a wide range of issues, including the possible location of such a centre.  When the committee's report and recommendations have been completed it will be necessary to have them submitted to my Department for consideration.</P>

      <P>As I have explained in reply to Deputy Taylor, it is not my intention to make a decision or even a recommendation at this stage.  I am waiting for the reports and the submissions from the governing bodies of sport to the committee that were set up.  When their report is completed I will be discussing in detail with the committee all aspects of the provision of a national sports centre. On the matter of location, I would not be prepared at this stage to rule out or to decide on any area.  It would be unfair of me to make any such recommendation at this stage.</P>

      <P>I can only assure the Deputy that the submission from Athlone UDC and from Westmeath County Council will be considered in great detail.  I am sure Deputies will understand my position.  There would be no point in setting up a committee if I were to make the decisions.  The purpose of setting up the committee was to have every application examined.  I assure the <Col N="1288" /> Deputies that many other local authorities have made submissions in this matter also and that some of these, too, are claiming to be close to the centre of the country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Minister for Education (Mrs. Hussey) Gemma Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mrs. Hussey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for the Public Service and I have had discussions with the teacher unions on the 25th round of pay increases and other pay-related matters, including the recent findings of the Arbitration Board for Teachers on a claim for a special pay increase for teachers.  It was not found possible to reach agreement at those discussions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In their findings the board recommended an increase of 10 per cent in the pay of teachers &ldquo;to take effect as to 50% thereof as and from 1 September 1985 and as to the balance as and from 1 March 1986&rdquo;.  In the course of the discussions with the teacher unions they were informed that the Government were prepared to implement the recommended 10 per cent increase in pay, but that in view of the cost involved it was not found possible to approve its implementation from the dates recommended by the arbitration <Col N="1290" /> board.  They were offered a three-stage phasing, corresponding to offers made, in parallel negotiations, to other public service unions in relation to special pay awards.  That offer was rejected by the unions even though it was intimated to them that it would be hoped to improve further on it.  Such an improvement would have been in line with offers made to other public service groups.  This would, of course, have covered a 25th round offer equal to the final offer which has been taken away for consideration by those groups.  However, the unions were demanding a commitment to have the 10 per cent increase paid in full from the dates recommended by the board and they made it clear that that was for them a breaking point.</P>
    <P>Under the terms of the teachers' conciliation and arbitration scheme it is a matter for the Government to decide whether to implement the arbitration findings; if the findings are not being implemented in full the scheme requires that an appropriate motion be introduced in this House.  It has been decided by the Government, following detailed examination of all aspects of the matter, to introduce a motion in the House providing for a modification of the findings.  I intend to introduce such a motion within the next week.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister indicate what is the latest position, what level of agreement has been reached to date with the unions and what exactly are the outstanding points of difference between the Government and the unions on the various negotiations that have taken place?  Also, are the negotiations ongoing or are have they been broken off?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that the teachers' unions decided they could not discuss any offer unless we were including full retrospection of the 10 per cent special pay award so they were not considering taking away any full package from the talks.  On the question of whether negotiations are in progress, so far as the Minister for the Public Service and myself are concerned, we were in <Col N="1291" /> negotiation and wished to remain so.  The Government side did not terminate the discussions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Would it be correct to say that the only outstanding item is the question of retrospection and that the phasing of the award has been agreed between the Government and the unions?  Would the Minister agree that it is important that continuing efforts be made on both sides, particularly on the Government side as employer, to try to resolve this matter, having regard to the fact that negotiations of this nature are not going to be satisfactorily concluded even by a vote in this House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am as convinced as the Deputy of the importance of continuing talks and have made that clear at all points, including a statement immediately after the teachers' unions had left the negotiating table.  I hope we will be able to resolve these matters satisfactorily and I believe this can be achieved by reasonable discussion.</P>

      <P>What moneys have been provided in this year's Estimate for the replacement and/or renewal of the school transport system?  Is the Minister of State aware that some of these buses are 16 years old?  Can he say when this committee, which appears to be meeting under the chairmanship of my constituency colleague but which is shrouded in great secrecy, will report?  Will the report's recommendations be implemented, what will it mean for the school transport system?  Furthermore, what <Col N="1297" /> will it mean for the firm at Shannon which had been anticipating an order from the Department and which had been so informed? What has happened to the moneys which the national plan envisaged would be spent on the school transport system?</P>

      <P>No decision on the replacement of the school transport fleet will be taken until this report is available.  It is no great secret that this investigation is being carried out by senior officials of my Department and by local interested groups in education.  As Deputies will appreciate, it is a very difficult service to provide bearing in mind that the number of children transported is approximately 150,000 each morning and evening.  Certainly at this point it is necessary to take an overall look at the system as it operates, at questions such as whether there should be greater dependence on local contractors, whether we should replace the fleet or continue to ensure that most of the existing fleet will be utilised.</P>

      <P>In order to warrant the appointment of an additional teacher in this school an average enrolment of 33 pupils is required under the rules.  As the current enrolment is only 28, the appointment of such teacher, even in a temporary capacity, could not be authorised at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I draw the Minister's attention to the fact that the pupil numbers have now increased fairly substantially since the second teacher who was in Cahermurphy national school up to about a year ago was released from that school. In view of the isolated area and the nature of the school in question, would it be possible, as a temporary measure, to have the position re-examined with a view to putting in a temporary teacher there.  It is an urgent matter of which I think the Minister is aware from the discussions she has had already about this issue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will be aware that, had it been a two teacher school as it was up to about a year ago, the numbers could have been at this level and still have maintained two teachers.  The difficulty now is you need a higher number of pupils to establish a second position there.  It is likely that the numbers will go up fairly substantially, and there is urgent need for a second teacher there.  Could the Minister have the matter re-examined in view of the circumstances in Cahermurphy to see if anything can be done about it?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>The implementation of the proposals outlined in <i>A Plan for Educational Broadcasting</i> would require funding to an extent that it is not feasible to provide at this time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department have had discussions <Col N="1303" /> with RTE regarding the possibility of providing a schools radio programme at primary level and this matter is under consideration.  Progress in this area is contingent on the requisite resources being available to me and in view of my heavy commitments in the overall educational sector I am not as of now in a position to make any commitment in the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>What funding is available or what does the Minister mean by saying that a considerable amount of funding would be needed to research and implement some of the proposals of this report <i>A Plan For Educational Broad-casting?</i> She mentioned funding.  What amount?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>We are talking about funding something in the region of £150,000 to £200,000 in 1986 rising to more than £300,000 per year thereafter. At a time of very limited resources and the necessity to guard them most carefully, I would have to see if such funding could be found for the initiation of this service.  Such an examination is under way at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I put it to the Minister that this area of educational broadcasting has vast potential to be a real tool for further education and present education at all levels?  Would she agree with me that the record of non-availability or non-take up of any type of programme has been, in the words of Dr. John Coolahan, dismal in the present and will be just as dismal in the future if a move is not made in that direction?  The amount of funding which the Minister has suggested would be the initial funding needed to get the project under way.  It seems relatively small for the advantages which could accrue from the use of this marvellous technology of both radio and television as media for instruction and education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to clarify something that I might not have made clear.  Those figures which I mentioned <Col N="1304" /> refer to a small proposal to begin from radio programmes for primary schools. In the much broader areas which the Deputy mentioned we are talking about a great deal more money than that.  I understand Dr. Coolahan's concern and the Deputy's concern.  However, neither the Deputy nor Dr. Coolahan are in a position of having to allocate resources within the educational system.  Since I am, I must look very carefully at how I can begin or initiate new spending.  It must be very carefully done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>We understand the Minister's worries, but that is her job which she has taken up willingly.  Let me put it to her that in ordering her priorities in education it appears as if funding or, indeed, any consideration of funding for educational broadcasting receives from her and from her Department a very low priority rating.  I want an answer to that first and then I have another supplementary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to that is &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  It does not receive a low priority. It is a question of money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>So it does not receive a low priority rating yet the Minister sees no future at all for the allocation of even an initial or token amount of funding to allow educational broadcasting at least to get off the ground again.  That seems an extraordinary and quite anomalous answer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not quite finished.  I am on my feet and protocol demands that one person at a time stands in this House.  That is what I learned when I came into it.  The Minister mentioned consideration between the Department of Education and RTE with regard to broadcasting at primary level.  Let me ask now for an elaboration of those envisaged talks and proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I was going to say that I <Col N="1305" /> wished to help the Deputy by pointing out that she misunderstood my original answer when I said quite clearly that the proposals which I mentioned for primary schools were under consideration in the Department.  At no point did I say that I was rejecting the beginning of this very important idea.  I wish to make that quite clear.</P>
      <P>The second part of the Deputy's question is that RTE and my Department have had meetings on this question regarding what one could do to begin schools broadcasting.  We looked at the question of having some music segments and speech segments and we have proceeded quite well with our discussions. Now it is a question of seeing when and if the funding can be found to initiate these programmes.  That is what is under active consideration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's answer has been extremely convoluted and has taken several offshots.  When might there be a result of discussions between the Department of Education and RTE and when might a priority be given by her and her Department to the funding for this project?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>My answer cannot be any more definite on that.  The discussions with RTE on the initial primary area have concluded.  It is now for me and my Department to look at the question of funding.  I cannot give a definite date for that discussion within my Department.</P>

      <P>Earlier the Minister gave me a rather odd answer about democracy, and her ideas of democracy differ greatly from those of many other people and I am sure people would be interested to hear them.  Does she think that in the number of ten to 12 &mdash; depending on the number of local authorities involved &mdash; this is a fair representation of persons elected by the will of the people through a ballot box on the LECs?  I do not think it is.  Her plan is an effort to diminish the power of local representatives, particularly as at this time they appear to be mainly of a particular political persuasion.</P>

      <P>I regret very much that the Deputy should take up that position. I would consider that the proposed structure of the LECs enhances the democratisation and decentralisation of education.  I remind the Deputy that at the moment local authority elected members concern themselves only with the VECs.  These committees deal with one quarter of the school population. Under my proposals the LECs will be dealing with the whole school population. Therefore, one would be extending the range of influence of local authority <Col N="1307" /> elected members.  It is also important to state that each individual school at local level will have representatives of the LEC on it, thereby extending much more the range of involvement of the local authority members through the LEC.  I would consider the combination of all the appropriate interests.  I am sure that the Deputy is not suggesting that representatives of voluntary settlement schools or the representatives of the social partners are non-democrats.  I would very much consider the involvement of this type of grouping in the local education council as indeed an enhancement of democracy.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Democrats&rdquo; appears to be a word much bandied about &mdash; dressed up, by the way.  I find it disturbing that while the Minister has envisaged a vast range of extra services and functions which it is proposed that the LECs will have, on the other hand she appears to think that this will not require the services of locally or regionally elected persons. Of course, there should be places for social partners and various people of industry.  However, the whole set-up envisaged by the Minister is antidemocratic and takes away from the will of the people as expressed in their local representatives.  That has been the primary virtue of the VECs.  They prided themselves on their democratic, nondenominational nature.  Bearing in mind that all sorts of persons put themselves forward for local elections, the composition of those committees has worked out extraordinary well and they have served the country very well.  It is a very retrograde step that the Minister should seek to diminish the powers of local representatives who have proved so capable in the field of education.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education, arising from the publication of the Green Paper, if she will give details of the costing considerations which were examined by her Department in deciding that regionalisation was the most economic way of proceeding to reform and rationalise second-level education.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">

      <P>The costing considerations examined by my Department included the costs of the present administrative and executive functions which are centralised in my Department and the costs associated with the 38 existing VECs, each of which has its own administration at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will be appreciated that it is not desired to increase the costs of administration and that any funds available should go towards the improvement of services for young people rather than be eaten up in administration costs.  In these circumstances, and making due allowance for the fact that the administration of individual vocational schools would be devolved to a local board of management, it would be possible, given reasonably viable areas, to provide additional services without increasing administrative costs.  The numbers of staff employed in my Department on the functions being devolved and the numbers of staff employed by the 38 VECs at present would be sufficient to enable the 13 local <Col N="1309" /> education councils to discharge the functions proposed for them.</P>

      <P>I wish to take up the last sentence of the Minister's reply in which she speaks of 13 envisaged local education councils.  I understood from various documents emanating from the Minister's office to anxious party activists of her party that 13 was not a set number but was up for consideration, for flexibility, possible enlargement, reviewing, discussing and so forth.  These were reassuring words.  The Minister has now given quite definitively the number of 13.  Will that be the number, or will the number not be much more?</P>

In the Green Paper it was stated quite clearly that there are 13 local education councils.

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond) Barry Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated in the earlier part of my contribution on the health services, this Government's policy has been and will remain consistent with the broad strategy set down in the national plan, <i>Building on Reality</i>.  The emphasis in policy now and for the foreseeable future is a shift towards prevention of disease and an emphasis on community care, ensuring that scarce resources are directed more specifically and selectively towards those in greatest need.  The measures being taken in 1986 in the light of the allocation for health services should be judged in this way.</P>
      <P>Naturally, at a time when resources are scarce it becomes more difficult to shift the emphasis within total spending, since development in one area must be compensated for by scaling down of activity elsewhere.  This amounts to no more than a recognition that the cash resource we are dividing up is of limited size and that desirable policy changes must be achieved within those limits.  However, it also imposes an obligation to ensure that the nature of the changes introduced are such as to improve the way in which resources are used.  Policy changes must necessarily be directed to bringing about a more effective, equitable and efficient health care system and this Government can certainly point to a range of activities which satisfy these criteria.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First, there is no longer any argument about the need for a greater emphasis on the whole area of prevention and health promotion.  This country is a party to the World Health Organisation strategy for Health for All by the year 2,000.  There is a concentration in this strategy on the development in each member country of an active health promotion policy.  While we can point to a number of services already provided in the preventive area, the strategy put foward by the WHO envisages a much more aggressive and comprehensive approach in which all <Col N="1330" /> decision making in an economy is informed to some extent by a health perspective. I contend that I have followed that approach and have introduced a number of immediate measures.  For example, last year as a matter of budget policy we introduced a measles vaccination programme which came into effect on 1 October last.  That scheme has achieved a 75 per cent vaccination of the target population in the short period since its introduction.  This is almost three times the success rate achieved in the United Kingdom over a period of two years. The Government have provided an extra £250,000 to extend the measles scheme to the end of March, bringing total spending to date on the scheme to £900,000. The investment in this scheme will yield a very substantial return by eliminating much unnecessary and costly illness from the child population.</P>
    <P>Developments in preventive services have not been confined to the child population, of course.  Among adults, smoking is considered by the World Health Organisation to be the single most preventable cause of ill health in developed countries. Since about 5,000 deaths each year in this country are directly associated with tobacco smoking and the health of many more is impaired by smoking there is an urgent need for Ireland to adopt the type of measures advocated by the World Health Organisation.</P>
    <P>As part of my programme to reduce the damage to health caused by smoking I recently introduced new Tobacco Products Regulations.  The main effects of the new regulations are to introduce a new system of rotational health warnings and increase the space requirements for such warnings on tobacco advertisements and packages.  The aim behind the new measures is to ensure that smokers are more aware of the risks smoking poses to their health.</P>
    <P>Existing provisions relating to control of sponsorship are currently being examined and I will shortly be making recommendations to Government on any changes I think appropriate.  It is also my intention to introduce shortly a Bill to prohibit smoking in certain designated <Col N="1331" /> public places and this Bill will include the collection of a levy on moneys used to promote sales of tobacco products, the proceeds of which will be used for additional health education on smoking and health.</P>
    <P>At a broader level my Department are continuing to support the Kilkenny Health Project, which was inaugurated in March 1985.  This project, which embodies a unique combination of research, education and primary intervention is supported by the Irish Heart Foundation and involves participation by the Medico-Social Research Board and South Eastern Health Board.  Its aim is to bring about a reduction in morbidity and mortality from coronary disease in this country.</P>
    <P>These initiatives represent concrete steps in the development of our preventive services.  They demonstrate positively that it is possible to make progress, even when resources are under severe pressure, and they mark the direction in which the health services, in collaboration with other sectors, will have to devote an increasing share of their energies and resources.</P>
    <P>The sensible strategy adopted in regard to community services is to switch the emphasis to community care when it is a viable option, recognising the need to maintain an efficient and orderly hospital system.</P>
    <P>The Government's commitment to the development of community care is documented in a number of major service reviews completed over the past number of years.  These include the report of the Working Party on the General Medical Service, which marked a serious commitment to the development of primary health care in this country and the review of psychiatric services which advocated a radical reorientation of psychiatric services to the community.  The follow up to both of these reviews is currently proceeding and further reviews are planned for services for the elderly and on the whole question of community care organisation.</P>
    <P>Commentators who point to the slow <Col N="1332" /> development of community care should recognise that we must learn to walk before we can run.  In effecting changes in the balance between institutional and community care we need to be particularly cautious.  What many people do not appreciate is that community care has significant implications for the community and not just the community-based health services.  It involves to a considerable extent shifting the burden of care to the unpaid carers in the community &mdash; the families and friends of people who would otherwise be institutionalised as well as to the formal health services at community level.  This caution should not be interpreted as a lack of commitment.</P>
    <P>In the current year I am taking particular care to ensure that spending on particular community based services is maintained at a level equivalent at least to 1985 expenditure in real terms.  These include key services for the old and housebound such as community nursing services, home help services and meals on wheels; child care services, particularly day care and pre-school services for deprived and disadvantaged communities, after-care programmes for children leaving long term residential care and boarding-out payments to reflect the trend towards increased numbers in foster care.  The health boards have been asked to maintain at least existing levels of expenditure on dental, ophthalmic and aural services.  The effect of these measures will be to discriminate in favour of community services in the allocation of resources between care programmes in 1986.</P>
    <P>I also expect to see significant progress in 1986 in the development of comprehensive family planning services throughout the country.  Following the commencement of the Family Planning (Amendment) Act, 1985, which eased many of the restrictions on access to contraception under previous legislation, the health boards were asked to review the services in their areas and to draw up plans to develop an appropriate level of service in their respective areas.  Such plans have now been drawn up and their implementation, for the first time in this <Col N="1333" /> country, will ensure that the community has reasonable access to a full family planning service, now considered to be a basic prerequisite in the social reality of the eighties.</P>
    <P>Another important element in this Government's programme of social and legislative reform is the introduction of new and more enlightened legislation in relation to children.  The existing legislation in this area is now badly outdated and not in keeping with current concepts in regard to the well-being of the child.</P>
    <P>Members of the House will now be familiar with the intent and terms of the Children (Care and Protection) Bill, which has now passed Second Stage. While undoubtedly a good deal of work remains to be done on the Bill, I am determined that it should now proceed through the remaining Stages and pass into law as speedily as possible.</P>
    <P>I intend to bring forward a Bill to amend the Adoption Act which will provide for the adoption of legitimate children who have been abandoned or deserted by their parents.  These major legislative reforms mark a milestone in our society's attitude towards the care of children.</P>
    <P>One implication of the protection of expenditure levels on a range of community services is that expenditure on institutional services, and particularly the general hospitals programme which continues to absorb about half of total non-capital resources, cannot grow in an unplanned way.  We have embarked on a major development programme in our general hospital system.  This has culminated in the upgrading of many existing hospitals and the building of a number of major new hospitals.  However, the underlying rationale has always been that in the interests of efficiency a lesser number of larger sized hospitals was preferable to a proliferation of small hospitals. We have always envisaged that some of the older under-utilised hospitals would be phased out of the system when the new developments came on stream. Indeed, any other course could scarcely be regarded as contributing to greater efficiency.  We must also continue to find <Col N="1334" /> the resources necessary, as we did in 1985, to fund developments like open heart surgery in the Cork Regional Hospital and renal dialysis in Limerick Regional Hospital.</P>
    <P>In regard to psychiatric services, I recently published a report <i>The Psychiatric Services: Planning for the Future</i> which sets out a clear-cut plan for a community oriented psychiatric service under which the need for the large psychiatric hospitals will gradually disappear.  Health boards are currently preparing their plans for the implementation of the findings of this report.</P>
    <P>This theme was also an integral part of the strategy outlined in the national plan. In 1986 we have reached the point when it is necessary and appropriate to commence the programme of rationalising hospital facilities.  The Government have decided that the first stage will involve the closure, scaling down or phasing out in 1986 of certain facilities which are demonstrably superfluous in the context of a rational, cost effective and integrated hospital system.</P>
    <P>The hospitals due for closure in 1986 include Sir Patrick Duns; St Patrick's Infant Hospital, Blackrock; Eye, Ear and Throat Hospital, Cork; Killarney Isolation Hospital; Castlerea Mental Hospital; Roscrea District Hospital; Longford County Hospital; and St Dympna's Mental Hospital, Carlow.</P>

At the risk of provoking Deputies, I have to deal with the hospitals where the Deputy regrettably interrupted.  I stated the situation in Castlerea Mental Hospital and referred to Roscrea District Hospital. Then I went on to deal with the question of Longford County Hospital.  As Deputies are aware, the Midland Health Board had already decided and have gone ahead, due to the premature retirement of the hospital surgeon in that hospital, to close the hospital as from next weekend.  I understand that decision has been confirmed by the health board as part of its plan at a meeting of the board yesterday. I have to inform the House of that in case there is any confusion.</P>

    <P>One other psychiatric hospital is included, St. Dympna's Mental Hospital <Col N="1339" /> in Carlow.

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Planning is proceeding for developments at St. Mary's School for the Blind, Merrion.  We have decided to maintain and develop a health infrastructure which meets the requirements of a modern health service.  With regard to the management of the health services I should like to state that while the strategy currently adopted is sufficient to address the immediate problems in the health services, the recessionary conditions with which we have had to contend in recent years have, I think, brought to the surface a number of broader issues. The acceptance that we have to live within defined resource constraints has induced a more questioning approach to health service management, both centrally and at local level and has highlighted the need to develop a more professional approach to administration in the health services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The crux of the matter is that the public purse does not have the capacity to satisfy simultaneously all demands being made on it.  Inevitably this leads into the need to establish priorities, to identify new and better ways of pursuing our objectives and implementing changes in policy as appropriate.  In the health services we are not dealing with a simple or stationary system.  We are managing a complex system which is constantly faced with new problems and which also has to absorb new methods of dealing with both new and old problems.  The times call for a dynamic and responsive approach supported by efficient management and information systems.  The systems were almost devoid of real information for years.  It has been breaking my heart to get audited returns from the health boards for 1982, when I was not even Minister for Health, and for 1983 to try to find out what is going on.  I have said that I want to change the system for the better despite political and profesional vested interests who want no change except to represent their own interests perpetually, incessantly and adamantly and to force the political parties into delivering them whether they merit delivery or not.  I make no apology for trying to change that and I am convinced that if I <Col N="1343" /> get the ordinary, sane co-operation of this House where people do not work themselves into a frenzy over particular issues&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy Haughey knows how trenchant we both can be in our reactions.  However, I am convinced that we can change a great deal in the health services.  They are quite outstanding at present.  We have a sum of £1,200 million in cash resources this year, £38 million more than last year.  There will be no cutback but I am not going to waste one penny of the money.  I am convinced that we can make major changes.  We have a very good health service which I intend to project and to develop in the direction in which it should be going and not where I found it when I took over in 1983 when it was moribund, rigid, unresponsive and incapable of delivering any change.</P>

      <P>The statistics in the Minister's speech were interesting, especially in relation to Sir Patrick Dun's, St. Patrick's Infant Hospital, Blackrock, The Eye and Ear Hospital, Cork, the <Col N="1344" /> Killarney Isolation Hospital, Castlerea Mental Hospital, Roscrea District Hospital, Longford County Hospital and Saint Dympna's Mental Hospital.  No plans seem to have been made for the future of the patients of these hospitals.  Deputy Leyden made the point that only 45 of the 200 patients in the hospital in his area knew where they were going.  The staff in these hospitals have no information and it is understandable why people are upset and concerned.</P>
      <P>After the budget yesterday, people calculated the effect it would have on their lives.  However, it is obvious that any increase in allowances will be clawed back by increases in indirect taxation, petrol, car taxes and the loss of the £100 child allowance.  When children continue full time education after 18 years there is no allowance for them.  The Minister did not refer to this but the people involved do not gain in children's allowances because there is no allowance for those over 18.  People who try to educate their children lose their tax-free allowance as a result of the budget and get nothing in return.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government came into office with the avowed aim of reducing borrowing, arresting the unemployment spiral and with a programme of social legislation which was to make us the envy of any progressive democrat.  During their time in office, there has been a massive increase in borrowing, 250,000 people are unemployed and we have the greatest collection of first edition reports which this country has ever seen.  The industrial and employment shambles, as well as the deep demoralisation of the nation, is a mirror image of the political ineptitude of the Coalition and their inability to do anything right.  Even children playing monopoly know that one must invest to build but there has been a 17 per cent reduction in investment since 1981 for the simple reason that risk capital is so heavily taxed that it is easier and more profitable to pump money into Government gilts than to invest it in the community or the country.  Thus, industrial production is in serious decline because funds are being moved out of the country <Col N="1345" /> on account of the low level of economic activity here or they are lying inactive in safe financial coffers.  More and more funds are being invested outside the country because of the major loopholes in the EMS.</P>
    <P>There can be no increase in employment unless individuals and the big companies are willing to risk their capital. Last year the top 40 publicly quoted companies in <i>The Irish Times</i> company list made no overall contribution to employment, in fact there was a net loss of 436 jobs.  Again, last year, two-thirds of the job losses came from companies trimming employment.  I know there is a strong link between management, profitability and employment but there must also be worthwhile incentives for those who are willing to put their money working for the country.  I also believe very strongly that it is long past time for switching from capital incentives for new companies coming into this country to employment incentives, where grants or subsidies are given on the basis of the number of people actually employed rather than handling out massive sums of public money in the hope that some day a particular company will be good enough to increase their employment.  In spite of the success of many IDA projects, I remain unconvinced that capital grants are as good for the needs of our young population as grants tied in with increased employment.</P>
    <P>One of the things that the Coalition will be angrily remembered for is that by their financial naivete and bungling ineptitude, they have created a new social group &mdash; the fifth estate.  The people in the fifth estate have houses but can barely meet the repayments, have jobs but can barely make ends meet after the savage tax take, have good education but cannot get jobs, have valuable skills and talents but cannot find any outlet for them, have enterprise and ambition but are not given any encouragement.  They are at one and the same time the haves and the have nots.  The demoralised citizens of the fifth estate will note carefully what action the Minister for Finance took in his budget yesterday.  Make no mistake about it, <Col N="1346" /> when the time comes the people of the fifth estate will tear the Coalition apart to regain a future that has been seriously put at risk by Government negligence.</P>
    <P>We all know that we have below average incomes and living standards but above average unemployment, taxation and borrowing.  We must offer worthwhile incentives to those who are willing to risk their capital in providing employment. We must show compassion for the fifth estate who can only educate their children at great personal sacrifice, who can barely afford to run cars which are essential for their work, who can rarely have meat on the table because they cannot afford it, who can hardly afford to cloth their teenage children as they would like because the Government increased prices by more tax.</P>
    <P>The budget is meant to outline the financial projections for the year ahead, the economic outlook and how the Government will tackle the major problems. Unfortunately, yesterday's budget avoided the major issues.  Despite the promise in 1982 that the national debt would be reversed, controlled and brought down to manageable levels, it is higher than ever.  When the Coalition came into office they tried to say that it was not the overall figures that bothered them but the percentage.  That worked for two years but it will not work any longer.  They said they would halt and reverse the levels of unemployment, although it has increased by 70,000 and continues to go up.  Last month we had the highest increase ever and from the unofficial reports it will again increase this month.</P>
    <P>While yesterday's budget had small if welcome increases in the bands and tax allowances, they were tiny for those in the middle income group and are totally eliminated when measured against the increases in the goods these people have to provide &mdash; cars, petrol and household goods.  It would be wrong to say that anybody will be better off as a result of this budget in six months' time.  Like last year, people will see that what the Minister says does not tie in with the facts.</P>
    <P>This morning I listened to the Minister <Col N="1347" /> for Finance on the &ldquo;John Bowman Show&rdquo; being questioned by telephone by the women of this country.  It could be clearly seen that these women had worked out their figures and knew exactly what the budget meant for them.  People are so hard up and are finding it so difficult to make ends meet that they calculate to the last penny just what the budget means to them.  This did not happen in the past. The people are very quick to realise when the Government are trying to mislead them by saying that there is a huge switch from the PAYE sector to insurance companies, the banks, the speculators and the private investors.</P>

      <P>In the weeks ahead the Deputy will see that these charges will be passed on to the consumers.  Mortgage rates will be hit and bank charges will increase.  The banks will continue to make profits and invest them outside the country.  If the Government really wanted to do something in this area why did they not repartriate foreign profits?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no need to nationalise banks, although the Government almost did that last year when they bailed a bank out.  The banks can hardly complain this year when the Government pumped in millions of pounds of taxpayers' money to help them out of trouble.  The fact is that it is the consumer who will have to pay these charges and the bank profits will be the same this year as they were last year and the year before. Time will tell.  In six months' time the Deputy will realise what I am saying is true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the budget played with these <Col N="1348" /> pluses and minuses it did nothing to help overcome our major problem &mdash; to create employment and to solve the unemployment problem.  We should try to help those people who are worried, angry, frustrated and demoralised because they cannot get jobs, people who are on the breadline and who cannot do more than put bread on the table and, maybe, pay the rent.  An increase of £1.60 a week for an unemployed person who has to pay rent, provide food and clothing for himself, his wife and children has no value in 1986.  An increase of £1.60, even with inflation running at 3 per cent or 4 per cent, will not help these people maintain the same standard of living they enjoyed in 1985.</P>
    <P>Statistics show that the people on the lowest income group spend a higher proportion of their money on food and clothing. They cannot survive on the miserly increases for which the Minister for Social Welfare said they should be grateful. People on social welfare want to work.  They want a Government which will put money into job creation, and which will encourage investors to take their money which they have invested all around the world and put it into risk capital here to try to raise our economy. These people do not want a hand-out. They accept the Minister's hand-out only because they need to survive and have a duty to their children, but what they really want is work.</P>
    <P>What have this Government done? There has been an 18 per cent fall-off in investment since 1981.  Our biggest industry is agriculture, but if one were to read yesterday's budget statement one would get the impression that there was something wrong with the word.  Again the construction industry has been hammered because the money is being pulled out of the capital programme.  There are thousands of people walking the streets in the Twenty-six Counties and nobody cares.</P>
    <P>The Minister says the Government are spending £1 billion on social welfare.  He says there will be more medical referees, doctors, inspectors and assessors to make sure there are no fiddles.  If this Government <Col N="1349" /> created employment, that £1 billion would be reduced and only people on invalidity and disability benefits would need to be helped.  If this were done we would not need inspectors.</P>
    <P>A great deal of the £8 billion which has been provided in the Estimates is being spent on totally inadequate hand-outs.  If that money were spent trying to stimulate the economy I would say that yesterday's budget was a good one.  But will one job be created as a result of that budget, except for the medical referees who will haunt the people who do not turn up for their disability benefit because they are in hospital, or assessors who are trying to catch those who are trying to fiddle the system?</P>
    <P>I have no time for people who try to fiddle the tax system but this Government must stop calling people with money rogues or gangsters, saying they are conning the system and so on.  We should encourage those people to invest here. There are almost 250,000 people out of work and the Minister should be convincing investors to invest here.  Over the next four or five weeks the Minister should do something like this before he introduces the Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>Some years ago Jack Lynch said that no Government should be in power if the unemployment level was over 100,000. At that time everyone in Fine Gael agreed and said Fianna Fáil should be thrown out if that happened.  Now the figure is 250,000 and nobody seems to give a damn.  Everyone ignores it.  The Coalition parties when in opposition used to get into a frenzy over the current budget deficit.  They said the country was going down the tube and that the international bankers would come in to liquidate us.  The State owes £21 billion now and nobody cares.</P>
    <P>My view is that this is utter hypocrisy and it sickens me to see the biggest social evil, unemployment being ignored.  The Minister is playing with £100 here and £100 there and the people are about to revolt.  The Minister spoke about dramatic increases in the tax system. Three or four times yesterday he tried to convince us that he had brought in a <Col N="1350" /> major realignment of the tax bands and that he had altered the tax system in a fantastic way.  He did almost nothing. As long as we continue to play with the PAYE and PRSI systems the situation will continue to be in a mess and the PAYE taxpayers will continue to pay more.  No matter how much tinkering is being done with the PAYE system, the situation remains the same.</P>
    <P>Until some Government take the five reports from the Income Taxation Commission and have the guts to do something meaningful about them we will continue to have the present system. I do not accept what the Minister said this morning: that the members on that commission got their figures wrong.  They did very good work, particularly in the fifth report.  I see much merit in some of their proposals for an expenditure tax.  It is no good closing every loophole on the self-employed, on the PAYE sector and on business people.  There are other sectors and the only way to catch them is to have an expenditure tax.  People have not considered fully all that could be done with such a tax.  When I studied accountancy 15 years ago I thought it was the only way to close all the loopholes and I am still of that opinion.  The officials in the Department should look at the recommendations.  It is easy to say that we would not get the money but the point is that we do not get the money from those sectors now.  Everyone has to buy goods and commodities.  The recommendation in question is worthy of examination.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned already that we spend £1 billion on unemployment benefit and assistance.  We also spend from £600 million to £700 million on a wide range of courses under the aegis of AnCO, the National Manpower Service, YEA, IPA, IMI and schemes under the aegis of the VEC and the Department of Education.  All of these courses are training people and are educating them in courses that lead to nothing.  Eventually they all lead to emigration but not one of those courses helps to prepare people for that possibility.  At the moment many young people are going away unprepared <Col N="1351" /> and are suffering hardship and people from the Irish clubs who visit this country confirm that.</P>
    <P>When will the Government produce a White Paper on manpower policy?  Last year I raised the matter but the House on that occasion did not divide on a Private Members' motion.  Will we continue the situation where young people are leaving school with no hope for the future?  We are trying to fool them by providing courses but that is not the solution.  If the £600 million or £700 million were given to them to allow them to set up small businesses or co-operative movements it might be worthwhile.  There are a number of worthwhile projects proceeding at the moment; for instance, there is the case of the Liffey Trust where warehouses have been obtained at low rent.  They have been renovated and young people with apprenticeship skills are encouraged to start up small businesses making crafts and furniture.</P>
    <P>It is not good enough to give people £30 per week on work experience programmes merely to file letters.  These people are then let go after a short time and they are worse off than ever.  Some people have been given £60 to clear graveyards but if they were given that money and the proper advice to set up an enterprise for themselves it would be of some benefit.  I have talked to many people who have been on four or five courses conducted by AnCO or the YEA and they are fed up with what is happening. This Government have been talking for three years about a manpower policy. The last manpower policy was initiated in 1965 when AnCO and the National Manpower Service were established. Their brief then was to train people for all the jobs then available.  That is totally unrealistic today when we have 250,000 unemployed.  The policy is outdated and is a waste of money.  If any cuts in public expenditure are to be made they should be done in that area.  We need a White Paper urgently because the present set-up has created unbelievable disillusionment throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Yesterday it was sad to see the areas <Col N="1352" /> where cutbacks were made.  I do not know why this Government continue to cut back on the capital programme while maintaining other less essential services. The Minister for Health asked me to name one and I did so.  The capital programme has always been used to try to stimulate investment and employment. We must ask what will happen to the construction industry.  We have a small economy that is open to the pressures and the forces of the rest of Europe. If we do not have a capital programme with the State giving help in respect of investment and construction, how can we expect anybody else to do it?  There has been a reduction in this sector of 18 per cent since 1981.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health told us about opening some hospitals.  He has not done that.  A sum of £37.5 million has been spent on Beaumont Hospital and it costs £1.5 million for security and heating costs.  Yet, no real effort is being made to open it.  It has been suggested that a few consultants in the Richmond Hospital are the cause of the problem but that is not true.  It is not the reason for the slow down in the development work at the Mater Hospital or in St. James' Hospital.  The Minister tells us about the new developments here and there but he will not open the hospitals that are finished.  There is a shortage of beds in hospitals.</P>
    <P>I gather the Minister was attacking the medical consultants even though he said it in a roundabout way.  He said the services they wish to provide were not necessary. Some 3,000 people are on the waiting list of the Mater Hospital.  Hundreds of people are waiting for heart operations and the hospital is packed to capacity.  The phase just finished should have been opened years ago.  Beaumont Hospital is locked up and at Blanchardstown the work is going ahead at half speed.  The Minister tells us he cannot do any more but I say that if he opened a few hospitals he would provide a better service.  If he put more money into the hospitals already built he could move two hospitals from the city centre to Beaumont. <Col N="1353" /> Then Jervis Street Hospital could be used as a drug centre and St. Laurence's Hospital could be used for geriatric patients.  This was suggested five years ago but the Minister will not do that.  He gets uptight and excited and he raises his blood pressure thinking he has to fight the entire country but all people want to do is to help.  It is a strange way to carry on.</P>
    <P>Public service pay forms part of my brief.  I have not made life difficult for the Minister for the Public Service because I accept the difficulty of paying for the public service.  I accept that every 1 per cent increase is a huge amount in money terms.  On the first day the Dáil resumed in October we asked him to negotiate with the workers and the unions across a table rather than negotiate through the media.  I think he and the Minister for Education have now learned their lesson. They realise now that they cannot browbeat people and that they must negotiate. The Minister's long nights of anguish and negotiation would not have been necessary if he had realised earlier that people will no longer tolerate being dictated to. However, it is good to note that he has had to rid himself of his arrogant approach.</P>
    <P>I raise the point at this time because it is so important in the context of the budget.  It appears from what I heard before coming into the House that there are no negotiations in progress with the teachers' unions and that the Government will introduce an amendment in the House on Thursday next in relation to the arbitration award which was for the payment of 5 per cent on 1 September and a further 5 per cent on 1 March.  At the time the arbitrator made his decision he said that he has taken full account of economic circumstances.  The Minister wishes the teachers to accept phased payment of the award.  I spoke to some of the representatives of the teachers yesterday and I have spoken to hundreds of them in the past weeks and my understanding is that they are prepared to talk about phased payment but that the bone <Col N="1354" /> of contention is the issue of restrospection.</P>
    <P>We have had 30 year's experience of the conciliation and arbitration system, a system that has been beneficial to the State.  Down through the years public servants always got the lowest increases, the minimum levels of the pay agreements or of any other awards.  They had to use the system of conciliation and arbitration to try to catch up with what was the position outside.  That was not the proper way to have to deal with the matter because, infortunately, I know from my experience of talking with leaders of the trade union movement that they regard the round increases as being available anyway and then begin seeking ways of achieving special increases.  Some of these people are beginning to realise that they could be much better off by not having a conciliation and arbitration procedure but by going to the Labour Court which would have an arm that would deal generally with the public service. In that way, it is contended, the increases would be paid when they should be paid and not a few years later.  That system, too, would be far better for the State because it is difficult and harmful for the State when an arbitration award that would cost several hundreds of millions of pounds is made.  It is said that to pay the teachers' award would cost £110 million, but the retrospection is the outstanding issue according to the teachers, though the Ministers concerned would say the money is the whole issue.</P>
    <P>Therefore, to avoid teachers' strikes, disruption of examinations and so on, I am calling on the Minister to sit down again this week with the teachers and to reach an agreement.  Perhaps the Minister believes he has a safe majority, but I regard the issue as being much more important.  It will not benefit any of us if we reach the stage next week that the Government will bring in an amendment on which there will be a vote and that the teachers, because of the Government's majority will then find themselves in a campaign backed by the Public Services Committee of Congress plus the total membership of their own associations. <Col N="1355" /> Some say the teachers do not have a mandate for what they are doing.  I would not agree.  On a cold December's day they were able to bring 25,000 people to Croke Park.  That figure represented about five-eights of their entire membership.</P>
    <P>If the Government are prepared to talk to the teachers this weekend they should be able to bring in an amendment next week that will be agreed.  The solution may be to phase further the payments but to pay in total the amount due by way of retrospection.  There was an item in yesterday's Budget Statement which did not receive any subsequent attention. The Minister for Finance, to his credit, told us that those teachers who are on pension or those who are about to go on pension will benefit from the full payment immediately.  Therefore, it is only a matter of moving from there to giving in on the retrospection.  The C and A report is binding.  Various Ministers from time to time have introduced amendments in respect of awards but an arbitration award relating to teachers has never been amended in this way.  The Minister should remember that when a Fianna Fáil Government rejected the proposals of an arbitration finding on behalf of teachers in, I think, 1948 the teachers caused a major battle for the party in the subsequent general election.  Fianna Fáil lost that election.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>There will not be much point in my asking for permission to raise the issue on Tuesday.  The Minister must act this weekend.  The teachers are willing to participate in negotiations in an effort to find a solution to the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is regrettable that the whole matter of the huge sums of money meted out by this economy to major investors coming in here is not tackled in this budget, apart from being addressed in a limited way. The change referred to yesterday will mean that in future IDA grants to companies coming into the State must not be <Col N="1356" /> used afterwards by way of the recipients trying to claim back tax allowances.  We have been operating the ridiculous machinery whereby the State were granting tax allowances in respect of moneys that were paid by the State in the first instance.</P>
    <P>If this Government do not change the whole scenario in respect of IDA grants, Fianna Fáil will act in this area when returned to power.  We will change the whole position in regard to IDA grants based on capital and concentrate on labour.  In an economy in which 18 per cent of the population is unemployed, the present position is incredible.  In my talks with the representations of the various trade unions I hear time and again of how the introduction of a new machine on foot of, say, a £100,000 grant from the Government caused the laying off eventually of eight workers.  We must gear our efforts to creating work.  It is ridiculous that the IDA would not give consideration to the number of jobs linked to any grant that is given.  There should be a clear link between IDA grants and the number of jobs involved. No grant should be made solely on the basis of the modernisation of machinery for the purpose of sustaining markets abroad.  If we continue on that road we will have the best machinery in the world but no jobs.  For years people in the trade union movement who have been the victims of cutbacks in terms of redundancies, liquidations and so on, have been pointing out that, while the IDA do a tremendous job in bringing foreign based industry to the country, the capital grants system will result in a continuing reduction in employment.  Grants should be paid on reality and not on projections that may never be fulfilled.  The grants should be on the basis of, say, £20,000 or £50,000 per job provided.  They should not be paid, as is the present case, for no purpose.</P>
    <P>The ICTU in their statement today expressed their concern at the cutbacks in the Estimates yesterday. Some of these cuts, especially in the Estimate for the Environment, will lead to unemployment. <Col N="1357" /> Is it not a fact that some of the schemes for short-term employment by local authorities will now have to be cut back?  Already the local authorities are aware that they will have to reduce expenditure in 1986.  In the case of Dublin Corporation the cutback is severe.</P>

      <P>Deputy Noel Treacy has been given permission to raise on the Adjournment the urgency for a directive by the Minister for Agriculture to the Land Commission to acquire a 700-acre farm in Galway East.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you for giving me this opportunity to raise this very important matter affecting my constituency. I am delighted that the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Deputy Connaughton, is here because I am sure his heart is with the people of Galway East.  Surely between the two of us we can do something to alleviate the situation there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister for Agriculture and the Government to ensure that this farm of some 673 acres in the townlands of Ballyhoose, Caltragh and Kylemore, Lawrencetown, Ballinasloe, Galway, popularly and officially known as the Kenny estate, be acquired by the Land Commission and allocated on the standard basis &mdash; either a lease back, sell back or rent basis &mdash; to the local farmers. Seldom do the people of the west have an opportunity like this to avail of so much good quality land in the south-east area of my constituency.  This farm is bounded by approximately 30 congested farmers, at least half of whom have a deep interest in acquiring this land.  Adjacent to that we have 36 small cottiers, people who live in council houses or former council houses and have a maximum one acre of land at their disposal.  I am asking that the Minister of State should exercise his right through the <Col N="1358" /> Land Commission to purchase this farm. I have taken up this matter with the Land Commission in Dublin and in Galway and with both the Minister and the Minister of State.  I have tried to raise it by way of ordinary and Private Notice Questions and I am deeply grateful to the Ceann Comhairle for this opportunity to raise the matter now.  I have always got the stock answer that the Land Commission are no longer acquiring land.  That is immaterial because the functions of the Land Commission are specific, as laid down in legislation.  No Bill has come before this House to change the function, policy or structure of the Land Commission.  While there may be a change in administrative policy at this time, that does not deprive the Land Commission of their powers or functions.</P>
    <P>I speak on behalf of those who want to acquire land.  I do not want to tie the hands of the Minister of State, the Department or the Land Commission. All I am asking is that this estate should be purchased by the Land Commission. The Minister of State has undoubtedly garnered much experience and expertise during the past few years while he has been in charge of the Land Commission. I compliment him on his efforts but this is a major test and a golden opportunity for him to put into action on the ground in his own constituency the policy which he has promoted during the past three or four years.  This is a vital opportunity for the Minister of State to use this farm as a blue print for land restructuring and redeployment.</P>
    <P>The Land Commission should acquire the land and then, with the expertise of the Minister, it could be sold in certain cases to farmers who could afford to buy it &mdash; there are a few but not many who would be able to do so.  Other portions of the land could be leased back or rented back in the normal Land Commission manner or held in a land bank until such time as it would be possible to carry out some restructuring in the county.  I know some people ten or 20 miles away who would be delighted to have a 60-acre or 80-acre farm there and would give up their own land to be reallocated by the <Col N="1359" /> Land Commission.  There are many options available to the Minister and I do not want to tie his hands.  Basically I am here in the interest of the farmers in my area.  We have a dual responsibility to our constituents to ensure that this opportunity is not lost.  Such an opportunity will probably not occur again in our day.</P>
    <P>The precedent has already been established. I see one of the Land Commission officials here and I am sure it would not be too difficult for him to delve into the files and produce the evidence that some years ago the Land Commission acquired the major part of this estate and reallocated it among the local small farmers. This is an unfinished job and the Minister of State has an opportunity to proceed with the acquisition of this land and its reallocation to many people who have not viable farms and cannot make a livelihood out of agriculture in their own area.</P>
    <P>This farm is situated two miles from Lawrencetown, five miles from Eyrecourt, eight miles from Banagher, 12 miles from Ballinasloe and just one hour's drive from Shannon Airport.  Its proximity to those towns indicates that it is very close to the River Shannon.  There are many congested farmers in this area; those at the bottom of the scale would have 15 or 18 acres while those at the other end would have 30 or 40 acres. There are some exceptional cases of farmers who have huge amounts of land but these are very well-to-do people, very good farmers, who are not interested in this situation.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Connaughton, has clearly shown the small farmers what the group purchase scheme is all about.  These farmers would not have amongst them the actual resources to avail of the provisions of the group purchase scheme in a manner that would enable the Minister of State to acquire the lands and reallocate them in that manner.  The State would need to step in to take over that land bank and reallocate it.  I want to make it clear that I have known the vendor of this farm for many years.  I conducted business with this man on many occasions.  He is a very decent <Col N="1360" /> man and has a constitutional right to get the maximum price for his farm.  I would not want to inhibit that man from getting the maximum price.  I am aware also that the State has a constitutional function to play in this matter.  As officers of the State, the Minister of State and the Land Commission would have to ensure that the proper constitutional rights of the vendor are protected.  I want to ensure that will be the outcome.</P>
    <P>There may be a shortage of cash. Goodness knows, after yesterday's budget and the way in which agriculture has been totally neglected &mdash; with the allocation of funds to the farm modernisation scheme again cut back, the money not having been voted &mdash; it is obvious that there is not much money around or indeed much good will towards agriculture. Last weekend at a meeting in Lawrencetown, in the presence of the Minister of State I said &mdash; as one who has had the privilege of representing farmers on behalf of my party in Europe in the past year, having gone to the European Investment Bank and talked to the people there &mdash; that I knew the money was available.  I know that the goodwill of that bank is available to this country. We have a very high credit rating.  There is nothing that £1 million would not do. Certainly £1 million would purchase and fence this farm, making it available to local farmers.  If the State is not prepared, from its own resources, or if the good will does not exist to provide the £1 million required to acquire this land in the interest of these farmers, then it should be remembered that money is available at 5 per cent to this State or to any agency of Government here.  All we must guarantee is the exchange risk.  With our punt so strong I believe the exchange risk would amount to perhaps 1 per cent, 2 per cent or, at most, 3 per cent.  Therefore, we are talking about money borrowed at a maximum rate of 8 per cent and definitely no more than 10 per cent. If the Government borrow money from the European Investment Bank, if that £1 million forms part of a figure accumulating to something in the region of £160 million, we will get back into our Exchequer <Col N="1361" /> in the region of £16 million to £20 million as a direct cash incentive from the EC to stimulate economic growth here. Therefore nobody can maintain that those funds are not available.</P>
    <P>It should be remembered that as at 31 December last the Minister for Agriculture, in his efforts to remedy the disastrous financial situation obtaining here, crucified Irish agriculture, perhaps unwittingly, returning out of the 1985 budgetary provisions a figure of £27 million into the Central Exchequer.  Certainly £1 million of that £27 million would do a wonderful job in this area.  Nobody can maintain unequivocally or categorically that the money is not there, that money cannot be got.  All we need is the goodwill and the structure devised to implement what I seek.</P>
    <P>I feel very sad that the Land Commission is slowly being ground to a halt.  They made a major contribution to land mobility here over the years.  Many people would contend that land mobility has been much too slow.  Obviously it has been.  Politicians on all sides of this House, probably past and present, must take some of the blame for that, the Exchequer, the public service and so on who had a role to play in this.  On many an occasion it was economic circumstances which dictated the course of action to be taken.  I believe the Land Commission formed a safety valve, a security for Irish farmers who needed land to make a living from it.  Now the position is that local farmers cannot survive, make a livelihood from farming or sustain their families on the land because the amount of land at their disposal is much too small. The size of holdings range from 15 acres to perhaps a maximum of 40 acres approximately.  Such farmers must avail of work whenever and wherever it is available.  Usually they go up the road to Clonfert, only a few miles away, and work for Bord na Móna.  We are all aware of the cutbacks imposed on the activities of Bord Na Móna.  I do not know the reasons therefor.  But these small farmers, working as seasonal workers with Bord na Móna, because of the inclement <Col N="1362" /> weather in 1985 and the cutbacks imposed, were put under protective notice in 1985.  There is also the fact that the Ballyforan briquette factory at the northern end of the constituency would have a major effect on bog development in this area.  Therefore, the fact that there is no activity taking place there slows down activity in the locality, denuding the locality of the extra industrial activity that would create the few extra jobs which would help to sustain people on the land and families in their homes.</P>
    <P>The position in modern Ireland is that there is such high unemployment that we are rapidly moving towards a figure of 250,000 people out of work&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <P>I am honoured to share my constituency with the Minister of State present, also with Deputy Kitt and Senators Hussey and Burke.  I am appealing collectively, on behalf of all my political colleagues, to the Minister of State.  This is a major opportunity for him to reverse that <Col N="1363" /> exodus from the land, to create hopeful opportunities, stability in agriculture, so that at least one person from each small farm in that area can be guaranteed a future in agriculture if these lands are acquired before it is too late.  I appeal to the Minister to examine this matter in a positive, flexible manner, exercising his powers and duties on behalf of his constituents in this area of east Galway.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Connaughton) Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Connaughton)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Connaughton)</NameTxt>
      <P>There were many matters raised by Deputy N. Treacy I would love to debate with him on any public platform but because of the constraints on time imposed on me I can deal with only some here.  There are answers to many of his questions.  However, here I shall deal with the principle of the motion before the House about the Kenny estate at Lawrencetown.</P>
      <P>First, together with the other public representatives of the area I was at a wellattended meeting at the Lawrencetown Centre which included many of my friends.  The House can be assured that anything humanly possible that can be done will be and will have my undivided attention, as the people of Lawrencetown are fully aware.</P>
      <P>What is involved here, by Irish standards, is a very large farm that has come up for public auction.  I should like to put on the record of the House, as I have done so many times in the last two or three years here, that there has been a major change in the direction in which the Land Commission are going.  That did not commence in the last two or three years.  Lest anybody take a different view or perspective of the proceedings I should say that in the area about which we are speaking, that part of Lawrencetown, it is at least eight years since any other land was acquired by the Land Commission. Of course, this period spanned the terms of office of several Governments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As will be known, various Ministers for Agriculture over the years have proposed that the agricultural scene might be better served by a new land restructuring policy. In my view there is a better way of doing <Col N="1364" /> it.  Some of these proposals I brought to the floor of the House and I hope in the next few months to bring others.</P>
    <P>I explained in detail to, I suppose, 60 farmers in Lawrencetown one night last week that there were certain aids which I would put at their disposal.  I informed them that there would be certain parts of section 45 which we would look at very carefully in the interest of the purchaser whoever he or she might be.  I put before them the basis of the group purchase scheme which it was decided they would do their best to work with.  On that occasion I committed the entire services of the Land Commission to helping those small farmers.  I am glad to say that a meeting has been held between the local Land Commission officer and the farmers who are interested.  I believe also that a further meeting after the meeting of the politicians that night has shown that there is very genuine interest in that area on the part of at least 15 or 16 people who believe that they are in a position jointly to purchase a fairly substantial part of this land and that moves are afoot to use that combined strength of 15 or 16 people to act as a trading bloc to the degree that they will do the best they can to purchase that land.  I have committed the Land Commission inspector to give them every possible assistance.  Despite the fact that most people, naturally enough, would prefer to get land as cheaply as possible &mdash; we are all like that &mdash; when the facts were pointed out to them many of them believed genuinely that this was the best way forward.</P>
    <P>I have no way of knowing what is going to happen before, during or after the public auction.  I have almost finished because I do not want to get into a national debate on the issue and I assume that the Chair will not allow me to do so anyway.  On an occasion like this it is very important to keep reality in front of us. If in the old days of the Land Commission the Kenny estate was acquired totally by the Land Commission, many people because of their off-farm income and other aspects of their lifestyle, such as larger farms and so on, would not qualify.</P>
    <P>Let me bring Deputy Treacy back for <Col N="1365" /> a moment to the cottiers.  Never in my lifetime have I heard that the Land Commission ever acquired land through compulsory acquisition for the relief of congestion to give land to cottiers.  I know as many of the cottiers as anyone else in east Galway, and whatever scheme might be available, many of them have a deep interest in land and I would like to see more people of that nature getting land. However, I want to put it on the record of the House that our legislation was never so designed that persons who found themselves in that situation were, so to speak, the prime targets for land acquired by the Land Commission.  That has been said in this House a million times in 50 years.  Rightly or wrongly, that is the way successive Governments have had it and it is no different at present.  The last thing I would do would be to lead any of those smallholders astray.  I stood up in front of the whole lot of them in Lawrencetown the other night and told them so.  I did not want to give them a popular decision on the night when they would only have to learn afterwards that the law never was, is not and probably will not be in their favour in so far as acquisition of land for the relief of congestion is concerned. Every Deputy knows that.  The sooner everybody talks on those lines to those people the greater chance we will have of getting realism across.</P>
    <P>I hope sincerely that the efforts I am making with the local farmers will bring a degree of satisfaction.  I believe there are many in the area whose farming would benefit greatly, and their incomes therefore, if an additional piece of land was available for them.  I was struck by the sincerity and dedication with which the meeting treated the subject in hand last week.  All the moves that could be made have been made.  I am keeping in <Col N="1366" /> daily contact with that part of the country to make sure that everything that I can do from my position, and that the Land Commission can do from theirs, will be done.  The people there are aware of the deep interest I have and that everyone else has in it.  I hope that extra land will come into the possession of people who (a) want it and (b) are able to work it and have shown through their farming pattern over the years that they will use the land efficiently and to great effect, which is most important from a land use point of view.  Some people down there may be landless and because of the flexibility that we have introduced into the group purchase scheme they will, because they are involved in the group for the greater good, be able to acquire land under legislation that we have now.  They would have found it very difficult to acquire land under any circumstances previously.  I hope that when the dust settles on this problem the vast majority of people down there who want additional land will get it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Minister for Education (Mrs. Hussey) Gemma Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mrs. Hussey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The two schools in the Dublin 5 area referred to by the Deputy were built in stages between 1970 and 1974, and part of the cost was met by my Department by way of grant in the usual way.  In the case of one of the schools the authorities noticed in 1982 that plaster was coming away from the ceiling and feared that <Col N="1311" /> there was a danger of the roof slabs collapsing. Problems were also being encountered in relation to other features, mainly arising from the poor quality of the timber available in the early seventies. The window frames in particular were in very bad condition.  Professional advisers were engaged by the school authorities and in consulation with professional officers of the Board of Works proposed a scheme of remedial works which was accepted by my Department for grant purposes and authorisation was given to the school authorities to place a contract which they duly did.  The works have been carried out and grants paid.</P>
      <P>Approximately one-third of the cost of the work related to the treatment of the ribbed concrete roof slabs which had been formed in permanent woodwool insulation shuttering of a type which was an accepted form of construction used extensively at the time the school was designed.  Tests carried out to establish whether the roof was structurally sound included a deflection test which established that the roof slabs were sound but it was found that the concrete cover was faulty.  With the benefit of modern research it could be shown that the danger lay not in the possibility of structural failure in the normal course but in the possibility that the slabs would collapse prematurely in the event of a fire.  It was decided that this condition should be rectified and that the work qualified for grant payment under the Department's scheme of improvements.</P>
      <P>Other works carried out as part of the contract included the installation of replacement aluminium windows, and the treatment of flat roofs.  During the course of investigations referred to, the Department's attention was drawn to, the emergence of similar problems in another school in the same district which had been built around the same time as the first school under investigation.  A scheme of remedial works has also been agreed in this case with the school authorities, and a grant has been sanctioned.  The works have been carried out by the school authorities and grant applied for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1312" /> While my Department are concerned that relatively extensive works have had to be undertaken in these two schools built in the early seventies, I am satisfied that the problems which developed were not caused by neglect to maintain the premises on the part of the school authorities, and that the particular feature which gave rise to the fears concerning the safety of the building was an accepted form of construction at the relevent time, and was in the course of the investigation found to have adequate structural strength.</P>

However, because, <i>inter alia,</i> of indications that method B is likely to result in savings in future years, Ireland is adopting that method as from 1986.</P>

      <P>Entitlement to unemployment assistance is dependent on an applicant being the holder of a qualification certificate and to obtain a qualification certificate an applicant must satisfy certain conditions, including an assessment of means.  The person concerned applied for unemployment assistance on 30 September 1985 and his case was referred to the social welfare officer for investigation of means.  The social welfare officer called on five occasions to his house but the person concerned was not available for interview and, accordingly, the investigation of means could not be undertaken.

At present, because of security restrictions in force since the unsuccessful escape attempt by Provisional IRA prisoners on 24 November the number of open visits which can be accommodated on any one day has been reduced from eight to six. Arrangements are in hand to provide additional facilities which will again allow eight visits to take place each day.  When these additional facilities are in place the situation regarding co-operation between the prisoners will be looked at again.
