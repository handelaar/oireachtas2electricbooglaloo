    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">

      <P>I had only just begun to speak when the debate on this Bill was adjourned.  I indicated that it is not simply a question of a lack of education or a lack of opportunities which creates poverty.  Fundamentally it is the absence of an adequate income for those who are caught in the poverty trap.  Our society allows extremes of wealth and extremes of poverty to exist side by side. The scale of poverty in our society is now such that it is openly admitted that one in three of our population is either on or below the poverty line.  That is at a time when we read newspaper headlines which indicate that there was a boom year for shares.  In the <i>Irish Independent</i> of 30 December 1985, Mr. Cyril Hardiman of the financial staff said:</P>
      <P>Shareholders in Irish companies have every reason to look back on 1985 with joy and hope for more of the same in 1986.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1171" /> For share prices rose by an average of 40 per cent over the past year &mdash; adding a massive £700 million to the value of their investments.</P>
    <P>And, just for good measure, Ireland's Top Fifty quoted companies between them increased their dividend payments to their shareholders by £10 million.</P>
    <P>By year's end, Allied Irish Banks has firmly regained its position as Ireland's biggest publicly-quoted company. Commanding a Stock Market capitalisation &mdash; the present value of all its shares &mdash; of £386 million, it has opened up a lead of some £33 million over arch rival, the Bank of Ireland in second place.</P>
    <P>Just three months ago, however, the placings were reversed, with AIB still very much under the cloud of last March's Insurance Corporation collapse. But once the Government cleared the air about the ICI's refinancing, investors piled back into AIB shares.</P>
    <P>Falling interest rates reduced inflation and &mdash; above all else &mdash; invigorating profitability all contributed to the rise in share prices during the year.</P>
    <P>We also know that in 1985 we had the highest unemployment figures ever.  We know that the poor had possibly one of the hardest years to survive in 1985. There is clearly a poverty problem and an imbalance in the distribution of wealth and poverty.  Parties in this House apply themselves to that problem in different ways.</P>
    <P>The main parties, Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, have an approach to poverty which leaves the present social relationships completely untouched.  They will argue, as did the Minister for Finance on the radio this morning, that private enterprise should do what they are expected to do by the Government and take up incentives to take on workers.  What the Minister for Finance said is fundamental to the thinking of Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil in tackling poverty.  They believe that one has only to encourage private enterprise to be enterprising to eliminate <Col N="1172" /> poverty and create jobs.  What has occurred since the foundation of the State indicates that private enterprise, particularly Irish capitalism, has not the capacity to eliminate poverty here despite all the protection they received in the thirties and forties and all the urgings they received in the fifties and sixties and despite the various reports on improving their efficiency and their capacity to compete. Despite all the urgings and incentives by way of grants and assistance which were increased yesterday by the Minister for Finance, more and more people are entering the poverty trap.</P>
    <P>I cannot say much for the views of the Progressive Democrats because they have not yet produced policy documents but I would argue that the Labour Party, on the basis of their policy documents, would agree with me that a fundamental change is required not only as to the question of whether or not poverty can be cured by providing incentives to private enterprise but that we need a fundamental change in our approach to the questions of private property and the virtually unlimited rights of private property in our society.  We need to have a fundamental change in our approach to how jobs are created.  The Labour Party in the past would have argued that there must be a comprehensive involvement by the State in the development of our resources not simply by providing incentives, although that cannot be ruled out for progressive companies, but by the State becoming directly involved in developing resources, providing jobs and in increasing GNP so that people who are at present unemployed can be employed and that that would have the effect of significantly reducing unemployment.</P>
    <P>Despite all the arguments about how to define poverty the fundamental definition is that a poor person has not enough on which to live and I am not talking about just existing.  Many people are living quiet lives of desperation.  They have barely enough to eat and from time to time to buy a coat or a pair of shoes but the quality of their lives is such that they are poor.  Other aspects arise from the inadequacy of income.  People born into <Col N="1173" /> poverty find it very difficult to get out of that trap.  Because of generations of poverty people end up in ghettos and they are traditionally discriminated against in terms of the education they can get.  Yesterday I raised a question with the Minister for Education about teacher-pupil ratios and the Minister said that our pupil-teacher ratio had been reduced from 27.5 pupils per teacher to 27.1 pupils per teacher.  That, to the Minister, seemed a very big improvement. The Minister also said that to bring the pupil-teacher ratio to the level of that existing in Northern Ireland, which is by no means an exemplary one, we would need to employ 3,000 extra national primary school teachers.  At the same time the Government have announced a reduction in the training capacity for teachers.  The teacher-pupil ratios are applied to all schools irrespective of the needs.  The areas which most need extra teachers are the areas which by and large are losing teachers.  In a school in my area teachers who have dedicated ten years of their lives to assisting some of the most deprived of our young children are being placed on a panel because numbers have fallen in the schools, and may in the next year be transferred to another area, to another school, resulting, as it has already in the school I am speaking about, in a number of classes being doubled up.</P>
    <P>We cannot talk seriously about tackling poverty through this agency if we do not also talk about the question and what resources are provided in this area for the most disadvantaged in our society.  It is pointless to talk about setting up a poverty agency while Government policy is directed towards creating greater disadvantage in those areas which are already suffering the most.  We are perpetuating educational poverty by pursuing the policies which the Government have enunciated in their national plan in relation to education.  I am talking about the cutbacks in the public service, the reduction in teacher training and that whole area.  We cannot accept that they are serious about tackling the problem of poverty.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1174" /> It is admitted openly that one in three of the population are now living below the poverty line.  This affects the family quite seriously, and obviously it affects children, young adults, people who are sick and people on pensions.  Poverty eats like a cancer into every aspect of the lives of those affected by it.  In relation to the family it means that parents lose the ability to control their lives or the lives of their children.  It means the loss of ability to decide not only where they might live but what they may eat, what they may wear, what schools the children may go to and for how long they may go to school.  Statistics show clearly that once in the povery trap very few manage to get out of it.</P>
    <P>According to an ESRI report published in July 1984, 75 per cent of those in higher professional and managerial employment came from just four of the upper ABC social classes.  In England and Wales the comparative figure was 47 per cent.  In 1980-81, 10 per cent of male post primary school leavers left without any qualification but only half of 1 per cent of upper social class male students were in the same category.  More than 17 per cent of students from unskilled and semi skilled families left school without any qualification whatsoever.  Unemployment data from 1982 showed that of unemployed people between the ages of 15 and 24 years only 4.7 per cent came from the higher professional and managerial classes while 52 per cent were from semi skilled and unskilled backgrounds.</P>
    <P>In my area, Finglas and Ballymun, over 50 per cent in some cases of people between the ages of 15 and 25 years are unemployed.  At the same time in an area like Castleknock the level of unemployment is 4.7 per cent.  In the Tallaght area The Workers' Party carried out a survey of an estate and found a 54 per cent unemployment level there, not in the whole of Tallaght but in an estate there. To conclude on the statistics I have referred to, only 1 per cent of people from the postal areas of Dublin 1 and 10 go on to higher education.  In Dublin 11, which includes my constituency, the figure is 7 per cent, but in Dublin 14 it is <Col N="1175" /> 30 per cent and in Dublin 24 it is 44 per cent.  In UCD only 0.57 per cent of the students come from unskilled manual backgrounds.</P>
    <P>Clearly society here discriminates against the poor, not deliberately in the sense that someone decides that these people are not going to get education or jobs, but inherently the structures of our society discriminate against those who are poorest and favour those who are best off in terms of income and wealth and who are best educated.</P>
    <P>I do not deny the great efforts which the staff of AnCO put into training those who come to them but in most cases those people who do six week, six month or 12 month courses are being trained for nonexistent jobs.  People caught in poverty face many frustrations.  Not only are they being denied employment or serious training for real and useful employment, but also they are usually forced to exist on pocketmoney from parents when those parents can afford it, or at best very minimal unemployment assistance support. Of course, you do not qualify for unemployment assistance support until you are 18 years of age.  If you leave school when you are 15 or 16 years you are not entitled to any support from the State.  You cannot sign on or get unemployment assistance.  Even when you reach 18 years of age the unemployment assistance you get, if you remain at home living with your parents, is means tested, in some cases out of existence.</P>
    <P>Recently I put down a series of questions in relation to unemployment assistance to try to figure out exactly how the means test works and how it could be improved so that those who are living at home at 18 years of age and over can get some kind of half decent, dignified income.  Fundamentally when you look at it you realise that the only way it can be done is for the State to decide that every person is entitled to a basic income. I have not got the new Social Welfare Bill here but, as far as I can recall, the figure for unemployment assistance when the increases are applied&mdash;which will not be until the middle of July&mdash;is £36 for a <Col N="1176" /> single person, assuming that the person lives in an urban area and is entitled to the full amount.  Does anyone argue seriously in this House that any one of us here could survive on £36 per week even living at home with parents?  Certainly I could not.  If I were living in a flat and trying to survive on £36 per week quite a number of things would not be paid for and it would be quite an incentive for me to become disenchanted with or alienated from the political process that exists and persists in maintaining me in that miserly fashion.</P>
    <P>That unemployment assistance does not apply just to young people.  It applies to any single person, irrespective of age, once that person lives at home and one of his or her parents is working and earning an income.  I have come across a case where a man of 50 years of age is getting £12 a week unemployment assistance because he is living at home.  That must surely be totally unacceptable to anyone with any concern for the ordinary, decent dignity of a human being.  This Poverty Agency Bill will not tackle that kind of problem.  The only people who can tackle it are the legislators in this House.</P>
    <P>The young people in particular are denied the opportunity of being trained for real jobs.  Poverty therefore is preventing young people from developing skills, enjoying the full flavour of life and settling down in a good environment. Those on social welfare payments cannot in themselves combat poverty.  Indeed, most people who are in receipt of these payments would rather be working and working in a well paid job.  Those on social welfare in the main are unpleasant by-products of the existing conditions in our society.  Those in our society who are poorest are to an extraordinary degree also those who have least privacy.  If you are a local authority tenant there is not a single aspect of your life which is not investigated by rent inspectors.  If you are on unemployment assistance, or an unmarried mother, or a deserted wife, there is not a single aspect of your life which is private to you, which is not open <Col N="1177" /> to investigation by social welfare field officers.</P>
    <P>Contrast that with the arguments made in relation to tax dodgers and in relation to those who make a livelihood out of avoiding tax.  We are told that we must not infringe the privacy of these people, that the question of what they earn or do not earn is a matter for themselves, that it would be improper to divulge in any way the names of tax dodgers.  At the same time, hundreds of thousands who are dependent on social welfare, living in local authority housing, the poorest in our society in effect, are subjected daily to an invasion of their privacy.</P>
    <P>Not only that, but the practice has grown up in the Dublin Corporation area that rent inspectors will no longer accept your word when you state your income or even a social welfare form which states what that income is.  Inspectors will be sent out around your area who will make inquiries of neighbours and watch your house to see whether you have a car and if anybody goes into or out of your house, to see if they stay overnight.  If any inspector is told or believes that you have not divulged your full income, he is not obliged to give the information on which he bases that belief.  He simply applies the maximum rent for your accommodation. Then you will have to prove that the inspector is wrong.  This, of course, in many cases is quite impossible as the inspectors refuse to divulge the basis on which their decisions were made in the first place.  I believe that what is happening in Dublin Corporation in this regard is illegal.  I am at present looking to see if I can locate a suitable case so that it may be tested in the courts.  It is my belief that many, not all, of the corporation tenants are being abused, frightened and intimidated into paying rents which they are not legally obliged to pay.</P>
    <P>These are all aspects of the lives of people who are basically living in poverty.  If they were not poor, they would not have to put up with that kind of treatment.  They would not have to put up with the indignity of having to appear before officials and plead for an explanation as to why their rent has been <Col N="1178" /> increased from £12 to £20 a week, or to plead with them for an explanation as to why they got a bill last week showing that they owed £20 and this week a bill showing that they owed £700.  If you are not poor, you do not have to put up with that kind of thing.  The indignities heaped on the poor in our society is one of the main reasons for an increasing decline in respect for politics, for politicians and for this House.  People no longer see politicians or this House as being relevant or able to do anything for them.  They may at times in a crisis run to their local TD or councillor when threatened with eviction and may feel that the councillor or TD has some power to stop that.  Otherwise they do not see politicians as having the power, or even the willingness, to change society and its operation in order to provide them and their children with a better life.</P>
    <P>When I talk about present conditions I mean the present relationship between capital and labour in our society.  That is not the kind of social relationship that I want to see because the present society is based on greed, on the ability of one person to exploit another.  If you cannot exploit your neighbour successfully you cannot make a profit.  It has always struck me as odd that in a society which prides itself on being Christian &mdash; and, indeed, there are those who pride themselves on this being a Roman Catholic society &mdash; that this exultation of greed, capitalism and the ability to exploit another sits so easily side by side with the belief that we have a Christian, a Roman Catholic society.  As far as I am concerned the two are totally contradictory.  If we really understood what Christianity was about, we would not tolerate the conditions in which the poor have to live, the exploitation which takes place of the poor and the working class.</P>
    <P>Doles, no matter what you call them, are demeaning and not desired by the poor or the working class in this society. What they want is the right to work in a well paid job.  The present economic crisis has divided those who have to work for a living and who if unemployed would have to collect the dole, from those who <Col N="1179" /> are employed.  When employment is lost there is a dismal slide into poverty.  The first months without a job are often cushioned by redundancy payments and pay-related benefits, but, even in those circumstances, in the budget this year we have again reduced pay-related benefits. Where a man or woman having worked many years in a particular job gets redundancy payments for the loss of earnings for the following ten or 20 years, once the unemployment and pay-related benefits run out, that redundancy payment is means tested and the person's income falls again.  If the condition of unemployment remains over a period, the redundancy payment and pay-related benefits only delay the onset of the full rigours of poverty.  People on unemployment benefit receive only a pittance grudgingly handed over after every possible deduction has been made from it.</P>
    <P>This is the policy of the present Government, and it is the policy traditionally followed by all Governments on this island.  It is a policy which forces an ever increasing section of the population to live without dignity and without reasonable comfort.  It is beyond question that many of our young people are rejecting the present social order which for them means one law for the rich and one law for the poor.  They are rejecting the establishment/media attitude which calls for increased penalties for vandals while, at the same time, praising the immoral standards, practices, ambitions and values of a vulgar elitist society.</P>
    <P>One aspect of poverty which applies more to women than it does to men is in the growth of part time work.  In areas where this category of worker has been traditionally employed, they find their hours cut and they are being forced to do more work in fewer hours.  Women are employed for fewer than 18 hours a week and thereby do not come under the normal protection which the existing labour law applies if a person works more than 18 hours a week.  It also reduces their entitlements to social welfare and therefore reduces their protection if they become unemployed, are dismissed or <Col N="1180" /> are made redundant for whatever reason. There are considerable structures in our society which not only prevent people from getting out of the poverty trap but more and more demean them and ensure that they drift further away from what one might term normal society.</P>
    <P>I am particularly concerned about a concerted campaign by some sections of the media and by a number of public representatives who are exaggerating to an extraordinary extent the nature and extent of social welfare abuse.  It is an indisputable fact that abuse does take place.  The Department of Social Welfare have estimated that this abuse costs about £2.4 million but we have public representatives and the media screaming from the rooftops that their is abuse to the tune of £25 million.  They immediately link that with paying £60 million to deserted wives and unmarried mothers.  In my view not only is that totally untrue but it is creating fears among those who are receiving social welfare.</P>
    <P>Last Friday evening I got a phone call from a man in a south Dublin suburb who was concerned about the fact that he was living in a rural area as defined by the administrative local authority boundaries in Dublin.  As a result of that, he was on a lower level of unemployment assistance and he was not entitled to a fuel voucher. That is not extraordinary because there are hundreds of thousands of people in that position, but what was extraordinary was that this elderly man was afraid to give me his name and address.  He said he had been reading in the <i>Irish Independent</i> about these social welfare spongers and he was afraid that, if he gave me his name and address, in some way it would get to the local labour exchange and his unemployment assistance would be cut off, not because he was not entitled to it.  He had got the impression from the media that there was a campaign against people on social welfare.  Not only are we expecting these people to live on a pittance, but some of our public representatives are driving them to fear that they may even lose the few shillings they get each week.</P>
    <P>I do not want to be read as defending social welfare abuse because I am not but <Col N="1181" /> I am trying to defend the right of those who, through no fault of their own, are unemployed, sick, disabled or have reached old age.  They have a right to support from the rest of us who live in some kind of dignity and they should not have to live in fear, and certainly not as a result of headlines created to some extent by public representatives in this House.</P>
    <P>The issue has been raised by these public representatives concerning deserted wives and unmarried mothers, and they have quoted £60 million as being paid to these women.  They have gone even further and claimed that in many of these cases, if not most, the deserted wives are not living as separated wives and that unmarried mothers deliberately become pregnant in order to collect the unmarried mother's allowance.  It seems extraordinary that on the one hand we have the same people arguing day in and day out that we must not have divorce because we must protect the family, that we must do everything we can to stop the trail of women to Britain to have abortions, and on the other hand, arguing that we should not be supporting deserted wives with children.  A deserted wife under 40 years of age without children will not get a deserted wife's allowance.</P>
    <P>If one is an unmarried mother, unless one is looking after one's child, one does not receive an unmarried mother's allowance. One cannot parade as a person who is trying to protect the family and children while, at the same time, attacking the support which taxpayers &mdash; by and large the PAYE sector &mdash; have chosen to give to the children of deserted wives and of unmarried mothers.  That is a totally contradictory position.  It is also totally contradictory to the Christian ethics about which this country so proudly boasts day after day, year in year out. One gets sick of it sometimes.</P>
    <P>I wrote to the Department of Social Welfare for some statistics in relation to deserted wife's and unmarried mother's allowance over the past five years.  In 1985 I ascertained there were 5,165 women in receipt of deserted wife's allowance.  They had 9,472 dependent <Col N="1182" /> children.  In addition there were 3,965 deserted wives on deserted wife's allowance who had 6,240 dependent children, that is, a total of over 9,000 deserted wives with 16,000 dependent children.  If those who criticise the deserted wife's allowance decide that it should be withdrawn, what then do we say about the support of the family and the care of children?</P>
    <P>The other aspect is the unmarried mother's allowance and this idea that young women parade the streets looking for suitable begetters of their children. Were it not so serious it would be worth smiling at.  If it was not creating the fear that it does, we could laugh at it.  I might give some statistics with regard to unmarried mothers.  I sought figures going back to the year 1981.  For example, in 1981 the number of applicants for unmarried mother's allowance was 2,413 &mdash; 86 of those were withdrawn, 2,000 were awarded and 372 rejected.  In that year, of those already in receipt of unmarried mother's allowance, 1,117 allowances were terminated mainly because the young women concerned had got married. For each year that was the picture.</P>
    <P>Up to 1985 the number of applicants was 3,352, the number withdrawn 73, the number awarded 2,800, the number rejected as being ineligible 349 and the number terminated in respect of those no longer eligible was 1,632.  The total number in receipt of unmarried mother's allowance was 11,530, an increase of 1,500 over the previous year even though 3,300 had applied during that year.</P>

      <P>A discussion on unmarried mothers is quite in order in so far as it is related to their state of poverty. But there could be many other aspects of unmarried motherhood which would not be in order on this Bill.</P>

      <P>I apreciate that.  I shall do my best to confine my remarks to this aspect of poverty.  I am endeavouring to highlight the laudable aspirations of people to deal with poverty.  While pointing out that it is fine to have an <Col N="1183" /> aspiration to deal with poverty in a general sense it is nonsense if, at the same time, one endeavours to undermine the supports we give to those least well off in our society through media speculation, headlines or statements, by exaggerating the degree of abuse of social welfare or, as seems to be the case in relation to unmarried mothers and deserted wives, by questioning the rationale of supporting them at all.  I am arguing that we can pass this Bill but if, at the same time, we pursue a policy of reducing benefits to those least able to support themselves, then we are wasting our time.  I appreciate that I am going on at length on this subject but it is an issue about which I am particularly concerned.  Indeed, it is one with which I am faced continuously and with which I am sure many other Deputies are also faced in their constituencies.</P>
      <P>Perhaps I should now deal specifically with what the provisions of this Bill should or should not do.  There is one further point I wanted to make in relation to the general question of poverty and the attitude of the State to it.  In December last the Government introduced a Supplementary Social Welfare Estimate. On that occasion I had five minutes only to contribute to the debate.  That Supplementary Estimate particularly incensed me because, in his introductory remarks, the Minister indicated that the Government had managed to effect a saving of £3.4 million in the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That annoyed me for two reasons.  I have telephone calls daily from people denied assistance under the provisions of that scheme, assistance in respect of the payment of rent, ESB, clothing, by and large people who do not want to go near a health board clinic claiming supplementary welfare allowance because, unless one is used to it, one is not prepared to put up with the indignity of it.  At a time when unemployment was at its highest level ever the Government managed to save £3.4 million.  At the same time the <Col N="1184" /> Society of St. Vincent de Paul, an organisation who genuinely pursue their Christian principles, last year had to make a special appeal because their funds were running out on account of the demands being made on their resources.  Yet the Government were able to announce in December that they had effected a saving of £3.4 million on the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.  That does not add up to being serious about dealing with poverty on a day to day basis.  Within days it was announced that the traditional Christmas double payment to certain categories of social welfare recipients would be extended, which would cost an additional £400,000.  In 1984 the cost of it was £20 million while in 1985 it was £20.4 million.  It was announced with a great fanfare that it was being extended to other categories of social welfare recipients and it was said that in order to do that the double payment would have to be reduced to 75 per cent and not 100 per cent.  The reality is that in real terms the Government actually saved money on that scheme, the 1984 £20 million should have been £21 million in 1985 but, in fact, by paying out £20.4 million in that year the Government saved £0.6 million.  That indicates an attitude towards those who are worst off in our society that smacks of the idea that once the headline in a newspaper proclaims that something is being done it will cure the problem.  We are all aware that newspaper headlines do not cure problems.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask a question in relation to equality for women.  Last year we passed a Bill in regard to this and £20 million was included in last year's budget to implement the terms of that legislation but where is that money now?  It has not been seen or heard of since.  We are all aware that fuel allowances for most old people represent the difference between life and death.  We know that hypothermia is a killer for old people but the fuel allowance of £5 per week was not increased this year.  Given the difficulty that old people have in carrying weights it is more than likely that they buy prepacked coal, in 1 st. or 2 st. lots or, if they have a trolley, they buy 4 st. bags. <Col N="1185" /> The sum of £5 would just about buy that amount of coal but how long will it last? Will it last two or three days?  Certainly, it will not last one week.  It may last that long if those people daily spend eight or ten hours in bed in order to keep warm. That miserly, niggardly attitude towards the old and to fuel allowances is not an indication to me that the Government are serious about tackling the problem of and the effects of poverty which the Bill sets out to deal with.</P>
    <P>In effect, the poor are being mugged by the Government in order to try to support the poorest.  They are taking from Peter to pay Paul while at the same time they are doing virtually nothing, except public relations exercises, about tax dodgers, about people who owe in excess of £700 million in unpaid taxes. That is the figure that the Government estimate is owed in unpaid taxes but all we hear in regard to it are announcements that the Government are going to do this and that.  Virtually nothing is being done and the vacancies in the Revenue Commissioners remain unfilled.</P>
    <P>The problem of poverty requires a fundamental reappraisal of how we organise our society.  It is no longer acceptable to the poor and the working classes.  The poor and the working classes are not always the same; there are some quite well off people among the working classes but the working classes who are employed are paying for the poor, not the entrepreneurs or the multinationals. More and more there will be demands that the Government, and future Governments, should attack the fundamental issues which create poverty in our society.  While fundamentally it is a question of income there are related issues such as education.  Basically it is a question of whether one has or has not got enough money to live a life of reasonable comfort.  The only way one can ensure a life of reasonable comfort and a reasonable income is to insist on the country utilising all its resources to create additional wealth.  We must ensure that the additional wealth created is used to provide the social services, the education and the hospital care that is needed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1186" /> Time and again it has been proved that the approach of private enterprise has failed.  It failed in the twenties, the thirties, the forties and the fifties.  It got a bit of a boost in the sixties with foreign capital but in those years there were marches in Dublin by the homeless.  They occurred at a time of boom, when our society was supposed to be booming with Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael claiming that a rising tide would raise all boats.  Unfortunately, a rising tide has a habit of drowning the poor, not of raising them. Private enterprise started to fail again in the seventies.</P>
    <P>I should like to make a number of points about the Bill.  In view of what I have said so far in the debate it is essential that the agency established under the legislation is independent not only of political hacks but of a preponderance of civil servants.  In my view it should come under the aegis of the Department of the Taoiseach, or be responsible to that Department, in the sense that it should have submissions and so on going to that Department.  I would argue that it is important to have direct access to Government through the Taoiseach's Department.  In the Department of Social Welfare poverty is treated purely as a social welfare problem and we all know it is not simply a social welfare problem. Poverty can also be created by our taxation system.</P>
    <P>One thing I have noticed is that the Bill does not contain a definition of poverty.  I presume it will depend on the EC definition, one I regard as being far too narrow. One of the groups established under the previous poverty agency described poverty as something that results from inequality in society and suggested that structural changes were needed to eradicate it.  That definition was formulated by people who were dealing with poverty and trying to cope with it on a daily basis. The question of the definition of poverty may seem academic to some Members but if we define poverty we define also how we are going to approach the problem.  If we think of poverty simply as poor housing then, obviously, we will <Col N="1187" /> attempt to deal with it by some improvement in housing standards, but if we define it as the result of inequality in society and go on to say that structural changes are needed to eradicate it we need a different approach to cope with it.  There may be need for some Ministers, public representatives and Departments to think deeply about what that means. Perhaps we should discuss what kind of structural changes are necessary and why there is inequality.  The Workers' Party and the Labour Party agree on the causes of inequality.  Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael also see the causes of inequality but I do not think they would agree with each other in that regard.  I was surprised to hear Deputy Prendergast say that his party were established for the poor.  If that is a common belief within the Labour Party perhaps that is the reason they have failed to become a Government party in their own right.</P>
    <P>If the agency are to be effective they should have direct access to information on any area of Government policy and the right to make representations on the likely implications of departmental actions or on EC Directives.  Without that right and access they will be simply another agency operating on the periphery of Government structures without any influence or say.</P>
    <P>The agency should be representative of groupings and social forces who have a direct involvement in combating poverty. For instance, there should be representations from the various professional agencies who deal with poverty such as tenants' and community organisations and a wide range of other voluntary and statutory agencies which are directly in touch with the problem.  The agency should also have a specific role in research and they should be involved with people who experience problems related to poverty.</P>
    <P>The question of how long the agency should continue is important.  I have been advised by people who have been involved in various projects that a period of less than six years is not much use.  I hope that a specific period will be incorporated <Col N="1188" /> in the Bill.  The Bill states that the Combat Poverty Agency will be linked to various State agencies and in that regard it is important that projects carried out by the agency should be innovative and not subservient to the agencies with which they are linked.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to say what budget will be allocated to the agency and for how long.  Will they have to plead each year for their budget or will they be given a specific amount of money for the period of their existence?  It would be totally unacceptable if the agency were subject to cuts of various kinds during the course of their existence.</P>
    <P>The agency should have the right to speak out.  Recently the Government funded Arts Council had the front cover of their report changed by diktat from the Department of the Taoiseach, presumably by the Taoiseach, on the basis of replies he gave in the House, because it was critical of the Government.  If this agency are to have any effect, part of their main function must be to be critical of the Government and if they last into the lifetime of another Government, of whatever complexion, they should continue to have the right to be critical of the Government's actions and to be able to voice those criticisms publicly.  Otherwise, there will be no confidence in the agency's ability to tackle the problems within their terms of reference.</P>
    <P>I have discussed this issue at length and I am sorry for delaying other speakers. However, this matter is fundamental to the existence of The Workers' Party and the Labour Party because it concerns almost one million people in this State. There are huge problems of poverty in Northern Ireland also which have not been touched on and for which this House is not directly responsible.  Poverty will not be solved by this agency.  It can only be solved ultimately by a restructuring of society and I intend to work politically through the democratic process towards that end.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamSkelly" hpid="Mr. Skelly Mr. Skelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy De Rossa need not apologise for delaying me because his contribution was worthwhile and I agree <Col N="1189" /> with a lot of it.  I hope, in a short contribution, to elaborate on this matter.  I am intrigued by the name of the Bill.  I am wondering whether the use of the word &ldquo;combat&rdquo; rather than, say, the word &ldquo;eliminate&rdquo; is an indication of a lack of confidence in what we are trying to do. Is it that those of us who have had anything to do with this Bill are frightened by the subject involved?  Perhaps we do not understand what is involved.  I would be more inclined to think that the latter is the case, judging from some of the references in the Minister's speech.  The tendency is to say that we should proceed quickly with the legislation but I approach it with a certain trepidation. This is legislation that needs thorough examination if we are to understand what we are doing and if those who will be entrusted with the task of operating the agency will know what they are doing. What we are talking about in this context is a redistribution of wealth among the poor.  We are talking of taking from the have-nots to give to the have-nots whereas we should be talking about taking from the haves to give to the have-nots.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we talk of the poor we should not adopt a patronising attitude.  We satisfy our consciences by making charitable contributions or, in the case of Government, by providing for another ½ or 1 per cent to those in receipt of social welfare payments.  The increase is always in proportion to what the rest of the population are earning and it is always in single figures but I do not know whether we have the will to bring equality into society or to eliminate poverty.  Perhaps it is this lack of will that has led to the cautionary type of Bill that has been produced.  I make no apology for harking back to the claim that is made so often about our being a Christian society.  We have a poor grasp of the difficulties that one-third of our population are experiencing.  The gap continues to widen.  It would behove us to eliminate usage of the word &ldquo;Christian&rdquo; from our vocabulary for at least a decade. I say this because daily we continue to hide behind that word in every aspect of life.  I include the Government in this too. <Col N="1190" /> Anytime we talk about such problems as divorce or the North we hide behind the Christian tag.  We say that we are a caring and Christian society while in one part of this country people have been killing each other for the past 15 years.</P>
    <P>There is a tendency to blame the poor for their plight.  We operate a filter system and this ensures that the disadvantaged, for want of another word, always finish up at the bottom of the heap, regardless of whether we are talking about jobs or any other area.  We say we want only the best.  That same old filter system is rotten from the bottom to the top.  The points system applies in respect of entrance to third level education while the background environment system is applied in the matter of jobs.  All the time the individual is blamed for his circumstances. The cycle is continued and whole families, because they happen to be born into poverty, are condemned to lives of poverty.  Our system almost ensures the recycling of the wealth among the few.  It ensures that the professions will continue and that whole sections of population will never be given a chance.  In the Dublin 10 or Ballyfermot area there are 50,000 to 60,000 people and only 1 per cent of those get a crack at third level education, yet up to 18 per cent of those people make up the population of St. Patrick's Detention Centre and Mountjoy.  In another part of my constituency 4 per cent of the population get a crack at third level education and the people from that area form up to 28 per cent of the population of St. Patrick's and Mountjoy.</P>
    <P>I came from those areas.  I was one of a family of nine.  Only the last two of us received a third level education.  The chances for the 60,000 people of Ballyfermot to break out of the mould are very slim yet we continue with this charade that we have made greater advances than any other country in Europe in terms of keeping social welfare recipients at above inflation levels.  That will not change the structure of our society.  Some people understand the problem.  Among these are Deputy De Rossa, Senator Michael Higgins and Senator Brendan Ryan.  A lot of courage and sacrifice are required <Col N="1191" /> to speak out about the system.  There are many, including people elected to this Asembly who are not prepared to make that sacrifice.  Many of those representatives exploit people for their votes in the same way as the poor are exploited.  Getting their votes is tantamount to getting their money because if one tries to help them by way of the democratic system they are so grateful that they give the candidate their number one vote at elections. Any Member of this House who has not tried to restructure the system while here and to represent honestly the votes he carries while here should not put himself forward for re-election.</P>
    <P>We spent a year here debating the Criminal Justice Act during which time we were endeavouring to ensure that there would be justice for the innocent in our society but it grieves me to hear people of ministerial rank as well as others refer to members of our population &mdash; mostly people from the poor and disadvantaged areas &mdash; as thugs.  There are some who talk about sweeping them off the streets and putting them into prison or of using the whip on them.  We must remember that we are talking of innocent children who were born into poverty but who on reaching the age of 15 or so are referred to as the thugs of society.  We can just sweep them aside, trample on them and laugh at them because they are carrying these disadvantages of unequal opportunity.  They are uneducated, speak in a certain way and happen to come from certain parts of the city which frighten people who do not understand those areas.</P>
    <P>I know that in the past ten years there have been attempts to set up a poverty agency.  Deputy Mary Flaherty was given the job of setting up a poverty programme in 1981 but I do not know what is on the record of this House about it.  From my own life and upbringing I know the kind of patronage that has been dispensed, the kind of opportunities that were available and I know what it is like to have gone on to the other side of the tracks and to be a legislator looking out. <Col N="1192" /> I know the chances of changing things for people who are still disadvantaged.  The gap is widening further and I do not hold out much confidence or hope for making the necessary changes.</P>
    <P>There comes a time when people have to demand their entitlements.  The unemployed and the PAYE workers do it and the poor will have to do it too.  It is a long, slow educative process but those of us who care will have to teach these people how to demand their rights.  I would like to see 50,000 people, or as many as possible, marching on this House and showing people here what it is really like to be part of a system in which they do not have a say, from which they do not benefit to any great extent and which they can do nothing to change.  The only possibility of achieving change will come when they stand up for themselves.  They stay in their ghettos and survive somehow, eking out some form of existence. They do not really enjoy the benefits of equal opportunity in education and their just desserts in this society.</P>
    <P>It amazes me how so many people in the middle and upper middle-class can live within stone throwing distance of rundown areas and drive daily to work through those areas, yet close their eyes to everything they see and not become involved.  Everybody in society has an obligation to contribute and those who are fortunate enough to have been born into families where they received a decent education and are comfortably off have an obligation to give something back to society.</P>
    <P>There is a great difference between being poor in a rural area and being poor in an urban or inner city area.  A poor person in the country can live in a humble cottage and retain his dignity but it is not possible to do that in a city ghetto or slum because a person's dignity is removed. The humiliation of the urban poor and unemployed is great.  The chance of getting away from this situation is so small that it is fair to say that it is impossible. The only way to tackle the problem is by restructuring our society, eliminating these areas and cleaning out the slums, so that we have mixed housing all over <Col N="1193" /> our cities.  In the past two years or so the Government have made a successful start by giving grants to people to leave local authority houses.  We must enable people to live wherever they wish without herding them into certain estates loaded with too many problems which cannot be overcome, where some 500 neighbours will have more or less the same problems.  We do not seem to learn from our mistakes but continue to make them.  Patronage and handouts will not solve the problem.</P>
    <P>I am amused to recall a visit by the then Taoiseach, Mr. Jack Lynch, to the country during the 1977 election campaign or perhaps earlier.  The rural unemployed were complaining that they did not get time to go into town to collect their dole and they petitioned him to have it posted to them, to which he agreed. The handout mentality does not help and we are not pleasing those people who are the recipients of social welfare benefits with the pittances we have to give to them.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate and very wrong that these people have been pilloried in recent weeks by irresponsible, unfounded, totally unresearched and untrue statements about the rip-offs which are supposed to be taking place.  One may talk about a few bad apples in every barrel, but the majority of social welfare recipients deserve what they receive.  Some people seem to think that unmarried mothers or deserted wives with four or five children are having a wonderful time on £70 or £90 per week, that it is great to be unemployed and to get handouts from social welfare.  Those who hold this point of view do not consider the predicament of these people and the psychological pressures on them, as well as the awful misery they are going through.</P>
    <P>There are very few advantages for people who are dependent on social welfare payments.  Almost all the facilities available to them are rundown.  Even the labour exchanges are filthy and they have to experience the humiliation of disclosing the most confidential details, begging and pleading for their entitlements.  They are then sent shunting around a city which is difficult to traverse even at the best of <Col N="1194" /> times.  They have to drag children with them on the buses &mdash; and sometimes they cannot afford the bus fare &mdash; in order to get proofs for supplementary welfare officers that they are not telling lies.  The assumption seems to be that these people are liars and cheats and that they cannot be trusted under any circumstances.  They are treated almost like criminals.  I do not know how these people retain their dignity and their confidence to eventually become employed.  I do not agree that silly solutions such as conscription would solve anything.  The last thing they need is to be brought into Army bases and put under the command of jumped-up Army officers with moustaches and gloves who will order them around.</P>
    <P>The disadvantages in our society were highlighted last week by the Taoiseach when he mentioned that only 50 out of 900 students in UCD came from a working-class background.  Some people do not believe that there is hardship.  The Minister stated that we would have to do a public relations job in order to persuade people that poverty really exists.  Surveys have shown that a sizeable number of people believe that there is no real poverty in Ireland any more.  They do not believe that people and young children are living on bread and butter and that some days of the week they do not have anything to eat at all.  People think people on social welfare are well off.</P>
    <P>Irresponsible statements have been made by some Members of this House who should know better.  For example, they say that problems regarding crime and other related social problems have nothing to do with poverty and unemployment. It is patently obvious to anyone who thinks about the position that crime results from unemployment and poverty.  Alcoholism, drug abuse and psychiatric illnesses also come about as a result of deprivation.  I heard comments to the effect that in the fifties poverty and unemployment existed at a high rate and we did not have the same crime levels. All the research shows the opposite to be true.  In fact, they are very closely linked.</P>
    <P>The layout of the districts in Dublin exaggerate the status and the standing of <Col N="1195" /> the people.  There are certain areas where the rate of unemployment is high and the standard of living is low.  There are three big problems in the country at present; unemployment, taxation and emigration. People may pick out one of them as being the biggest problem but in my opinion the three of them can be taken together. By solving the unemployment problem the other two can be eliminated.  The question of unemployment has reached alarming proportions in certain areas.  In certain parts of my constituency there are small estates with an unemployment rate from 4 per cent &mdash; because Castleknock is included &mdash; to 76 per cent.  There are some streets where in 20 out of 22 houses nobody is working.  If we think about that we will realise the incredible problems that are highlighted in districts such as those.  In other cases there are problems such as alcoholism, wife beating or irresponsibility in the home and those people are depending on unemployment assistance or supplementary welfare benefit.  The responsible members of our society, in the main the mothers, have to go cringing to social welfare officers and beg and plead for help in order to pay their ESB bill or their gas bill or to buy fuel or food.  That is a regular occurrence and is happening in bigger proportions than we care to believe.</P>
    <P>The case that has been made about rip-offs in the social welfare system has blinded many of us into thinking that problems do not exist.  The most unfair attacks have been on unmarried mothers and deserted wives.  I do not know many of those people who are living in luxury. They are generally under-nourished because they give anything they have to their babies.  They live in poor housing and are afraid to open the door of their flat in case somebody will accuse them of having relations with men.  In most cases this happens as a result of ignorance as proved by statistics and research.</P>
    <P>We had an outcry in the House regarding the Health (Family Planning) (Amendment) Act, 1985, not to mention others.  We had a contradictory call from some Members who think that unmarried <Col N="1196" /> mothers should not be entitled to any care or housing.  Statistics show that over 50 per cent of the unmarried mothers in the 15 to 19 age group never use any form of contraception.  In the 20 to 24 age group the figure is 37 per cent and in the 25 to 29 age group it is about 29 per cent. Most of these problems arise as a result of ignorance, lack of education and unequal opportunities.  In this great Christian society of ours the moral leaders, the ones who shout most against contraception and a form of divorce, are the ones who accuse these people of illicit relationships and of deliberately having babies so that they can get this fantastic £60 a week and live in luxury.  That is so irresponsible that it is almost criminal.  I totally deny that that takes palce to any appreciable extent.</P>
    <P>The response outlined in this Bill is not adequate.  We are not showing that we fully understand the problem.  We are only dealing with the &ldquo;no hopers&rdquo;.  The Government are introducing a Bill to combat poverty but in the near future they intend to introduce a Bill setting up a lottery to bleed the poor.  All over the world governments have got out of lotteries because they have proved to be a tax on the poor.  We might as well say that we are going to raise £100 million by increasing the tax on the poor, by giving them less money so that we can use it for the benefit of the well off.  The advantaged people know best how to get most from the system.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier that only 1 per cent of the population in Ballyfermot can go for third level education.  I was told by the Minister for Education that there was a fine regional college there.  I went to see the college and it is a fine college with a wonderful range of subjects but I was astounded to find that most of the pupils there came from outside the area, from places as far away as Dún Laoghaire and that the only pupils from Ballyfermot, with the exception of a few, were doing pre-employment courses.  People came from all over the city to avail of the huge range of subjects.  This proves again that the advantaged know how to get the best from the system.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1197" /> People on benefit, such as the deserted wife's allowance, get no extras and the people on unemployment assistance seem to get everything.  The whole supplementary welfare system needs to be examined.  I ask the Minister for Social Welfare to consider streamlining the system.  This is only an administrative problem due to the total lack of sympathy and understanding of the hardship being suffered.  We have an archaic, unwieldly system to deal with people experiencing extreme hardship.  The Minister should look at this as a matter of urgency.  It will not cost anything to streamline the system.  There are outlying social welfare offices throughout Dublin without a telephone communication and who do not keep files and consequently people are sent traipsing all over the city and must wait two or three days for their position to be reassessed before they can get any money.</P>
    <P>We are coming to the end of the century and while times have been good for a lot of people we are beginning to experience the grinding poverty that prevailed in the fifties when people queued for fuel at turf depots and for coal, when people queued for handout gansies and children went in bare feet.  We now see mothers with dank, lifeless hair, skeletal features obviously under-nourished and who cannot manage the bureaucratic system. The standard of literacy required to know what benefits one is entitled to is not there and that is mainly why these people come to us and to the community information officers.</P>
    <P>I remember in the past when there was a bus strike people working as cleaners left at 5 a.m. and 6 a.m. in the morning to walk to town to work.  I thought that a terrible hardship at the time.  Ballyfermot is near to the city now when one thinks of areas such as Mulhuddart where it costs the best part of £2 to go into town by bus.  The people living there just cannot go to town.  They cannot survive on their income.  Unless we do something drastic to help these people we are failing badly.  We are totally at a loss as to what to do with our huge, young population.  In the fifties the unemployed were labourers <Col N="1198" /> who could not get work but nowadays the unemployed have fairly decent educational qualifications.  This is causing terrible problems which must be faced. These problems are not being faced in this Bill.  This Bill only calls for more research and we have had a lot of research over the last ten years.</P>
    <P>The educational system does not reach into the poor areas where the educational standard is not high.  Pupils are leaving schools in my constituency and five out of seven of them cannot read.  They have not a chance of progressing through the system.  We are creating a nation of lounge bar drinkers and gamblers.  Do I take it from the tenor of this Bill that we are preparing for permanent unemployment and permanent poverty?  Are we conscious that the gap between the rich and the poor is widening?  Will the Government take it upon themselves to recognise the problems and gather the agencies controlling our society together and mould them into something that is egalitarian and basically fair to everybody? Who should advise the Minister in this agency?  I am concerned about it because we are just setting up another board which will report and suggest that we should do this, that and the other.  I am inundated with reports.  I cannot keep track of them.  They are filed and put away and when you are researching it is grand to take them out again, but I do not see the real meat in this Bill or what it really wants to do.</P>
    <P>It is not a nice thing to be doing.  It is worthwhile and shows concern, but it does not seem to be attempting to tackle the injustices in our society.  I do not see it attempting to break the system or asking for it to be broken or for a redistribution.  I see no attack on the wealth in our society.  This Bill is identifying the poor, saying: &ldquo;There is a poor out there.  We do not understand why it is there, or the extent of it, or at least we do not believe it is all that big.  Go away and find out and tell us how big it is and we will see what money we can get to help out.&rdquo; I think a figure of £1 million was mentioned.</P>
    <P>That is not the problem.  Many people <Col N="1199" /> with experience could tell the Minister the extent of the problem.  After all, we are public representatives who are supposed to know the problems on the ground.  We all represent constituencies throughout the country, 43 altogether with 11 in Dublin, and there is a great deal of information there already.  Many voluntary and religious groups, people on the ground, are working daily all over the country and they know the extent of the problem, but we do not seem to be facing it here.  Surveys should be ongoing. We do not need surveys or advice groups to tell the Minister what to do.  We ought to tackle the problem.  There is a good mix in the Government.  With the influence of the Labour Party within the Government we could tackle this immediately, but someone must look at the extent of the problem.</P>
    <P>Even here in Dublin where one third of the population are, we must decide on something drastic and big, and that we will not continue to make the same mistakes.  Most of us recognise that the housing problem has been solved by this Government over the past few years to the extent that maybe 3,000 or 4,000 people are on the housing list, but large numbers of units are empty throughout the city and that means that the crisis in housing has ended.  If that is so and it is now predictable and controllable&mdash;now single people are getting dwellings&mdash;is it not time to say: &ldquo;Let us not continue with this system but let us have a social mix throughout the city and we will not be creating ghettos or putting people and whole neighbourhoods with health problems into the one district, or putting people at the top of the points list all together?</P>
    <P>Let us have a mix where people can go nearly anywhere they like in the city.  Let us try to tackle the overall problem.  The people should advise, but more teeth should be given to the Minister by the Government to tackle this problem since it has a ministry of its own now.  Support will be given in this House for that, but those who should advise should be those who know, those on the ground who work with the poor and sympathise with them. <Col N="1200" /> We should make big gestures such as deciding finally what to do with the Ballymun flats and whether they should be demolished.  What about other blocks of flats such as St. Michael's Estate?  Should they be replaced with houses, things that will work there?</P>
    <P>The poor are being exploited by the less caring, the well off, the Right and the Left.  Recently in an effort to help the poor when I was trying to prevent a proliferation of gaming machines I called a series of public meetings around my constituency.  When I was outside at my meetings The Worker's Party members distributed leaflets decrying what I was doing and ridiculing me over it and saying that I was jumping on their bandwagon.  I mention this because gaming and rackets were what I was trying to prevent.  Consider the hypocrisy of The Workers' Party in trying to claim that they were working in the interest and on behalf of the poor when they are accused of exploiting them by putting these kinds of machines, leisure centres and gaming halls into their areas and milking those poor citizens.  It is too much to bear or to let pass without putting it on record.  The Workers' Party have been linked to the Official IRA to whom the Provisional IRA were said to be amateurs in comparison.  They were racketeers and had a system similar to that of the Cosa Nostra.  Will they continue to operate those systems throughout the country and in my constituency and among the poor in Ballyfermot and Inchicore&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy De Rossa pilloried the Labour Party when he was making his speech.  He stated that Deputy Prendergast said that the Labour Party were set up for the poor and remained there to help the poor and that perhaps that was why they had not made much progress, and that The Workers' Party were doing well.  If The Workers' Party are representing the poor in the way I saw <Col N="1201" /> portrayed on &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo; last night all I can say is: &ldquo;God help the poor.  They will need the Labour Party and others to help them.&rdquo;  This is exploitation of the worst criminal kind and I hope it will be investigated, but I am worried that we have a national party here.</P>
      <P>The Workers' Party go into the Six Counties and claim that their leaders are operating in both places.  They are involved in rackets and I can say with confidence from what I know of my constituency that I wonder at their resources.  I cannot afford the kind of operation they have on the ground in Dublin.  They should come out and say whether they are milking the poor, whether they are truly representative of them or if they have something else in mind and up their sleeves.  That must be answered.  I will stand shoulder to shoulder with them to help the poor and truly to represent equal opportunity in the country, but I will not stand shoulder to shoulder with hypocrisy if these people are using rackets and methods&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Progressive Democrats have brought in the rising tide again and there is a point to be made here.  I do not think they will bring out a policy so that does not matter too much, but I am concerned that every time they have spoken their words have been directed towards employment and the private sector.  They have not spoken about a social policy.  A rising tide will not help one million poor people.  We have here a filter system.  The best is defined in every instance and in every area, and the disadvantaged and the poor fall to the bottom.  A rising tide will not help them, it will drown them. They will benefit the least.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred to the need for <Col N="1202" /> research because it seems that the Establishment do not know, or perhaps do not want to know, that a poor exist or know the extent of poverty in our society. There are other factors apart altogether from income.  There are educational disadvantages, bad health conditions, low nutritional standards, insufficient housing, job insecurity, poor environment and social isolation.  The Minister refers to these.  She also says:</P>
    <P>We are all aware of this and of the concerns voiced by persons who are involved in this area &mdash; people representing voluntary organisations, the Churches, statutory bodies, academic institutions and so on.</P>
    <P>It is the &ldquo;and so on&rdquo; that bothers me.  It seems that we do not know what we want to do here.  That phrase shows a lack of getting to grips with this problem and of making the changes which need to be made.  Again, she says:</P>
    <P>... there is still a lack of basic information, of statistical data and of knowledge in general in many aspects of poverty.</P>
    <P>How can anybody say that in 1986 after what we have experienced and are experiencing? Again she says:</P>
    <P>Without public understanding and support change will be difficult to achieve.</P>
    <P>Are we joking?  What about political understanding?  Is somebody trying to tell me that this great Christian society of which we are never tired of reminding ourselves is not going to support change, or help towards poverty-stricken people? &ldquo;Poverty&rdquo; is the word used in the Bill. That shows a dreadful lack of confidence in our people.  If that is the case, we have some serious work to do.  What about political representation?  If we in this House decide that we should help, restructure, and bring in laws and redistribute wealth in a certain manner, we do not need to get public support for that. That is what we were elected to do.</P>
    <P>Again, she says:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1203" /> ... we must first of all have adequate information on the causes, characteristics and extent of poverty and we must attempt to convince society in general of the need for the policies which we intend to pursue and that they will be effective.</P>
    <P>How can we stand over that statement? I must be living in a dream world and so must Deputy De Rossa and Senators Brendan Ryan and Michael Higgins.  If that is the extent of the understanding of the problems and the poverty in this country, as I said at the beginning, I despair of our ever doing anything worthwhile about it, except patronisingly giving a half of 1 per cent increase to widows, or something of that kind.</P>
    <P>I should like to know what the Minister meant by:</P>
    <P>... the initiation of measures aimed at overcoming poverty in the State and the evaluation of such measures.</P>
    <P>What we are really thinking about here is getting people out of rags &mdash; to use a euphemism &mdash; getting them into shoes and warm clothing.  Essentially they would remain in the same state.  What we want is a restructuring of our society, to get such people completely out of their predicament.  We want them to have equal opportunity, to have an egalitarian society, but this is going in the wrong direction.  If that was just a once-off statement, I should not be too worried about it, but it is mentioned four or five times in the Minister's speech.  It states: &ldquo;Any projects which the agency run should be in the nature of demonstration projects&rdquo;. Projects for what?  The place is full of projects, all wasting money and getting us nowhere.</P>
    <P>I agree that this agency should not become just another source for funds for local projects because we have enough of those in the last couple of years.  What we must do and should be attempting to do is breaking the mould.  We should be attempting to help people out of their predicament.  The European programme <Col N="1204" /> is not the kind of thing that we should have in mind, a self-help situation, because that is only perpetuating the hand-out mentality.  When are we going to get up off our knees, solve our own problems with dignity and lift ourselves out of the mire in which we are?</P>
    <P>Again, there are the words:</P>
    <P>action research projects in favour of deprived groups of deprived areas.</P>
    <P>That seems like a fire brigade operation. We are going to go in, see a shocking state of affairs and try to relieve it temporarily. Temporary relief will not work here. What is happening is that society is going away from us.</P>
    <P>The Minister refers to &ldquo;providing an integrated response to the needs of the poor&rdquo;.  Perhaps my understanding of the Bill is not the same as the Minister's. Perhaps I do not understand the intention of the draftsmen.  That can be teased out on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The fourth main function of the Combat Poverty Agency as outlined in section 4 (a) of the Bill is &ldquo;the promotion of greater public understanding of the nature, causes and extent of poverty in the State and the measures necessary to overcome such poverty&rdquo;.  While that is laudable I cannot understand how we can have so many people living below the poverty line, one million poor people, and at the same time ask for &ldquo;greater public understanding of the nature, causes and extent of poverty&rdquo;.  One in every three people experience poverty and yet we are asking for greater public understanding of the nature and causes of poverty.  Most people know about poverty.</P>
    <P>The Minister's speech is a cause of despair for me.  The Minister said: &ldquo;The notion of poverty itself is, I feel, a somewhat vague one to many people and it will be important for the new agency to `operationalise' the concept and make it meaningful in concrete terms&rdquo;.  This is vague to whom?  It is vague to a few people at the top of the ladder, and there are very few of them.  It is vague to the upper middle class, but it is not a vague notion to many people.  It is a real <Col N="1205" /> problem which is affecting their daily lives.  Between now and Committee Stage we have some work to do.  We have to show that we understand this problem and can do something about it.  It will be years before these objectives can be attained.  What we need is action.  There is no point in the Government bringing in Bills if nothing happens when they are passed.  In 1981 an agency was set up but it was disbanded by the next Government. What is the point of setting up another agency now if the same thing can happen?</P>
    <P>The Minister said: &ldquo;The proposals in the Bill endeavour to take account of all that has happened in this area over the past decade&rdquo;.  That information is in my office, and it is probably in the offices of most Deputies and Senators.  For the umpteenth time the Minister said: &ldquo;To be effective the new agency will have to have a wide degree of support in the community and I hope that it will be possible to achieve a wide measure of agreement in relation to proposals now put forward&rdquo;.  Surely we have this support? If we are having difficulties in getting support for this measure, we should not dream of having a divorce referendum. I thought we were advancing. We are nearing the end of the 20th century but we are talking as if we were setting up the new State in 1923-24.</P>
    <P>We have a responsibility in this House, and we should exercise it now.  We should tie this in with the other things this Government have done very successfully. The last thing we will do in the remaining 18 months is to try to create a massive number of jobs.  By doing this we will to a large extent eliminate poverty and create opportunity.  We will do away with the need for supplementary welfare and we will be able to put more money into different areas of education.  If we get the planning right, especially in the Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Galway areas, we could have a five or ten year plan to eliminate poverty altogether.  I think that is the way to do it.</P>
    <P>I hope action will be taken immediately in this area because we have statistics on poverty in every district.  I remember <Col N="1206" /> taking a survey in a small area of 1,350 houses in Corduff.  I identified all the unemployed, the deserted wives, the single mothers and those on unemployment assistance and social welfare benefits.  I am breaking down these figures so that I can help the people in the area.  We all have these types of statistics in our offices.  I get many reports through the letter box every day.  In fact, I get so many reports from different Departments that I cannot keep up with them.</P>
    <P>Immediate and substantial funding should be made available.  A special fund should be set up to look after those in receipt of supplementary social welfare.  This is one area where a study should be carried out immediately because the system is cumbersome administratively.  It is not streamlined.  There is no central office of statistics one can get in touch with.  With one stroke we could wipe out a great deal of misery throughout the country by setting up these offices.  There is one thing which could be done, and it would not cost very much.  I am speaking now of my own area &mdash; Clondalkin, Mulhuddart and the border of Meath where people are living in local authority houses.  When they come to the social welfare offices they are told to go to Phibsborough, Holles St. Hospital or some part of town to get a document to prove that they are entitled to what they are claiming.  These people should be given a chit by the social welfare officer which they can hand to the bus conductor to travel to the city. My view is that these people should not have to travel into the city at all.  It is terrible that an unfortunate woman with three, four or five children dragging out of her has to make her way into the centre of town and when she arrives at the office she is told to come back another day. These women can spend two or three days trying to get these documents.  This is criminal and something should be done about it immediately.</P>
    <P>I do not believe we can salve our consciences by setting up a Combat Poverty Agency and providing some money.  I believe we have to do something more fundamental.  The social welfare abuse, <Col N="1207" /> estimated by the Department to be around £2.4 million, is not enough to warrant all the screaming we have heard from detractors of the system over the past few months.  We should congratulate ourselves because we have managed to keep ahead of inflation and we have given the highest social welfare increases in Europe.  Our hope should be that these social welfare payments will help these people until they return to work.  We know now that most of these people will never work again, that viewed in the context of jobs available in Dublin they are to all intents and purposes unemployable.</P>
    <P>It must be pointed out that there is a limitation to the initiative or ideas of people in poverty stricken areas.  We are all products of our environment.  That is why one will not discover too many ideas for starting up businesses or overcoming their problems emanating from such areas.  Even if such did exist these people would not be given opportunities because of where they live.  In the main they would not be accepted by our financial institutions; they would not have any credibility. That is another reason the Government must intervene and restructure society.  After many complaints some progress was made in that respect in the last year.  I am on the record many times complaining about the contribution of the banks in this country during the recession, which was nil.  Indeed, they were the only institutions in the State that did not make any contribution during the recession.  As we are aware, the Chairman of the Bank of Ireland, Mr. Mark Hely Hutchinson, at one point decided to add a 3 per cent premium interest rate on all small businesses wanting to expand.  Subsequently, because of public outcry, that proposal was dropped.  I contended that if the banks did not enter into those risk areas, then the Government would have to.  The Government have done so by way of the establishment of the National Development Corporation.</P>
    <P>We must recognise that if certain sections of society are to be discriminated against &mdash; in that such people will not be <Col N="1208" /> taken seriously or afforded credit in those areas &mdash; then there must be an agency to intervene, or one to which they can resort to get themselves going.  To date such an agency has not been available.  I mentioned the unfair attacks levelled, perhaps not deliberately, on single mothers and deserted wives.  One would think there were red lights flashing outside the doors of unmarried mothers' houses and flats with all the talk there is abroad, but that is not true; they have been pilloried unfairly.  We should bear in mind what the Minister said in a radio interview in the past week &mdash; and what I have said consistently &mdash; that it is not deserted wives or unmarried mothers we are helping, although they are entitled to help, but rather their dependent children.  It is the dependent children who are suffering. No matter what kind of liaison or relationship preceded the birth of a baby we must, even at cost to ourselves, look after such children.  They are perfectly innocent.  It is society that is at fault, so they must be looked after.  I do not think anybody would deny that.</P>
    <P>The media do not help the poor in our society; if anything they encourage greed.  They do not help the process towards an egalitarian society because they glamorise wealth, the success of film stars, pop stars, people who own yachts, large cars and who are very successful, showing their fine houses in society columns.  All of that does not help, bearing in mind especially the prevailing dependency on the media, television, radio newspapers and so on.  It does not help society to settle down, to become less selfish, less consumerised, less greedy.  Rather society is becoming less caring, understanding of and helpful to neighbours.  The only way in which the problems of the poor will be eliminated is when they become sufficiently aware and demand their entitlements, the right to work, to a home, to equal opportunity and decent education.  I hope that day is not too far distant but I fear it will be a slow process.  It is up to us to help the poor to reach that stage.</P>
    <P>The poor in our society are inded treated as second-class citizens and are <Col N="1209" /> confined by all the disadvantages from which they suffer.  I had thought that the objective of an educational policy was to eliminate those disadvantages.  A number of primary school teachers have reported children in their classes being listless and disinterested because they come to school hungry.  I know of teachers who have shared their lunches with such children. One does not have to engage in research to prove that because the poor are rapidly becoming poorer, with a whole series of oppressions being piled on their shoulders, which we would like to pretend do not exist.  For example, basic hunger is now a fact of life for many people in our society.  I know of many families who eat for part of the week only and whose children exist on bread and butter.</P>
    <P>This Bill affords Members an opportunity to debate this issue.  I hope the provisions of the Bill will be taken very seriously and that, by debating them, we will give them teeth.  Poverty is something we closed our eyes to for a long time.  It was not that we turned our noses up at it but rather that people caught in the poverty trap are often treated brusquely and dismissively by others in authority. The poor tend to make some people feel uncomfortable; they do not want to deal with them.  That is a fact of life.  The poor just do not receive the same facilities or reception as people who can pay their way, who have the ability to pay for services and so on.  Emigration is not going to help us now.  It may be on the increase but those who are poor cannot get away. It may have been a solution in the past but it will not in the future.  We will have to face up to our problems or otherwise we will have such people knocking on our doors.</P>
    <P>We have tended to treat the poor in our society as people who must be controlled. It appears that it is the view that the children of poor people should be suppressed and kept down so that the rest of society can carry on with minimal interference from them as they go about their daily lives.  The better off in society drive through poor districts to attend glittering or State functions watched by the <Col N="1210" /> beggars who get a wave from the people in the big cars as they go.  That is the way society has always looked upon the poor. The successful are the only ones who are tolerated or applauded but the humble poor person is not.  It would take a lot to erase that from our consciousness and do something about it.</P>
    <P>A lot of lip service has been paid in the past to the need for a redistribution of the wealth in our society but the redistribution we are talking about now is from the have-nots to the have-nots.  The poor, the largest group in society, are deserving of most attention.  After three years in office, during which time they ensured that social welfare increases were in line with or ahead of inflation, the Government should change the structures so that the poor get the share they are entitled to.</P>
    <P>The main cause of poverty in our society is unemployment.  In fact it is the main cause of most of our social evils. Unemployment leads to crime, alcoholism, drug abuse and psychiatric illnesses. Our reponse appears to be to humiliate such people even further.  It is a shame that we are not in a position to provide employment for such people but we should not insist on humiliating them further as they pass on the road to collect the pittance we offer.  It may be that we humiliate and push those people around because of history or the way the poor are treated in western society.  It may also be due to what we have learned from the Bible down.</P>
    <P>Of the 40,000 people who live alone, 30 per cent do not have water, 60 per cent do not have hot water and 10 per cent do not have electricity.  We do not need any more research on poverty.  In the last ten years an enormous amount of research was carried out but we did not come up with any solutions.  We have not come up with a solution to the problem of the itinerants, the homeless or the treatment of long stay psychiatric patients.  I accept that the trend today is towards more community care but we must be very careful that such people do not end up on the scrap heap.  We do not look after our poor, and those with <Col N="1211" /> psychiatric problems are more vulnerable still.  In most cases if such people go out into the community and are not looked after properly they will end up in hostels or on the streets.</P>
    <P>The poor receive inadequate incomes and the services for them in the areas of health, education and the environment are not sufficient.  Those people tolerate those conditions because they are powerless to do anything about them.  They are like innocent children in that they depend on us to do something about that while they stay in their squalor.  We have a responsibility to do something for them. I should like to relate some of the experiences of the poor when they seek to avail of our services or must attend at our courts.  They do not know how to handle our archaic courts system which is from a by-gone age.  The system that operates in our courts is an affront to every decent Irish person.  Our poor and uneducated people when they go to our courts must walk into an atmosphere of wigs and gowns, bowing and scraping, listen to an archaic language and listen to people referring to a man with a cloak and a wig sitting on a chair &mdash;&mdash;</P>

Those people <Col N="1212" /> are at a loss, are unable to defend themselves and do not know how to hire a solicitor.  The system was deliberately established by the British to intimidate those who appear before our courts.  Poor people are frightened of our courts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>We need a whole restructuring of our society and the courts system is one thing that should be got rid of.  It is because poor people are too frightened and do not understand what is going on that they end up losing.  Most people who have the misfortune to end up in court find the procedure very unequal from their point of view.  The commonality of interest which exists in court procedures between the Garda, the legal profession and the Judiciary is further evidence of the powerlessness of poor people.  I will not elaborate on that but it is an important point in relation to poverty.</P>
      <P>The prison population is comprised largely of poor and uneducated people. Deputy Gregory said, after his recent sojourn in Mountjoy, that nobody in there had a third level education.  In that prison 27 per cent of the inmates are from my constituency and they come from a part of the constituency where only 1 per cent reach third level education as against 4 per cent in other parts of the constituency. Irrespective of who commits crime, those who end up in prison are poor, without employment opportunities, they do not have an educational background.  They cannot read and a substantial minority cannot do basic addition and subtraction.  These people are pathetic&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamSkelly" hpid="Mr. Skelly Mr. Skelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>If I can talk about poverty <Col N="1213" /> in housing estates throughout the country surely I can talk about poverty stricken people in prison?  The dregs of society are in prison and because of the structure in society the people who are likely to commit crimes are from the poorest backgrounds and do not get the opportunities available to those more fortunate.  It is very difficult to end up in prison but it is always the poorest people who do.  Not too many years ago we had a tiny prison population but that is not the case at present.  They are now building a prison for women which is ridiculous because a very small proportion of women are involved in crime.</P>
      <P>Oppression of the poor is not confined to the State or its agents in the area of law enforcement.  Social services are also run as an instrument of oppression.  They are not meant to be run in that way but that is what happens because of the extraordinary rigmarole which people have to go through in getting a medical card.  In the social welfare appeals system, no specific evidence is presented to a person appealing against disqualification. They are not allowed to cross-examine those who make allegations against them and there is no confrontation with their accusers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Poor people are frequently taken to court for non-payment of arrears of rent. The local authority agents are under oath but these people are not and do not have any say in what happens to them.  They are invariably convicted and get notice to quit.  I am just making the point that the poor are unable to defend themselves in many instances and unless we do something drastic in regard to legislation, instead of tinkering with it, the problem will get worse.  For example, the legal aid board are not allowed to take an interest in social welfare cases and the law pertaining to them.  Poverty is not an accident. It is a direct consequence of the way we order society.  It is a reflection of the values in society and of the emphasis on competition as a basic value.  In competitions there are winners and to identify them we enshrine a level of affluence and consumption as a mark of success. Everyone is striving towards this goal. <Col N="1214" /> Senator Brendan Ryan said that the poor are necessary to reassure the powerful that they are successful which is an interesting statement.  He also disagrees with the use of words like &ldquo;underprivileged&rdquo;, &ldquo;deprived&rdquo; and &ldquo;socially disadvantaged&rdquo; because it gives society an excuse for believing that all this came about accidentally.</P>
    <P>I said earlier that success is cyclical for the professions who benefit most but poverty is also cyclical.  Children are born into poor families and many of them dream of a new life while they are growing up, and how different it would have been if they had been born into wealthy families?  They suffer and see their parents suffering because of deprivation. Because they are poor their housing is poor; as a result their health is bad and the health services are inadequate.  It is not long since the poor came out of the ghettos of Dublin with their mattresses and other belongings on horses and carts and handcarts.  As many as 50 people lived in one tenement in the fifties and they wheeled their belongings to places like Ballyfermot.  We have to have short memories and to have forgotten what it was like then in Dublin.  We must do something about it.  You cannot build housing estates like Ballymun and just forget about them.  Some of these people are now in the wilds on the borders of County Meath and do not know how to get out of their predicament.</P>
    <P>The reports of the Medico Social Research Board demonstrate that the children of the poor have poor health. They have higher levels of infant mortality, all because of poverty.  They leave school early, malnourished, and the cycle continues.  Children born into well off families have all the advantages.  We could help by changing the law in the area of social welfare and we should allocate more resources to welfare, housing and education.</P>
    <P>The Minister should examine the total mess of the supplementary welfare system which is characterised by unwritten laws under which people must operate, by circulars which are not public knowledge, and by rules which seem to <Col N="1215" /> vary with the resources available from area to area.  I am certain this is not the way it is meant to operate, but it is driving people to distraction because it is so unpredictable.  It depends on the day, and the humour of the person with whom you are in contact.</P>
    <P>In their report, No. 109 of 1981, the ESRI said that as taxation on capital and inherited wealth drifted towards the inconsequential, an awareness of social class would have alerted policy makers to the possibility that Ireland might enter the 21st century with an upper middle class so privileged and so securely entrenched as to hark back to its 19th century predecessor.</P>
    <P>Though this Bill is welcome and its objectives are laudable, the resources being devoted to the effort, £1 million, are most inadequate.  There is a need for research into the way we order our society.  The reason for our living in an unequal society, for our sending our children to schools that reproduce that inequality, for our having two health services, two legal systems, two educational systems and all other sorts of inequalities is that we do not sufficiently evaluate knowledge in terms of the nature of society.  Our attitude to poverty is high in terms of compassion but low in terms of justice as was said by Senator Michael Higgins.  The existence of poverty is attributed usually to personal characteristics. There is this notion of poor families being of low motivation, people who are low on the work ethic and so on.  We fail to see poverty as the consequence of social and economic structures.</P>
    <P>Out of public taxation we make it possible for an overwhelming disproportion of the population, in the form of the professional classes, to reproduce themselves in the various professions.  That is the saddest factor of all, as I know from my experience from trying to break that system.  It continues like a huge steamroller and we do not seem to be able to stop it.  Unemployment is a status that is not chosen but which is inflicted on individuals by reasons of fluctuations in the economy.  When Gandhi was asked <Col N="1216" /> by a clergyman what concerned him most he replied, &ldquo;The hard-heartedness of the educated class&rdquo;.  This Bill gives us the opportunity of showing that the educated class can make themselves aware of the extent of poverty in society and can act to eliminate that poverty.  However, my experience and my research indicate that that will not happen.  Because the educated class are given the task of combating poverty, to use the term chosen in the Bill, I do not think we will achieve our objective.  I would be much more confident in this respect if we had used the word &ldquo;eliminate&rdquo; rather than the word &ldquo;combat&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I shall be contributing also to the Committee Stage debate though I fear that what I will be doing will be tantamount to trying to move a brick wall.  We are not really aware of what we are setting out to do in terms of this Bill.  In addition, we do not have the will to restructure society though that would be the minimum necessary in order to eliminate the scourge of poverty.  If trends continue as they are, towards the end of the century there will be plenty of scope for revitalising the religious communities because they will be needed to take care of the huge poor population that is building up. This may be the last opportunity we will have in this century to make a final assault on poverty and on the inequalities in our society and of replacing the system with equitable educational and career opportunities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>One must welcome any Bill that is designed to deal with poverty but one must consider this Bill seriously. In its various sections it includes such grandiose titles as chairman, vice-chairman, directors of agencies and so on, but I wonder whether what we are really setting up is merely another layer of bureaucracy and red tape.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is reference in the Bill to research.  I agree with Deputy Skelly that there is no great need for further research into the area of poverty and the problems associated with it.  Already we have had a number of reports on this question from organisations and from Government so <Col N="1217" /> we are well aware of the problems associated with poverty.  Every Member of this House will be well aware of the problems associated with poverty.  Any of us could take the Minister to any town and point to the various families who are living below the poverty line.  Social inequality is rampant in this country and as the unemployment problem increases we are moving into the area of the haves and the have-nots though many people today would like us to believe that poverty is not a major problem.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister in her speech alluded to that type of thinking also when she said that the problems of poverty are not as great as we might think.  Unfortunately the political structures seem to ensure that while the rich become richer the poor become poorer.  I have no hangup about people becoming rich or making profits but I suggest that any one in that category has a duty to have regard to those who are experiencing hardship and to those who are depending on social welfare payments.  Those who are well off do not have a right to forget those on lower incomes.  Perhaps we as politicians tend to create the type of climate in which the poor will always be with us because most of the representations we make are on behalf of the poorer sectors.  We try to act as mediators in relation to applications for social welfare payments, for free fuel and so on.  The major political parties, including the party to which I belong, have not seriously tackled the problem of poverty.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Skelly when he says that the poorer sections do not have pressure groups to represent them.  This may be the situation that they will have to move away from.  I know it is difficult because they are trapped in a situation of poverty.  They will have to break out of the trap, acquire better housing, better educational facilities, improved social welfare payments and, above all, the right to work.  Well-heeled people talk a lot about the poor and like to give the impression that they are concerned about them, but what are they doing in a practical way to solve the problems of poverty? <Col N="1218" /> I would suggest that they are doing nothing. The majority of them have no concern whatsoever for the poor.</P>
    <P>Last week there was hysteria about social welfare fraud.  There were headlines about widespread abuse and a so-called expert came up with a figure of £25 million.  There is nothing wrong with highlighting the issue but nobody talked last week about the serious abuses suffered by people living on social welfare, a mere pittance, well below the poverty line.  These people have to go through a humiliating and degrading procedure in order to get their entitlements.  They go to social welfare offices and are made to feel out of place in society.  I know of some social welfare officers who say to these people that they are a burden on the State and that their taxes are being used to support them.  That is the type of attitude displayed by some so-called social welfare officers representing the Government. Not all of them feel that way, but I have come across cases where they have been very abusive and angry with people claiming their rights.</P>
    <P>Unemployment is a major problem.  In Wexford we probably have the richest agriculture land in the country but the unemployment rate is 20 per cent.  There are many rich businessmen and farmers living in the country but the scandal is that they have not decided to do something about the unemployment issue.  It is left to the Government of the day and to various State agencies to try to solve the problem.  The rich, the better-off sections of society, the banks and the institutions have a duty to give some resources to the community.</P>
    <P>Poverty is a word seldom used in this country, except perhaps in connection with the Famine.  There is a romantic notion among older people that in the past people were poor but they were happy.  I do not think people who are poor are very happy.  It is simply that when people get older they develop a romantic image of the past.</P>
    <P>There are a number of different types of poverty.  There is the poverty of those who depend on social welfare payments, poverty related to unemployment, the <Col N="1219" /> poverty of old people and the new poor. The &ldquo;new poor&rdquo; is a nice expression to describe people hovering on the poverty line or below it.  I think of people who had very good jobs, bought their own houses and were repaying their mortgages. When the firms who employed them closed down they had to sell their houses and live in rented accommodation while waiting for local authority housing.  It is humiliating for a family to have to leave their home, particularly for the wife and children.  All politicians at all levels should be concerned about this problem.</P>
    <P>In many cases it leads to broken homes and broken marriages because the family find it too difficult to readjust to their changed circumstances.  There should be some type of facility which would allow the local authority to purchase the house and let the family pay rent in the same way as people on unemployment benefit do.  This is a growing problem which is not being faced up to realistically by the Government or various agencies.</P>
    <P>I was elected to this House three years ago last November.  Yet, despite the problem of poverty and its serious consequences, this is the first real opportunity we have had to discuss the issue.  I hope the debate will last for a number of days but I am concerned about what happened here this morning.  The debate began at 10.40 a.m. and by 1.40 p.m. there had been only two speakers.  Speeches lasting an hour and a half are not on any more. I admire Deputy Skelly and Deputy De Rossa, both of whom made very good speeches, but it should not take so long to get the message across.  The Committee on Procedure and Privileges should look at this matter with a view to cutting speeches to half an hour.  It would give an opportunity to other Deputies to contribute to the debate.  I have been concerned about the length of time some Deputies take to make long-winded speeches.  It is an area which should be considered.</P>
    <P>I hope the Combat Poverty Agency will not be a talking shop.  The agency should not spend all its time diagnosing the problems of poverty.  I hope it will <Col N="1220" /> devise genuine ways to deal with the problem.  Over the years many organisations such as the Society of St. Vincent de Paul have worked tirelessly at all levels on behalf of the poor and made strenuous efforts to alleviate the problems of poverty.  Such charitable groups have carried out many studies and reports and I hope their recommendations will be taken on board by the new agency.  I would also hope that their expert advice and experience would be utilised.  I should like to see some of those people appointed to the board because their experience could play a major role in the development of the agency.</P>
    <P>Some old people will say that financially they are not too badly off but that the greatest poverty is living alone.  They have no friends, no visitors and feel they are not wanted in the community.  This Bill should set up some kind of community watch, groups of people who will look after old people living alone.  Old people are afraid even to open their doors for fear of attack.  In the past few years there have been a number of cowardly attacks on old people resulting in deaths in some cases.  Some of those who committed these crimes have been brought to justice but others have escaped because of the reluctance of old people to report the crimes to the Garda.  They feel that if they report an incident they may face further danger in the future.  When we talk about alleviating poverty we do not always have to speak in terms of providing money.  We should also be providing programmes to enable old people to be looked after so that they do not experience a sense of loneliness and of being unwanted.  Basic facilities such as water and toilets are lacking in many of the older houses where old people live.  Such houses are often in a poor state of repair.</P>
    <P>A scheme was introduced three years ago by the Government called the housing aid for the elderly.  It was a good scheme but every year since it was introduced the funding has been reduced.  It is now totally inadequate.  This scheme was administered by the health boards, through AnCO and the local community groups such as St. Vincent De Paul. <Col N="1221" /> Money was made available for the provision of basic facilities such as water, general repairs and toilet facilities.  Last year Wexford received £20,000.  That small amount would go nowhere towards dealing with the number of applications received.  The authorities in Wexford are bogged down with the number of applications they receive and they can only deal with 15 or 20 per year.</P>
    <P>The organisers feel very frustrated by the lack of finance and the people who make the applications feel that they are being neglected.  One person may receive financial aid but five or six others in the locality are refused because of insufficient funds.  The Minister should think seriously about raising the funding to a sufficient level to enable this serious problem to be tackled immediately.  I am not talking about bathroom facilities but only toilet and water facilities.  Finance should be made available to ensure that those simple necessities are provided for old people.</P>
    <P>Unemployment is one of the greatest causes of poverty.  Poverty is clearly identified among the unemployed.  There are about 250,000 people unemployed if one is to accept the figures given.  With the 30,000 who are on training schemes and the 30,000 who come and go in the emigration circle, we would be talking about 300,000 people unemployed.  Unemployment is leading to poverty, social problems, marriage breakdown and broken homes.  There are 700,000 people on social welfare benefits.  In a small country such as Ireland this is alarming.  In many cases people on social welfare assistance are living way below the poverty line. The 4 per cent recently granted by the Government does nothing to help their cause.  I am tired listening to people saying that those on the dole are better off.  If those people who are talking that way had to live on that type of income, they would find it impossible to survive. There is a great deal of tension and a lack of understanding within those families because of lack of money and the lack of a decent living.  We should improve substantially the social welfare benefits to <Col N="1222" /> our unemployed.  They are not adequate and do not meet the needs of families.</P>
    <P>Many people on long-term unemployment assistance are not in that situation because of their own choice.  There will always be a few who, in spite of what jobs are available, will have no interest in working.  The majority of people are interested in work, in finding a decent job and providing a decent income for their family.  Because of the serious lack of employment they find it difficult to provide this standard of living.  It is very disconcerting to see so many young people who leave school at 16 or 17 years of age who cannot find jobs.  They get married at 18 or 19 years and at 22 or 23 years they have two or three children. Those people never had the opportunity to go out to work.</P>
    <P>It is very unfortunate that children are reared in such an environment.  It is one of the most degrading, demoralising and psychologically damaging factors to that person and to the family.  This is one area that we should be concerned about.  The Government made an effort to find a solution through training schemes and social employment schemes which are proving very successful.  Wexford is one county which has taken advantage of those schemes.  It is important that we get people away from thinking about unemployment assistance and use the money that is available to ensure that those people get work with the local authorities or local community groups. Many young married couples are very frustrated and disillusioned.  The area of unemployment assistance causes serious problems for families, in particular for the wife.  She knows that no matter how many children she has she will only have a small amount of income each week which is not adequate.  She can make no plans for the future either for herself or her family.  There is a standard fixed rate of unemployment assistance and there is no hope of getting money through overtime or any other way.  In many cases the food on the table is the only luxury which this family can afford.  This leads to serious problems in the home.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1223" /> The most degrading means test in existence is the one carried out for social exployment assistance.  It ensures that the applicant will always feel that he is poor, that he is being downgraded and that he is trapped in a situation that he cannot get out of.  Many social welfare officers are arrogant and have no sense of compassion and no commonsense approach to dealing with the problems relating to unemployment.  In some areas even the hens, chickens and goats are taken into account when calculating the means test. I know of one case recently where the son of a man who applied for unemployment assistance had one sheep and two lambs which were taken into account in his means test.  His unemployment assistance was reduced by £1.50 a week because of this.  This is a ridiculous situation.  If this gentleman makes an appeal the social welfare officer will have to visit him again.  More time and more money are spent.  It often costs a lot more to have the social welfare officer call on a number of occasions.  Unless a person has a large number of sheep or cows his unemployment assistance should not be reduced. It is already small enough as it is.</P>
    <P>This has all to do with poverty.  People have to go to the social welfare officer and beg.  They must get help in order to survive until the appeal is heard, and at the moment it is taking up to six months to have appeals heard.  People are pestering politicians and community information officers everyday of the week to find out what has gone wrong.  I do not know if the problem is because of a shortage of appeals officers or because of problems in the west, where there is a huge number of appeals from small farmers whose dole has been withdrawn.  The length of time it is taking to deal with appeals is causing serious hardship and I would ask the Minister to have a look at it.</P>
    <P>The criterion concerning availability for work has always mystified me.  When we have 250,000 people unemployed it is obvious that people on unemployment benefit have not a real chance of getting a job.  I and other Deputies accompany <Col N="1224" /> people to appeals hearings where the first question asked is if the person is available for and looking for work and are they registered with Manpower.  I agree that a person should be registered with Manpower in the event of a job coming up. When people can confirm by letter from an employer that they sought work they invariably get their social welfare benefit, but if they cannot produce the letter they will be disallowed.  This criterion is causing serious hardship and it should be dropped.  In particular, it is causing serious hardship for women, who are refused benefit because the Department considered that they are not available for and seeking work.  This is adding to the poverty of families on social welfare assistance.</P>
    <P>I hope our spokesman will put down amendments to a number of sections in this Bill.  Because unemployment assistance is means tested, if the son or daughter of an employed man seeks unemployment assistance they only get a reduced allowance perhaps as low as 99p which is not worth collecting or £9, £8 or £10.  How does a social welfare officer decide what should be allocated?  I know the total income coming into the family is taken into account and I know of cases where three or four members of a family are unemployed and are receiving reduced unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister reconsider that and consider that the paltry sum they will get on the full allowance would not keep a young person of 18 or 19 in clothes or in food for a week?  To offer these people less than the full allowance is insulting. The son of a director of a company will not get anything, but in those cases the sons are usually involved in third level education.  What about the people who because of financial constraints do not have an opportunity to avail of third level education?  Such people should be considered differently.  There should not be an across the board criterion in relation to entitlement to unemployment assistance. The circumstances of a family and why the young people are not involved in third level education should be taken into account when making an assessment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1225" /> There is major poverty among widows because the widows' allowance is insultingly small.  Widows with a number of children are finding it almost impossible to survive.  They do not have free electricity, free transport or a free television licence.  They must pay their way all along the line.  The widows are totally neglected as regards social welfare benefits.  They are left out of the mainstream of benefits. The teenage children of widows should be considered for a special allowance. When a youngster reaches the age of 13 years or 14 years he or she wishes to be similar to the other young people in the neighbourhood, to dress the same, to go to discos and so on.  There should be a special allowance for these children.  This area pertaining to widows and their children should be seriously reconsidered and updated.  Widows should be helped to maintain their families as they should be maintained.</P>
    <P>We must not forget deserted husbands or widowers, who are of grave concern to many people.  The deserted husband or widower is usually allowed unemployment assistance and an allowance for his children.  In many cases a father must give up work to look after the children and they are finding it impossible to survive. If they go to the social welfare officer they might get an allowance of £5 or £10.  If a man put his children into care it would cost the country a fortune, but if in his wisdom he decides to look after his family he is not encouraged to do so. The unemployment assistant rate should be brought into line with other rates being paid.  We talk about equality for women &mdash; and I am all for it &mdash; but I would like to see equality for men also.  The deserted wife is reasonably well looked after but the deserted husband finds himself&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;I am not saying not reasonably well looked after but he finds himself in an impossible position with unemployment assistance and just the allowance for the children.  This area is becoming more contentious and we should look at it.  I do not blame the <Col N="1226" /> Minister or any Government Department in that area.  The attitude of the people dealing with the supplementary welfare allowance is what needs to be looked at.  It is causing concern to the people I am talking about.</P>
      <P>The supplementary welfare allowance and the criteria used in regard to it are in a total mess.  It could be of great benefit to poor families if it was freely available to them.  I do not mean that it should be given to people who are well off but it should be freely available to the people who deserve it.  Some type of secrecy surrounds the supplementary welfare allowance.  No definite information is available about it.  Most families are not aware that such an allowance exists. When I ask people who come to me if they have looked for social welfare supplementary allowance at their local welfare clinics they look at me as if this was a new device just introduced yesterday. It has been in existence for a long time but people are not aware of it.  Its allocation is left to the discretion of the social welfare officers, and their attitude in a community leaves much to be desired.  Some of them have a reasonable attitude towards people but many of them give the impression sometimes that they are paying the money out of their own pockets, they are so stingy and miserable with it, judging by the attitude they adopt towards people whose right it is to seek this allowance and to receive it if their income is inadequate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A veil of secrecy hangs about this allowance, for what reason I do not know.  This allowance has been available for a number of years and people are suffering hardship that they should not have to suffer when this allowance is available and should be given to them.  I would like to see definite guidelines drawn up for the administration of this supplementary welfare allowance and that the officers would not have discretion to use their own criteria and their own ideas in its allocation.  The guidelines should be defined by the Minister of the day as to what the social welfare officer can or cannot do.  It should not be left to his own decision so that if he does not like you you do not get it and if he gets <Col N="1227" /> a notion you have money hidden away you do not get it either.  Guidelines should be drawn up to make it easier to get this allowance for its intended purpose, to help families in need.  If it was more readily available to genuine applicants in genuine circumstances it could play a significant role in alleviating real poverty.  If some people who are barely above the poverty line could get a few pounds from the social welfare officer their lives would be much easier.  The Minister can do something immediately about this.</P>
    <P>Deputy Skelly talked about the free fuel.  I am inclined to agree with him that £5 per week is totally inadequate but, being realistic, in difficult times we must accept that things will not be as good as they should be.  In the last few years the rate has increased to the present amount. The scheme was introduced to help poorer families but the public are very confused about it.  If you live in an urban area on unemployment assistance or unemployment benefit you can get the free fuel allowance through the local authority but if you live in the rural areas and the scheme is administered through the health boards it is impossible to get it.  Criteria are laid down there and if you are on unemployment assistance you do not get it.  If you are on short term unemployment benefit you do not get it, whereas people in the towns get it.  I am not criticising that latter fact, but people in rural areas have more or less the same problems as people in the towns and they feel that they are victimised.  I believe that moves are afoot to regularise the situation, but then I suppose that people in towns who at present are getting the allowance, will be brought into line with people in the rural areas and none of them will get it.  I hope that will not happen.  I would like to see the people in rural areas getting it to alleviate their problems of low or inadequate incomes.</P>
    <P>Old age pensioners who have a son or daughter living with them do not get free fuel.  In many cases the son or daughter is on unemployment assistance of a paltry £30 a week, or less if on reduced rate. <Col N="1228" /> Old age pensioners should not be victimised in this fashion.  A son or daughter living with them on that money is only barely surviving and not in a position to contribute much, if anything, to the running of that home.  When old age pensioners have a son or daughter living with them I would like to see their case dealt with on its merits so that they will not be refused free fuel without account being taken of the circumstances in that house. Here we are dealing with the weakest section of the community, the old, the infirm, who have worked hard to rear their families in difficult times and now when they should be able to enjoy a few comforts at the end of their days, because of a ridiculous interpretation of their circumstances by a welfare officer they are refused the free fuel allowance.  Again it goes back to the social welfare officer having his own standard and using his own judgment.</P>
    <P>The winter just ended was the coldest for years and in many cases those people had to remain in bed for most of the day because they could not afford to provide a fire to burn for the whole day.  Are we really serious about poverty?  What will this Bill do for such people?  Let there be no doubt about it, old age pensioners who are not getting the free fuel allowance find if difficult to provide the heat necessary to ensure that they can remain up for the best part of the day and live on the money left after doing that.</P>
    <P>Lest we run away with the idea that poverty is associated totally with people on social welfare allowance, let me talk about working class poverty and families where the husband is on low income and his take home pay is small.  Many families have less than £100 per week to live on and because a member or members are working their gross earnings are taken into account.  In many cases they have no medical card, no free shoes and no perks of any kind and sometimes they pay a high rent to the local authority.  All this causes serious strain and every day of the week one hears men saying that they are going to give up working because they would be better off on the dole.  I say to them that they will not be better off on <Col N="1229" /> the dole; it is degrading and is not in the best interests of the country.  However, there should be some incentive for people to continue in the workforce and get at least some type of recognition for the fact they are working.</P>
    <P>The criteria for the medical card in the last year have been tightened up and that is understandable considering that the health boards and the Department of Health cost so much to run, but where people who are working earn only a small amount over the limit their case should be considered seriously for the allocation of a medical card.  It may mean the difference between a reasonable standard of living and a poor standard of living. Health bills and medical expenses for lower paid workers are causing serious problems and in many cases families are neglecting their health because of the cost of doctors' attendance, prescriptions and chemists' bills.  We should consider seriously the question of allocating the medical card to people in the lower income bracket.  We should change the criterion for the allocation of the medical card from gross pay to net pay.  When taxation and PRSI are taken out of the amount people can become eligible, but because eligibility is based on gross pay they are refused a medical card, which adds to the problems many families face in being poor.</P>
    <P>I presume that the agency will be tackling seriously the area of poverty with regard to low paid workers and poor housing.  People are allocated new homes because of their impoverished situation, but then find it difficult to build up a reasonable standard of housing because of being barely able to provide the necessities of food and clothing, for example, consideration must also be given to education. Those who do not go on to second level school, third level college or university mostly come from poor backgrounds. Drop-outs leave school at 14 and 15 years of age and wander around the city streets and country roads with nowhere to go.  We are disregarding a whole section of young people who, because of their social background, are <Col N="1230" /> not in a position to avail of further educational facilities.  If this agency do nothing else but tackle that problem and come up with some solution, they will be worth-while. They must ensure that those young people are brought back into the educational system, perhaps in a vocational or some type of special school, in order to learn a skill or trade which will be of value to them in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>I seriously question some of the teaching methods used in our primary schools when pupils are leaving school at 14 and 15 years of age unable to read or write. The first things that we learned when we went to school were reading, writing and arithmetic, or sums, but an amazing number are now dropping out of school without those basic essentials.  That is a terrible social disadvantage and a problem to which I should like to see the Minister responding, perhaps on Committee Stage, with proposals to tackle it. Most of these dropouts, but not all, come from poor backgrounds.  We as politicians, regardless of what Government are in power, should look seriously at this subject.  Some type of educational facility must be provided.  It may not be secondary school or third level college, but it should enable those young people to acquire skills such as carpentry, woodwork or metalwork.</P>
    <P>At present there are six months AnCO training courses, but they are not doing the job that I and all other politicians would hope they would, which is to increase skills.  A group of 25 young people started recently on an AnCO scheme.  The first three months were spent being instructed on the best future for them, in carpentry or other areas. During the next three months they tried to learn that particular skill.  Then the six months were up and they were back on the dole queues, more frustrated and disillusioned than ever.  We should be trying to get these people back on an educational course with a view to providing jobs for them.  A number of other speakers on both sides of the House are anxious to speak and they should have an opportunity to debate this very important <Col N="1231" /> agency Bill.  This has been the first such opportunity within the past few years.</P>
    <P>Another area is that of abuse of alcohol, a problem which is inclined to be pushed into the background.  I may be wrong, but I think that alcoholism is causing many social problems within families and leading to serious poverty.  In many cases the husband &mdash; or wife, but almost always the husband &mdash; will spend all the wages or social welfare benefits on drink. Young people should be educated in the dangers of alcoholism and then some effort must be made to solve the problem of alcoholics.  This is a major difficulty. The institutions dealing with these people are mostly in Dublin.  In Stillorgan, the St. John of God Brothers do an exceptional job and we also have Bellmount in Waterford, but people coming from places such as Wexford and other counties do not want to travel such distances and make every excuse for not going. There should be facilities attached to the local hospitals.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and hope that it will go some way towards initiating discussions on ways of combating poverty and towards tackling that serious problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad at least to have the opportunity to put down a marker to come back and speak to this Bill after Question Time.  I welcome the Bill; it has been built on much experience but only of recent times.  It is quite remarkable, in terms of our social policy, that it was not until the Kilkenny Conference on Poverty in 1971 that there was a real focus on the reality that we had poverty in this country and an attempt was made to understand the extent of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is all the more serious because historically there was such tremendous emphasis on our social economy, our social planning.  Papers of all colours and planning programmes were produced but even today we have inherited the need for an agency such as this.  All our economic planning was done without any serious social planning aligned with it.  The economic policies did not take into consideration who would be affected by <Col N="1232" /> economic progress, how it might leave areas, how it might dismantle and change areas beyond recognition, how it might move some people into the upwardly more mobile social scene and condemn others to areas from which there was no escape.  Until 1971 the existence and extent of such poverty and the lack of social planning were never examined. That conference discovered that a quarter of the population of Ireland were poor.  This was after the soaring sixties and into all the promises of the seventies.</P>

      <P>A total sum of £1.2 million is available in 1986 to meet existing commitments and for allocation to new projects under my Department's capital grant scheme.  Due to the large number of grant approvals in 1985, which involved the carry-over of heavy commitments to 1986, it will be possible to assist only a small number of new projects this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amount available for allocation to new projects in 1986 cannot be determined precisely at this stage as it depends <Col N="1233" /> on the level of expenditure on existing commitments in the present year.  The best estimate at present is that a sum of £300,000 will be available for allocation and expenditure on new projects.  Further money may become available later, depending on the trend of expenditure on existing commitments.</P>
    <P>The following grants have been allocated in 1986 to date:</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that the money provided this year is inadequate? In previous years the Taoiseach gave special grants for sports at a later date than the original Estimates.  As the Minister of State will realise, many grant applications have been sent to the Department and several millions of pounds are needed, and that is just for six projects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy about the number of applications which have been made and their validity.  However, the decision to allocate the amount of money awarded to this Vote was taken in the light of budgetary constraints.  I expect to do the best possible with the amount available to me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a separate question. The second part of the Deputy's <Col N="1234" /> question was answered yesterday by the Minister of State with responsibility for sport, Deputy Barrett.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>There seems to be a reluctance on the part of the Department to give grants to community centres with bar facilities.  I know of an application for a grant which was sent to the Department, but although the facility was separate from the bar the application was turned down.  Is that departmental policy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. F. Fahey Mr. F. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Labour if he will give a breakdown of the expenditure of the £2 million provided in the recent budget for youth affairs; and the aspects of the national youth policy which will not be undertaken during 1986 because of financial restraints.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not possible at this stage to give a breakdown of the £2 million provided in the budget as the final allocation of these funds will be decided on the basis of proposals from local youth service boards and voluntary youth organisations towards meeting the objectives of the national youth policy &ldquo;In Partnership With Youth&rdquo;.  The available funds allow for all aspects of the National Youth Service to be undertaken on a phased basis as provided for in the policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. F. Fahey Mr. F. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>As this £2 million is to provide for all aspects of the national youth policy and in view of the fact that the Costello Commission estimated that the total cost of the proposals would be approximately £20 million, would the <Col N="1235" /> Minister consider that the £2 million allocated is totally inadequate and that an expenditure of only £2 million in such a wide area will lead to a great deal of frustration for the people involved in providing youth services?  It would have been better to put this money into existing youth services rather than setting up a further bureaucratic structure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Fahey has a later question about the latter point.  As regards the national youth policy, this is to be phased in and extended over the youth service grant scheme, the local youth service boards, the national programmes and the facilities for youth. That will take a certain amount of time to set up and phase in, but that is the intention.  If the Deputy has followed progress in this matter he will be aware that recommendations have been made with regard to the number of local youth service boards which it was recommended would be set up in 1986.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>

      <P>No, they are not.  In fact I am dissatisfied with the rate of progress we are making in trying to provide an integrated computerised service for the entire National Manpower Service system.  If the Deputy wishes to put down a question I can give him the precise details.  But I should say that the Dublin regional area of the National Manpower Service is on a limited computerised facility. The rest of the entire seven regions are on a manual system which is highly unsatisfactory at present.  We are at the stage of implementing a design and instal programme for computerisation of the entire national system.</P>

      <P>The precise position at present is &mdash; here I am speaking from memory and subject to correction &mdash; that the Department have sought tenders from various consultancy firms following a preliminary survey prepared by a consultancy company setting out the requirements. We are at the final stages in taking a decision as to which consultancy firm will get the contract.  The period of implementation will be at least 12 months from the date of commencement of that contract.</P>

I cannot understand the delay. If one takes the example of a city such as Birmingham, which undertook all of this work ten years ago, it should be remembered that they have a comparable population and I am sure the appropriate programmes could be purchased for very small amounts.</P>

It is my aim to ensure that will not be the case.

      <P>Would the Minister agree, if one is talking about value for money, that CERT seem to stand out in an unbelievably good light, when compared with all of the other agencies in the manpower area?  Has the Minister any comment to make on why that should be so?  I do not have to quote the figures for the other organisations but there is a clear imbalance.  I know that CERT are efficient but there must be a reason why the other agencies need so many personnel &mdash; the National Manpower Service, AnCO, the YEA, whose staff costs are so much greater than those of CERT when viewed in the light of the number of people they train or provide with jobs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of explanations I would offer the Deputy. The first is the belief that small is beautiful which is clearly demonstrated in the management size of the operation.  It is also probably the oldest of all of the manpower training agencies, certainly older than AnCO.  They avail of much of the infrastructure provided by AnCO, particularly with regard to research, computerisation and so on so that some of their normal development costs are carried by AnCO.  It is specific to a particular industry and has developed a degree of trust between the social partners, as represented on their council and the training agencies, including the Department of Education.  I agree with the Deputy that they are a model of cooperation and enthusiasm which, in turn, has generated very good morale among their staff.  Indeed, it is an example that all of the other training agencies could follow.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of claims received under the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act, 1973, by the Employment Appeals Tribunal during 1985 was 7,489; this number is not broken down into categories of workers.  The tribunal dealt with 7,396 claims in 1985. The two figures quoted are not comparable as the cases dealt with by the tribunal in 1985 would include some received in 1984 and would not include others received in the latter part of 1985.  Of the number of claims dealt with by the tribunal in 1985, 6,423 succeeded, 500 failed and 473 were withdrawn before or during the hearings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1244" /> The number of cases of non-compliance with EAT minimum notice awards notified to my Department in 1985, other than through formal claims for payment under the Protection of Employees (Employers' Insolvency) Act, 1984, was 181.  It is the policy of my Department, when notified of such cases, to endeavour first of all to persuade the employers concerned to make the payments, failing which the question of instituting legal proceedings is considered.  Of the 181 cases already mentioned, 33 were settled by direct approach from my Department to the parties involved and six further cases after the initiation of legal action.</P>
    <P>Legal proceedings have been initiated or are under consideration in 119 cases. Of the remaining 23 cases, the employees concerned have been advised in 14 cases to pursue the question of payment further with the representatives of their employers and in nine cases payments of the awards have been made under the Protection of Employees (Employers' Insolvency) Act, 1984, or are being considered.  A total of £2,524,191 was paid to employees whose employers were insolvent under the 1984 Act from the Redundancy and Employers' Insolvency Fund in respect of minimum notice awards in 1985.  The sum would relate partly to employees who were dismissed because of their employers' insolvencies in 1983, on or after 22 October 1983, the operative date of the Act, and 1984 as well as in 1985.</P>

      <P>In the 119 cases in which the courts have become involved, why is there such a long delay?  Can anything be done to speed up that process?  Would the Minister agree that a large number of such cases now get caught up in the legal system, defeating the purpose of the legislation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that the cases which get caught up in the legal system do frustrate the intentions of the Houses of the Oireachtas in terms of the legislation. Part of the reason for the delay in many legal cases is the failure to speedily exchange the necessary information <Col N="1245" /> before a definitive case can be pursued. I am not in a position in respect of the 119 cases to give a collective or detailed explanation of why delays have occurred.</P>

    <P>It is not possible in the case of these funds to provide a breakdown under the headings referred to by the Deputy as they are not allocated on that basis.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Teamwork youth employment scheme is operated by the youth affairs section.  This is a community managed scheme designed to help voluntary organisations provide temporary community based employment for their young people.  Teamwork projects are community/social projects.  Training and enterprise type projects are not eligible under the scheme.  In 1985, £8.5 million was allocated towards the operation of the scheme.  This allowed for the employment of some 3,285 young people on 400 different projects throughout the country.</P>

      <P>While I appreciate the budgetary constraints under which the <Col N="1246" /> Minister operated, I must point out that the expenditure is rather wasteful.  For instance, the employment of full time youth workers is not being financed 100 per cent.

      <P>Will the Minister accept that there is a serious difficulty in regard to youth organisations in that most of their full time officers are spending far too much of their time trying to find their own wages and expenses instead of being involved in pragmatic youth development work?  Will the Minister accept that his Department are causing many youth organisations to spend an inordinate amount of time trying to finance their own people when they should be financed by his Department?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I have received a submission from the trade union concerned raising the question of the application of certain labour legislation in this case.</P>
      <P>From the information available to my Department, there is no evidence that the requirements of the Protection of Employment Act, 1977, have not been complied with in this instance.</P>
      <P>In regard to the European Communities (Safeguarding of Employees' Rights on Transfer of Undertakings) Regulations, 1980, my Department understand that what is involved in this case is the sale of a plant and not the transfer of an undertaking or business to which the regulations would apply.</P>
      <P>If the employees consider there is not a genuine redundancy situation obtaining in relation to proposed dismissals at the plant, they may appeal to the Employment Appeals Tribunal under the Unfair Dismissals Act and the Redundancy Payments Act to establish their rights under those Acts.  However, from the submission made to me, it would seem that the main issues in dispute between the union representing the employees and the firm concerned are the question of extra statutory redundancy payments and the continued employment or re-employment of former employees by the new owners. These are matters for negotiation between the parties concerned.  The conciliation services of the Labour Court and, if necessary, the court itself, are available to assist in such negotiations, if required.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister satisfied that the board of management of Cork Marts-IMP acted properly in this case?  Is the Minister aware that in January 1985 the employees were temporarily laid off with the result that they had used up their unemployment benefit? Will the Minister accept that the procedure adopted in this case was deliberately employed to lay off employees, make them redundant from January 1985, under the impression that it was only a temporary lay-off?  Under the Act they were entitled to a lot more information and consultation about what was happening during 1985.</P>

      <P>I met a deputation of the workers and their union representatives about this matter and, while the law in its letter has been complied with, I am satisfied that the spirit and intention of the law was not adhered to.  However, as the person responsible for administering the law I am confined to the letter and not the spirit of it.  For whatever reason over the last year the workers in the Leixlip plant have been laid off and, as a consequence, have lost some of the entitlements which they would otherwise have if they were being made redundant in the normal course of events.  I expressed that point of view to the trade union representatives and made the resources of my Department fully available to assist them pursue their rights and the rights of the workers they represented within the framwork of the laws we have.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware of the inconsistency which has been apparent in the way in which the Cork group treated the workers at Leixlip over the last couple of years?  Is he aware that some workers received redundancy and were re-employed while others who to all outwards appearances had similar entitlements did not get the same recognition for their case?  Is the Minister aware that some people who were legitimately on sick leave were summarily dismissed while other workers got the benefit of redundancy and a return to work thereafter? Has the Minister a role to play in monitoring such behaviour?</P>

      <P>I should like to thank the Minister for making the full facilities of the Department available to the workers because they require every help if they are to gain their rights.  In connection with the EC regulations safeguarding employees' rights, will the Minister say if in the event of the plant being sold as a going concern the employees' rights have the same value as all other assets and rights in the transfer from one owner to another?  It appears to the workforce that the intention is to continue in beef production and they are anxious to know what rights they will have if the plant after it is sold continues in beef production.  Will the employees have a right to employment there?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has highlighted the ambiguity in regard to the present state of the premises.  People have been temporarily laid off and there is a question as to whether the firm constitutes a going concern.  It is because of this ambiguity that workers who would have an entitlement under the regulations dealing with the transfer of undertakings do not have the same clear entitlements. As can be seen from the questions put to me, and my replies, the case is a complex one.</P>
      <P>My sympathy is unreservedly with the workforce because the spirit of the law has not been adhered to.  I repeat now what I said in private to the deputation which I met that, in so far as possible, all the resources of the Department of Labour will be made available to the workforce to enable them to clarify the position and to obtain their legal rights. Constructive negotiations between both sides is required and the services of the Labour Court, either the conciliation services or the court itself, are available to resolve a dispute which has gone on for a long time.</P>

Having said that and putting him in good humour, perhaps he will now answer my question.  The Minister said that he will be looking at Dún Laoghaire in the overall context of the national youth policy.  Dún Laoghaire seems to be regarded as a backwater in the sense that while it is part of County Dublin it is not given proper recognition as part of that entity.  I ask the Minister not to overlook Dún Laoghaire because it is often treated in an offhand fashion.  We are not second class citizens in Dún Laoghaire and we should get the recognition we deserve.

      <P>&ldquo;In Partnership with Youth&rdquo; recognises that the development of projects such as those taking place under the youth service project operating in Dún Laoghaire was a key strategy for the development of local youth service boards.  The previous Minister of State accepted that County Dublin, for the purposes of the establishment of local youth service boards, should include the administrative area of the Corporation of Dún Laoghaire.  They were also prepared to consider the needs of Bray Urban Council district in that context.  A very active VEC in Dún Laoghaire submitted a detailed recommendation for their consideration to be set up as a local youth service board.  Dún Laoghaire Corporation have already passed a formal motion to that effect which is in my Department.  From an initial examination of these detailed proposals, it appears as if the criteria set out in chapter 4 of the youth policy for the establishment and operation of local youth service boards has been satisfied by Dún Laoghaire Corporation. I am not in a position to make a definitive statement today but, from the information in the Department, these matters will certainly be taken into account.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Labour the numbers at present unemployed in County Louth who were at some stage during the last three years employed on the temporary employment scheme operated by his Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Labour the numbers at present employed on various temporary employment schemes operated by his Department in County Louth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13 and 22 together.  At present in County Louth 127 persons are participating in the work experience <Col N="1261" /> programme; 284 in the enterprise allowance scheme and 48 in the teamwork scheme.  As statistics relating to the social employment scheme and employment incentive scheme are at present compiled on the basis of the National Manpower Service regions, it is not possible to provide details in respect of individual counties. In the north-east region, which includes Counties Louth, Cavan and Monaghan, 487 persons are participating in the social employment scheme and 225 under the employment incentive scheme.</P>
      <P>My Department are not in a position to monitor the employment or unemployment history of persons who have participated in temporary employment schemes.  While the information which would be obtained from such monitoring would be of some interest, the cost, in terms of overall resources would be more than the use value of the information received.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>In a case where this scheme cannot be operated under the terms as laid down, would the Minister consider diverting whatever funds had been allocated to some other scheme to get over this <i>impasse</i>?  Would the Minister consider this as a device for getting around the impossible position in which a certain local authority finds itself?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In respect of any of the Manpower intervention schemes which provide employment under different categories, I am constrained by regulations and such flexibility as is built into the regulations is fully availed of by my Department.  In addition, between the various subheads that make up the Manpower section, I intend to ensure that we get maximum value for money.  If there is an underspending under one subhead as against another in Manpower services it is my intention, subject to the agreement of the Minister for Finance who also has a statutory role in this, to ensure that we get the money.  If the latter part of the Deputy's question refers to the continued refusal or inability of Dublin Corporation, because of lack of trade union co-operation, I regret to say, to <Col N="1262" /> avail of the social employment scheme, it means that he is requesting me to make some kind of block grant equivalent to the kind of moneys which on a <i>pro rata</i> Dublin Corporation get relative to other authorities, a sum of approximately £1 million, I regret that I am not in a position to do so.  I ask the Deputy to use his position in Dublin City Council to ensure that management and the trade unions agree to operate within the SES to see if there is some way, now that spring is with us, to provide up to 1,000 jobs for unemployed people in the Dublin area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I should dearly like to see that happen.  If the Minister could find some way of allocating the money to the local authority, there would be no difficulty in providing 1,000 jobs but, for some ulterior motive, the trade union movement will not allow the scheme to operate in Dublin Corporation so the matter is beyond the Minister, the management or myself.  Because the position is peculiar and arises through no fault of the majority in the City Council, would the Minister consider taking the matter back to Cabinet for the purpose of trying to have a block grant sanctioned for Dublin Corporation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the sense of frustration the Deputy experiences in Dublin Corporation regarding this matter.  Like every other Deputy, each week when he holds his clinic he is being requested to provide employment for people while he is aware that the corporation are not in a position to provide up to at least 1,000 jobs.  The Deputy was an office holder during a previous administration so he may be aware that experience has shown that a block grant to a local authority is not the most effective way of providing employment.  If that were the most effective way of dealing with the matter it would be much easier administratively for us in the Department.  The resolution of the problem lies with the management of Dublin Corporation, with the elected members of the corporation and with the <Col N="1263" /> trade unions representing workers in Dublin Corporation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. J. Leonard Mr. J. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the reason for having figures available on a regional rather than a county basis when in that social employment scheme there is an element in respect of materials for sidelining roads and so on which would have to be allocated on a county basis?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy and I have given instructions that the information be made available on a county basis so that we may compare county with county.  Regrettably the information which I had to give the House today was uneven in that some of it was in the form of county by county and some related to regions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. J. Leonard Mr. J. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that if we were to consider the figures on a county basis we would find that some counties have not been as effective as others in implementing the scheme and are getting off very lightly on the coat-tails of someone else?</P>

      <P>Do the COMTEC committees cover all the State agencies involved in this area?  I have been putting forward the argument that for the scheme to be successful the COMTECs should be given a defined area with all the State agencies working together to tackle the unemployment problem in that area. Otherwise, we will continue to have duplication.  Is this procedure being adopted in the matter of the pilot projects?</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Labour if he intends to take any action to deal with the high level of accidents on construction sites, which between 1980 and 1985 resulted in 52 deaths and more than 3,000 injuries; if he has any plans to extend the provisions of the Safety in Industry Act, 1980, to cover construction sites; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Building operations and works of engineering construction are subject to many of the relevant provisions of the Safety in Industry Acts, 1955 and 1980, including those relating to general safety concerning chains, ropes and lifting tackle, cranes and other lifting machines, sanitary and welfare provisions and so on.  These operations are also subject to the detailed comprehensive provisions of the Construction (Safety, Health and Welfare) Regulations, 1975.  When the Deputy refers to the extension of the provisions of the Safety in Industry Act, 1980, to construction sites, I presume that what he has in mind is the extension of the provisions of Part III of the Act concerning safety consultation at the workplace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this regard and, indeed, in relation to occupational safety and health in general at all work places, I would point out that I am developing comprehensive legislative proposals based on the recommendations of the Commission of Inquiry on Safety, Health and Welfare at Work &mdash; the Barrington Commission.  These proposals will include, <i>inter alia,</i> provisions relating to the establishment of a consultative mechanism at each workplace to give workers an input into decisions about their working environment. In the meantime, I do not consider it appropriate to amend the Safety in <Col N="1267" /> Industry Acts to extend to the construction industry their provisions concerning safety consultation having regard to the fact that the inflexible provisions of those Acts relating to worker consultation were strongly criticised by the Barrington Commission.</P>
    <P>The annual level of accidents both fatal and non-fatal is, indeed, a cause for concern. The annual figures show that the standards of safety in construction work are clearly unacceptable and that greater effort is needed to improve matters.  One of the most disconcerting aspects of the situation is the similarity of causation from year to year.  Attitudes to safety by employers, management and workers must change if the present undesirable rate of accidents is to improve.  In this regard, the fullest co-operation of all is essential in the establishment and operation of safe systems of work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear the Minister say he is considering legislation on the proposals in the Barrington Commission report but I take it he is aware that last year there were 11 deaths on construction sites.  Is he aware that this high level of deaths concerned construction workers so much that recently a delegation from Moneypoint came to Dublin on a day's protest about accidents on their site?  They referred to the record of the Minister in regard to safety on construction sites as abysmal.  Will the Minister ensure, either under the Safety in Industry Act or any other legislation, that safety officers have a statutory right to enter construction sites to make certain that safety regulations covered by legislation are being implemented?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I met the deputation from Moneypoint who came here on a day's protest highlighting the difficulties they have experienced and the enormous range of accidents that have occurred.  I undertook to meet them with the representatives from the construction industry committee of the ICTU.  I have received correspondence from the secretary of that committee and a date has <Col N="1268" /> been set for a meeting.  Everybody accepts that the existing legislation covering safety in industry is inadequate.  It covers only 20 per cent of the workforce. The proposals of Barrington, which I am pleased to say were cleared at Cabinet today and will now go to the parliamentary draftsman, will extend it to 100 per cent of the workforce.  This will provide a framework for the sort of safety system we require and which we can afford.</P>
      <P>I am not in a position to say if on a general basis a safety officer can go into a construction site.  I have not the information directly to hand but I will try to get it for the Deputy.  As I indicated in my reply, safety regulations concern only some general aspects of operations on construction sites, not their entirety.  It was this unsatisfactory aspect which was brought to my attention by the deputation. The extension of the 1980 Safety in Industry Act, with all the rigidities denounced by Barrington, has been considered by me and my Department.  We are not proposing to go down that road but to proceed full steam ahead with the Barrington proposals.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>As we become an increasingly industrialised society, handling complex and dangerous processes, we have to instil by way of education and persuasion a responsible attitude among workers and managers towards their own safety.  It cannot be imposed from outside. The cost of conscientiously supervising such a regime would be prohibitive and not necessarily as effective as the personal assumption of responsibility for safety.  That was the fundamental principle of Barrington's recommendations. In order for people to exercise their rights to look after themselves and to take due precautions, there has to be a framework within which they have the right to have <Col N="1269" /> safety committees with workers' representatives. They also need access to information and the right of inspection where that is appropriate.  The steps we have taken to date, which have the full support of both sides of industry, are the right steps.  I welcome the concern expressed by the Deputy and I propose to proceed to implement the legislation in 1986.</P>

In the case of alleged misuse of funds within the Manpower Service referred to in the examination, an officer <Col N="1270" /> of the Department has been charged in the courts.

      <P>The social employment scheme was developed to enable the large numbers of productive and energetic persons over 25 years who have been unemployed for a year or more to obtain employment and to make a worthwhile contribution to the social development of their community at a reasonable cost to the Exchequer.</P>

      <P>In my county, Monaghan, we set ourselves to avail of that scheme in February 1985.  We carried out an assessment and estimated that about 600 people could be usefully employed on road construction, drainage, waterworks etc.  The takeup was only about 160.  In areas such as those, where only 10 per <Col N="1271" /> cent of the workforce can be under 25, would it not be possible to allow some leeway in order to increase the number under 25?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I recognise the Deputy's concern in this matter.  He has previously put down questions of a similar kind.  I am looking at proposals to change the conditions of eligibility for access to the social employment scheme to deal with the question of some people who are under the age of 25 and have, tragically, been unemployed for longer than a year. The other aspect of the Deputy's supplementary question is of interest.  There are well over 200 people over the age of 25 unemployed in the areas which the Deputy represents.  It is interesting that the take-up relative to the official numbers of people unemployed has been very small.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been advised that the IDA inform all new overseas grant-assisted companies establishing plants in Ireland about the industrial relations practices <Col N="1274" /> and procedures in this country.  In addition, promoters are put in contact with relevant organisations and State agencies. The IDA also monitor all aspects of the development of new overseas firms, including their industrial relations progress, on an ongoing basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that it is vitally important, now that it is so difficult to attract major industry to put substantial investment into this country, that the industrial relations models in our large firms controlled by foreign firms live up to a high standard? Is the Minister happy that we have a monitoring process which ensures that difficulties are not allowed to fester under the surface?  Many of these firms are part of multinational corporations in the US who regularly assess where to invest. These companies take industrial relations into account when assessing whether or not to invest.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the Deputy's concern about attracting industries here because we need a level of investment from abroad.  My Department strive at all times to ensure that the IDA are fully acquainted with industrial relations on the ground.  There has been a general improvement in industrial relations here in the past three to four years.  That improvement may not necessarily improve the perception among some people who come from some sectors of the world and start off with an enormous prejudice against trade unions of every kind.  It is our intention to ensure that any firm which establishes here will comply with the norms and regulations involved in good industrial practice. Good industrial practice here is first and foremost the recognition of trade unions <Col N="1275" /> and the establishment of proper consultative procedures with them.  If the Deputy is referring to a particular instance or firm that may have doubts about establishing here I will be happy to be of direct assistance to him in that instance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>From my experience it appears that industrial relations are better in a firm which establishes here and follows proper procedure if there is only one union involved.  It would be unhelpful to say to which firm I refer specifically in this House but there is one or possibly two cases of highly successful firms who have indicated privately their concern not with the economic conditions here or with law and order but about industrial relations and how they are run by certain trade unions.  I will take up the case to which I am referring privately with the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Deputy's concern.  I, too, as well as the Congress of Trade Unions share the view that there are far too many trade unions here, but it is for the trade unions to put their house in order.  Congress have established a committee to try to bring about mergers. I would remind Congress and the House that unique among western countries, we have a very generous set of provisions in the 1975 Trade Union Act that will provide financial assistance to trade unions who wish to merge their undertakings so as to achieve the rationalisation necessary in the industrial relations field.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Labour if he intends to amend the legislation regarding the amalgamation of trade unions to give better incentives to trade unions to cover the substantial costs involved in this matter, and by so doing to improve the overall structure of the trade union movement.</P>

      <P>As stated in the discussion document on industrial relations reform <Col N="1276" /> published in March 1985, it is the intention to introduce changes in the provisions of the Trade Union Act, 1975, in order to improve the scheme of grants payable for expenses incurred in connection with amalgamations or transfers of engagements between trade unions.  I would point out that payments have been made which have facilitated a number of amalgamations and thereby contributed to trade union rationalisation.  I am conscious, however, that there is room for further improvement in this area and I intend to include amending legislation as part of the overall package on the reform of industrial relations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>This ties in with the first question.  It is important that the incentives be set out.  Some of the trade union leaders would say that the problem is that, while the incentives are there, they are only paid if the amalgamation is successful and at the final stage.  Because the trade union movement too are suffering from the recession, they are not tempted to amalgamate in those circumstances. As long as we continue to have a large number of trade unions we will continue to be unattractive and to have major difficulties in the negotiating process. There are a number of amalgamations which trade union leaders would consider if the package were more attractive and these amalgamations would pay for themselves in the economy.  Will the Government consider paying in advance, or even paying for surveys to assist or force the trade union movement to take chances which they are not otherwise prepared to take?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The 1975 Act will be amended in the context of the reform of industrial relations legislation which I will shortly bring before this House.  I published a set of proposals dealing with reform of the trade dispute law, and the reform of the trade union industrial relations institutions and I outlined proposals designed to give effect to the points raised by Deputy Ahern.  Those points must be seen as part of an integrated whole and <Col N="1277" /> their enactment can only come about in a comprehensive and integrated way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister at least encourage Congress in this area and make them fully aware that he is favourable and sympathetic to any amalgamations? This could be a major factor in attracting investment here.  There is a perception among many of the trade union leadership that neither the Government nor the Opposition have been particularly helpful because the provisions made do not stand up to examination. They are a disincentive in many cases to putting in very substantial funds and &mdash; it may never happen &mdash; are the Government prepared to pay anything towards a union who attempt to amalgamate with a smaller union but fail to do so?  It is a costly business as the Minister knows.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I have informed the trade unions directly, but I welcome the opportunity to do so again formally and put it on the record of the House that considerable financial assistance covering all the incurred costs, properly audited, which occur if there is a successful amalgamation of trade unions can be paid for in full through my Vote through the Oireachtas. Those costs can include harmonisation of pension provisions for officials moving from one union situation to another, terms which are considerably generous. There are defects, and I accept that a defect is that at present under the 1975 Act they can be made available only after the successful completion of an amalgamation. Clearly there would have to be safeguards regarding contrived negotiations, but I take the point and I join with Deputy Ahern in encouraging those trade unions currently contemplating amalgamation and so on to proceed with negotiations on the basis that any amalgamation that now takes place from January 1986 will benefit from any reforms that will take place in the 1975 legislation. I give that undertaking now to Deputy Ahern.  Therefore, at this stage there should be no impediment whatsoever in terms of cost to trade unions opening up discussions between themselves about <Col N="1278" /> possibilities of rationalisation and mergers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Labour if he will consider making a secret ballot mandatory for positions on executives of trade unions when bringing legislation to the House on industrial relations reform.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Trade unions in Ireland are not strangers either to secret membership ballots or to delegate conference votes by secret ballot.  The proposals for reform of trade dispute law which were published recently do not suggest that provision for uniform mandatory secret ballots in elections for the executives of unions be enacted in civil law.  No case for the introduction of a uniform statutory procedure has been made to me by trade union representatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I am trying to make is that on a number of occasions recently at union deputations and at senior levels in the trade union movement &mdash; not to name any because this business is current &mdash; it was pointed out that very small minority groups with minority views can create a great deal of disruption within the trade union movement and elections are carried on tiny minorities. While it may be a case of people organising their own branch meetings, the argument can be put forward that executives could by secret ballot try to obtain a better vote at their various branches.  Frequently about 1 or 2 per cent of paid up membership of a branch elect the national executive.  If that can be followed through to any other body it could be of great concern.  People do not like to say too much about it but it is no secret that a number of unions have not perhaps been manipulated but have small groups within them of inordinate strength because of the present system of voting privately.  This should be examined because it is very important that we have a strong, democratic movement representative of workers and workers' <Col N="1279" /> rights and not necessarily of any other rights.  There is a case for the examination of trade union law with the whole process and means of organising trade unions being looked at.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>It should be looked at to see how executives can be elected more democratically than at present.  The Minister knows that I was one of the people who was elected at a very early age through that system and I know exactly how to manipulate it.  Mainly because of that I believe it is a false system.  It is possible at the moment to be elected to one of the biggest executives on 1 per cent of the vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a fundamental principle in any democratic system, irrespective of what the organisation or institution may be, that in order to get a true reflection of opinion there should be the maximum valid poll possible.  In so far as postal or secret ballots of all the membership in a branch or in an entire union for elected positions in the executive would enhance or bring that position about, I would support it.  However, the trade unions are voluntary, free associations and they have a right within the framework of the law to regulate and organise their own affairs.  That said, because the trade unions as established bodies receive, properly in my view, the recognition that they do from this and previous Governments and because they are an institutionalised part of the social partnership, it is incumbent upon them, as it is on every other section that participates in the democratic system, to ensure that democratic standards are maintained at the highest possible level.</P>

      <P>I accept what the Minister is saying, but I am thinking of the last three or four months and the power of the trade union movement &mdash; which people like to see.  Therefore, the Government may have to negotiate &mdash; I <Col N="1280" /> am concerned as much about Governments of the future as about the present Government &mdash; on behalf of the Irish people with groups who represent in theory millions of workers but in practice maybe only 1 or 2 per cent of those people, as happens at present.  I am not afraid to say that at most of the branch meetings that take place on behalf of the major unions about 2 or 3 per cent are all who vote and if they get more than 5 per cent they are pleasantly surprised. The results thrown up by that are not a coincidence.  You can look wherever you like, at the committee of the ICTU, the transport union or any of the unions&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Title>Combat Poverty Agency Bill, 1985 [Seanad]: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the debate was adjourned I commented on the fact that little or nothing was done with regard to either research into or examination of the extent of poverty in Ireland until the Kilkenny conference on poverty in 1981 from which emerged the fact that the astonishing figure of a quarter of a million of the population were poor.  While certain pilot programmes regarding poverty were set up here and research was done into the subject, the same activity was being undertaken at European level and member countries received funding towards this end.  A great deal was done in this area in both the EC programmes and the Irish programmes in pilot schemes between 1976 and the end of 1980.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will be brief on this subject today because this is merely welcoming the Bill and establishing its principle and I welcome it because at that stage the national committee recommended the establishment of such an agency as this Bill is introducing.  If we sensed a lack of urgency, of seriousness, or that the situation was improving during those years, the EC Commission's final report on the poverty programme showed that Ireland had the highest level of poverty within the EC as it was then constituted; 23.1 per cent of households in Ireland were below the poverty line.  The report showed also that the national net income in Ireland then was only 64.5 per cent of the EC average.  That made the situation even worse.  Relatively the poor in our country were even poorer because of our lower national income average.  With the difficult times we were coming through <Col N="1299" /> the poor were even poorer because of the lower national income and with the high levels of unemployment.  We are setting up the agency and the principles and the functions outlined are to be welcomed.  I hope that not alone will those principles and functions be implemented but that progress will also be made.</P>
    <P>I started off by saying that part of the problem was lack of knowledge and appreciation of poverty.  Even more important is the alleviation and removal of it.  In the fifties and sixties when we had strong economic programmes we did not align them with social planning.  No economic programme should ever be introduced without the social implications being spelled out alongside it.  If that were a statutory requirement for Government I could not put it strongly enough.  The social victims of some of our economic planning are examples of what I am talking about.  The agency should advise and make recommendations to the Minister on all aspects of economic and social planning in relation to poverty. They should also initiate measures aimed at overcoming poverty and evaluate such measures.</P>
    <P>Some speakers who have already contributed questioned whether or not we need any more research.  One of the principal functions of the agency will be to examine the nature, causes and extent of poverty.  For that purpose the promotion and interpretation of research is needed.  Some speakers feel that enough research has been done as to the extent of poverty.  That may be the case but there has not been enough research with regard to effectively removing poverty.  I was reminded of that very forcibly ten years after the first Kilkenny conference on poverty in 1971.  A second one was held in 1981.  Unfortunately not alone was there not much progress made with regard to the removal of poverty during that ten year period, but we were biting into a very hard and long recession.  Some attitudes towards unemployment had not only become less enlightened but had actually hardened.  One good thing that came from the fact that people were <Col N="1300" /> working actively within the areas of poverty was the knowledge that perhaps research was necessary to look at the various systems for relieving poverty. Most systems only relieve poverty and do not remove it.  Within those areas and within the budget which we can afford, there should be a far more effective use of it.</P>
    <P>Many Members spoke about the different levels of social welfare.  I do not intend to take up the time of the House on this because we also have a Social Welfare Bill in which it will be addressed. A report is eagerly awaited from the Commission on Social Welfare.  One could go through every category within the social welfare system and see that it is not alone not contributing towards the removal of poverty but it is also adding to the humiliation and lack of self-esteem which people who are caught within the social welfare system have to suffer.</P>
    <P>One point which I hope we will discuss in a more constructive way when the commission submit their report is that, because of the patchwork assembling of it decade after decade, and trying to cope with vulnerable sections that emerged throughout the seventies, we have no coherent programme.  The report from the National Economic and Social Council of January 1985 entitled <i>Economic and Social Policy Assessment</i> highlighted what I am talking about.  It states:</P>
    <P>Poverty traps essentially result from the lack of co-ordination of the ways in which benefits are withdrawn and taxes are imposed.</P>
    <P>The whole trust of that report is that not alone do we have to look at the social welfare system but also at the whole tax system.  One is totally interlocked with the other.</P>
    <P>A term which was developed in Britain in the early seventies was that people were caught in the poverty trap.  That term has become so familiar to us now that we feel it has been with us much longer.  Not alone did the patchwork building-up of the social welfare system and the lack of reform within the tax <Col N="1301" /> system lead to poverty, but it also led to a lack of co-ordination.  Much of this comes about because we have spread it around through several Departments and agencies to the extent that there is sometimes duplication.  The result is that the very people who need help do not get it. I hope the commission will look into this area.</P>
    <P>Another term coined since the early seventies is the unemployment trap.  By getting into a work situation families lose heavily.  People may use one benefit from the social welfare system as a marker for so many other benefits.  The one that comes to mind is the medical card.  We should look at the area of giving eligibility benefits through the medical card.  It is almost seen as a passport to many other areas of support systems such as free school transport.  It is used almost as a credit card.  The means test is so stringent that nobody will rip it off.  Within this poverty trap there is a valley in which thousands of people are caught and in which there is a total cut-off.  Many things are eligible within a very narrow margin in the social welfare system.  Fear and insecurity must be the most terrible experiences for people in the social welfare system.  Without co-ordination we are not even beginning to approach the problem.  Research and models from other countries must be used in this regard.</P>
    <P>We employ arbitrary methods which do not apply to the real circumstances in which people find themselves. We have a very high dependency level of very young and elderly in our population and, instead of trying to make these a priority, we still marginalise them, particularly the elderly.  There must be more compassion and humanity shown in these cases.  If one has an non-contributory pension one is eligible for certain items such as free telephone rental, a certain amount of free electricity and perhaps free fuel.  These are basic lifelines for older people &mdash; the difference between life and death.</P>
    <P>I would mention the case of a widow of a bank manager or some other person who died young and whose pension was <Col N="1302" /> not all that high but seemed at the time to have been a pretty good and secure pension to live on.  Inflation, thankfully, has come down, but, with the huge change in prices, we are not talking about the same economic background as, for example, in the sixties.  I know of people living alone for whom a telephone is a necessity because they may be at risk from a health point of view.  The only way in which they have the security of getting help is by telephone.  The telephone rental is prohibitive for people on a low income.  The agency must see that we use our whole economic strength as effectively as possible based on need, not on arbitrary categories which place people inside or outside eligibility, regardless of their real day-to-day situation. We must use a much broader and more humane method than this.  I hope that the research facilities available to the agency will concentrate on that whole area from the beginning.</P>
    <P>It is not that we are not spending money.  We spend a large part of our GNP on social welfare, <i>per capita</i> even higher than in the UK, which is considered the ultimate welfare state.  We have to examine how effectively we direct that money to those who need it most and how much is spent on duplication in needless bureaucracy and overcategorisation. I shall give a practical example of how money can be more effectively used and saved.  At the 1981 Conference on Poverty, one of my most lasting memories was of a report given by Nóirín Kearney. Many people in this House will know that she has been involved for many years in the whole area of research into and statistics of poverty.  She decided for that conference to discard the practice of giving cold statistics, which we hear and forget, and instead gave a practical example of how in combating poverty we were not using what was available to us as effectively and as humanely as we should.</P>
    <P>She quoted the case of a family caught in the poverty trap.  The children, because of lack of nutrition, were far more open to all kinds of disease.  Depending on which disease they caught, or which doctor they attended, they were sent to <Col N="1303" /> different hospitals within the city.  The mother had to take them to these different hospitals at great cost in time and expense.  It was also discovered that a file on the child's health was never sent from one hospital to another, so a new file had to be set up in each hospital, without any continuity in the record of the health history of the child.  A great number of drugs, including antibiotics, had to be used consistently by the family because malnutrition had made that the only way of coping with keeping the children in good health.  This was costly at every level.</P>
    <P>The mother was under severe pressure and was kept going on a day-to-day basis by drugs and sedation.  When Nóirín Kearney added up the cost to the State and to that family, she discovered that this was not the most central, effective and humane way of dealing with this problem.  It was costing everybody &mdash; certainly the family &mdash; more expense than if they had been given enough of a basic income to buy good food, keep themselves warm and protect themselves from the costly health hazards that they were running into.  That is what this agency must be about.</P>
    <P>I could not talk on a Combat Poverty Bill without mentioning the ritual humiliation and guilt that we build up in people who are forced on to the social welfare system.  These must be removed, or we cannot live with ourselves as a society. As Senator Michael Higgins has already said, we cannot base our welfare system or our whole society on compassion or aid.  We must build them on justice.  Until this agency comes into being and the social welfare system has been reformed, we cannot begin to see the measures that we would all hope to see implemented in cases that we as public representatives come across daily.</P>
    <P>I am glad that section 5 states that the agency will have the duty of submitting periodic strategic plans for the Minister's approval and also that a report of such reviews will be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.  We must all take collective responsibility as legislators and as <Col N="1304" /> Members of the two Houses which pass the budget for each year.  We must be in the vanguard in trying to bring about changes in our society.</P>
    <P>It has often been repeated that we cannot talk about removing from our society poverty, inequality and discrimination, low esteem and snobbery, privilege and perks unless we fundamentally want to change society.  That will be painful and difficult for those who have the perks and privileges at the moment.  However, if we have any sense of common justice, we must do that.  Every family unit and every person must feel that they have a right to a basic income, regardless of what work ethic is being exercised.  When we talk about work we must acknowledge that it is very unequal with regard to its reward in status and in income.</P>
    <P>Even the words &ldquo;salary&rdquo; and &ldquo;wages&rdquo; have connotations of skilled and unskilled, of status and lack of status.  I remember getting statistics about how Sweden had managed to achieve the type of democracy, equality and lack of discrimination of which they could be proud. In passing, I wish to record my sadness and shock at the assassination of an architect of social democracy, Olaf Palme. Sweden brought about the social planning which was needed by ensuring that all work was regarded as it met the needs of the community.  This meant that somebody who collected rubbish was considered to be performing a service which was at least as important, and much more valuable, than that provided by an engineer building a bridge.  This meant that that person was rewarded in status and in salary.  They also ensured that nobody's wages were more than two or three times that of another's.  It is some years since I got those statistics but at that time in Ireland the gap between the top salary and the lowest wage was 16 times.  Can we live in a country which designates a job as being 16 times more important and more highly rewarded than others?  When we look at some of these low paid jobs we see that they are among the most demanding, repetitive, physically exhausting and valuable to the community. That is the type of fact which I should <Col N="1305" /> like to see the agency and the legislators taking into account.  We should discard these built-in inequalities in our society.</P>
    <P>We know from history that as a nation we had little or nothing.  We were denied an education and the right to possess land.  We were even denied the right to improve our houses.  One would think, with that experience of deprivation, discrimination and inequality, that when we set up a State we would have ensured that we did not make the same mistakes and that we would not build in certain privileges which would once again result in deprivation, discrimination and inequality.  It is a matter of sadness to me that we have allowed 60 years of that type of inequality to continue and that, in a Christian sense, we can even seek to justify it.</P>
    <P>A quarter of our population are poor and have no control over their lives because they are in the social welfare net. Now with all the knowledge we have acquired from painful experience &mdash; lack of jobs, a change in employment and security &mdash; we should use all this information positively, not selfishly, and we should ensure that we do not hurt once again the victims of the last decade.</P>
    <P>The pilot schemes and the poverty conferences on which this Bill is based have shown that we have poor, that we have poverty traps, and that the real victims continue to be women and children.  I will not delay the House further by going into this in more detail, but the agency must concentrate on this area and, for the first time, set up structures to ensure that this position will not continue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>While I welcome this Bill and share my colleagues' concern with the level of poverty in the country, nevertheless I have some reservations.  I do not understand why this Bill is before us, because it appears that everything in it was in the legislation passed by this House in 1982 &mdash; The National Development Community Agency Act.  For example, the principle functions of this Bill are:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1306" /> (a)  to advise and make recommendations to the Minister on all aspects of economic and social planning in relation to poverty in the State;</P>
    <P>(b)  the initiation of measures aimed at overcoming poverty in the State and the evaluation of such measures;</P>
    <P>(c)  the examination of the nature, causes and extent of poverty in the State and for that purpose the promotion, commission and interpretation of research;</P>
    <P>(d)  the promotion of greater public understanding of the nature, causes and extent of poverty in the State and the measures necessary to overcome such poverty.</P>
    <P>The functions of the National Community Development Agency, as set up in 1982, are to advise the Minister and to make recommendations to him regarding community development policies and community development programmes in relation to self-help, poverty and social services; to promote and to co-ordinate programmes in relation to self-help, poverty and social deprivation; to ascertain and to specify communities in which there is a high degree of poverty and social deprivation; to foster and assist, financially and materially projects of community involvement and activity; to advise the Minister on the social aspects of economic and social planning; to advise the Minister on the development and community based services, including in particular improved training and supply of community development staff; to draw on and evaluate research on self-help, poverty and social deprivation, and so on.</P>
    <P>I do not understand why it was necessary to dismantle the 1982 Act and then to delay so long in bringing this Bill before the House.  In their joint programme the Government stated that an anti-poverty plan would be drawn up and implemented within the context of national economic and social planning, concentrating on a more just distribution of wealth, income and power.  We will <Col N="1307" /> not see anything implemented in the lifetime of this Government.  That programme was published in December 1982 and now, three and a half years later, we have not even got the Combat Poverty Agency set up.  It is obvious that we will not be able to implement the legislation before this Government's term of office is complete.</P>
    <P>What I find particularly disappointing is that the National Community Development Agency which would have fulfilled the functions of this Bill &mdash; even if the Minister at the time had reservations about it &mdash; were not afforded an opportunity of operating and proving themselves. That legislation was repealed without ever having been implemented. A council was established, headed by Joe McGough, £2 million having been allocated by the then Fianna Fáil Government, but the agency was never allowed to operate.  Why was that agency not given a chance of operating?  If the Minister was not satisfied, he could have come back to the House in, say, six months, a year or two years and said: &ldquo;I am not satisfied with the way that agency is working. We will have to have a special combat poverty Bill&rdquo;.  The Minister did not do so.  Valuable time has been lost in the last three years when we have not had the benefit of any agency working in this area.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in introducing this Bill, told us that one of the main advantages in setting up the Combat Poverty Agency is that that agency will provide a forum for the examination of Government policies and those of other agencies and organisations.  I would have thought that this House was an excellent forum. Indeed, it has been used by Members on all sides to examine Government policies, to comment on them, sometimes in praise of them and, others, critical of them but, hopefully, objectively.  Therefore, I do not think it necessary to implement the provisions of this Bill just to create a forum through which Government policies can be critically examined. There was nothing in the Minister's introductory remarks to suggest there was <Col N="1308" /> anything that could not be undertaken by the National Community Development Agency.  That is a matter of disappointment.</P>
    <P>While there is nothing in the Bill about funding, the Minister did tell us that, in respect of the new pilot projects, the EC would be allocating £1.3 million and our Government another £1 million, making a total of £2.3 million.  It is important that those funds should be used to alleviate poverty, that they should not be used on administration or in the creation of another layer of bureaucracy.  It is my opinion that we have sufficient information on poverty at present.  The biggest problem is that we are not doing anything about the poverty of which we are aware or, while we may be doing something, certainly we are not doing sufficient.  I am not sure that we need another agency at present to assess the level of poverty. Any Member of this House has only to move around his or her constituency to see poverty all around them.  Many reports have been published, including one by the Society of St. Vincent de Paul who have been involved in the alleviation of poverty for many years.  They published a document &mdash; Towards a National Social Policy &mdash; which I have no doubt is available to the Minister's Department and contains valuable information on how poverty might be alleviated.</P>
    <P>The Minister told us also that she looked forward to the receipt of the Report of the Commission on Social Welfare. We all await that report which hopefully will contain some radical recommendations for the improvement of our present system.  When the Minister's predecessor introduced the National Social Service Board legislation in January 1984 I was of the opinion that he had at least a preliminary report from the Commission on Social Welfare containing their recommendations on what should be incorporated in the legislation setting up the Combat Poverty Agency. When replying the Minister might clarify that matter.</P>
    <P>The first European Community programme on poverty stressed the need for more statistics with regard to poverty <Col N="1309" /> and additional monitoring of what was happening.  I wonder about our statistics. There must be an accumulation of facts and figures pointing out the areas of greatest need in relation to poverty here, bearing in mind the many reports that have been prepared by all sorts of agencies, statutory agencies such as the National Economic and Social Council and the various voluntary areas.  The European Community programme highlighted the lack of co-ordination between the various European countries, something which should be rectified in the context of the new programme.  That study carried out on European poverty estimated that there were 30 million people in Europe below an acceptable level of living standard.</P>
    <P>Of course if somebody is socially disadvantaged, this tends to become cumulative. If they are socially disadvantaged in one area they tend to be socially disadvantaged in all others.  For example, if they are socially disadvantaged by way of income, they do not perhaps avail of the educational opportunities or of the health services in the same way as other members of the community.  Generally such people are accommodated in inadequate housing and are socially more isolated. In terms of real or absolute poverty we would all accept at present that there is an increasing number of people experiencing an unacceptable level of hardship in society.  The effects of social disadvantage are cumulative.  In terms of social disadvantage, while income is probably the most easily measured, there are other areas also, for example, education.  The last European programme on poverty highlighted the position of people who were illiterate, the disadvantages suffered by the physically and mentally handicapped in terms of education, and unqualified school leavers who experence much greater difficulty in finding a job.</P>
    <P>It is well recognised that the socially disadvantaged do not avail of the health services to the same extent as other members of the community.  This is as true here as in any other country, particularly in urban and inner city are as and also <Col N="1310" /> in the more remote rural areas.  Examples would be the mother and child scheme which is absolutely essential to the welfare of mother and child and the immunisation programmes which are not availed of to the same extent by those in the poverty trap.</P>
    <P>The same applies in relation to housing. While we all in this House recognise that an increasing number of people are experiencing an unacceptable level of hardship, a question we could legitimately pose is: how do we respond?  How do the Government respond?  For example, since the New Year, we have experienced the coldest winter since 1947.  I should like to know if the Minister gave any directions to the health boards or the social welfare officers to be a little more lenient in administering services for the poor.  Was a directive given to the health boards to be more lenient in administering the national fuel scheme?</P>
    <P>In my experience the officials of the Departments of Health and Social Welfare are conscientious people who do their work well, but they can be caught up in regulations which may leave people in need without the help that should be available to them.  I am aware of a woman in receipt of a UK pension of £28 per week who, when she applied for assistance under the national fuel scheme, was told she was ineligible because she had a UK old age pension.  That woman was told to apply for a non-contributory Irish pension.  I have no doubt she will receive it to bring her income up to an acceptable level, but she was not told she might be eligible for free fuel then.  That highlights the difficulty there is in administering the present system before we establish a Combat Poverty Agency at all.  I hope the Commission on Social Welfare will have something to say on such cases.</P>
    <P>An unemployed man with a wife and four children told me recently that he can afford to buy only one bag of coal per week.  That lasts three days with the result that they do not have a fire for the remainder of the week even in extremely cold weather.  He told me that the only meat they have in the week is mince on two days.  That family are ineligible for the fuel <Col N="1311" /> scheme because of a decision of the Government that persons on short term assistance should not receive free fuel vouchers as they had been entitled to prior to 1982.  In the administration of our existing schemes we are not getting to the people to alleviate poverty.  What role the Combat Poverty Agency will play in highlighting such cases I do not know.  My view is that such cases are being highlighted sufficiently at local level and in the House.  Sufficient information is available to allow any Minister or any Government to do more to alleviate the poverty that exists.</P>
    <P>I fail to understand why our legislation is not scrutinised more to ensure that it does not create unnecessary hardships and more poverty.  Glancing at the Social Welfare Bill presented today I noticed something new.  People on disability or occupational injury benefit have had the disqualification limit increased from six weeks to nine weeks if they fail to attend a medical referee when called.  In theory it is not unreasonable to penalise a person who fails to attend a medical referee when called but in practice &mdash; I can speak after 25 years' experience in this regard &mdash; I have never seen a person drawing such benefits failing to turn up for a medical referee unless there was a legitimate reason.  Invariably such people are in hospital and unable to turn up.  There may be a break in communications between them and the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>Such provisions in our legislation should be scrutinised because, obviously, their implementation will create further hardship for those who are already in a very vulnerable position.  Most of them are not used to the social welfare system. After working for many years they may suddenly find themselves out of work and on disability benefit due to illness.  When they are called by the medical referee they may be in hospital but because they fail to notify the Department, they lose their benefit.  If such people have a wife and dependants they are also deprived. We should try to ensure in our legislation that we do not do anything that will <Col N="1312" /> increase the level of poverty when imposing restrictions and introducing control mechanisms.  We should be careful not to make the position of such people worse.</P>
    <P>I hope the Combat Poverty Agency will consider the position of the aged. They are more liable to poverty and chronic illness.  Very often they live alone in inadequate housing.  It is important to make a reference to the aged because I see them as presenting a major challenge to us in the future.  We must ensure that we provide adequately for them.  More than any other group they will be a challenge because there will be more of them and they will live longer.  We must ensure we do the right thing for them.</P>
    <P>At present 10.6 per cent of our population are over 65 years of age, 381,000 people.  A total of 66 per cent of them are female.  Another interesting figure is that 47 per cent of women over 65 years are widows.  While it is recognised that husbands die younger, nevertheless the figure I have quoted is a significant one. What is very important in the context of this, and other social legislation, is that while the number of persons over 65 years will increase by 10 per cent in the next ten years, the number of persons over 75 will increase by 20 per cent.  We can expect the number of persons over 80 years to increase dramaticaly in the next ten years.  They are the people we have to cater for.  It is also interesting to note that the number of males living alone is 11 per cent while the number of females living alone is 54 per cent.  It is worth noting that 38 per cent of the elderly do not have any bathroom or shower, while 31 per cent do not have any toilet.</P>
    <P>We should turn our attention to those matters.  There are very good schemes available for the elderly to help them to provide such facilities.  Health boards, for example, operate an excellent scheme and the home improvement grants are well worthwhile.  We should try to coordinate these schemes and improve the minimum living standards in all houses, particularly for the elderly.  Very often, particularly in regard to the provision of bathrooms or toilets, people do not have <Col N="1313" /> enough money to invest in such facilities and the schemes for the elderly do not provide the full finance.  Perhaps some way might be found where, in specific cases, especially for the elderly, they might be able to avail of the home improvement grant and the scheme for the elderly.  They should get at least 90 per cent of the cost of the provision of a very basic amenity.</P>
    <P>I spoke about the problem in the new Social Welfare Bill regarding disability benefit.  We must ensure that there is no delay in the receipt of benefits.  The income of many families is probably adequate but they are unable to manage it.  Perhaps the Combat Poverty Agency could help these people in terms of homemaking. The availability and accessibility of social welfare services is very important. We have a good social service in terms of education, health and social welfare but the question of their availability is very important.  It is recognised, particularly in inner city and larger urban areas, as well as remote rural areas, that services are not always as readily available as they should be.  Where they are available there is also the question of accessibility and this is something which needs to be addressed because in inner cities and remote areas the services may well be available but, for one reason or another people may not know they are available or, even if they do know about them, they may not know how to avail of them.  This needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency because essential services like the mother and child and immunisation schemes are not being taken up by the people who probably need them most.  There is also a problem in relation to older farmers and elderly single people living alone in remote rural areas.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the prescribed relative's allowance which has been very beneficial over the years in ensuring that one member of a family is in a position to look after an aged parent or relative. It is disappointing that the number of recipients of this allowance has gone down and indeed persons who had the allowance over a number of years have <Col N="1314" /> now had it disallowed.  I wonder if a direction has gone out to that effect, perhaps the Minister might look at the scheme and its benefits to the elderly.  I do not know if it is recognised but in smaller holdings in the constituency which I represent and down the west coast many people stay at home to look after an aged parent.  While the prescribed relative's allowance was not very large, nevertheless it allowed people to remain at home and its removal from persons on uneconomic holdings means that they must work away from home, which is not in the interests of their elderly relatives. Perhaps the Minister might, in advance of the Combat Poverty Agency &mdash; because I am sure they will highlight it any way &mdash; have a look at that scheme to see if something can be done about it.</P>
    <P>The greatest problem at present is the high level of unemployment.  It is a major challenge to this House, especially to the Government, because the only way to alleviate unemployment is through proper economic policies.  The Government's policies have been a major contributor to unemployment but I do not want to develop that line of argument on this Bill.  We must try to alleviate the hardship created by unemployment.  The whole perception and presentation of what has been referred to as fraud in the Border areas among those on social welfare is a matter for concern.  I am totally opposed to fraud but I am very much in favour of the social services being orientated towards service rather than control.  There must be a control mechanism but it should be separate from the service element and a small group of people should be engaged in detecting fraud.  I am not referring to the man who goes out and gathers sticks for the winter but to the person who is defrauding the system in a major way by holding down a job and also claiming unemployment benefit.  There should be legislation to deal with these people because they are making it much more difficult for thousands of unfortunate people who find themselves out of work through no fault of their own.</P>
    <P>As a result of the report of fraud in the <Col N="1315" /> Border areas I am concerned that there might be more control in the service and less service.  It is intolerable and unacceptable that a person has to wait 17 weeks to have a claim for unemployment assistance processed and it causes very serious poverty for the people concerned. We should see the unemployed in their proper perspective.  I am quite satisfied that the vast majority are genuinely anxious for work.  I approached the Medico-Social Research Board in my own town to carry out a study of the unemployed. They did a very valuable study which was reported last year and it showed that all these people wanted work and were prepared to emigrate in order to do so.  One person in his forties spent all the money he had saved over 18 months on his wife and family before he faced down to the labour exchange to sign on for unemployment benefit because he was so ashamed.</P>
    <P>I should like to quote a paragraph from the <i>British Medical Journal</i> of 16 November 1985.  This relates to a semiskilled machinist who had been unemployed for two years.  He had this to say:</P>
    <P>I used to get up at 6 a.m., like I was going to work.  I thought I'd get a job in a couple of weeks, but now it's a couple of years.  That's frightening, my confidence is going.  When people ask me how long I've been out of work, I think, shall I lie?  When you're unemployed, you feel like you've committed a crime somewhere, but nobody tells you what you've done.  The first thing that happened to me was that I realised I'd become almost illiterate after years working in a factory.  I fall asleep a lot, it happens if you've got nothing to do. One bloke round here, the only place he goes is to sign on the dole.  Sometimes I think I'll go barmy.  Of course you get depressed, you convince yourself it's you.  Sometimes I feel really ashamed, especially with things like Christmas.  This will be the first time I've ever not given my sisters something for Christmas.</P>
    <P>Those are sentiments we can all recognise <Col N="1316" /> and identify with.  They represent fairly the feelings of those who are unemployed. It is well recognised by researchers that unemployment has serious psychological consequences.</P>
    <P>The number of young people who are unemployed is a matter of major concern and it is only right that we pay tribute to the concern shown by the youth of today generally.  They are much more concerned socially and are much more aware of the problems of society than would have been the case some years ago.  Other groups such as single parents and those disadvantaged in terms of housing are also a major problem.  In rural Ireland especially there is a problem in regard to the provision of housing for single parent families.  The houses that are built are either the standard three bedroomed type for the average family or the single storey type house for the elderly.  The travelling population, too, are another group who are at a serious disadvantage.  One can only hope that the prejudice against this group is fading but they continue to be disadvantaged in terms of education, housing, training and the job market.</P>
    <P>This morning someone criticised the use of the term &ldquo;new poor&rdquo; but there is a group who are just outside the limits for the various State benefits and they are worthy of some consideration.  A disappointment in the recent budget was the abolition of the £100 tax free allowance in respect of each child.  While the children's allowances are being increased and may compensate some families, other families will be at a loss especially those with children over 18 years and pursuing third level education but who are not eligible for higher education grants.  The new child allowance will not apply to such families.  While the £100 per child in terms of tax allowance was not very much, it was a recognition of the place of the family in our society so there is an important principle involved.  That is why I urge the Minister to reconsider this change before the Finance Bill is enacted.</P>
    <P>Another area that is important in the context of this Bill is the question of the various social services that are available. We appear to have three areas of social <Col N="1317" /> services all working in parallel.  The Department of Social Welfare and the health boards provide a personal social service mainly by way of the supplementary welfare allowances and then there are the various voluntary organisations. Each is providing a service and in some cases there is overlapping and no co-ordination. There is still a lot of poverty and the services that are available do not always reach the people we would like to help.  I do not know what function the Combat Poverty Agency will have in terms of some sort of co-ordination, but it is not necessary to have this agency to highlight the fact that there are three different groupings working in the area of social services.  I trust the Commission on Social Welfare will have something to say about this arrangement.</P>
    <P>The same applies in respect of the means test.  The investigations in this regard are undertaken both by the health boards and the Department of Social Welfare while the local authorities undertake means tests in respect of housing and higher education grants.  There is no reason why there should not be the one means test with a range of services available depending on income or on projected income.  In this context I am thinking, for instance, of small farmers in the west who have adequate money during the summer when they are supplying milk to the creameries, but who do not have an income during the winter months.  For the purpose of unemployment assistance their means for the year are divided by 52 to give a weekly average but that does not give the true picture because of the lack of income in the winter months.</P>
    <P>It is well recognised that poverty is related to income so it is disappointing that, in this year when we all recognise that there is so much poverty, the increases in social welfare payments will be only of the order of 4 per cent with no increase in the dependants' allowance.  In addition, the increases being granted are not to come into effect until the third week in July.  In former years they took effect from 1 April but this Government have taken away from social welfare recipients one-quarter of the year's benefit. <Col N="1318" /> In their first year in office they made the payments effective from the first week in July.  In subsequent budgets the date was changed to the second week in July and this year it is to be a week later.  Consequently, if the Government survive another year we may assume that the whole of July will elapse before the increases in this area are paid.  That will represent a delay of four months compared with the time Fianna Fáil were in office.</P>
    <P>One sure way of escalating the level of poverty is to close the psychiatric hospitals. We do not need a Combat Poverty Agency to remind us of what the experience in this regard has been in Italy and in the US in particular.  In Italy a law was introduced to prevent people being admitted to psychiatric hospitals who had not already been in such hospitals.  This resulted in people living as recluses and in all sorts of bizarre places.  The experience in the US was similar.  In Chicago, in an area called Up Town, for example, people who would otherwise have been in psychiatric hospitals congregated together and had nothing to do.  Despite having the benefit of knowing what happened in these places we are closing our psychiatric hospitals and returning to the community people who are not able to survive in the ordinary way in the community.</P>
    <P>One of the difficulties at a time of recession is that the Government are curtailing social expenditure rather than expanding it, as would be necessary, or indeed reorientating it to meet the needs of the people.  In a recession there are much greater needs.  When times are good people say that benefits are not sufficient.</P>

      <P>Deputy Bertie Ahern has been given permission to raise on the Adjournment the large number of <Col N="1319" /> robberies in banks, post offices, supermarkets and business premises in the Drumcondra-Phibsborough area during the past five days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you for your cooperation in allowing me to raise this matter.  I congratulate the Minister on his new appointment and wish him well in his extremely difficult portfolio.  It will probably be more difficult than his previous job.</P>
      <P>I have not raised the matter of crime for some time.  I am a member of the Committee on Crime, Lawlessness and Vandalism and if one raises the matter too often one's colleagues begin to think that there are no other parts of the city or country which have crime.  Unfortunately the area which I have the honour to represent is one of the main trading areas of the city and attracts a large amount of crime.  Statistics prove that it is an area hit very badly by crime.  I do not wish to claim, however, that the area I represent is any better or worse than other areas on the north or south side of the city. Crime in the city has not been highlighted in recent times but the position is extremely bad.  There are regular robberies, muggings and house breakings and arms are being used with greater frequency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have great admiration for the gardaí who man the stations in Pearse Street, Store Street, Whitehall, Mountjoy Street, Fitzgibbon Street and the Bridewell. The personnel in these stations have to deal with a vast amount of crime.  I cannot say that the position has become worse but last weekend was a particularly bad period in my constituency.  My office is based at Tolka Bridge in Drumcondra. On Friday there was a convergence of about 100 gardaí, including members of the Task Force and Special Branch and men drawn from surrounding stations. They were literally running in circles trying to combat three crimes which took place within a very short time.  A total of £15,000 was taken from a security van at Quinnsworth in Drumcondra.  Shots were <Col N="1320" /> fired outside the bank in Lower Drumcondra Road and there was a raid on the post office in the same area.  At the same time the resources of the Garda had to be diverted to deal with a very large robbery in Tallaght.  Shortly afterwards there was a raid on the Northern Bank in Finglas.  During a raid in Santry a gun was held to the head of a three year old retarded child.  There was also the rape of a 30 year old woman in Clontarf when she returned to find thugs in her house. All these crimes occurred within a short space of time.</P>
    <P>A huge number of burglaries are being carried out, to say nothing of car thefts. Mugging has now become so common that it is considered a petty crime hardly worth reporting to the Garda.  Handbag snatching is not reported and if stolen cars are recovered by the owners the theft is not likely to be reported.  Even minor burglaries are not reported.  One reason for this is that many people living in my constituency are unable to get insurance from any company.  People living in flats, which cover one-third of my area, do not even try to get insurance because they know it is impossible.</P>
    <P>I do not attempt to accuse or blame the Minister.  He is new in his job and it is a most difficult one.  I know he will agree that the level of crime I have outlined is completely unacceptable.  The Garda must be commended for doing their best, both on duty and off duty. Unlike other people in this House, I do not ever criticise them because I see them working extremely hard to combat crime. There is a danger that the current level of crime will become acceptable and for that reason I raise the matter from time to time.  It would be a sad reflection on our society if we become complacent about the number of armed raids and people wearing balaclavas parading around the city, jumping off motor bikes to rob shops.  The more organised gangs operate on Fridays and it would be appropriate today for the Minister to say a few words on this subject and reiterate the resolve of his Department and of the Garda to stop these crimes.</P>
    <P>In my own area I have several times <Col N="1321" /> called on people to co-operate fully with the Garda and give any useful information. There are certain difficulties involved because the people who make up these gangs are well known by name to me, to the Minister and to the Garda.  It takes evidence, however, to put them where they ought to be and it is difficult for people to give that evidence because of the obvious dangers.  In recent times there has been a greater understanding on the part of the public of the slippery slope which is leading to an escalation of crime.</P>
    <P>There has definitely been a change in the type of crime being committed.  The criminal gangs in the city have become more competent.  They have perfected their techniques.  The banks in my area all have a pre-printed sign &ldquo;Closed for an Hour because of Bank Raid&rdquo;.  They do not have to wait too long for another raid.  I gather a raid was carried out only a short time ago in Marino Mart, very near my home.  I believe many of these crimes are carried out by the same gang. Local knowledge would indicate that this is the case and in my constituency local knowledge is invariably correct.  Anyone in the Department or the Garda would confirm that.</P>
    <P>Armed crime has become far more common in recent years and the determination of the criminals to fire has become very evident in recent months. The public cannot become involved in efforts to prevent these crimes because shots will certainly be fired.  Luckily there have been no deaths.  Vicious gangs are working within the city and no doubt they are planning their deeds for tomorrow and Saturday.  We had this kind of thing a few years ago but it tended to be a different type of crime.  The business community, who are very hard pressed because of the financial recession and the difficulties of getting insurance, now face an added burden.  A number of journalists have highlighted the problems.</P>
    <P>During the past month there has been a massive increase in crime in Dublin city and suburbs.  There have been about 20 armed raids carried out on Fridays and Saturdays&mdash;11 in my area and the rest in <Col N="1322" /> other areas.  Shots were fired on a few occasions but gardaí were on the scene very quickly.  They are well organised and timed to perfection, often with information which is hard for anyone to defeat.</P>
    <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for giving me this opportunity to raise the matter and to ask the Minister to do something about it.  I know that the Garda are very professional and they know these gangs better than anyone else.  They know the areas which they hit, the banks, bars, supermarkets and places where there is ready cash.  They are not interested in money orders.  In Dublin city areas such as Drumcondra, Glasnevin, Iona and Phibsborough which are full of business premises, resources should be made available in order to bring the Task Force into that area.  They have to come from Dublin Castle and time is lost in doing so.  They can get there at amazing speed but five or six minutes makes all the difference. It is not very hard to locate the unmarked cars, as they all are nowadays, in strategic areas.</P>
    <P>Last year there was a big robbery on the south side of Dublin and the Task Force were there before the criminals and successfully apprehended them, I will not say they were charged because it is <i>sub judice</i>.  The case is coming up soon. When three or four major robberies occur in a certain area it is unlikely that different gangs are involved.  They are usually well timed in order to cause chaos.  In cases such as this the Garda need additional resources in order to combat this new type of activity of hitting several places in the one area.  Arms are used in all cases.  This is causing great fear for shopkeepers, their staff and the ordinary people.  There have been very savage attacks on people.  The rape of a 30 year old woman in Clontarf and the holding of a loaded gun to the head of a three year old retarded child are only two of about 20 cases which I have heard of in the past week.  That is a different type of criminal but it shows the extent of the viciousness of crime in our city.</P>
    <P>The Minister has an onerous and difficult responsibility.  Because this happens on a large scale and because we get used <Col N="1323" /> to vicious crime it does not make it acceptable.  It has been proved in the past that where there is a concentration of gardaí and the Task Force, criminals are, if not driven out, at least driven underground. I know a lot about city crime and I have spoken this week to people in the Garda Síochána who have far more knowledge of it.  They are extremely concerned about the increase in crime levels. I ask the Minister to take whatever measures are necessary to clamp down on this vicious and violent escalation in armed robberies in the city.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Dukes) Alan Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Dukes)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned at what can only be described as a spate of robberies on business premises over the past week in the north central area of the city.  Deputy Ahern referred to a number of specific cases.  I agree with him that every occurrence of a crime of this nature is a very serious matter, in many cases with very traumatic results for the victims.  It is deplorable that a series of such crimes should have been perpetrated in that area over such a short period of time.  I share the concern expressed by Deputy Ahern which I know is reflected in the thinking of many other Members of the House.</P>
      <P>I assure the House that the Garda Síochána can be relied upon to do all that can be reasonably expected of them when faced with this situation in order to prevent further crimes of this nature.  They will take every action that is open to them to apprehend and to bring to justice the people who are involved in this type of crime.  The Garda authorities assure me that a number of specific measures are being taken, that deployment of Garda personnel and other resources at the Garda stations serving the area are being reviewed and that crime prevention patrols are being stepped up.  The local Garda effort is being supplemented by assistance from the serious crime squad of the Garda Síochána.  I hope that the intensive investigations now under way, will produce results in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Tuesday last the gardaí were involved in a car chase after a sum of money <Col N="1324" /> was snatched at bank in Marino.  Four men were subsequently arrested and the gardaí took possession of a sum of money.  The persons arrested have appeared in court and have been remanded to a further hearing.  I will not go into any more detail since the matter is <i>sub judice</i>.  The gardaí are carrying out their job with concrete success in some cases.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to comment on the local knowledge referred to by Deputy Ahern.  The Garda authorities are keeping the situation in that area under special review with a view to seeing whether any further special measures are warranted.  The Garda have no evidence to suggest that this is the beginning of a major upsurge in crime in the area. I am very concerned, as indeed we all must be, at the trend towards the increasingly frequent use of arms in crimes of this kind.  I want to make it clear that the penalties for crimes involving firearms will be rigidly applied.  I cannot see why any of the leniency that our system allows for at various levels should be applied to cases of armed crime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the not too distant past we introduced stiffer penalties for the illegal possession of firearms.  I intend to ensure that these penalties are fully applied in order to make the point that, not alone in Dublin city but in any other area, we cannot tolerate the increasing resort to the use of firearms by people involved in crime.  There is some comfort to be gained from recent crime statistics assembled by the Garda authorities.  For the moment the figures for 1985 are provisional but a definite downward trend in the level of reported crime can be identified. The 1985 figure indicates a reduction of 8.6 per cent below the level of 1984 which had shown a similar reduction of about 2½ per cent compared with the previous year.  Provisional figures for the first two months of this year indicate that, throughout the country as a whole, there <Col N="1325" /> has been a slight decrease in the number of armed robberies and aggravated burglaries compared with the same period last year.  This is not a reason for complacency. The House would agree that there is no such thing as an acceptable level of crime or an acceptable proportion of crime in the categories Deputy Ahern mentioned here.</P>
    <P>The gardaí will have my full support and the full support of the House in measures they take to deal with the situation. I know the gardaí will give the community generally their full support both in the prevention and detection of crime of this kind.  I thank Deputy Ahern for having raised this in the way he did.  Local information is always of particular use in dealing with this kind of crime.  We are fortunate in that over the years our Garda force have been very successful in tuning in to local information.  I appreciate the fact, as Deputy Ahern mentioned, that there are people who from time to time feel a certain reticence about sharing <Col N="1326" /> information that they have with the Garda authorities.</P>
    <P>I assure Deputy Ahern and anybody else concerned about this that, if for any reason people who have local information that could be useful to the Garda have an inhibition about giving it to the Garda, then as Deputy Ahern knows, there are means of getting to the Garda through other channels.  Deputy Ahern and other Members of the House will find me particularly co-operative in that regard and the Garda will be very anxious to get any information they can.  I emphasise as a general principle, and not because of the situation Deputy Ahern raised, the very serious obligation on anybody in the community who has information that can assist the Garda in protecting the public, to make that information available through whatever channels are open to them.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5.25 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 11 March 1986.</P>

      <P>Workers engaged in the manufacture of asbestos goods are currently covered by the provisions of the Safety in Industry Acts, 1955 and 1980, and the Factories (Asbestos Processes) Regulations, 1975. These provisions also apply to workplaces such as construction sites where asbestos cement pipes and asbestos cement sheets are used and premises under the Acts where asbestos lagging or insulation is applied or removed.  These workplaces are subject to inspection by my Department's industrial inspectors, who sample the atmosphere to ascertain exposure to asbestos fibres.  While compliance with the required provisions is found to be generally good in the manufacturing sector there is room for improvement in some other operations, particularly those involving the removal of asbestos products, such as asbestos cement and asbestos insulations, from buildings and plant.  The inspectorate advise employers and workers in relation to safe working methods and practices where such advice is seen to be necessary or is sought.  The inspectorate always respond promptly to complaints from workers or others relating to exposure to asbestos at work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department are currently drafting regulations to give effect to the provisions of EC Council Directive 83/477/EEC of 19 September 1983 on the protection of workers from the risks related to exposure to asbestos at work.  As opposed to the somewhat limited scope of our existing domestic statutory provisions the <Col N="1282" /> directive will apply to all activities, other than sea and air transport, in which workers are or may be exposed in the course of their work to dust arising from asbestos or materials containing asbestos.  The directive is due for implementation by member states by 1 January 1987.</P>
    <P>The Commission of Inquiry on Safety, Health and Welfare at Work, as well as making a substantial number of recommendations in the occupational accident and disease preventive area &mdash; based on which I am currently developing proposals for legislative change &mdash; also examined a number of other matters including compensation arrangements and how they affect accident prevention.  The commission pointed to the many complex issues relating to compulsory employers' liability insurance which is not a general subject falling within my area of responsibility. Those issues would need to be examined comprehensively by all the interests involved.</P>

      <P>To be entitled to unemployment benefit a person must be unemployed, capable of and available for work.  The three persons in respect of whom details were supplied were employed by the same employer up to 2 January 1986 when the employment was terminated in respect of one of the persons concerned, who had been employed on a temporary casual basis.  The other two persons named failed to report for work from 6 January 1986.</P>
      <P>The persons concerned claimed unemployment benefit on 13 January 1986. Inquiries, which are ongoing, had to be made to ascertain the reason their employment was terminated and whether they satisfied the necessary conditions for receipt of benefit.  When these inquiries, which it is anticipated will be completed shortly, are completed, a decision will be made in the case in the light of the information available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is understood that only one of the persons concerned applied for, and is in receipt of, supplementary welfare allowance. It is open to the other persons to apply to their local community welfare <Col N="1292" /> officer for supplementary welfare allowance if their income is insufficient to meet their needs.</P>

      <P>Entitlement to unemployment assistance is dependent on an applicant being the holder of a qualification certificate and to obtain a qualification certificate an applicant must satisfy certain conditions, including an assessment of means.  The person concerned applied for unemployment assistance on 10 January 1986 and the papers were referred to a social welfare officer for investigation of means.  These inquiries have recently been completed and the papers are being submitted to a deciding officer for assessment of his means.  His entitlement to unemployment assistance will be determined in the light of the assessment of the deciding officer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mrs. Hussey) Gemma Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mrs. Hussey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The unemployment assistance claim of the person concerned was disallowed with effect from 24 April 1985 on the grounds that her means, derived from the value of board and lodging enjoyed by her, exceeded the maximum rate payable in her case.  She applied for a review of her means on 24 September 1985, but due to an oversight, her means were not reinvestigated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Arrangements have now been made with the local social welfare officer to carry out an investigation of her means for the period from 24 September 1985 to 29 October 1985, when she ceased <Col N="1293" /> to sign at the local office.  When these inquiries are completed, her means will be reassessed and her entitlement to unemployment assistance will be determined accordingly.  The oversight in this case is regretted.</P>

He is, accordingly, in receipt of unemployment assistance at £14.45 weekly being the appropriate maximum rate payable in his case of £31.75 less means of £17.30.</P>
      <P>He appealed against the amount of means assessed against him and an appeals officer, on 20 February 1986, also assessed him with means of £17.30 weekly.  If the person concerned considers that his circumstances have changed since the last investigation it is open to him to apply for a review of his means.

      <P>The person concerned does not satisfy the contribution conditions for entitlement to unemployment benefit on the basis of her Irish contribution record. Her UK contribution record cannot be invoked for the purposes of her claim as she is not eligible for a transfer of contributions under the provision of the EC regulations by reason of her last insurable employment being outside this country. Entitlement to unemployment assistance is dependent on an applicant being the holder of a qualification certificate, and to obtain a qualification certificate an applicant must satisfy certain conditions including an assessment of means.</P>
      <P>The person concerned applied for unemployment assistance on 23 December 1985 and her case was referred to a social welfare officer for investigation. These inquiries were recently completed and the papers are now being submitted to a deciding officer for assessment of means.  Her entitlement to unemployment assistance will be determined in the light of the deciding officer's assessment.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mrs. Hussey)</NameTxt>

He failed to furnish relevant details requested from him regarding his parents' holding, on which he resides.</P>
      <P>He appealed against the disallowance and an appeals officer also decided that he failed to furnish particulars of his means and disallowed his appeal.  An appeals officer's decision is final in the absence of new facts or fresh evidence.</P>
      <P>The person concerned has not signed as unemployed at his local employment office since 21 January 1986.  If he wishes to have his appeal reopened he may do so on the condition that he co-operates fully with the social welfare officer in the investigation of his means.  He should inform his local office accordingly, if he wishes to pursue this course.</P>

This is the rate to which he is entitled having regard to the assessment of his means consisting of half the weekly value of capital, his pension from the county council and his wife's pension from the Department of Education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An appeal form issued to the pensioner <Col N="1296" /> on 3 February 1986.  On receipt of the completed form the case will be referred to an appeals officer for determination. The person concerned will be notified of the outcome.</P>
