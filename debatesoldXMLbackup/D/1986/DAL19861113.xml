    <P>
      <i>(a)</i> the member in whose name the Question appears on the Order Paper requests, before 4 p.m. on that day, that the Question be addressed again to the member of the Government concerned on the next day on which that member is to answer Questions, or</P>
    <P>
      <i>(b)</i> the Ceann Comhairle is of the opinion that such answer would prejudice the answering of another Question put down for oral answer on the next day on which the member of the Government concerned is to answer Questions.&rsquo;.</P>
    <P>Standing Order 37</P>
    <P>15.  To add to the Standing Order &lsquo;: Provided that, in the time allocated to Questions nominated for priority, supplementary Questions may be put only by the member in whose name the Question appears on the Order Paper.&rsquo;.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2276" /> Standing Order 82</P>
    <P>16.  To delete the fifth and sixth lines and substitute the following:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&lsquo;be, shall be interrupted between 7 p.m. and 8.30 p.m. to take private members' business: Provided that, where leave has been given to make a motion under Standing Order 30, such motion shall have priority: Provided further&rsquo;.</P>
    <P>Standing Order 123</P>
    <P>17.  To delete &lsquo;10.15 p.m.&rsquo; in each place where it occurs and substitute &lsquo;8.30 p.m.&rsquo;.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The main purpose of this motion is to continue in operation the new system for Parliamentary Questions, which was introduced on an experimental basis in June 1985.  The motion proposes to end the experimental status of the new system and to introduce it as a permanent feature in Standing Orders.</P>
    <P>In addition the motion incorporates permanently into Standing Orders the current Dáil sitting times, which were introduced on an experimental basis in 1976 and renewed when each new Dáil met.</P>
    <P>The new Questions system has proved to be far superior to the one which it replaced and has been widely acknowledged as such.  When I spoke last year on the motion introducing the system on a trial basis I set out the main advantages which I believed would accrue from it.  I feel that it is worth repeating the more important of these, which are: quicker rotation of Ministers answering Questions; Questions are less likely to be overtaken by events which would make them out of date or cause them to lose much of their relevance; and parties in Opposition can now ask Questions of national importance on a more regular basis, through the introduction of Priority Questions.  Through the lottery system, each member has an equal chance of his or her questions being answered.</P>
    <P>The benefits which have followed from the new procedures are evident.  In particular there has been a major improvement in the frequency with which <Col N="2277" /> Ministers answer Questions relating to their Departments.  In a comparison made between two nine month periods, one in 1984-85 under the old system and the other in 1985-86 under the new system, the following emerged: in the period under the old scheme, Questions relating to four Government Departments only were taken on three occasions; Questions relating to four other Departments twice only; Questions relating to a further three Departments once only; while, in the case of five Government Departments, Questions relating to their activities were not reached at all during the period.  The Departments not reached at all were Social Welfare, Agriculture, Justice, Education and Labour.  By contrast in a similar period in 1985-86, under the new procedures, Questions relating to all Departments were reached on at least four occasions, and in the case of six of those Departments, on five occasions.</P>
    <P>This, in my view, is the most significant achievement of the new system.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to discuss the detailed provisions of the Questions procedure as these were dealt with at length during the debate in May 1985.  This present motion simply incorporates into Standing Orders the provisions in the 1985 motion, with two changes.</P>
    <P>These changes provide that repeat Questions can be tabled again after four months rather than the six months currently in force.  They also enable a party in Opposition to nominate lottery questions as replacements for Priority Questions, in the event of any of the latter being disallowed or transferred after the time limit for submission of Priority Questions has expired.  Both changes have been requested by the Opposition and agreed by the Government in an attempt to overcome certain difficulties being experienced in those areas.</P>
    <P>Similarly, I do not think it necessary to cover in detail the provisions of the motion relating to the sitting times of the Dáil and other related matters.  The reality is that the House has been functioning for ten years now under those <Col N="2278" /> provisions, which have been introduced by way of a sessional order at the commencement of each Dáil.  It is way past time to put them on a proper footing and incorporate them into the Standing Orders.  Subject to approval of this motion by the House I feel that the existing Standing Orders should now be reprinted in updated form &mdash; the last edition was prepared over 12 years ago, in 1974.</P>
    <P>I commend this motion to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>Basically we are in agreement with the proposals contained in this motion.  The matter has come before the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and we have had a number of discussions on it.  While we are not completely satisfied with the new system of Question Time for a number of reasons, nevertheless, taking all circumstances into consideration, it probably has proved much more effective than the older system.  I presume that this new format of Question Time is a step in <Col N="2279" /> the direction of Dáil reform which the Government promised to take when the Dáil commenced in 1982.  I must express my disappointment at the very slow rate of reform that has taken place.  I appreciate that there may be difficulties in some areas but nevertheless in view of the fact that the Minister of State's predecessor, now the Minister for Finance, indicated that one of his main priorities would be major Dáil reform, that has not been forthcoming.  All Deputies in the House must express a certain amount of disappointment at that.</P>
      <P>One of the main areas on which most Deputies have expressed disapproval and dissatisfaction with Dáil proceedings is the fact that major issues of immediate interest cannot be debated.  The objective of the priority questions at Question Time was to try to meet that situation in some way.  That has not been completely successful for the reason that it will take 15 or 16 sitting days before the rotation comes back to a particular Department or a particular Minister.  Nevertheless, I hope that the Minister of State with responsibility for looking at Dáil reform will look at all of the systems to ensure that there are some measures that can be taken to improve the overall effectiveness of the Dáil.  We all know that there is very little time left for this present Dáil.  Presumably it will be the responsibility of a Fianna Fáil Minister to look into these matters during the next Dáil session, whenever that might be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To come back to the subject under discussion, I mentioned that I was dissatisfied with certain aspects of the new system.  One of these areas relates to the number of questions that is being taken and the number of answers provided during Question Time each day.  For example, yesterday we put down something in the region of 41 questions and out of that only ten questions were taken. By any normal standard this is most disappointing and unsatisfactory.  This is a matter that has been referred to on numerous occasions and various causes have been put forward.  We all acccept that there are a number of reasons for <Col N="2280" /> this.  For example, some Ministers are inclined to give too lengthy answers.  Very often much of the information is not necessary.  Ministers often use the opportunity to make a policy statement rather than just reply directly to a question. We must accept that the whole point of putting down a question for reply is to obtain specific information on a certain topic.  Because some Ministers are inclined to use that opportunity to make policy statements the time of the Opposition is lost.</P>
    <P>Question Time which takes up one hour each day has always been the time of the Opposition.  In the past 18 months to two years more and more Government Deputies are also availing of that opportunity to raise questions for political reasons.  Much of the information which has been sought by Government backbenchers could have been obtained quite easily by going to the Minister's office or by speaking to him in the corridor. Therefore there would be no necessity to wast the time of the House and to take the time of the Opposition in raising those matters during Question Time.  It is, of course, the democratic right of every Deputy to submit questions.  I would not attempt to deny or to challenge that in any respect.  Nevertheless in the interest of the House we should try to get through as many questions as possible, which is the whole purpose of Question Time.  Up to two years ago 90 per cent of questions on the Order Paper came from Opposition Deputies.</P>
    <P>When I first came to the House in 1977 about 25 to 30 questions a day were answered.  It is unfortunate that that number has tumbled back to ten questions, as happened yesterday.  Other days only seven or eight questions were answered.  Very often, a Cheann Comhairle, you are placed in a difficult position. The solution to this problem lies in your hands.  The Ceann Comhairle is the chairman of the proceedings and if there is to be an improvement in the number of questions being answered you will have to be a little more insistent that replies should be shorter.  Perhaps some supplementary questions are unnecessary or <Col N="2281" /> there may be too many supplementary questions but this is something that I hope, a Cheann Comhairle, you will look into in the future.  I am certain also that while there may be teething troubles in that respect you will have the full support of the House in ensuring that we can have a more smooth, efficient and better format for Question Time.</P>
    <P>In regard to the hours of the House, what we are doing today is bringing into line the hours of sitting that we have had for the past ten years.  This should have been done some years ago.  The hours in which we operate at present are far better, more effective and more civilised than the hours which the House sat prior to 1975.  That is a good thing.  There is also the opportunity that the House may sit on Fridays if necessary to take additional business.  We also have on the Order Paper a motion that the House should sit on Fridays in the future to take Private Members' Bills.  That should meet the requirements and requests of the amendment that has been tabled by The Workers' Party.</P>
    <P>When talking about Dáil reform I would like to mention that the recent innovation of broadcasting Dáil proceedings has been a very good thing.  It has been very well accepted.  I have received many complimentary comments from the public about the new broadcasting service.  We could look at this again in the future and maybe even extend broadcasting time because it is important that the public should be brought closer to what happens in this House.  They should be able to identify more closely with the happenings and proceedings of the Dáil.  After all, we must never forget that we are very much involved in a democratic process.  Apart from the Members of the House, the public must also play their part.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>Standing Order 20</P>
      <P>In amendment 1 to delete the words &ldquo;at 2.30 p.m. and every&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I shall address myself mainly to the amendments I have put down to the motion amending Standing Orders.  The main point is that we are today making permanent a number of changes that were made over a year ago to Dáil Question Time procedure.  Many Members of this House will be aware that we had grave reservations about the procedures as proposed at the time.  I have to say that the procedure worked out far better than we had anticipated in terms of the balance achieved on the questions taken. Nevertheless, there are a number of aspects about which we are still concerned, resulting in our amendments.</P>
      <P>We also considered it opportune to place a number of other amendments concerning the times at which the Dáil sits.  This is because we are aware, as is every other Member, I am sure, that the public, regardless of the fact that they may not be fully aware of the way in which the House operates, have the perception that the Dáil does not sit very often and does not do much work.  I would not agree that the House does not do much work but there is the perception that it does not sit very often.  We know that there are literally dozens of pieces of legislation which the Dáil should be dealing with as a matter of urgency.  It is for that reason that we have tabled a number of other amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The members of my party, Deputy Mac Giolla and I, are not members of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and so are not privy to the discussions which take place concerning Dáil reform and the procedures of this House.  I have yet to see any reports of the proceedings of that committee.  I understand that they meet in private and I do not know where the minutes are kept, or what discussions take place.  Deputy Mac Giolla and I have written to the committee on a number of occasions relating to matters about which <Col N="2283" /> we were concerned and, while on one or two occasions we received acknowledgments of our letters, we have never been consulted or involved in a discussion on Dáil reform.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton, when Leader of the House, met Deputy Mac Giolla and myself on one occasion to discuss a submission we made on Dáil reform but again we have not been involved in the general discussions.  That may be an aspect of reform of this House which perhaps we should also consider at some stage &mdash; the manner in which places are allocated on the various committees of the House.</P>
    <P>The first amendment concerns the time at which the Dáil sits on a Tuesday.  I note from the Minister's statement that the present Dáil sittings were introduced on an experimental basis in 1976 and have been renewed by each Dáil ever since then.  A Dáil sitting which starts at 2.30 p.m. on a Tuesday is no longer realistic or acceptable in view of the volume of work which this Dáil has to get through and also in view of the much more speedy and modern means of transportation available to get Members to this House. It is not inconceivable that work could be structured in such a way that not every Member need necessarily be here on the Tuesday morning.  I am thinking, in particular, of Members who may live very long distances from the House, in particular, in places like Donegal, Kerry and other remote parts of the country from and to which, because of our present system of transportation, it is quite difficult to get.  There is no argument in this day and age for a Dáil sitting which starts at 2.30 p.m. on a Tuesday.  For that reason, I have submitted an amendment that the words &ldquo;2.30 p.m.&rdquo; be deleted. This would have the effect of the Dáil sitting on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday at 10.30 a.m.  It would not affect the times at which the Dáil rises.</P>
    <P>My second amendment concerns Friday sittings.  It is intended to set aside Fridays for, mainly, the discussion of Private Members Bills.  Again, there is quite a number of Private Members' Bills on <Col N="2284" /> the Order Paper and those of us who do not belong to large parties, or parties or groups of more than seven, have not the right to have such Bills discussed in this Dáil unless the largest Opposition party, Fianna Fáil, agree to allocate time to us on a Tuesday and Wednesday night. Alternatively, the Government, presumably, could facilitate by allocating time.</P>
    <P>Of course, the argument &mdash; and it is a good one &mdash; is that the normal time of the Dáil on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays is taken up fully with discussion of Government business and presumably Fianna Fáil, as the largest party, have some claim to at least a major portion of Private Members' Business.  At the same time, the rest of us in this House &mdash; and I think that we number around ten or 11 Deputies who are not members of the Labour Party, the Fianna Fáil Party, or the Fine Gael Party &mdash; should have some right to have our motions and Bills discussed in the House.  Every Deputy in this House is elected by a quota of electors.  For that reason they should achieve equal access to time in the House.  We are proposing that Fridays from 10.30 a.m. to 3.30 p.m. be set aside to discuss Private Members' Bills, and that where there are no Private Members' Bills in progress the Dáil should deal with Private Members' Business or any such business as it may decide.  If there are no Private Members' Bills in progress there are motions many of which have been on the Order Paper for three or four years. The Dáil could also discuss Estimates on Fridays in the way they have done in recent years.  That would be an important reform to the procedures of the House. I regard this as our most important amendment and I would press the House to support it even if they cannot support the extension of sitting time on Tuesdays or my other amendment about Question Time.</P>
    <P>My third amendment concerns Question Time, in particular the allocation of time from 3.30 p.m. to 3.45 p.m. for priority Questions.  At the moment the only party in this House who can qualify for priority Questions are Fianna Fáil, <Col N="2285" /> simply because Standing Orders define the right to priority Questions as a right applying to groups in the House.  The definition in Standing Orders of a group, is any party of seven or more, who may form a group in the Dáil, or who have been elected as a group to the Dáil.  I contend that the relevant Standing Order should refer to parties, so that any party in the House would have the right to place priority Questions before the Minister. Our amendment seeks to substitute &ldquo;party&rdquo; for &ldquo;group&rdquo; so that each Opposition party could table priority Questions.</P>
    <P>I also have an amendment relating to the number of questions.  This amendment, No. 4, seeks to delete paragraphs (ii) and (iii) of the Government amendment No. 13 and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>the number of priority Questions which may be tabled by a qualifying member shall not be more than 2, and the sequence in which such questions shall be taken shall be determined by lottery.</P>
    <P>That is a reasonable allocation of time for priority Questions.  I have noticed on priority Questions that in many cases the person asking the first or second priority Question spends most of the time on the first or second Question so it would be reasonable to allocate two Questions to each nominated member.</P>
    <P>My fifth amendment is a consequential amendment which seeks to replace the word &ldquo;group&rdquo; with &ldquo;party&rdquo; where it appears in Standing Orders relating to Parliamentary Questions.</P>
    <P>My sixth amendment is related to priority Questions and to Questions in general.  The practice at the moment is that the Minister may in replying to a priority Question take a Question which is not a priority Question which was put down by another Member of the House for oral answer and answer two Questions or even three or four Questions together. However, the only person entitled to put supplementaries to the Minister is the person in whose name the priority Question has been listed.  This ignores the other Members whose Questions are <Col N="2286" /> being taken along with the priority Question. My amendment would give the right to a Member whose oral Questions have been grouped with priority Questions to ask supplementaries.</P>
    <P>Those are the amendments which I and Deputy Mac Giolla are seeking to make. We are seeking to improve the workings of the House.  We are seeking to make Question Time, particularly the time devoted to priority Questions more equitable. We are seeking to extend the hours during which the Dáil sits.  We seek to move the starting time on Tuesday from 2.30 p.m. to 10.30 a.m. and we are anxious to ensure that the Dáil will sit on Fridays to take Private Members' Bills and other Private Members' Business, so that every Member of the House will have an opportunity to have matters discussed in the House.  At the moment we have a number of Private Members' Bills on the Order Paper including the Nuclear, Chemical and Biological Weapons (Controls) Bill which we moved recently but which will not be discussed in the House during the lifetime of this Government.  This Bill seeks to restrict the access of ships or planes which may be carrying such weapons to this country and it is unfortunate that it will not be discussed in the House.  The other Bills should also be discussed.  It is a reasonable request that this House should sit on Fridays to deal with those Bills.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>In general terms I welcome this motion and what it proposes to do to bring Standing Orders into line with what has now been the practice in the House for some time.  I welcome the proposal of the Minister of State to reprint Standing Orders in their new form.  I hope this will be done as soon as this motion is passed and that they will be made available quickly to Deputies as the present situation is most unsatisfactory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I welcome what is proposed in this motion, I have a number of comments to make.  The statement in the first page of the Minister's speech today was that parties in Opposition can now ask Questions of national importance on a <Col N="2287" /> more regular basis, through the introduction of priority Questions.  That statement is untrue.  The statement would be true if it read &ldquo;One party in Opposition can now ask questions of national importance on a more regular basis&rdquo;.  As Deputy de Rossa made clear, that is the position and only one party can ask questions. That is unsatisfactory.  There are eleven members in this House in Opposition who are not Members of that party and who find many aspects of Question Time unsatisfactory.  One can put down questions for oral answer on matters of some importance and which should be answered orally but one finds that the day before they are due to be answered one gets a letter from the Ceann Comhairle saying that a month or two earlier a written question was asked on that topic and that that precludes one from asking an oral question on &mdash; it appears in practice &mdash; anything relating to that topic for six months.  It may well be that the topic is such that it should be pursued by way of oral answer rather than by way of written answer.  Now it is proposed to change the time limit to four months but that is a very marginal change because the thing may be just as irrevelant after four months as it is after six months.</P>
    <P>I regard that as unsatisfactory and I do not think an oral question should be displaced in that way.  It may well be that at times when the oral question comes in and if reasonable notice is given of it that it can be arranged that an innocuous written question on the same topic can be put down and answered in order to dispose of the oral question and prevent it ever being asked.  That has had quite an effect on Question Time because it has prevented many matters of importance being raised in the House, where they should be raised.  It has caused them to be dealt with in a perfunctory and brief way, not on the floor of the House, but by way of a two or three line written answer which closes off the topic for six months.  The amendments in the motion do not deal with the problem.  I should like them to do so because it is an urgent problem and one that has taken the value out of <Col N="2288" /> Question Time.  It does it quite fortuitously simply on the basis that someone has put down a written question that has some relevance to the subsequent oral one. It is almost impossible for the average Deputy to keep track of what has been asked and answered in previous weeks because, on occasions, there are literally hundreds of written questions on the Order Paper.  The Minister of State should take steps to ensure that what he says here about parties in Opposition becomes the practice because that would be quite satisfactory.  Unfortunately, though, what he says is not correct.</P>
    <P>There is a way open to parties in Opposition, who are not the main Opposition. party, to form an artificial procedural alliance under Standing Order 85.  If such an alliance were formed it would be a procedural one for the purpose of trying to overcome the existing difficulties under Standing Orders.  It would not be in any sense a political alliance.  It is very unsatisfactory for people who have quite disparate political views to find themselves either largely silenced under the matters dealt with in this motion such as Private Members' Business, priority Questions and so on or to enter into a procedural alliance of convenience.  That is not satisfactory and one should not have to resort to an artificial operation of that kind in order to be able to exercise one's rights in this House.</P>
    <P>On the question of Private Members' Bills referred to in the motion and the amendments, it is unsatisfactory that a Bill for which there is very substantial support in the country and put forward as a Private Members' Bill cannot even be debated in this House, let alone passed or rejected as the House thinks fit.  There are a number of such Bills on the Order Paper, one put forward by the Progressive Democrats dealing with Oireachtas and ministerial pensions for which there is substantial support in the country but which, apparently, is opposed by the two Government parties and the main Opposition party.  Their method of opposing it is to use Standing Orders as they are &mdash; and as they will continue to be if this motion is passed &mdash;<Col N="2289" /> and not going into the lobbies of the House to vote on it having discussed it. They use this procedural device under Standing Orders to prevent the Bill from being debated and passed.  There is also a Bill in the name of The Workers' Party relating to bringing in nuclear, chemical and biological weapons to this country in ships or aircraft.  This proposal would have widespread support in the country and it is a great pity that it cannot be debated and then either enacted or rejected by the House.</P>
    <P>This morning an extremely important report was published by the NESC which goes to the very root of the problems of this country.  Incidentally, it repeats many of the arguments I and my colleagues have been making over the past 12 months.  That report is surely one of the most important documents of its kind that has appeared for some time.  Because it goes to the very root of our problems it should be debated in the House. However, there is no prospect of that happening which is most regrettable.  If a similar report were produced in another country which found itself in the same public financial difficulties as we do, I have no doubt that it would be very rapidly debated in their Parliament.  Indeed, the Parliaments of nearly every west European country would deal with a matter of that kind very rapidly.  The only prospects within the rules of order of making references to that report might be on an adjournment debate immediately before Christmas.  In the meantime we will spend time discussing matters which are peripheral to the real difficulties facing us.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the suggestion I made in the House a week or two ago and which is now contained in one of Deputy De Rossa's amendments, that is, that the House should sit on Fridays to discuss Private Members' Bills, is a perfectly reasonable one.  If the House does not want to sit on Fridays it could sit, as suggested in another amendment, on Tuesday mornings to deal with these matters. It is not unreasonable to ask for that especially when the recesses &mdash; especially in the summer &mdash; are so long.  The <Col N="2290" /> summer recess is extraordinarily long by any standards.  It would not be necessary for every Member of the House to be present and if a vote arose on any of these matters it could take place at another time as is already done in regard to Estimates. We describe ourselves in this House as sitting on a Tuesday.  However, when Question Time is left out and the inevitable ten or 15 minutes which the Order of Business seems to take nowadays, the public business of the day does not really begin until 4 p.m. and ends at 7 p.m. when Private Member's Business begins and it ends at 8.30 p.m.  That means, in effect, that there are three hours available on a Tuesday for legislative business.</P>
    <P>I do not think that anyone, by any stretch of the imagination, could describe a three hour day as a full day.  It is an illusion to describe it in that way.  It would be more meaningful if the House sat on Tuesday mornings, taking public business in the afternoon, to deal with Estimates, Private Members' Bills and motions etc. Private Members' time which is now available on Tuesday and Wednesday evenings should be made available for public business when legislation could be debated.  There is a long list of Bills on the Order Paper.  I know that the Government do not want to proceed with many of them because they have lost their enthusiasm for them and because there is disagreement within the Government parties on a number of them.  Leaving those Bills out there are many other Bills which have not been dealt with.  If we are going to have a general election in the very near future, as most people seem to think, most of the Bills on the Order Paper will never be touched again in this present Dáil.</P>
    <P>Let me give a brief history of one of those Bills to show how slow the legislative process is.  I refer to No. 37 on today's Order Paper, The Bankruptcy Bill, 1982, which is on Report Stage.  That Bill was introduced in the House in 1982. It is not a controversial or an opposed Bill.  It is a very technical but necessary Bill because our bankruptcy laws date <Col N="2291" /> from the 1860s and 1880s when commercial circumstances were totally different from what they are now.  When I was Minister for Justice that Bill was handed to me in draft form in 1972 by the late Mr. Justice Gardner Budd who was chairman of a committee which had been set up in the late sixties to look into the modernisation of our bankruptcy laws which were then 100 years out of date. That committee were asked to propose amendments and draft a new Bill.  They did so and they handed it to me in late 1972.  I handed it over to the Department of Justice and asked them to put it through Government procedures and produce it in the House in early 1973.</P>
    <P>The Bill saw the light of day in the House in 1982, ten years after it was drafted.  This Bill did not have to go through the ordinary procedure in having to be drafted in the parliamentary drafts-man's office; it was actually drafted by a group of people who were then the leading experts on bankruptcy law in Ireland and who were in a better position to draft the Bill than anybody else.  The Bill saw the light of day in the House ten years after it was handed to the relevant Minister and now four years again after that it still has not been enacted by this House although no one has any objections to its provisions.  It is now 14 years since the Bill was drafted and 17 years since the request was made to have the Bill drafted and a committee set up to do so.</P>
    <P>This is the legislative process of Dáil Éireann in the eighties.  I do not think it is satisfactory.  Report Stage of the Bankruptcy Bill could go through this House in three, four or five hours.  I doubt if it would take much longer than that.  The points which would be made would be technical and they would not be made in any spirit of animosity or in any party political spirit.  The Bill is still there four years after it was introduced in the House and 14 years after its drafting was completed. In the meantime there is the farcical situation in the country with regard to personal bankruptcies where the laws of the 1860s apply.  That is only one example from the Order Paper.  I could <Col N="2292" /> go through a number of other Bills which one might have thought could be easily enacted.  The possibility of their being passed in the present Dáil is fairly remote.  Therefore, the question of sitting hours should be much more actively reviewed than is the case at present when we have very short periods of sittings.  To describe Tuesday as a working day in this House is a misnomer because, in fact, it is only three hours.  It is rather meaningless. Either the House could sit on Tuesday mornings and do a full day's business or alternatively if it does not want to do that it could sit on Friday mornings and do at least a half day's business up until 1.30 p.m. or 2 p.m.  Anything would be better than the present system where urgent and non-controversial legislation lies here for years on end.</P>
    <P>There is another Bill on the Order Paper which proposes to abolish juries which got its Second Reading in the House, as far as I can recall, last May but which we are told has been precluded by the pressures of the parliamentary timetable from proceeding any further. Apparently, the Government are totally committed to the Bill.  When I said that the Bill proposed to abolish juries I meant to abolish juries in civil cases, in the assessment of damages.  I did not mean in criminal trials.  The Bill's Committee and Final stages have not come forward. Factories are closing down, frequently because they have no insurance.  More of them are continuing to work without insurance and as soon as there is a serious accident in one of them the business will close down.</P>

      <P>It is very important to have that Bill brought forward and passed as quickly as possible.  I am referring to No. 44 on today's Order Paper, Courts (Supplemental Provisions) (Amendment) Bill, 1984.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome this proposal so far as it goes <Col N="2293" /> but it should go rather further than it does.  When the motion is passed, whether with or without the proposed amendments, I hope a copy of the full up-to-date Standing Orders will be printed and circulated to Deputies as rapidly as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I welcome this opportunity to review Standing Orders in so far as there is not a day's sitting that goes by when some Member does not have difficulty with the Ceann Comhairle in his abiding by Standing Orders.  There are a number of points with which I as a backbench Deputy find frustration.  I wish to raise some points which I would like the Minister of State to reply to.  The relatively short sitting hours have been referred to in the contributions so far.  I share the view that the existing hours are very restricted.  I fully appreciate the difficulties of the Whip's office in so far as they not only have to manage on an agreed basis the affairs of the House but they also have to manage all the Members in the House on a three-line whip basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is difficult, because of the constituency commitments of TDs through being members of local authorities and other statutory bodies in their constituencies, for the Whips to have a full complement of Members in the House. We need an extension of sitting hours to deal with non-partisan business that will not involve a vote in the House but if a vote is called it could be deferred.  I am thinking of areas such as the discussion of reports of Oireachtas committees.  I am Chairman of the Joint Committee on Small Businesses.  Of the six reports we have produced only one has been debated in the House.  The Seanad have discussed all the reports and it seems most unfortunate that time could not be set aside, perhaps on a Tuesday morning when a lot of Members are in the House, to discuss matters that arise out of those reports.  It should be remembered that Members put a lot of work into those reports on a non-partisan basis.  The committee system has been one of the positive developments of Dáil reform but it just stops at that and it is left to each <Col N="2294" /> Government Department to pursue matters raised in the reports.</P>
    <P>I should like to see reform in regard to Private Members' Bills.  At Westminister they have a well established lottery system under which Bills introduced by Members are brought forward.  For example, my Bill on the Order Paper, Retail Sales Below Cost (Groceries) Bill, has been there for some months awaiting an order for Second Stage.  I am happy that the Minister for Industry and Commerce will be able to deal with that directly but a backbencher pursuing a Private Members' Bill, if he is lucky enough to get a letter from the Whip to get it on the Order Paper, if he is lucky enough to get agreement from the Opposition to put it into Private Members' Business and if he is lucky enough to get a Second Stage debate &mdash; these are all very big &ldquo;ifs&rdquo;&mdash; will find that the Bill will be sent to a select committee of the House to be studied before Committee Stage is taken.  There is no way that a Private Members' Bill can get through unless it is taken wholeheartedly by the Opposition.</P>
    <P>When looking at legislation we must bear in mind that the structure of legislation here is that the base of power is in the Dáil; the Seanad has very limited powers.  Within the Dáil the base of power is operated by Government business. That presupposes that the legislative wisdom in the country lies in the Civil Service, something I do not accept.  They should have the right to vet any legislation but there are other sources which Members can pursue outside the House. Members can get professional advice outside and bring forward legislation that is not contentious or party political and which would be for the good of the country. While welcoming this revision of Standing Orders I appeal to the Whips to try some other changes on an experimental basis.  There is no need to put them down in the diktat of Standing Orders that are subsequently almost immutable.  The changes may not work but we should experiment.  For example, if some Members have an interest in legislation banning below cost selling they <Col N="2295" /> could discuss it on a Friday and if the Opposition decide to oppose a Bill on that topic the division could be deferred.  In that way the House would become more efficient and we would increase the throughput of legislation here.  At the moment there is no facility for getting Bills through other than through the Government.  I do not say that in any tone of criticism but as a matter of fact.</P>
    <P>When the Dáil is in recess matters arise from time to time for which there is little or no accountability and it should be possible for the written answer procedure to continue during that time.  Departments could be given two weeks to answer a written question on any matter during recess.  Such a procedure would give Ministers an opportunity to make statements of detail in regard to important matters.</P>
    <P>One matter that is of grave concern to me is the decision to disallow a number of questions I have tabled in regard to semi-State bodies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been told that the reason for refusing my questions is that the Minister does not have any responsibility to the House in relation to the companies concerned.  However, that same Minister gets money from the House. The Minister is responsible for allocating money to semi-State bodies either through the public capital programme or through moving a Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not agree more with the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>For example, in regard to the ESB or CIE the original Act setting up those companies was passed by the House.  When the Ceann Comhairle disallows a question about those companies he is saying that under Standing Orders the House does not have any accountability over companies or bodies established by the House.  If the House does not have accountability over those bodies, who has?  Is it the Minister?  In turn, who is the Minister accountable to? <Col N="2296" /> Is he accountable to the media or some type of nebulous interest?  The position in regard to semi-State companies is most unsatisfactory and there should be a change in the Dáil questions procedure, on a written or oral basis, so that matters of significant public importance could be raised with the Ministers who had a <i>de facto</i> responsibility in the area.  Alternatively, other bodies should be established to police Semi-State bodies with whom Deputies could raise questions.  At present there is little or no accountability for not only tens of millions of pounds, hundreds of millions of pounds but, in some cases, sums in excess of £1 billion of State borrowing is being entered into by companies who are not answerable to the House in any way.</P>
      <P>I am not satisfied with the procedure in regard to Supplementary Estimates. Last week I had a difficulty with the Chair in regard to the Supplementary Estimate on Energy.  The Minister said he would not answer the questions I raised and the Ceann Comhairle ruled the discussion out of order.  On the rare occasions when Supplementary Estimates are taken we should be afforded an opportunity to have a fuller debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Whips should get together to try to find ways of allocating time to discuss Oireachtas reports and to allow for the possibility of Private Members' Bills being debated.  Deputy De Rossa complained that he failed to get a Bill discussed and that is bad but what is worse is that if it was discussed it would not be passed by the House.  The same applies to other Members.  There should be a facility for Members to obtain written replies to questions in recess time and there should be changes in regard to the accountability of semi-State bodies.  If changes are made in those areas the House will be more relevant to the public and Deputies will be able to participate more fully, as they have done in the committee structure.  At the moment one gets the impression when making a contribution on Second Stage that one is talking in a vacuum.  One's level of contribution is very limited.  It is a case of restoring power to the House because <Col N="2297" /> power has moved out to the different Departments across the city and throughout the country.  That is an unwelcome development because at the end of the day the only people who are accountable to the public are the Members of the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. Barrett,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Dún Laoghaire</i>): I should like to thank Members who contributed to the debate. I do not in any way suggest that we should be on the defensive when discussing the way we should run our business in the House.  Therefore, it is not a question of the Government opposing good suggestions from either side of the House in relation to Dáil reform.  I would be only too delighted to take on board some of the suggestions that have been made.  It may be possible in the future to bring in more changes on the lines suggested and I will be only too delighted to do that.</P>
      <P>I would like to deal with some of the points made.  Deputy Vincent Brady, Opposition Chief Whip, was somewhat critical of the lack of Dáil reform.  In fairness I should outline that we have done a fair bit in a short time.  We have introduced the new committee system which is working reasonably well and in future we can have a look at it to see if we could improve on it.  We now have a new parliamentary question system and the new format for debating Estimates. We have introduced broadcasting which is a great step forward.  I join with Deputy Brady in saying that I am very pleased with the public response to Dáil broadcasting and hope that in future we will see it extended and more time given to it.  RTE might put out their programme earlier than 10 o'clock in the evening because there is obvious interest in that programme.  I hope that in the not too distant future we will see television in here allowing the public the opportunity of watching on their screens what is happening here.  There may be a difference of opinion among Members as to whether that is advisable, but I am in favour of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been some progress in regard to debates on reports.  There is a <Col N="2298" /> motion on the Order Paper to extend sitting hours on a Tuesday.

        <i>(Dún Laoghaire):</i> We have an explanatory memorandum now for all Bills.  That is in progress also.  It is on the Order Paper.  More information will have to be given in relation to Bills coming before the House and Private Members' Bills.  There is at present before the CPP a proposal to have Friday sittings to deal with Private Members' Bills at least once per month.  That proposal before the CPP is being examined and Standing Orders are being drawn up to bring about its implementation.  I hope it will be before this Dáil in the very near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is not bad, given that previously there was practically nothing in terms of Dáil reform.  I join with Deputy Brady in relation to a point he made about the number of questions that are taken here on a daily basis.  At the CPP we discussed this recently and it was agreed that party Whips would support the Ceann Comhairle in limiting the number of supplementary questions put by Deputies here at Question Time.  On a number of occasions we have seen that Question Time is now more like a debate than seeking information through parliamentary <Col N="2299" /> questions.  Ministers do not deliberately set out to give long replies in order to reduce the number of questions which may be taken.  Those replies have to be given anyway so their length is irrelevant.  We are trying to give adequate information so that we will limit the necessity for a number of supplementaries. Unfortunately, we have got into the habit here that once you table a question you feel obliged to ask a number of supplementary questions irrespective of whether you have got adequate information.  It is entirely for the Chair to decide whether the Deputy who has asked the question has got sufficient information.</P>
    <P>In relation to Deputy De Rossa's amendments, which unfortunately I cannot accept for reasons which I will outline, I am delighted with Deputy De Rossa.  I recall a debate 12 months ago when he was highly critical of this new Question Time.  I welcome the fact that he was big enough to say that it worked better than he thought it would and that there was no deliberate attempt to exclude small parties like The Workers' Party from being able to ask a PQ.  The Workers' Party have been extremely fortunate in the way their Questions have come out of the lottery.  They are very lucky and I suggest that the first day national lottery tickets go on sale they buy one.</P>

He failed to recognise that we are extending Dáil sitting times on Tuesdays from 8.30 p.m. to 10.30 p.m.  He failed to explain that on numerous occasions when the Dáil sessions are in progress we have special sittings every Friday.  He failed to explain that on numerous occsions over the last three or four years when I was <Col N="2300" /> Whip, and I was working with Deputy Brady, the same thing was happening, the Dáil sat till midnight on numerous occasions and it is a regular occurrence here that, even though Standing Orders say that the Dáil shall sit until 8.30 p.m. on Tuesday and Wednesday and until 5 p.m. on Thursday, Whips come in and by agreement Dáil sitting times are extended to midnight.  Such irresponsible remarks lead to the public perception that Deputy De Rossa talked about.  It is very unfortunate that the same Deputy picks up his newspaper and his Order Paper and walks out of the Chamber having made his onslaught and is not even here so that I can inform him in order that in future he will not make such wild statements.  I hope that those remaining on the press gallery will report to those who left shortly after he had finished that we sit on a regular basis till midnight and on Fridays and we are extending the sitting hours on Tuesdays from 8.30 p.m. to 10.30 p.m.</P>
      <P>I will be delighted to consult at any time with The Workers' Party or any party in relation to ideas they may have on Dáil reform.  I think that any time they contacted us they found that we tried to pass on the information they sought or give them a reason as to why perhaps a suggestion could not be implemented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a proposal to have time available on a Friday in future to take Private Members' Bills.  Deputy O'Malley was also very scathing about how difficult it is for Private Members' Bills to be taken in the Dáil.  It is very peculiar that he should say that because he was chairman of an informal committee on Dáil procedure in 1972, and the same chairman produced a report: &ldquo;Private Member to be allowed to initiate Bill without leave of the House if nominated by group and if no other Bill sponsored by group before the House.&rdquo;  He chaired the committee which brought in the Standing Order that a certain number is needed to form a group and that a party must consist of at least seven members.  He is highly critical of us today and says that small groups cannot be heard in this Parliament.  He chaired the committee which brought <Col N="2301" /> that position about.  The only recommendation that committee made in relation to Dáil sitting hours was that the Dáil should sit on Church holidays.</P>
    <P>He was very critical of the fact that a matter of public importance could not be repeated for six months and he was glad that we were making a petty change and reducing the time to four months.  The chairman of the committee who introduced that six month rule was Deputy O'Malley.  The committee recommended that the reopening of discussion on a matter discussed within the preceding six months be prohibited.  I wonder why people make such statements?  Are they sincere in their belief or are they just making political points?</P>
    <P>I suggest that he look at the number of hours the Dáil sat when he was Chief Whip.  The record speaks for itself.  Perhaps it is just as well he is not here to hear the reply because he would not like to have to listen to it.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dún Laoghaire):</i> I am sure he will read it in the Official Report. In relation to the amendments put down by The Workers' Party their proposal to bring forward the sitting hours to 10.30 a.m. on a Tuesday is not realistic and I hope they accept the fact that extending the hours at the other end of the day is a better proposition.  We had thought of bringing forward the sitting hours but after discussions with members of the Opposition it was felt it was better to extend the sitting.  Some of us are fortunate to represent Dublin constituencies but those who have to travel from Goleen or north Donegal would have to leave on a Monday in order to be here at 10.30 a.m. on a Tuesday.  A number of Members are also members of local authorities and have to attend to constituency work on a Monday.  For that reason we are not proposing that the Tuesday sitting be brought forward to 10.30 a.m.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the point made by Deputy Yates, we are extending the sitting <Col N="2302" /> hours specifically for the taking of committee reports.  There is a motion on the Order Paper which will be taken next Thursday, I understand from the Opposition Whip by agreement, without debate.</P>
    <P>As regards Friday sittings the Dáil regularly sits on a Friday.  It is more usual for that to happen after Christmas but if the Whips consider it necessary there is no reason we cannot have sittings on a Friday.  It is not incorporated in Standing Orders but if the motion in relation to the taking of Private Members' Bills is accepted by the House Standing Orders will be amended to make it possible for sittings on Friday for the taking of Private Members' Bills.</P>
    <P>The purpose of amendments Nos. 3, 4 and 5 is to enable The Workers' Party to qualify for priority Questions and to limit the number of priority Questions to two per party.  If a party in Opposition have far more Members than any other party it is only reasonable that they would get more time; being the bigger party, they represent more people.  What we are being asked to do is to treat a party consisting of two Members in the same way as a party with 70 Members.  That is not equitable or reasonable.  The definition of a group as comprising seven or more Members is a long standing one.  It goes back to the committee chaired by Deputy O'Malley and was incorporated in Standing Orders in 1974.  Given the increase in the number of Deputies since 1974 a case could be made for increasing the numerical requirement.  It is open to those Members who are not members of a party with more than seven Members to form themselves into a group and avail of the rights which exist under Standing Orders for a group consisting of more than seven Members of the Dáil.  That is open to The Workers' Party, to the Progressive Democrats and to the Independents.</P>
    <P>The purpose of amendment No. 6 is to enable a Member who has put down a lottery Question which is subsequently grouped with a priority Question to join in the supplementaries to that question. I have some sympathy with what the <Col N="2303" /> Deputy says.  I will have a look at it and discuss it with the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  The problem is that we do not get through enough questions. A lottery Question could not be grouped with a priority Question if the lottery Question was taken first.  A lottery Question which is not reached can be joined onto a priority Question later on. The answer to the problem is to get through all the Questions on the Order Paper.  If Deputies were more co-operative with the Chair that would be feasible. I hope the appeal made by the Whips of the main parties will be listened to and that we will get through the maximum number of Questions possible.</P>
    <P>I have dealt with the points raised by Deputy O'Malley.  There must be some number and seven is reasonable bearing in mind the fact that the number of Members has increased since 1974.  As I have said, it is open to those who are not members of an Opposition party to form themselves into a group of more than seven and avail of their rights under Standing Orders.  That is something they must decide for themselves.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley was highly critical of the fact that the House only does Legislature business for three hours on a Tuesday. The Dáil will now sit from 2.30 p.m. to 10.30 p.m. minimum when the Order is passed next week.  That is an eight hour sitting but of that time only three hours will be taken up by the Government. Seven hours will be given to other business. One and a quarter hours will be given for Question Time, one and a half hours for Private Members' Time and three hours for committee work.  In relation to that, rather than having committee reports debated in this House, there is no reason committees should not have an open session where Members who are not members of the committee could attend and where the Minister could be invited to attend.  The report could then be discussed and the time of the House would not be taken up.  It could be used for something else.  The same result would be achieved in the end. <Col N="2304" /> Committees should look at that possibility.</P>
    <P>In reply to Deputy O'Malley's charge that the recesses are too long it should be remembered that all committees now sit during the months of July and September. Some of those committees sat on numerous occasions during the recess and a great deal of work was done, and will be done in the future.  I reject what I would term cheap party political comment for the sake of getting a line in the press, because it is giving the public a wrong impession of what we are trying to achieve.  Nobody can deny we are sitting longer hours and that we have formed committees which sit when the Dáil is in recess and that the media are reporting the findings and the work of those committees. What I am saying is backed up by evidence.  There are people who will avail of any opportunity to convey an impression to the public that we are doing nothing.  That is totally and utterly unfair and unreasonable and I hope the press, when reporting this debate, will take what I have said into account for the sake of giving proper information to the public.  I am extremely annoyed that the said gentleman picked up his papers and walked out of this Chamber before I had a chance to reply to his cheap political comments.</P>
    <P>Every effort has been made by the Whips over the last number of years to extend sitting hours, to make this Chamber more relevant and to introduce a committee system which I believe in years to come will be just as important as discussion in this Chamber.  If I am around, I will support the extension of the powers of committees and their ability to bring forward more ideas and suggestions for whoever are in Government.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley also said that matters crop up from time to time which should be debated, and he referred to the NESC report.  When I was Whip, both in Opposition and in Government, I worked with both Deputy Bertie Ahern and Deputy Vincent Brady and on many occasions we had special debates when, on the Order of Business a Deputy suggested that a <Col N="2305" /> particular matter necessitated urgent debate.  We provided time regularly for special debates by suspending Standing Orders.  If Deputy O'Malley is so concerned about the NESC report, he could have raised this matter on the Order of Business this morning and asked that the Dáil give special time to debate that report.  The record will show that in the past three or four years we have introduced a number of special debates in areas where the Opposition of the day thought it necessary to have a special debate and we suspended business as ordered to enable those debates to take place.  There is no reason that that procedure cannot continue.  I sincerely hope it continues.  Every Deputy is entitled to ask for a special debate if he thinks the matter is important enough and if he gets the support of the Government and the Opposition Whips.  There is no reason such a debate cannot take place because it is not necessary to write everything into Standing Orders.  They are only a guideline.  There is a lot of merit in having these debates because they show the public that we are aware of what is happening and that we are prepared to debate a live issue rather than letting it lie for a number of months.</P>
    <P>I think I have dealt with all the points raised by Deputy O'Malley.  I have answered the questions raised by Deputy Yates dealing with hours, committee reports &mdash; they will be debated on Tuesday evenings &mdash; and Private Members' Bills.  I will investigate the possibility of having written Questions taken while the Dáil is in recess.  This is a valid point and we should look at it.  As regards questions on State companies, these are disallowed. The only thing I can say is that I will make inquiries about this matter, but State companies have their own chief executive officers, boards of directors and chairmen and they must be answerable for the working of their State bodies. It would be wrong to convey the impression to the public that the Minister of the day is responsible for the day to day running of these State bodies when we are paying salaries to the chief executives <Col N="2306" /> and when they also have boards of directors and chairmen.  However, it is wrong to say State companies cannot be investigated because we have two committees who regularly investigate the activities of State bodies &mdash; the Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies and the Committee on Public Expenditure.</P>
    <P>Whether we use the parliamentary Question system or the committee system to investigate is open to debate.  I suggest that the committee system is the better way because Question Time is for the purpose of getting information which can be supplied by the Minister of the day in a letter.  This is something we should clear up once and for all.  I will take on board the views that have been expreseed.</P>
    <P>I hope I have replied to all the points made and I recommend the motion to the House.</P>

    <Title>Transport (Re-organisation of Córas Iompair Éireann) Bill, 1986  [  Seanad ]:   Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Minister for Communications (Mr. J. Mitchell) Jim Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Communications (Mr. J. Mitchell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Córas Iompair Éireann is undergoing an exciting period of change and development. This Bill is a major milestone in the evolution of the board and the public transport services operated by it.  The changes which I am proposing now in relation to CIE amount to an historical step equal in importance to the step taken in 1944 when legislation founding CIE was enacted.  There are striking differences between the two events.  The calendar alone demonstrates that the planning for the establishment of CIE was undertaken in a war time situation where all judgments were uncertain.  Prophecies of what might happen in the years following the end of the war were completely speculative.  The fact that CIE succeeded at all is a tribute to the planners of those far-off days.</P>
      <P>In their thinking, it is fair to say, financial considerations took great precedence. The conventional wisdom of the twenties and thirties in the failing public transport industry was that the strong could help the weak.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2310" /> Our planners believed then, and for the best part of 20 years thereafter, that an industry which through no fault of its own could no longer survive, mainly due to increasing costs and a threatened market, would be sustained and maintained by the cash contributions of strong members such as Dublin buses, and by a multiplicity of secondary elements such as line cross-subsidisation.  There were further expected benefits based on concepts like economies of scale, or integration which, in the transport area, are not as relevant as many believe them to be and probably played only a limited part.</P>
    <P>The money end worked reasonably well for nearly 20 years.  It was in the early sixties that it was finally acknowledged by the then Minister, the late Erskine Childers, that CIE had to go the way of national transport systems in almost all countries and depend on a permanent rail subvention.</P>
    <P>The management and market assumptions were less sound than the financial ones.  It suffices to distinguish between those planning days 40 years ago, when there was virtually no private transport at all, and the market of today where private transport occupies an overwhelming position.  It is extremely difficult to see how a unified management structure such as that which grew up between 1944 and more recent times coped at all with the increasing complexities of economic and social life and the pressures and changes internal to itself.</P>
    <P>The complaints so often heard about CIE have originated as much in the management and market sectors, including the work of serving the market, as in any other.  I see my role in relation to CIE in three aspects: (i) I have to get the subsidy right &mdash; it must never again revert to the excesses of growth that characterised the seventies.  The correction process is well in hand but more has to be done; (ii) the overall direction of the undertaking has to be got right; and (iii) service of the market has to be got right.  The Bill deals with the second and third points.</P>
    <P>The financial arguments based on cross <Col N="2311" /> supports for holding CIE together were exposed to chill reality 20 years ago.  In all respects every major activity started to head for losses.  The management of CIE became increasingly pre-occupied with the financial struggle and their reputation in the market had to suffer.  With the ending of the financial argument for an amalgamated system there were questions that might be asked about the system itself but they seemed to escape notice.  It did not really emerge that running a railway company was not the same task as running a provincial bus service and that the demands and needs of these two were different from the demands of a major urban transport system which in the case of Ireland and Dublin had always been a self-contained and distinctive activity until the creation of CIE.</P>
    <P>It amazes me that a relatively small central management team kept the whole unwieldy structure going at all or managed to deal on any rational basis with all the problems of infrastructure, rolling stock, supplies, staffing, industrial relations and service.  The thought applies not alone to distinctive major activities on rail and road but out to the fringes of tour management, hotel operation, running Rosslare, keeping the canals passable and running ships to the Aran Islands.</P>
    <P>The Board and Management of CIE were not invariably helped by Government. I do not wish to recite faults in government of any party.  I can say, however, that this vast agglomeration could have been helped often by clear delineation of what Government expected from it, by some better financial judgments and by less interference with the revenue earning plans of the undertaking.</P>
    <P>I have no hesitation in complimenting CIE for the benefits they did produce during what I think should now be identified as years of struggle.  And I am happy to put this positive aspect against the criticisms which have been made often and which I, occasionally, found it necessary to make.  I also give the highest praise to the whole hearted effort by CIE at all <Col N="2312" /> levels to implement and bring to fruition the changes I have already introduced.  I know I can rely on a continuation of this effort to bring about this more or less final set of necessary improvements.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for retention of CIE as the parent of three new operating subsidiary companies registered under the Companies Acts.  The new companies will have full responsibility under the board of CIE for the operations of the railways, Dublin city bus services and provincial bus services.</P>
    <P>I think it would be useful to describe in a little more detail how CIE have developed over the years.  CIE were established on 1 January 1945 and resulted from the dissolution of the Great Southern Railways Company and the Dublin United Tramway Company Limited and the transfer of the undertakings of the dissolved companies to the new company, Córas Iompair Éireann.  Thus, the Transport Act, 1944, brought about the incorporation of Corás Iompair Éireann as a State-sponsored transport company and the country's principal transport operator.  The Transport Act, 1950, established Córas Iompair Éireann as a statutory board to replace the State-sponsored company and the Grand Canal Company.</P>
    <P>In the Great Northern Railway Act, 1958, the Great Northern Railways undertakng within the State was amalgamated with CIE.  At that time the board had responsibility for the railways, passengers and freight, bus services in Dublin and the provinces, road freight, coach and tour services and canals.  Their mandate embraced Rosslare Harbour, a number of hotels and the Galway-Aran ferry serivce.  Later legislation made some small adjustments to the CIE role and mandate.  These adjustments included the transfer of Great Southern Hotels, then a big loss maker from CIE to CERT in 1984 and the transfer of canals earlier this year to the Office of the Public Works.  However, the statutory structure of the organisation remained intact.</P>
    <P>Over the years, CIE have adapted their <Col N="2313" /> services to meet the needs of the times. The early fifties brought a major dieselisation programme.  Since then rolling stock has been periodically updated and the current mainline carriage programme commenced in late 1982 and involving the construction of a fleet of air conditioned carriages, is in progress at the CIE Inchicore works.  As a native of Inchicore I was delighted to be able to give the final go-ahead for that programme.  These new carriages and the upgrading of track and signalling systems have reduced journey times and improved very considerably standards of passenger comfort.  The Howth-Bray railway has been electrified at a cost of £113 million and this development has brought the railways right up to date in technological terms &mdash; the DART service is technically among the most advanced of its kind in the world.</P>
    <P>There has been periodic updating and replacement of CIE's urban and rural bus fleets.  Since 1980 CIE have undertaken a major programme of bus replacement and since then about 800 new buses have been purchased by the board at a cost of about £100 million.  Fifty new tour coaches were acquired by the board for this year's tourist season and for the CIE cross-channel Supabus services.  These are major capital investments but they had to be matched with station and garage renewals and the acquisition of ancillary equipment to ensure that maintenance and support services were upgraded in line with needs.  So it will be seen that CIE have had a lot of renewal in recent years.</P>
    <P>Against their financial background, it is not surprising that down through the years CIE have been the subject of a number of in-depth studies, the most recent being the McKinsey study &ldquo;The Transport Challenge&rdquo; published in February 1981.  When I was appointed Minister with responsibility for transport matters in late 1982 the serious situation in regard to the CIE finances and indeed in relation to the overall image and effectiveness of CIE was one of my immediate priorities.  The deficit had spiralled and in the period between 1969-1970 and 1982, during which the consumer price index <Col N="2314" /> had increased by a factor of only 5.4, the deficit had increased from £3.234 million to £109.373 million, a factor of 33.8 &mdash; over six times more than inflation.</P>
    <P>These facts dictated that, on coming to office in late 1982, I set to work immediately on the financial problems and simultaneously began to look at the CIE organisation in the context of the McKinsey recommendations.  As a first step in tackling the financial problems, the Government approved in June 1983 a package of measures, which I proposed, aimed at not only reducing CIE's cost to the Exchequer over a five year period but also paving the way for a new operating environment in CIE.  These measures included a new basis for determining the CIE subvention which now limits it effectively to one-third of the board's expenditure. This was in CIE's interest as well as the Exchequer's.  The package also provided for the payment of the subvention &ldquo;above the line&rdquo; in recognition of CIE's social role in providing commercially unprofitable, but socially desirable services.</P>
    <P>Expenditure restrictions were imposed on CIE as a means of introducing cash limits to contain costs.  An obligation was placed on CIE to reduce the level of their expenditure in real terms by 2½ per cent per annum up to 1988 and the purpose of the formula was to obtain a reducing subvention in line with a reducing expenditure. For 1983, 1984 and 1985 I am glad to say the targets have been met or bettered and this is a cause for congratulation to all in CIE and to all in my Department.  After taking account of the State subvention in 1985 the board returned a surplus of close to £7 million, that is to say that CIE beat the target set for it by £7 million.  The target itself was 2½ per cent below that for 1984 after allowing for inflation whereas between 1969 and 1982 the deficit had gone up by an annual average of 17 per cent above the inflation rate.  The 1985 results represent a very fine achievement and a reflection of the hard work put into CIE in the past three years.  So far in 1986 CIE are again on target.</P>
    <P>During questions in the House on 6 <Col N="2315" /> November I promised Deputy Wilson to include in my speech today further details on the Exchequer subvention to CIE for 1985.</P>
    <P>Before dealing with the subvention, I wish to mention the arrangements between CIE and the Departments of Defence, Education and Social Welfare for the carriage by the board of certain categories of passengers at State expense. In the case of the Department of Defence, CIE received £1.9 million in 1985 for providing travel for veterans of the War of Independence, civil servants of the first and second Dáil and certain widows.  They received £20.6 million from the Department of Education for school transport services provided by the board themselves and £23.8 million from the Department of Social Welfare for travel for invalidity pensioners, recipients of the disabled person's maintenance allowance, blind adults and persons aged 66 or over.  The total for these services amounted to £46.3 million.  This is treated in the CIE accounts in the same way as receipts from other passengers and is included under passenger traffic receipts.</P>
    <P>As regards the Exchequer subvention of £115 million, this is made up of £104 million for normal subvention, £8 million for interest charges on DART and £3 million to cover the repayment of principal for 1985 on a £30 million loan.  The £104 million was allocated as follows: Railways other than DART, £75.6 million; DART, £7.0 million; Dublin Bus Services, £16.8 million; Provincial City Bus Services, £2.1 million; Other Provincial Bus Services, £0.3 million; Canals, £1.4 million; Galway-Aran Ferry Service, £0.8 million.</P>
    <P>In addition to setting the financial targets for CIE, the Government also decided it was necessary to supplement the Board's mandate to ensure that the national economic situation and Government objectives were fully reflected in the formulation and development of board policies.  A number of specific objectives were identified for CIE and included:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  to review in depth all aspects of <Col N="2316" /> CIE's operations in the interests of reducing the board's dependence on State subvention;</P>
    <P>(ii)  to review the effectiveness and organisation of CIE management and to undertake any restructuring found necessary;</P>
    <P>(iii)  to regard the improvement of staff morale and motivation throughout CIE as a major aim;</P>
    <P>(iv)  to extend and strengthen the role of the financial control function so as to improve the cost effectiveness of expenditure;</P>
    <P>(v)  to review board policy in relation to capital works and proposals for new developments; and</P>
    <P>(vi)  to arrange at maximum advantage to the board's financial position the disposal of surplus assets or the development of those assets by third parties.</P>
    <P>When the package of measures was in place it was then necessary to turn to fundamental issues.  McKinseys had come to a number of conclusions based on the decline in the board's market share and projections.  They recommended:</P>
    <P>&mdash;complete disestablishment of CIE into three separate organisations;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the introduction of one-person-operation in the Dublin city bus services; the closing of CIE road freight operations, and the elimination of the sundries rail service;</P>
    <P>&mdash;centralising freight management to Dublin with operations limited to bulk traffic and the carriage of dangerous goods; and</P>
    <P>&mdash;dismantling of the company's area management structure.</P>
    <P>Having considered the future of CIE in the context of the McKinsey report, other related documents, observations furnished in response to the report and the views of the Chairman of CIE, the Government were convinced that a major reform of the CIE organisation was essential.  While many of the consultants' conclusions were found to be valid, the McKinsey recommendation for the disestablishment of CIE was rejected <Col N="2317" /> because of the value perceived in a single board continuing to have overall control of the organisation's operations.</P>
    <P>Another option considered was the re-organisation of CIE's responsibilities as an internal CIE matter without new legislation. It was rejected also because such a response was not considered sufficiently far reaching to give the results desired. The route chosen by the Government had a number of main objectives: first, to keep the deficit under control without major disruption to services or employment; secondly, to improve morale and the working environment generally in CIE; thirdly, to improve the reliability and attractiveness of services at the lowest possible fares and fourthly, to obtain greater transparency of the allocation of costs between the various CIE activities.</P>
    <P>In the light of this, the Government decided that the reform of CIE must be such as to transform CIE into smaller, more compact operating organisations, with clearly defined functions; hence the provisions of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Re-organisation is not the whole story.  For clarity it was also necessary to set financial objectives for such an enterprise.  As a result the Government announced their intentions in <i>Building on Reality 1985-1987</i> in October 1984. Members of the House will recall some of the main elements of the Government decisions, which covered such matters as:</P>
    <P>1.  The requirement to reduce expenditure in real terms on the railways was extended to include 1889 and the objective was revised to the reduction in real terms of railway costs by close to 20 per cent over a five year period, an average of 3.7 per cent per annum;</P>
    <P>2.  The halving again of the 1984 deficit, itself half the 1982 deficit, by 31 December 1989 in real terms was set as the objective for Dublin city bus services. That is to say that the 1989 deficit would be one quarter of that of 1982.  This aim is on target;</P>
    <P>3.  The formula for reducing costs by 2.5 per cent per annum was extended to 1989 for the provincial bus services and <Col N="2318" /> the services should become profitable by that time.  This aim is also on target.;</P>
    <P>4.  CIE rail sundries and road freight services to be discontinued by 1 January 1986 unless they proved profitable in 1984 and 1985.  I am glad to report that such is the improvement in these areas that their future is now assured.</P>
    <P>It is emphasised that the railway objective needs to be achieved without endangering rail safety.</P>
    <P>There are significant advantages in retaining the board of CIE as the parent to the three subsidiary companies.  The subsidiaries would be more manageable units having chief executives with clear objectives and targets to achieve.  The board will vet the plans of the companies, monitor their performance and assess their competing demands for investments and funds.  The board will also be an instrument for promoting an efficient, coherent overall approach to CIE transport services generally and will determine competition issues which may arise between the companies; this will avoid a situation where the CIE companies are engaged in disruptive competition with each other.  At the same time the setting up of the companies will introduce greater flexibility into the CIE organisation with each of them having their own board of directors whose objectives will be influenced mainly by the more limited mandates of the individual companies and with management closer to their staff and operations.</P>
    <P>That in summary is the background to the Bill before the House today.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, already two aspects of reorganisation have been put in place, namely, the transfer of the hotels owned by CIE to CERT and the transfer of responsibility for the Grand and Royal Canals from CIE to the Commissioners of Public Works which took place on 1 July 1986.  These changes were designed to allow CIE to concentrate more completely on their transport activities and to facilitate the reorganisation.</P>
    <P>Now we must build on the financial improvements of the past few years and turn to the more fundamental reorganisation as soon as possible.  This is <Col N="2319" /> reflected in the Bill which is not so complex as to delay its enactment but comprehensive enough to achieve the desired results.  Under the Bill, CIE, I must emphasise, will not relinquish any of their statutory powers and duties or privileges but rather will use the new subsidiaries as instruments for implementing CIE policy and as the board's agents in carrying out more effectively the functions entrusted to them by the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The Bill requires the board of CIE to establish three new operating subsidiaries responsible for railways, provincial bus services and Dublin city bus services and to register them under the Companies Acts.  It deals with the delegation of functions and responsibilities to the subsidiary companies in respect of operational matters and for the provision of rights, duties and liabilities for the subsidiaries to allow them to carry out their functions.  It sets out the principal objects of the companies and provides for the assignment of CIE staff to the new companies and the protection of conditions of employment of staff transferred.</P>
    <P>The Bill also contains provisions dealing with certain financial matters arising from the proposed reorganisation.  While I circulated an explanatory memorandum with the Bill, I would like to highlight some of the more important provisions, particularly those which involve fundamental changes for CIE.  I would also like at this point to draw the attention of the House to the fact that in the course of an interesting and constructive discussion on the Bill in Seanad Éirann I introduced a considerable number of amendments to take account to the maximum extent possible of concerns expressed by members of that House as regards the doubts and fears of the employees of CIE in regard to the reorganisation.  The net effect is that the Bill, as passed by the Seanad, is in some aspects different from that introduced.</P>
    <P>I must underline, however, that the intentions behind the Bill and the fundamental principles of the original text remain unchanged.  The detailed changes give more explicit expressions to some of <Col N="2320" /> the original provisions, particularly in the area of conditions of employment.  The revised text reflects the assurances I gave to the effect that employees transferred to the subsidiaries will find their conditions of employment unaffected by this Bill.</P>
    <P>Part I of the Bill, comprising sections 1 to 5, contains standard-type provisions of a general kind and for the repeal of certain sections of existing legislation. Section 14 of the Transport Act, 1950, which empowers the Minister to grant, by order, additional powers to the board, is being replaced by section 25 of the Bill which extends the scope of the existing provision to include specifically functions relating to the development of the assets of the board.  This is in keeping with the revised mandate given to the board by the Government in 1983.</P>
    <P>The repeal of section 35 (2) of the 1950 Act dispenses with the requirement on CIE to hold open public examinations for the recruitment of clerical staff and thus will allow greater flexibility to the board and their subsidiaries to determine recruitment policy and procedures in keeping with modern practice in major commercial and semi-State organisations. This change is something which both management and unions have been seeking for some time.</P>
    <P>Part II of the Bill, comprising sections 6 to 24, provides for the formation of the three operating subsidiary companies.  It also contains provisions relating to certain financial matters, staff transfers and protection of conditions of service and other general provisions, which are features of Acts dealing with State-sponsored bodies.</P>
    <P>Section 6 obliges the board to form and register the new limited liability companies conforming to the conditions laid down in the Bill and provides for the appointment, by order made by the Minister, of a vesting day, that is the day on which the re-organised CIE will commence operations.  This order will be irrevocable except by an amending Act of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The proposed names of the new subsidiaries are listed in section 7.  Since the <Col N="2321" /> Bill was introduced a considerable effort has been devoted to trying to find more attractive names for the companies but so far without success.  I will be glad to consider any suggestions which Members of the House may wish to offer.  Section 7 also specifies that the share capital of each of the subsidiaries shall be wholly owned by the parent board and prohibits the transfer or disposal of any share in the companies.  This clarifies beyond doubt that the purpose of the Bill is to reorganise and revitalise a State company which will continue to remain in State hands unless the Oireachtas decides otherwise on some future occasion.</P>
    <P>The Government's intention for continuing on a long term basis the national transport undertaking is also reflected in section 17 which enables the board to transfer assets to the subsidiary companies for the purposes of their operations but excludes from those assets land and buildings; these will remain in the ownership of the parent board.</P>
    <P>The principal objects of the companies and the general statutory basis for carrying out their functions subject to the directions of the parent board are set out in section 8.</P>
    <P>These provisions lead naturally into treating of the roles envisaged for the parent board and their subsidiary companies. Overall general objectives for the CIE organisation as a whole will continue to be set by the Government.  The board of CIE will settle, within overall sums provided by the Government and, well in advance, the financial targets and allocations for the subsidiaries.  In setting these allocations the board will consult with the Minister where necessary.  The annual recommendations of the new Dublin Transport Authority on transport funding, together with the authority's objectives for public transport services, will be important considerations in deciding on objectives for CIE and their subsidiaries in the Dublin area.</P>
    <P>It will be the responsibility of the board: to agree with the boards of directors of the subsidiary companies their annual budgets, including capital investments; to monitor the activities of the <Col N="2322" /> subsidiaries: to ensure that the subsidiaries achieve any financial targets set for them and to provide an assessment of the performances of the operating companies in the board's annual report to the Minister.</P>
    <P>More generally the board will be expected to foster the development of a more commercial approach across the spectrum of the activities within the overall CIE remit.  In addition to the responsibilities in relation to the subsidiaries, the board will be responsible for actively pursuing the development of CIE property and other assets, the operation of the board's International Tours Company and providing common services, such as pension schemes and computer services, etc, for the subsidiaries.  I want CIE to fully utilise their many human skills and property assets to the benefit of the board, their workforce and the public generally.</P>
    <P>I see potential for expansion here and this is something I have been encouraging the Chairman and board of CIE to pursue.  This could well be a vital contribution to the financial success of the organisation in the future and to providing the outlets for these relatively untapped, but rich, resources.</P>
    <P>The boards of directors of the subsidiary companies will be responsible under the board for the operations and activities of their companies.  This will include responsibility for finances, staff and industrial relations, marketing and customer and other services, business development, operating procedures, etc. They will be accountable to the board in regard to their performances.</P>
    <P>Specific requirements as to the articles of association are contained in section 11 which sets out particulars of the size and structure of the boards of the operating subsidiaries.  The directors will be appointed by the Chairman of CIE with the consent of the Minister, and it allows for the possibility of the chairman being appointed chairman or director of a subsidiary company or companies.</P>
    <P>Deputies will notice that I propose to limit the membership of each of the new boards to six members and to include two <Col N="2323" /> of the four members elected to the board of CIE by the CIE workforce as directors in each of the three subsidiaries.</P>
    <P>Fears were expressed in Seanad Éireann about the risks which had been associated with competition between the rail company and the national bus company. In response, I agreed to introduce an amendment providing, in subsection (4) of section 11, for a majority of the directors of these two companies to be common to both companies.  This should ensure that the boards of the companies will take full account of the interests of the individual companies in exercising their functions.  I see these boards as executive in nature in the interest of efficiency and effectiveness and this arrangement introduces into the State sector here a two-tier type board system, which in a somewhat different format has been so successful in West Germany.</P>
    <P>The value of worker directors in the State boards is now clearly established. In order, however, to avoid a situation which would cut across the electoral arrangements in CIE, the Bill includes a provision in section 14 to ensure the new structures maintain intact the total CIE constituency for electing worker directors to the board.</P>
    <P>Section 14 of the Bill also provides for the transfer of staff of the board to the companies and for the protection of their existing pay and conditions.  It empowers the board to designate existing employees for employment by a company and it obliges staff so designated to transfer to that company.  It also allows flexibility for the transfer and promotion of staff between the companies within the group. This provision highlights, yet again, the continued coherence of CIE.  This is underlined by section 15, an important provision, which enables the board of CIE to continue to organise and operate existing pension schemes for both the staff of the board and those of the companies. It provides for service with any of the companies to be treated as employment with the board for pension purposes. This should further facilitate intercompany transfers of staff in the future. <Col N="2324" /> Other important provisions in relation to staff are contained in section 11 (2) (f) which requires the companies to set up negotiating machinery for the purpose of negotiations concerned with pay and conditions of service and for every reasonable endeavour to be made to reach agreement with the trade unions concerned on that important issue.</P>
    <P>The escalation of CIE's losses between 1969 and 1982 was all the more disastrous when it is considered that overall employment in the board fell by nearly 4,000 in that period.  I am glad to be able to tell the House that I have been assured by the chairman of CIE that any further reductions will be achieved through natural wastage or where necessary by using the existing arrangements agreed with CIE trade unions concerning redundancies.</P>
    <P>The principal financial provisions of the Bill are contained in sections 19 and 20.  Section 19 is based on the usual formula for the accounts and audits of State bodies.  Section 20 outlines the borrowing powers and procedures to be followed in the case of the subsidiary companies.  I envisage, as I hope is clear from the text of the Bill, a vital role for the parent board in regard to control of borrowings by new companies.  The powers to borrow for capital purposes are being retained by the parent board because of their overall responsibility for the CIE group.</P>
    <P>Subsection (3) of section 20 prohibits the giving of State guarantees for moneys borrowed directly by the companies.  This will not hinder the subsidiaries in obtaining their capital needs as the board of CIE will be able to on-lend to their subsidiaries. They will therefore be able to carry out their capital investments in line with the capital programmes agreed by the parent board.  The guaranteeing by the State of borrowing by the CIE board is not affected.</P>
    <P>The existing statutory borrowing limits and controls will continue to apply to the new organisations as a group.  All capital borrowings will continue to be subject to the approval and control of the Ministers for Communications and Finance, subject to the overriding statutory limits <Col N="2325" /> determined from time to time by the Oireachtas.  The Bill empowers the companies to borrow temporarily, with the consent of the board, for day to day operating purposes subject to existing controls and within such statutory limits as may be determined from time to time.</P>
    <P>Section 21, on the disclosure by directors of certain interests, and section 22, on the prohibition on unauthorised disclosure of information relating to the CIE groups, resulted from suggestions made in Seanad Éireann.</P>
    <P>Section 23 of the Bill was drafted before the decision to disband the National Prices Commission was announced because experience had shown that the extent to which CIE could raise fares and rates was strongly influenced by what the market could bear and that was invariably less than what would be permissible under the national price control criteria.</P>
    <P>CIE fares and rates will, however, continue to be subject to approval by the Government.  The new Dublin Transport Authority will have a role in the approval of CIE fares increases for Dublin bus and suburban rail.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill, comprising sections 25 to 31, contains a number of provisions relating to CIE and the subsidiaries.  The statutory obligation imposed on the board by the 1950 Act to appoint a secretary and a general manager is being replaced by section 30 of the Bill which will allow the board greater flexibility in the appointment of officers and servants. This flexibility is desirable in the situation where the chairman holds office on a full-time basis and where the organisation is undergoing a period of major change and restructuring.</P>
    <P>A large organisation such as CIE have need of continuous review so that they can adapt to the various challenges as they appear.  In transport, changes can arise from many influences, including changes in technology and equipment, barriers to travel and trade, the relative competitiveness of the various transport modes and the transport preferences of the customers.</P>
    <P>The proposed re-organisation of CIE <Col N="2326" /> and the financial measures which I have outlined are designed to put the board's finances on a firmer footing and to secure the future of CIE, having due regard to what the Exchequer can afford, the interests of the taxpayer and the need to provide reliable services for the public. The Bill is designed to ensure and strengthen the future of the organisation.</P>
    <P>The re-organisation now proposed is, I am convinced, in the best interests of the travelling public, the CIE workforce and the Exchequer.  The smaller units should be susceptible to more effective management in a manner which is not possible in the case of very large and diffuse organisations and should, I hope, contribute greatly to improved industrial relations.</P>
    <P>The implementation of the re-organisation provided for in this Bill is, of course, a matter for the board of CIE in the first instance.  As I said in my opening remarks I am confident that I will have the full backing of CIE management and general workforce in carrying through the new arrangements which are so necessary for their future.  The board and management are dependent on the support of all CIE employees in order to effect a smooth transition.  The future success of the new CIE will rest squarely on the shoulders of the parent board, the subsidiary boards and the workforce. CIE and their employees have shown in recent years what it was possible to achieve in regard to CIE finances.  This inspires confidence for achieving objectives set for CIE by the Government in the years ahead.  It is relevant that in 1985 CIE have had their best year for many years.</P>
    <P>General public confidence in the transport services provided must be increased. This will be achieved mainly by improving the quality and especially the reliability of the services.  In that connection there is hardly need to emphasise the importance of a stable industrial relations climate.  I have spoken on a number of occasions about industrial relations in CIE, particularly in the Dublin City Services.  My more recent <Col N="2327" /> references were rightly devoted to improvements in that climate.</P>
    <P>Recent experiences are quite positive and augur well for the future.  The introduction of one person operated buses and DART feeder buses in Dublin, following agreement between the board of CIE and the unions, happily brought to a satisfactory conclusion that long drawn out saga.  The new structures with less remote management should also contribute to good industrial relations throughout the organisation.  Transport services which arrive on time and which are not prone to unpredictable stoppages should bring increased passenger numbers, and hopefully in time, cheaper fares.</P>
    <P>While I have set tough targets for CIE in the past three years and for the next three, I have also given a very substantial commitment to the board.  For 1986 the subvention, based on the subvention formula, comes to £104.5 million.  In addition, since I came to office, provision has been made for the Exchequer to take on board directly the interest payments on DART which is the correct approach for infrastructural projects of this kind. Moreover, the problem of CIE's short term borrowings has been addressed and £30 million is being remitted by the Exchequer over ten years, having commenced in 1985.</P>
    <P>The capital provision for 1986 is £34.4 million mainly for new railway carriages, signalling and communications and the acquisition of buses for CIE Supabus and tour activities.  These represent a very big investment, without which the CIE services would inevitably run down.  It will be readily clear, that the renewal of CIE which this Bill seeks to bring about has been accompanied by very large investment to give them the modern tools to do the job.</P>
    <P>The Green Paper on Transport Policy and the publication of the national plan raise a number of very important issues which have a bearing on the longer term future of the new CIE group.</P>
    <P>In so far as the railways are concerned, the new organisation and management structure, together with the investments <Col N="2328" /> made in the railways, give all concerned an opportunity to prove the worth of the railways and thereby guarantee their long term future.</P>
    <P>The many views on the Green Paper which have been furnished, for which I am grateful, are currently being assessed. The conclusions which we will draw from the contributions on that paper will be taken account of in a White Paper now in preparation.</P>
    <P>The problems in relation to the structure of CIE which we are tackling here have been ventilated freely in the past few years.  A certain negative approach which is based on so called privatisation has been imported into the discussion.  I do not wish to say anything about privatisation in connection with this Bill for the simple reason that privatisation has nothing to do with the Bill and is simply a red herring in the debate.  There are also arguments based on what is seen as a threat within CIE &mdash; the threat of competition between rail and road services. This seems to mean that there must be no competition, irrespective of cost to the taxpayer or service to the public, as between CIE's rail and provincial road services.  I utterly reject that approach. There must be some competition to ensure that each new operational company will be kept on its toes, that each worker in each company will identify with the public entity to which he or she is attached, work to further its aims and take pride in its new identity.</P>
    <P>The board of CIE will still retain their powers and responsibilities.  The board will guard against reckless or ruinous competition between the subsidiaries. Indeed the proposed structure gets close to the optimum.  It maintains the overall framework of the integrated approach which many see as essential to our transport system.  It allows also for specifically identifiable sharing of services and supports where sharing is necessary &mdash; another argued benefit of integration.</P>
    <P>National transport issues such as CIE and their services provide a basis for a very broad debate covering a very extensive field.  I have endeavoured to give the House a comprehensive statement on the <Col N="2329" /> background to the changes proposed in the Bill, the motivation and the objectives. It goes without saying that there may be some issues which Deputies consider relavant but which I have not touched on.  Omissions are inevitable in a situation like this.  I will, however, endeavour to reply to any such points in the course of my reply to the debate.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I go along with the general tone of the Minister's endeavours to improve morale and strengthen CIE's belief in themselves.  This is important and I agree with the Minister when he says that over many years they have been the target for criticism, often ridicule, and the butt for jokes in music halls and elsewhere.</P>
      <P>CIE have a large workforce recruited by public competition allied to training in apprenticeships etc. over the years. The potential of the workforce of CIE is great and there is an onus on the Members of the House to see to the greatest extent possible that that potential is realised.  From reading their magazines and trade union publications it is quite clear.  That in many areas there is a significant <i>esprit de corps</i> in various matters which they undertake relating to charity or in the cultural area.  Anybody serving in this House would benefit from reading the autobiography of Dr. Tod Andrews who was once head of CIE.  He paid tribute to the workforce in CIE and also underlined the fact that the basic problem to be solved is that of industrial relations. I do not think the case is proven but if this Bill makes it easier, because of smaller companies and the fact that the management are more involved with the workers, to improve industrial relations, we will welcome it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister also referred to an improvement in finances.  I asked for a breakdown of the £115 million subsidy to which the Minister referred in his speech. During Question Time a few days ago I talked about the importance of transparency. The Minister today devoted a section of his speech to transparency.  I cannot go along with him that he has <Col N="2330" /> made the subvention as transparent as I would like it to be.  It is opaque in certain regards.</P>
    <P>In the statistical extract 1982 to 1985 there is an account of the payments to CIE.  The net deficit for 1980 was £74.5 million; in 1981, £94.8 million; in 1982, £109 million; in 1983, there was a dip to £106.6 million; in 1984, £112 million and in 1985, as we know from the Minister, £115 million.  That figure is also listed in the Book of Estimates.  The Book of Estimates for 1984 also quotes the figure of £112 million.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">

      <P>The DART payments are added.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that the DART payments are added but I am talking about what this House has to do by way of sustaining CIE and about the desirability of the House having clearly before it details of what the money is being spent on.  In the 1985 annual report of CIE, the most recent one available, the figures for State grants received or receivable are included and are as follows: 1980, £70 million; 1981, £85 million; 1982, £96 million; 1983, £86 million; 1984, £112 million and 1985, £119 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not comparing like with like.  The DART subsidy has to come out of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>We are both trying to clarify the issues.  All I am reading from the report are the State grants, received/receivable, which rose from £70 million in 1980 to £119.490 million in 1985.  If we want to make that sum of money transparent we have a good but more to do than what the Minister has done either in answer to my question in the House or in today's speech.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister gave a breakdown of the Exchequer subvention of £115 million which was allocated as follows: railways other than DART, £75.6 million; DART, £7 million, the Dublin bus services, £16.8 million; provincial city bus services, £2.1 million; other provincial bus services, £0.3 million; canals, an item <Col N="2331" /> which will now disappear, £1.4 million and Galway Aran ferry service, £0.8 million.  We have received more information and I am grateful to the Minister for that.  What is opaque to me is that £75.6 million mentioned in connection with railways other than DART and £7 million, which is quite transparent, mentioned in connection with DART are due to pay off capital charges.  On 13 June 1983 the Minister issued a press statement in which he stated that one of the main advantages of the new system is that CIE would have the opportunity to record a profit after bringing the subvention into account.  He believed that this incentive was the key for substantial improvements in the standard and quality of the board's services.  The one thing I do not want to happen &mdash; if we want to record a profit &mdash; is for accounts to be presented to the House in a certain way which will indicate that a profit has been made when the above the line payment has been taken into account but when in fact there was no profit at all.</P>
    <P>It is important that the management and staff of CIE feel they have the support of this House in making an effort to bring the finances under control, to cut the subvention and to make a profit, if possible, in certain areas.  There are areas where substantial profits could be made with good management and marketing. We can put the new companies on the spot in that regard.  The Minister said that CIE will have an opportunity to record a profit.  That is precisely what was announced this year, that CIE made a profit of £7.6 million but all that evoked from those who watch the scene were cynical remarks about heavy State subsidy and that by a method of accounting a profit had been made.</P>
    <P>We should look at the £75.6 million subsidy for railways other than DART to see if we can find out where we have rail services which are being subsidised.  I have before me a map of the railway system in Ireland.  There is always the suspicion that if we examine individual routes and find that a profit is not being made that that is an indication we are <Col N="2332" /> putting that particular service under threat.  I submit that that is not the case. The people who have such fears should have those fears removed for them.  The House should know if the service from A to B is paying its way and making a profit or if the service from A to C is not paying its way and must be subsidised to the tune of so many millions of pounds.  For example, is the Dublin-Cork line making a profit?  It must be.  It is a splendid, punctual and fast service.  Is the Dublin-Belfast line making a profit?  We are responsible for most of that service which is a good one when it is allowed to run, if bridges are not blown up.  Is the Dublin Ballina service making a profit and if not to what extent is it subsidised?  Are the Dublin-Westport, Dublin-Galway, Dublin-Wexford, Dublin-Kilkenny-Waterford, Dublin-Killarney-Tralee and the Dublin-Limerick services making a profit?  What about the service from Limerick to Rosslare which is an important line?  Lest this House should be accused of trying to ferret out services that are not making a profit in order to abolish them I want to state that that is not the purpose of my submission on this matter. I want the House to have full information on this.</P>
    <P>The Minister, the chairman of CIE, and others, have stated that we must bluntly face the fact that a substantial amount of the money spent by CIE must be regarded as a social service.  I was taken aback when the Minister, in answer to my question in the House recently, said the full subvention was a social subvention or, consequently, &ldquo;above the line&rdquo; but he excluded from that the specific social services provided by CIE in accordance with decisions of the House to provide transport for various categories in our community.  We should concentrate on getting full transparency in regard to the railways, the areas that are profitable and those that are not.  If we get that, the House will be able to know what we are doing.  Figures should not be lumped together.  If they are people may be in the dark about the expenditure.</P>
    <P>In the course of his speech the Minister <Col N="2333" /> said that there was a time when the idea was that there should be cross-subsidisation, with the services that were paying their way subsidising those that were not.  I can recall citizens of Dublin &mdash; such people when they become aggrived are very interesting &mdash; complaining that by their fares in Dublin city they were keeping services going in the rest of the country.  They were angry about this but we see from the Minister's speech that the Dublin bus service has to get £16.8 million to keep going.  That is one area where there should be a heavy concentration of marketing and management expertise because there is no doubt that the customers are there.  The buses are available although they may not be the proper type for such a service.  A good effort in marketing and management should be able to bring that service back into profit.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister, when replying, give us an internal breakdown of the £75.6 million?  I am aware of the cost of the DART system and the Dublin and provincial bus services.  It has been said by way of rebuttal to this line of argument that one cannot be running around getting accounts from here and there on a small scale but I do not think that argument stands up.  Nowadays very sophisticated systems exist with computers and there should be no bother in putting a finger on the costings or the revenue of specific operations in CIE.</P>
    <P>I should like to put on record the policies which I have put together and given to the policy committee of Fianna Fáil and remind the House of the policy put forward by Fianna Fáil in 1982 in relation to CIE.  Our policy document then dealt with the McKinsey recommendations.  I should like to put it on record that the Fianna Fáil Government in 1982, contrary to certain indications in the Seanad, did not decide to adopt the McKinsey report, nor did I in the Department decide to adopt it and I understand from my predecessor, Deputy Reynolds, that such a decision was not taken.  The 1982 document stated:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2334" /> If the Government decide to continue the railway system the present &ldquo;open-ended&rdquo; type of subvention should be discontinued.  Criteria should be established for the payment of subvention in respect of services which are uneconomic but which are recognised as essential in the public interest.  Such payments should then be made &ldquo;above-the-line&rdquo;, i.e. as payments for service rather than as at present &ldquo;below-the-line&rdquo; i.e. in recoupment of losses.  The issues involved are at present under discussion between CIE and the interested Government Departments.</P>
    <P>The House will gather from that that the &ldquo;above the line&rdquo; payments had been decided on by Fianna Fáil in Government. Fianna Fáil had set the discussions going between the Departments of Communications and Finance in the main. The 1982 document continued:</P>
    <P>Decisions are about to be taken on the major issues relating to the railways, the structure of CIE and the reporting relationship with Government. Clear guidelines will be established in regard to manning levels, a market oriented approach to services based on improved pricing systems and the cost of providing services.  The overall Government objective will be to ensure that the public transport system provides services effectively on the principle of commercial viability, with departures from that principle permitted only on the basis of specific criteria as to the manner in which the function will be discharged.</P>
    <P>The steps being taken by the Dublin Transportation Task Force to reduce Dublin's traffic congestion and hence improve bus utilisation will be continued and intensified when the Dublin Transport Authority (DTA) is established in 1983.  These steps, coupled with CIE's investment in new buses, should result in improvements in the efficiency of Dublin City Bus Services. The DTA will be a regulatory body <Col N="2335" /> and will help to improve the administration of Dublin transport in four major respects....</P>
    <P>The four major respects listed were transport planning, transport budgeting, public transport services and traffic management. The policy I submitted to the Deputy in charge of our policy documents was to establish the Dublin city services on their own.</P>
    <P>This ties in with what I have just said about the huge conurbations with large numbers not now using the public transport service but who by democracy, good management and good services could be attracted to use it.  The Minister did say that the numbers were up in regard to Dublin city services.  I have here some statistics which I got from the Dáil Library.  These are important when we are considering the Dublin city services. They are: 175 million in 1980; 158 million in 1981; 163 million in 1982; 158 million in 1983 and 156 million in 1984.  The statistic I got from the Library for 1985 is not for the full year &mdash; it is up to 2 November 1985 and is 137 million.  I got elsewhere, possibly from some document of the Minister's, 161.8 million as the figure for 1985.  The figure was reduced, as we can see, from 175 million in 1980, going as low as 156 million in 1984 and we are still 14 million behind for 1985 compared with 1980.</P>
    <P>That is highly relevant to the Bill before the House because one of the companies, as the House knows, are a company who will be totally dedicated to the development of the Dublin city services.  My contention was, and my policy document stated, that that particular company should be set up on their own but relating to the Dublin Transport Authority as I had envisaged it and which was fully debated in this House, but which was totally changed and practically wrecked by the Bill the Minister brought before this House and which is now an Act on the Statute Book.  I am grateful to the Minister for sending me a document stating that November 12 is the vesting day, or the inaugural date.  He was possibly <Col N="2336" /> avoiding the 13th.  That Act is so weak that the ideas I had about the development of the Dublin city services would not be able to work within its provisions.</P>
    <P>As the House will recall there was to be a traffic plan for the area covering Dublin Corporation, what was then Dún Laoghaire Borough, and Dublin County Council.  There are now many new fangled councils and I have not time to go through them.  The idea was that a plan would be elaborated on in consultation with everybody concerned and giving even the individual citizen an opportunity to make an input, that that particular authority would have a budget and that CIE would be the agent of the authority, not operating independently of it as it will be now.  In that situation, there was a commercially viable company.  As I said, the Bill was emasculated and we have an Act on the Statute Book which will not really be relevant to any great extent to the company being set up under this Bill here.  I know what happened.  The Department of the Environment counterattacked on the Department of Communications and weakened the legislation.  Deputy Richard Bruton, now a junior Minister, supported me in the contention in this House that the Bill was too weak.</P>
    <P>To add insult to injury, we have a Bill before the House now, the Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission (No. 2) Bill, which weakens the Dublin Transport Authority still further.  In other words the Department of the Environment have made another grab for power in so far as transport and infrastructure for transport are concerned, all to the detriment of developing an efficient and profitable, dare I say, transport company running the Dublin city services.  I want to reiterate what I said &mdash; I have not a formal script so that I may be a little discoursive &mdash; that no decision was made by the Fianna Fáil Government who left office in the winter of 1982 to implement the McKinsey report. Senator Flor O'Mahony in another place, Seanad Éireann, made that statement and the Minister, so far as I remember, <Col N="2337" /> did so also.  I know quite well because I was ten months in the Department then. I had An Post and Bord Telecom and the Dublin Transport Authority, three major items which required a great deal of hard work and of discussion to get them through Government and so on and I think that I was highly productive for those months.  I reiterate that the above the line subvention was a decision we had made and published in our programme, <i>The Way Forward.</i></P>
    <P>If we had started with the Dublin city services company, this would have left the two other companies, the National Bus Company and the National Rail Company, together and my idea was that they would be together for some time, pending the results of the refurbishment of the Dublin city services.  This brings me to the Fianna Fáil Party attitude to the national bus and national rail companies. Incidentally, I agree with the Minister about the names, but I have been asking people if they could get names that were more euphonic than those that have been chosen.  I noted in the Seanad that the Minister invited people to try to suggest better names and he repeated the invitation today.  I cannot help in any way.  I did try to have an Irish name given to what is now called The DART.  The suggestion was Fast Line or Mear Line, but that did not find favour with those who named the line.  It did not improve my acceptance of the word DART to find when I was in San Francisco this summer that DART is named after the suburban San Francisco service, which is called BART.  That is Bay Area Rapid Transport and we have Dublin Area Rapid Transport here.  It is bad enough for streets and roads to be named after the soap operas which are polluting the country and to be imitating pseudo colonial architecture but if we have to go to San Francisco to get a name for our most efficient suburban rail service we have reached a bankruptcy of ideas.  I am pleased that the Minister is still searching for a name and that he has power in the Bill to name it.  Surely we have enough imagination to think of something better <Col N="2338" /> than the names which are incorporated here.</P>
    <P>I will put down amendments with regard to the triple company, in other words I shall try to persuade the House to rely on two companies, namely, the national bus company combined with the rail company on the one hand and Dublin city services on the other hand.  For the sake of viability and harmony that would be the best arrangement.</P>
    <P>When the Minister made the announcement I examined the provisions incorporated in the Bill and was of the opinion, admittedly without our party having fully debated the matter at the time and without having had representations from various trade unions, that the three companies might work and might be the best solution.  After much debate and having received submissions from various people, particularly trade unions, I am convinced that it would be better if we did not split the rail side from the provincial bus services.  My arguments are based on the fact that they are both supplying services for passengers very often to the same towns and following the same routes.  It will prove very difficult in practice to separate them. They are in many ways complementary to one another.  Passengers use roads to feed to railway stations and are glad that there is a complementary element.</P>
    <P>What will happen with regard to the staff?  The Minister outlined the duties of the parent board.  The parent board will have enough on its plate with regard to general policy, organising finances, looking after the three companies and so on without having to act as a boxing referee and settle difficulties which will arise between the national bus and rail companies. The Minister indicated that he rejected the idea that there should be no competition.  I can see his reasoning but in the context of the national rail and national bus service I do not think it is valid.  If there is competition it would be almost an eating of their own innards. There is a direct involvement at present between rail and bus staff.  Clerical, supervisory and operative rail staff have a direct involvement with road passenger <Col N="2339" /> services.  There would be plenty of trouble.  If there was a manager responsible to the bus company and one responsible to the rail company trying to grab passengers there would be many disputes which the board would have to settle. There will be nothing but chaos if we have a manager running out at a railway station which is also used by buses trying to grab passengers for the railway and <i>vice versa</i>.  The board would become involved in the running of the company which should not be its purpose.  Rest rooms, booking offices and waiting rooms are shared by rail and road passengers. The workers are not anxious for a separation. If they were in favour of it there would be some chance of a reasonably smooth transition but since they are not in favour of it there will be plenty of difficulties ahead.</P>
    <P>I had consultations with the ICTU and ITGWU and they say it is difficult to see how this will not mean a rise in costs instead of a reduction for the companies. I would be interested to hear the Minister's argument that outright competition, modified and monitored by the parent board, will not damage one or other of the companies.  The suspicion among the workers is that the rail company will be damaged.  I find it hard not to see that there is some substance in what they suspect.</P>
    <P>In the Green Paper on transport policy there are some pointers that could cause worry.  There are arguments given for doing away with the railways and for maintaining them.  Particular emphasis is laid on the 6,800 railway employees who would have to find new jobs.  The Minister said that at the IDA's current cost of creating new industrial jobs it would cost £100 million to provide replacement jobs for the railway workers.  In general the workers could be reassured by that. Paragraph 229 states that by virtue of the investment decisions referred to in the previous paragraph the Government have in effect decided to retain the railways in the medium term.  Those words are a source of worry.  The breathing <Col N="2340" /> space provided by this decision allows time to consider whether the existing railway network should be retained in the long term, whether retention should be on the basis of a reduced railway network or the railway network should be eventually closed down.  If I was a railway worker and read that I would feel entitled to ask more questions and be a little worried.</P>
    <P>I have already commented on the information &mdash; for which I am grateful to the Minister &mdash; about what is paid by the Department of Social Welfare to CIE.  If we can make the rest of the accounts as transparent as that, I would be very pleased.  The House would be the better for it, the people who are often hypercritical of CIE would be better for it, and CIE themselves would be better for it. The enlightened social welfare legislation with regard to old age pensioners, introduced by Deputy Haughey when Minister for Social Welfare is important to the people, to the House and to CIE, even though in comparison with other sources, the amount of revenue is not great.</P>
    <P>I would like to hear the Minister's comments on the difficulty for the board and the danger of paralysis if they become involved in dog fights at local level about the rail and bus companies.  I understand the transport salary staff association, representing management for the most part, would not find any great difficulty in dealing with two companies rather than the three, namely, a joint rail and provincial bus service on the one hand and city services on the other.  We have to be careful about two tiers, seeing the parent board is still in existence.  If the people who are actually dealing with the problems are satisfied that they would be able to cope with the Dublin city services on the one hand and a single company for rail and bus on the other, what they have to say should be listened to very carefully.</P>
    <P>The contention of the Congress of Trade Unions is that Dublin city services alone, and separating them from CIE as it exists, is a man sized job without taking on the other possible contentious division of rail and bus.  To avoid chaos merely <Col N="2341" /> setting up the Dublin city services which, topographically and operationally, is compact and concentrated in a limited area, the people who understand the problems at ground level are worried that that in itself will be such a major task that the idea of separating the other two should be got rid of altogether.</P>
    <P>I had an opportunity of being briefed by the consultants CIE employed.  They gave me a magnificently lucid explanation of what they intended.  I told them I would be making a comment on the proposal for the three companies and I had a full debate in my own party and with our front bench about it.  I am not taking away from the clarity with which they explained what was behind the triple company with the parent board, and I want to take this opportunity to thank them.</P>
    <P>With regard to the capital investment mentioned by the Minister, he claimed some credit &mdash; he is an Inchicore man and I do not want to take it away from him &mdash; for the programme that was launched for building carriages.  In the interests of a proper record of the affair, I have to say that I am responsible for that.  Having done that for Inchicore I think I am in my rights to appeal to the Minister to see to it that a proper bus station is built in Cavan town.  He should indicate to the chairman and board of CIE that a quick decision should be taken.  It is the shabbiest place.  When I pass this station I look at the other side of the road because it is one of the scandals of south Ulster that this station should continue to be the offices and headquarters of the national transport company.</P>
    <P>The people interested in the development of Rosslare Harbour are anxious for the speedy provision of rail cars.  Perhaps the Minister would indicate what is the present position.  From the capital point of view the most urgent question is the provision of buses.  There is no renewal of the school bus fleet.  The policy on school busses should command the attention of this House.  I know decision and expenditure are the responsibility of the Minister for Education but this Minister <Col N="2342" /> has responsibility as commander in chief of transport, of dealing with the provision of buses.  GAC have closed and I want to say a few words about that.</P>
    <P>At the moment there is no place where school buses can be provided within the country.  Is there any plan to reactivate bus building here?  I am speaking not merely of school buses but the larger buses used for normal bus services by CIE.  This is a very serious question.  As I understand it, CIE owned the machinery and equipment of the GAC operation. That was a substantial investment.  What is the position at present?  Is any use being made of it?  Is there a proposal to sell?  Is there any invitation to any other company to try their hand at building school buses, or the larger buses, or perhaps a smaller bus which could be used even in the Dublin city services area in off-peak hours and in rural areas?  It is illogical from an economics and management point of view to be using large buses, often no more than quarter full, at certain periods of the year.</P>
    <P>When I was Minister I launched the first coach bus in County Clare.  I think it is thriving, but I wonder if there has been any extension of that or any thinking along the lines I am mentioning now. In some continental countries there are small buses used for cross services at times when there is not a heavy demand. I remember seeing and examining one small Mercedes bus.  I do not know whether it would pass the safety test here in that there were two seats on either side of the central passage.  Then there were tuck-in seats one could pull out so that whoever was in the centre passage could sit down.  Those tuck-in seats were tucked away under the proper two seats when not needed and pulled out for use when needed.  We are very strait-laced in our vision of double deckers, having them running at hours when there is not heavy traffic.  There is the example of the large provincial ones running at times when they cannot hope to command sufficient passengers to render their operation economic.</P>
    <P>Another point I want to raise is that I have an idea that the super buses that <Col N="2343" /> were requisitioned, bought, purchased, leased or whatever, had to be imported at heavy expense.  Is that so?  I want to know.  I may not be right but I have an idea that that is so, that the tourist scene was served this year by imported buses.</P>
    <P>I am not advocating any wild goose scheme with regard to Shannon but a good, hard look should be taken at that operation, at the capital that is locked up there, as far as I know, to ascertain whether we could come up with any sensible, employment-giving scheme &mdash; God knows we need employment &mdash; that would put that capital investment to work for the benefit of the State.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned amendments made in the Seanad.  I am glad that the Fianna Fáil Party in the Seanad, and I have a suspicion that the Labour Party in the Seanad also, did work hard to amend the Bill.  Might I ask the Minister what is the position with regard to staff recruitment. There was a tradition in CIE of holding a national examination for staff recruitment.  The idea was that people who had just passed their leaving certificate examination would be recruited for training in the clerical division of CIE. Is it true that this national examination has been suspended or abolished?  If so, is it the intent of the Minister that some similar, equitable system of recruitment should replace it?  It is important that anything in which this House has a hand should be seen to operate &mdash; as in the case of recruitment systems &mdash; above reproach as far as fair competition is concerned. The most recent report on this morning's news is that leaving certificate holders with good qualifications are now competing very heavily with each other for manual work, that one in four girls only who have a leaving certificate, plus an extra year's acquisition of secretarial skills, is at present being employed. Therefore the whole area of employment in CIE is very important.  I should like to know what are the Minister's views on that, whether it is still the intention that there should be a national, fair, equitable examination system, with recruitment taking place on that basis.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2344" /> The Minister did mention that under the 1985 Act he provided £30 million, to be financed by way of a £3 million loan per annum for 10 years, with CIE &mdash; if my memory serves me correctly &mdash; being responsible for the payment of the interest on that loan.  Again the transparency syndrome enters in.  When we are dealing with the finances of CIE we should not merely discuss in this House the annual subvention, now above the line, which is categorised as social expenditure &mdash; but also take the global financial position into account.</P>
    <P>In the Seanad on 10 July 1985 the Minister made a statement about the provision of money, £16 million annually for the years 1985, 1986 and 1987.  That was an original method of funding decided on but not adhered to.  There is mention by the Minister that £32 million of that total of £48 million will fall to be paid in 1987. That is because £8 million only was paid each of the years 1985 and 1986.  I can foresee a problem arising in 1987.  I think this was a bit of shuffle the brogue financial management, when £32 million of the total was put back for payment in 1987.  I hope the finances of this country will be in a better position in 1987 than they were in 1985 and 1986 but I do not think it is a fair way of financing &mdash; shoving the debts forward to the following year.  I do not think it is fair for the Department of Finance, if they were responsible, or the Minister himself, if he was responsible, to do so.  If there is a change of Government I would find it even more distasteful to have to rustle up £32 million whereas, in accordance with the original ministerial decision, £16 million was all that would be required.</P>
    <P>There should be a substantial saving to CIE which should show itself in the amount of subsidisation required or not, as the case may be, in the drastic drop in the price of diesel of which CIE is a very heavy consumer.  I got some statistics for the benefit of the House on that matter. These are crude oil prices, Arab, light, on-the-spot market, which was the standard used for reporting for a considerable period.  <i>The Economist</i> has now switched to North Sea Brent but these prices are <Col N="2345" /> the same.  For example, in the last two years of the 1977 to 1981 administration the price of crude oil per barrel zoomed up.  This has never been properly taken into account in estimating the economics of that period of Government.</P>
    <P>Admittedly, possibly Fianna Fáil did not give sufficient credit to the Coalition Government of 1973 to 1977 for their difficulties when the price of oil increased in 1973 but the increase of 1973 was chicken feed &mdash; if one can describe diesel as chicken feed &mdash; compared with that in 1979.  I will give an example.  When I came to office the price of a barrel of crude oil was $12.57.  In January 1979 it cost $15.95; in February, $19.50; in March, $20.80; in April, $21.20 and in May, $34.25.  The average price for 1981 was $39.25.  In other words it was well over 300 per cent up on what it was when we took office.  The average price for 1982 was $34.12.  On October 28, and I checked this in the Dáil Library, the price of a barrel of oil was $13.25 or one-third of the cost of what it was in 1981.  That should show in CIE's finances.  The management in CIE, the Minister and this House cannot claim any credit for that drop.  It is simply a matter of the way it worked out.  We should take note of it and CIE should also be asked to take note of it.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned Inchicore and he is justly proud of it.  There is a great mass of skills in Inchicore. There is no doubt about that.  Over the last few years we have been toying around with the idea of entrepreneurs, enterprise, encouraging entrepreneurship and so on.  To try to create that kind of atmosphere is a valid and worthy aim of a person in public life.  In Inchicore there is a large workforce with a great body of skills.  I see nothing wrong with either the Minister for Communications or the chairman of CIE trying to instil a spirit of entrepreneurship in the people there.  They should encourage them to come up with suggestions as to how their skills could be used in manufacturing, even outside the remit of CIE.  It does not matter what <Col N="2346" /> they do provided they indulge in profitable and productive manufacturing.</P>
    <P>As I said before in the House, Mr. Kieran Kennedy who is currently head of the Economic and Social Research Institute carried out a study of the economy of Denmark some years ago.  It was published in the Central Bank report. Admittedly, Denmark's economy is not anything to write home about at present. One very effective point he made was that there had been a big proliferation of small companies in the engineering field, using engineering in its widest sense. Eighty per cent of those developments came from people who were working in a major engineering company.  They developed ideas of their own and set up their own small industries.  The people in Inchicore could be given a lead in that regard and there is nobody better than the Minister, being an Inchicore man, to do so.  He would have to do it through the board of CIE and the rail company. That possibility is there.  It was not until I sanctioned the £43 million programme in 1982 that I realised the vast potential in that place.</P>
    <P>Mr. Conlon, the chairman of CIE, stated that the rail sundries and road freight were on trial and if they had not made a profit by 31 December 1986 the prevailing thinking was that it would be closed down.  The Minister did not say that they made a profit.  His words were interesting.  He said that they were safe and that they were going to carry on. Perhaps when the Minister is replying he would indicate to the House the position with regard to the sundries and freight area.  In his speech he stated:</P>
    <P>CIE rail sundries and road freight services to be discontinued by 1 January 1986 unless they proved profitable in 1984 and 1985.  I am glad to report that such is the improvement in these areas that their future is now assured.</P>
    <P>That falls a little short of saying that they made a profit.  If the Minister would indicate in his reply the exact psoition I would be grateful to him.</P>
    <P>With regard to staff reductions, when speaking to Mr. Conlon and some of his <Col N="2347" /> managers it was indicated to me that the staff redundancies had taken place some time ago.  They were reduced by 500.  I am in general agreement with the humane approach of the Minister on this, that it will all be done properly with due consideration and in a voluntary manner in so far as that is possible.  In regard to the transfer of staff the provisions in the Bill are above reproach.  I hope that things will work out as the Minister indicated, namely, that the transfer will be one which will not damage in any way existing staff.  However, I have information that the chief civil engineer and his staff at Pearse Station in Westland Row &mdash; I think there are between 80 and 100 staff there &mdash; are making representations with regard to a transfer which is about to be imposed upon them.  That is not in accordance with the spirit of the Bill or with the sentiments expressed by the Minister in his speech.  The general idea is that, without any regard to the interest of the staff, they have been told that they are to move from Pearse Station, Westland Row, to the North Wall Quay.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to assure me that the interests of those people will be taken into account, that he will approach the management of CIE on the matter and that he will see to it that there is no summary order for them to move out. They are particularly worried about losing, for example, the advantages of rail travel to and from their work.  That is something which many other people have to put up with.  The staff there are brought straight to their place of work. If those people are sent to the North Wall it cannot be said that their conditions are not disimproving.  The transport service to the North Wall &mdash; the 53A bus goes there &mdash; certainly does not compare with the service made available through DART to the people working in Westland Row.  The staff point out that British Rail offices are a mile from O'Connell Bridge.  These are the offices they have been asked to switch to.  Apparently Sealink gave this place to CIE for nothing.  If I know Mr. Sherwood, he does not go <Col N="2348" /> out to give valuable presents to anybody, so there must be a problem about the use of this building.</P>
    <P>Another point they make which the House will recognise as valid is that the safety of the staff going to and from the North Wall should cause concern to CIE. In general they feel that they are isolated in a way.  They cannot even go for a walk at lunchtime.  There is not much substance or validity in such arguments although they should be taken into account.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to have consultations with Mr. Conlon and his management team with regard to the staff of the chief civil engineer in Westland Row.  The chief civil engineer was not on to me himself but I have had representations with regard to the position, and the purpose of the Minister's representations, should be to see to it that the staff there do not have to suffer any deterioration in their place of employment or conditions of employment in accordance with the spirit of the Act.</P>
    <P>I will be going through the Bill <i>seriatim</i> in a moment.  I gather that the amendments which were introduced in the Seanad were to fend off a major revolt there with regard to a number of points. The first is one that I have been discussing, namely the desirability of maintaining separate rail and national bus companies.  Second, there was a strengthening of the section with regard to trade union and industrial relations activities. This in a sense is in accordance with what the Minister said.  I agree with him that industrial relations, as Dr. Todd Andrews said, was the basis and essence of the development of CIE.  I will be having a look at section 11 as amended later on.</P>
    <P>The borrowing for capital purposes has to be done by the board.  The Minister may clarify this.  The borrowing for ordinary running expenses, I understand, can be made by each of the individual companies with the overall safeguard of an upper limit to the amount that can be borrowed.  The system of reporting from the company to the parent board will be important in this regard so that the parent <Col N="2349" /> board can keep an eye on the amount of borrowing that takes place for ordinary running expenses.</P>
    <P>With regard to fares and rates, as the Minister indicated, the prices commission has been abolished but still the Minister has retained for the Government the right to approve or disapprove of proposed fares.  I presume that the Minister feels that that is necessary.  One could imagine CIE making a pitch for such high fares as to damage the citizens, although I cannot really see how that could happen because naturally if they go out of kilter altogether they will lose customers and the whole purpose of the exercise is to make the company more competitive and in whatever areas possible, profitable.  As I have said, I think that they can be made profitable in the Dublin city services area.</P>
    <P>Section 29 of the Bill as originally published read:</P>
    <P>In determining the remuneration or allowances for expenses to be paid to its officers or servants or the terms or conditions subject to which such officers or servants hold or are to hold their employment, the Board and each company shall have regard either to Government or nationally agreed guidelines which are for the time being extant, or to Government policy concerning remuneration and conditions of employment which is so extant, and, in addition to the foregoing, each of them shall comply with any directives with regard to such remuneration, allowances, terms or conditions which the Minister may give from time to time to it with the consent of the Minister for the Public Service.</P>
    <P>In the Seanad Bill as passed, unless I am blind, section 29 seems to be eliminated altogether.  It was a section that came into a number of Bills that came before this House for some time and it was resented by Members on all sides of the House because it seemed to be interference with the principle of free collective bargaining by the workers in particular State companies. The Minister can comment on it <Col N="2350" /> but I think I am right in saying that that was removed during the Seanad debate.</P>
    <P>Sometimes during debates in the House I raise points and when the time comes for reply the Minister has not time or is crushed into a corner and so on.  I do not believe that that will happen on an important Bill like this, but if there are some points that the Minister does not succeed in reaching I would appreciate it if I get a reply from the Department of Communications on the points I make.</P>
    <P>In passing, I suppose it would be strange if we did not mention the plan that has been bruited abroad about the headquarters for CIE.  I asked a question in the House about it.  It is still in <i>suspenso,</i> but it is highly relevant to this Bill because if a decision is taken to go ahead with the scale plan, as it is called, that will have an important bearing and impact on the running of the Dublin city services particularly, other national bus services out of the city and, if I am right in what I recall, the feed into Heuston and Connolly Stations.  I know that CIE had been purchasing buildings along the quays.  This seems to have been going on for some time.  Certainly an objective was for some form of development in that area.  Perhaps the Minister might mention this in his reply.  It depends on when the reply comes, because I gather a date has been given for publication of a reply to the proposal by Caneire for that development.  It is very important to make the right decision.  It is important not to refuse a capital input if we are sure there is such capital input with all its implications for employment and development in the capital city.  It is important that it be got right and that the country will gain from it if a decision is taken to go ahead with it.</P>
    <P>The quays were decided upon a long time ago.  The Earl of Ormond was responsible and an attempt was made to build warehouses or other houses right down to the edge of the river.  There was in that man a sound sense of urban planning and he should get credit for the quays as they are.  Admittedly we have not looked after the houses along the quays as we might and the whole area <Col N="2351" /> could do with an overall architectural plan.  As far as I know, the Caneire or Skelly plan would not change the face of the quays.  It was designed to go underground for the most part.  I do not have the details nor does anybody else but any interference with the quays architecturally or as routes into the heart of the city would be wrong.</P>
    <P>I was speaking to tourist interests recently and as far as CIE are concerned they are very anxious that we get it right with regard to Rosslare and the rail service particularly from Rosslare to the south and south west.  Co-ordination of boats and trains and bus services in the areas of Waterford, Kilkenny, Wexford, Limerick, Cork, Killarney and Tralee are important.</P>
    <P>A point was made in the Seanad debate about CIE's role as an employer, and I would add to that, their role as an educator. Every Member of this House has had at some time representations from young people anxious to train as fitters, electricians and so on and asking us to see if there were any vacancies in CIE.  I hope the new parent board and the new subsidiary companies will keep their educational role in mind.  There could be a danger that the educational role would be minimised because of the split up.  The board may have to address the whole problem of apprenticeships right across the activities of CIE so that apprentices may be trained for the national bus company and the railway company &mdash; if we do not succeed in persuading the Minister into having one company &mdash; and for the Dublin city services.</P>
    <P>I intended to tackle the Minister about his statement in the Seanad that 1982 was a dreadful year and so on.  It happened to be the year of my consulship and that is why it attracted his attention to the extent that it did.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not true.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already given figures which are to the credit of 1982 so I will not go into greater detail on that.  I just wonder about the Minister's argument that because units of management <Col N="2352" /> are smaller we will have a better industrial relations climate or that it will necessarily be more efficient, particularly where there is cross competition.  I know there is potential for a quicker response to outside competition.  The only outside competition that CIE really have is private cars, private haulage, private coaches and so on.</P>
      <P>The Minister at the end of his speech mentioned privatisation and made it quite clear that there is no purpose of privatisation behind this Bill.  I fully accept that but I also maintain that there is a need for legislation with regard to private transportation particularly now that the Minister intends to have two separate companies which will compete with each other to some degree with the old father figure of a board moderating and modifying the competition.  I would like if in the Minister's reply he would indicate if he has any intention of bringing forward legislation with regard to private coach operators and so on.  The trade unions are opposed to any development along that line and I would be interested to hear the Minister's views.  There is a big operation in private coaches and they have a large constituency supporting them, particularly among young people. All one has to do is have a look at what happens around Parnell Square and O'Connell Street at the weekends to see how big that constituency is.  It is incumbent on this House to address itself to the problem of private coaches.</P>
      <P>The Minister has also set people's minds at rest about the danger of the companies going into liquidation.  I can see why workers develop fears and phobias about this having regard to what happened to Irish Shipping Limited.  One group of workers put it to me that if in the competition between the national bus company and the national rail company, the national bus company won out, unless it was built into the Bill that there could not be liquidation, this could be used as an excuse to liquidate the railway company. I thought it was a far fetched argument and said so but the reply I got was &ldquo;well, you know what happened to Irish Shipping Limited&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2353" /> An interesting area is the role of the Department of Communications <i>vis-à-vis</i> the new CIE board and their companies. The McKinsey report addressed this problem in their study of CIE.  I agree that there should be a regular and frequent reporting procedure developed between CIE and the Department of Communications.</P>

I mentioned before that that was the view of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges but it was put on the record this morning. Therefore, I propose to do my best to make progress and to get some law and order back into Question Time.  I will not allow speeches, short or long, and I ask for the co-operation of the Deputies in that regard.  I also propose to limit the number of supplementaries and when the Chair calls the next question he will regard it as disorderly &mdash; as indeed it is &mdash; should Deputies continue to press for another question or talk about the importance of the one under discussion. The same will apply if they argue that they have the right to ask another question. I hope I will get the co-operation which I seek.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 2, 3 and 24 together.</P>
      <P>The Social Welfare (Amendment) Act, 1985, provided for implementation of the EC Directive on equal treatment for men and women in matters of social security.  That Act was passed by the Oireachtas in July 1985 and section 24 provided that the Act would come into operation on a date to be fixed by ministerial order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first phase of equal treatment was implemented from 15 May 1986 and married <Col N="2355" /> women now get the same personal rates of benefits as men and single women and they are also entitled to unemployment benefit for the standard duration of 390 days.</P>
    <P>The second phase of the equal treatment provisions is being implemented in the week commencing 17 November 1986 and in consequence married women will be entitled to claim unemployment assistance in their own right, also the same conditions will apply to both men and women in the matter of increases in social welfare payments for adult and child dependants.  The revised definition of adult dependency is based on the principle that one spouse will be regarded as dependent on the other only if he or she is being wholly or mainly maintained by that spouse.  Where neither spouse is dependent on the other, 50 per cent of the child dependant allowances will be paid to each claimant.  However, where the spouse of the claimant is regarded as an adult dependant the full child dependant allowances will be paid to that claimant.</P>
    <P>Special alleviating measures are being introduced in recognition of the drop in household income which some families will suffer following implementation of the revised definition of dependency. Regulations at present being made provide that a working spouse earning £50 a week or less will continue to be regarded as an adult dependant and in the case of families where both spouses are at present independently entitled to benefit a special transitional payment of £10 a week will be made to mitigate the overall loss of income which the family would otherwise suffer.</P>
    <P>In addition, special arrangements are being made to further assist families where both spouses are entitled to a payment in their own right and where there is a financial commitment which would cause difficulties because of the reduction in income.</P>
    <P>Under existing arrangements married men automatically got increases for a wife and children irrespective of whether the wife was working or receiving another <Col N="2356" /> social welfare payment.  To duplicate such payments in the case of both husband and wife would be out of the question on the ground of cost and would in any event be totally unjustified.  I am satisfied that the new arrangements are the best that can be made in the circumstances.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisFoley" hpid="Mr. Foley Mr. Foley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have evidence that there will be a net loss to social welfare recipients as and from 17 November.  Will the Minister clarify this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>That statement is not correct because the implementation of equal treatment will cost £80 million extra for social welfare recipients.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMcCarthy" hpid="Dr. McCarthy Dr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has given the impression that the implementation of equality will cost £18 million.  Does she concede that the sum of £18 million which will be spent on increased payments to women in receipt of social welfare and the increased duration for which they will receive unemployment benefit, will be clawed back by the Department to finance the scheme to the extent of almost £17.21 million over the next year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>No, after the alleviating measures and the adjustment in the dependency rates have been made, the net extra money going to social welfare recipients will be £18 million.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMcCarthy" hpid="Dr. McCarthy Dr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it true that the cost of the increased payments to 46,000 women will be in the region of £18 million?

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>The cost of the second phase of equal treatment coming in on 17 November is a neutral cost because of the £9 million extra alleviating measures which the Government decided upon and which were announced in the House in 1985.  They were not questioned or voted against at that time.  The net additional payments going to social welfare recipients, after the full implementation of equal treatment, remains at a cost of £18 million.  The extra £9 million which the Government are spending on alleviating measures neutralises the cost of the second phase.</P>

      <P>I am surprised that the Minister did not take Question No. 18 also because it specifically deals with the reply she made to the other questions. Does the Minister accept that because of the way this equality legislation is being introduced it will mean that women will be driven out of the workforce?  It will reduce the incomes of up to 20,000 families by £40 per week, even with the minor adjustments which the proposed scheme will introduce.  Will the Minister defer the implementation of the scheme pending the introduction of a long term phased implementation of it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>My original answer made it quite clear that the implementation of the Directive on equality was the fairest way of doing things.  In May of this year 46,000 families gained and will continue to gain as a result of the equal treatment costing £18 million.  That is an inescapable fact.  About 17,000 families will lose as a result of the adjustments in the dependency rates.  The alternative is to either spend considerably more money than the £9 million spent on alleviating measures thereby adding to the total cost or to go even further and give men and women full adult dependency allowances for spouses who are not dependent.  The final point I would make is that despite a loss in income for some families which will occur even with the alleviating measures <Col N="2358" /> the Government have introduced those families will still be better off than the 150,000 social welfare recipients who are on one rate.</P>

      <P>I would not describe these measures in any of the terms used by the Deputy.  The implementation of equal treatment was fully explained in 1985 when this Bill went through the House.  It is also not unconnected with the clause inserted in the 1978 Directive by the then Minister for Health and Social Welfare, Deputy Haughey.  The unfortunate result of the second phase of equal treatment, which means that there is an equalisation of dependency allowances as between men and women, is a necessary result of having to implement a Directive which is very specific on the need to have equality.  It is entirely forgotten in most of these discussions that the people who are going to lose some money are nevertheless not among the poorest of our social welfare recipients about whom we are all concerned &mdash; the 150,000 families who are in receipt of one social welfare payment where there is no working wife or no other social welfare entitlement. The question of people losing money has concerned us all and that is why the Government decided to spend a further £9 million on alleviating measures.</P>

      <P>I am aware that there are difficult cases arising from the implementation of equal treatment.  We are all equally aware that for many years families where the mother was at work or where she lost her job or where she was on social welfare were discriminated against and lost a great deal of money. This equality measure puts the situation right for those families who greatly outnumber those who are going to lose by this Directive.  The Government took into consideration every aspect of the equal treatment Directive and in spending £9 million on alleviating measures they feel they are going as far as they can. Therefore, it will not be possible, I regret to say, to make any further alleviating measures.</P>

That is a very straightforward principle that could be simply operated and, in my view, would meet the objections of all sides of the House.

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. F. Fahey Mr. F. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if she will give details on the length of time it takes to consider an application for unemployment assistance in County Galway; if she is satisfied with the length of time involved; and the proposals she has to expedite the consideration of unemployment assistance applications and appeals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>Entitlement to unemployment assistance depends on the means of the claimant and individual investigation of means must be made in each case.  The time taken to carry out a means investigation and reach a decision in any particular case depends to a large extent on the individual circumstances of the case.  While most new unemployment assistance claims in County Galway are normally dealt with within six to eight weeks it is accepted that in some cases longer delays can occur.</P>
      <P>The longer delays are as a result of the increasing numbers claiming unemployment assistance together with the need for individual investigation of means.  Furthermore many of the claims received in County Galway are from small farmers and generally such cases are more difficult to investigate and take more time to process than the normal run of unemployment assistance claims because of the need to obtain detailed information when determing the income and expenditure of the claimant's holdings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this connection I should also mention that there is an arrangement whereby persons who are in receipt of unemployment benefit are advised as a matter of course, at least three months before they have drawn their maximum entitlement to benefit, to apply for a qualification certificate in order to avoid <Col N="2366" /> any delay when they subsequently transfer to unemployment assistance.  Two additional social welfare officers were assigned to the area last March and this has contributed to a considerable reduction of the arrears of cases on hand awaiting investigation of means.</P>
    <P>A number of other measures have also been introduced to speed up the processing of claims generally.  A policy has been adopted to devolve the decision of awarding qualification certificates from the Department's headquarters to employment exchanges to the greatest extent possible.  The Galway city employment exchanges are now making most decisions in relation to the award of qualification certificates and plans are in progress to extend the process to Clifden exchange in the near future.</P>
    <P>A further step that has been taken recently is the payment of unemployment assistance on a provisional basis to certain claimants pending an investigation of their means by a social welfare officer. In accordance with this arrangement a claimant is interviewed at the local office when making the claim and if it appears that he has no means, payment is authorised at the appropriate maximum rate. This arrangement applies only at the larger offices at present and it was introduced at Galway city employment exchanges last month.</P>
    <P>As regards delays in processing appeals, the position is that delays can occur when an oral hearing is necessary and particularly where further investigation of means by the social welfare officer is looked for before a decision is made.  However, there has been a significant reduction in the past year in the time taken to deal with all appeals under the unemployment assistance scheme, including appeals which are the subject of an oral hearing.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I should like to emphasise that every effort is being made, within the available resources, to ensure that claims are processed as quickly and efficiently as possible.  I should also mention that during the period that an unemployment assistance claim is being processed it is open to a person to apply <Col N="2367" /> for supplementary welfare allowance at the local health centre if he is in need of immediate financial help.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. F. Fahey Mr. F. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>The theory as the Minister outlined, a delay of six to eight weeks, does not convey the true position because in practice people have to wait between three and five months to have their applications or appeals dealt with. I suggest to the Minister that the action she has outlined is not sufficient to deal with claims and appeals throughout the country and especially in Galway.  In the course of replies to questions tabled by me last week the Minister said that the normal period of delay was three to five months and I should like to know how she can expect people to exist without any income for such a long time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>In the course of my reply I said that most new unemployment assistance claims in County Galway are dealt with within six to eight weeks and that contradicts what the Deputy has said.  I explained, at considerable length in response to this broad question the reasons delays occurred in some areas.  I told the Deputy that where the Department discovered delays they took steps to deal with them.  I should like to assure the Deputy that the Department want to cut down on the length of time people must wait for a decision.  I am sure the Deputy does not wish me to read my reply again because I would be wasting more time.</P>

      <P>The measures outlined by the Minister are not good enough. There must be a significant increase in the number of social welfare officers in County Galway to deal with the long delays.  The bureaucracy that operates must be eliminated.  There is no need to send files from Galway to Dublin and here, there and everywhere.  Cases should be dealt with speedily and people should not be forced to beg in order to survive while awaiting a decision by the Department.</P>

      <P>In the course of her reply the Minister alluded to the assessment of small farmers for unemployment assistance and I should like to know if she is aware of the serious dissatisfaction in western counties about that assessment. Is the Minister aware that small farmers when assessed for unemployment assistance should have their incomes assessed on a factual basis less the amount of their inputs and interest? Is the Minister aware that that is not being applied and that as a result small farmers who have suffered a lot in recent years are being discriminated against?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>The national fuel scheme which is operated under the supplementary welfare allowances scheme, applies throughout the State and covers <Col N="2369" /> persons on social welfare pensions or health board payments who have no other income and who satisfy a living alone condition.</P>
      <P>Urban fuel schemes are in operation in certain cities and towns mainly along the eastern and southern seaboards.  These schemes are administered by the local authorities concerned and the schemes give automatic entitlement to persons in receipt of certain pensions and certain persons on unemployment assistance. The schemes are confined to the areas concerned and persons living outside one of those areas do not qualify for a fuel allowance under the scheme.</P>
      <P>The value of the fuel allowance in each case is £5 per week and the schemes operate from October to April.  The legal basis of the national fuel scheme is at present <i>sub judice</i> and the decision of the Supreme Court in the matter is being awaited.</P>
      <P>Subject to this decision, it is proposed to continue the fuel schemes in their present form for the 1986-87 season and to examine the question of producing a single uniform scheme for the whole country from October 1987 onwards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMcCarthy" hpid="Dr. McCarthy Dr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that there is a necessity to harmonise the national and urban free fuel schemes? Would she concede that it is unfair that whilst under the urban fuel scheme persons on employment assistance with dependants can qualify for free fuel, yet those on unemployment payments who are under the national fuel scheme are specifically precluded from receiving fuel allowances?  Does she think that this is fair?  Does she think that certain sections of the unemployed living outside the urban areas who would qualify for the urban fuel scheme are being specifically discriminated against?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel that I cannot, as I mentioned earlier on, discuss the basis of the national fuel scheme because we are awaiting a decision of the Supreme Court in the matter.  I would agree with the <Col N="2370" /> Deputy that there is, indeed, much injustice felt by people, for different reasons, about the existence of two separate fuel schemes.  A single scheme would involve either termination of the automatic entitlement of certain categories of people, or the extension of the entitlement to all those categories throughout the country.  I am sure that the Deputy is aware that there is a continual demand for the extension of the schemes to all sorts of other categories outside the present urban areas.  Without enormously increased expenditure it would be very difficult to produce a harmonised scheme which did not involve the abolition of some current rights to fuel.</P>

      <P>Following reinvestigation of the unemployment assistance claim of the person concerned he was assessed with means of £96.15 weekly, derived from the profit from his holding.</P>
      <P>In calculating this amount, the deciding officer took into consideration the gross yearly value of the holding at £12,848, less expenses amounting to £7,848 incurred in earning that income, leaving a net profit of £5,000 per annum or £96.15 weekly.</P>
      <P>The person concerned appealed against the amount of means assessed against him and an appeals officer on 17 September 1986 also assessed him with means of £96.15 weekly.  He is, accordingly, in receipt of unemployment assistance of £5.80 weekly, being the appropriate maximum rate payable in his case of £101.95 less means of £96.15.</P>
      <P>The basis of the calculation of means for the holding in this case was the net income from the holding over the 12 months preceding the investigation of means on 24 June 1986.  It was considered that this assessment reflected the net income from his farm in a normal year.</P>

Is she aware that from the report of the social welfare officer this man's income from the sale of milk was £7,800 and his expenditure was £7,700 giving him a profit of <Col N="2376" /> £100?  The basis which was used to calculate that he had £96 a week was the sale of livestock last year which amounted to £5,111.  In fact the man's operating profit is £100.  He spent the £5,000 last year and he does not have a realistic income at this stage with which to keep his wife and family.  That is the reason he appealed. The appeal was decided on the basis of the £5,000 he got last year for the sale of stock.  It bears no relation to his income at present.

General information booklets and booklets setting out the rates of payment of various schemes are widely distributed, in addition to a range of leaflets on particular schemes.  A number of leaflets have been added recently, specifically designed to improve awareness of entitlements, for example, &ldquo;Retiring&rdquo; and &ldquo;Pensioners and Savings&rdquo;. Information leaflets have also been made available in conjunction with the introduction of new schemes, such as the pilot schemes for the unemployed, including Jobsearch, the part-time job allowance scheme and the educational opportunities scheme.</P>

      <P>Despite the leaflets, booklets and promotion of new schemes I am sure the Minister is aware from the feedback from Deputies that every Deputy receives many requests for information from people who are not aware of their entitlements.

      <P>Is the Minister aware that despite all the leaflets and so on there is a high level of non-take up of benefits by people who really need them? In regard to the survey would the Minister not agree that with the social welfare offices, labour exchanges and so on already at her disposal, she has sufficient means to carry out a reasonable survey? Has she attempted to do that in her Department?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no evidence to suggest that lack of take up is a problem. The Commission on Social Welfare did not identify lack of take up as posing a problem.  Some broad indications of take up have been given.  For example, 82 per cent of persons over 66 years of age are in receipt of a pension or long term social welfare payment.  Most of the rest are public service pensioners and 63 per cent of widows are in receipt of widows' pension. There is almost 100 per cent of take up of child benefit and there is no reason to believe that the take up of unemployment payments is anything less than 100 per cent.  The Deputy will be interested to know that the ESRI are undertaking a major survey of poverty at present.  This is being jointly funded by the Department of Social Welfare, the EC poverty programme and the ESRI. The survey is intended to provide very <Col N="2379" /> important information about the income position of households and the extent to which they depend on social welfare.  It will also provide us with valuable information about the take up of supplementary welfare and so on.  If there is a problem, which there does not appear to be, it will shortly be identified.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 10 and 53 together.</P>
      <P>At present child dependant increases are payable with most social welfare benefits and pensions in respect of children up to the age of 18 years.  However, for the purposes of widow's pension, deserted wife's benefit and allowance, prisoners wife's allowance and unmarried mother's allowance, child dependant increases continue to be payable in respect of children up to the age of 21 years if they are receiving full-time education. The extension of the age limit also applies in the case of widows receiving invalidity, retirement or old age contributory pensions.  The measure was introduced in recognition of the special needs of widows and other one-parent families.  The position in relation to child dependent increases was considered in the context of the rationalisation of the system of child support payments which was to be achieved through a full child benefit scheme.</P>
      <P>The recommendations of the Commission on Social Welfare however are at variance with the notion of a unified child benefit scheme.  In the specific area of child dependant increases the commission argue that they are an effective mechanism of targeting resources selectively. The commission considered that these increases should be retained but that in the long term there should be a modest relative shift towards child benefit and away from the child dependant increases.</P>
      <P>The whole area of State support for persons with families, including the age limit for the payment of child dependant allowances, in now being re-examined in the light of the commission's recommendation and I am not in a position at this stage to say what the outcome of this examination will be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VincentBrady" hpid="Mr. V. Brady Mr. V. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware <Col N="2381" /> that there are many children of 18 years and upwards who are attending full time education and whose parents are in receipt of unemployment or other benefits? Would she agree that such people are entitled to child dependant allowances?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>A great number of social welfare schemes were introduced to cover groups which were considered to have specific needs.  Since I became Minister for Social Welfare I have been asked to extend these schemes to other people. Each request has enormous financial implications.  That is one of the factors that has to be taken into account as the Deputy will agree.  The majority of the questions I answered today involved enormous additional expenditure. However desirable it might be for all young people over 18 years who are in full time education to be treated in the same way as the children of widows, unmarried mothers, prisoners' wives and so on, it is a difficult proposition in the light of the report of the Commission on Social Welfare and of the considerable extra resources which would have to be found.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VincentBrady" hpid="Mr. V. Brady Mr. V. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the person who is unemployed is in greater need than some of those other people?  If they have children of 18 years and upwards in full time education, surely they should be entitled to the child dependant's allowance because at that age these children are an even greater expense on the family.  In those circumstances, these parents are entitled to such benefits. Would the Minister look at this matter very urgently and extend this allowance to the dependants of unemployed people?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>While all these issues may be very desirable, there is the question of cost to be taken into account. Earlier questions referred to people of the lower rate getting increases while other questions referred to people losing money under the equality Directive, but <Col N="2382" /> every question involves extra expenditure. Obviously all these matters are considered very carefully but we are in a very tricky financial position.</P>

      <P>Despite the very difficult financial situation, the Government have more than fulfilled their commitment to maintain the value of social welfare payments and have, in fact, provided real increases in the levels of those payments.  In the period mid-May 1983 to mid-May 1987 the increase in the consumer price index is expected to be of the order of 22 per cent.  In that period the long-term unemployed will have got increases of about 40 per cent, other long-term recipients, such as pensioners, will have got increases amounting to 33 per cent and short-term beneficiaries will have received increases amounting to 30 per cent.</P>

Indeed we must have reached well over £200 million now in the course of this Question Time &mdash; of requests for extra expenditure without any suggestions of where that money might be found.  The Commission on Social Welfare recommended that the benefits we are discussing should be retained for the existing categories of recipients. The commission did not recommend the extension that the Deputy is seeking now.  Whereas it may cause people some concern, unfortunately, it is a question of our having the financial resources available to us and the logic, if you like, of extending these schemes in the face of the advice of the Commission on Social Welfare.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>it is proposed to take Questions Nos. 16 and 23 together.</P>
      <P>Following formal publication of the report of the Commission on Social Welfare on 6 August, I invited views from interested organisations on the recommendations of the commission by 31 October.  A larger number of submissions have been received and these are now being considered by my Department.</P>
      <P>A great deal of progress has been made in evaluating the recommendations of the commission.  I expect to be in a position to report to the Government on the matter early in the New Year.  Given the overall budgetary constraints which exist, it must be accepted that the degree of progress which can be made in implementing those recommendations of the commission which have serious cost implications, is limited.  However, whatever progress can be made to be made within these constraints will be made.  Priority will also be given to implementing recommendations for rationalisation and simplifying the various social welfare schemes and improving the delivery of services which do not have significant cost implications but which would greatly improve the overall effectiveness, efficiency and fairness of the social welfare system for all those who are dependent on it as well as for those who administer it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would also like to point to a number of measures which have already been taken and which are in line with the commission's recommendations.  Higher levels of payments have been provided for the long-term unemployed in each of the past four years which have gone part of the way to reducing the gap between the payments made to them and to other social welfare beneficiaries.  The three pilot projects for the long-term unemployed which were introduced this year <Col N="2387" /> are significant steps towards developing a flexible approach to the unemployed which was recommended by the commission.</P>
    <P>Significant progress has also been made in improving the delivery of the Department's services.  There has been a major reorganisation of the Department which has involved the setting up a separate Social Welfare Services Office.  This will enable the officials involved to concentrate more fully on effective management and the provision of an efficient and speedy delivery of services.  Computerisation of the Department's services has also been greatly advanced with the number of claims dealt with by the computer system being increased from 100,000 in December 1983 to over 1 million at present.</P>
    <P>The system of controls operated by the Department to prevent abuse of social welfare schemes and fraud has been tightened up and independent consultants are currently helping in a further systematic review of these controls to see where weaknesses remain and to find cost effective ways of remedying them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in the process of asking the Minister.  Since so much time has elapsed since that report was produced, have any of the priorities been identified by the Government?  For instance, have they identified the possibility of rationalising the child dependency allowances and targeting increased dependency children's payments to lower income groups, such as the unemployed? Have they decided to improve the family income support?  What views have they in relation to children's allowances, in relation to such items as the family income supplement and targeting more support for large families?  Have any of these priorities yet been identified by the Government?  Is there any intention to introduce a minimum income for those who are on low incomes?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>

      <P>As announced in the National Plan <i>Building on Reality 1985-1987,</i> the Government are committed to the rationalisation of the system of child support in order to ensure that available resources are targeted to those most in need.</P>
      <P>As a first step a non-taxable child benefit scheme providing monthly payments of £15.05 for each of the first five children and £21.75 for each subsequent child was introduced in April 1986.  This scheme was financed in part by the abolition of child tax allowances, which were of greatest benefit to those with highest incomes. These measures have brought about real improvements in the level of payments to low income families including families dependent on social welfare payments.</P>
      <P>Further developments will be considered in the context of the review which is taking place of the report of the Commission on Social Welfare.</P>

      <P>What are the Minister's intentions in real terms, of improving child benefit support because, in the infamous document <i>Building on Reality 1985-87,</i> it was suggested that, when the child benefit scheme was introduced to replace <Col N="2390" /> children's allowances, a minimum of £30 per month, per child, would be paid? No doubt the Minister well knows that the record of this Government has been quite atrocious in relation to financial support for children.</P>

      <P>It is unfortunate because the present Minister hides behind everything.  May I ask the Minister if she realises that this Government gave no increase in children's allowances in 1983, that in 1984 they gave a tiny increase of 7½ per cent from August when half the year was gone, that in 1985 they gave no increases and that this year they introduced this child benefit scheme which gave an increase of £12.03 to £15.03 per child per month, an increase of £3 per month or 75p per week or for a family on the lower tax bracket of 35 per cent, a gain of something in the region of 8p a week?  Does the Minister not accept that in the present day and age increases such as that are quite ridiculous <Col N="2391" /> and are certainly not sufficient to maintain essentials for families, particularly those with a large number of children?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with what the Deputy says because the Government, as has been pointed out in several other answers, have given considerable increases in real terms to social welfare beneficiaries, particularly those at the lowest level of social welfare.  The child benefit payment has specifically benefited those families at the lowest end of the social scale more than any other families. I think that is the right way to proceed. The annual cost of child benefit in 1986 is £206 million.  That is an enormous amount of money added to the rest of the social welfare bill.  We are targeting this money as far as possible towards families on the lowest end of the social welfare scale.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMcCarthy" hpid="Dr. McCarthy Dr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if she will give details of the anti-fraud measures which her Department are now taking, including the cost of these measures and the terms of reference given to Craig Gardner and Company in relation to their investigations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department have recently undertaken a number of anti-fraud measures.  On the disability benefit side a series of measures designed to improve control of abuse and fraudulent claiming have been introduced.  These include the recruitment of additional control staff including extra medical referees. Improved computer facilities to assist with speedy identification and retrieval of irregularly cashed cheques and streamlining the referral of claimants to the Department's medical referees are also in place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2392" /> In relation to unemployment payments, new procedures have been introduced in the Department's local offices which require clients as a matter of course to produce enhanced authoritative evidence of identity before claims are put into payment.  In addition, a designated officer has been appointed at each employment exchange to co-ordinate action on suspected cases of personation or multiple signing and to ensure that the follow-up action is both speedy and complete.</P>
    <P>Special interviewing sessions by members of the special investigation unit have been undertaken on an experimental basis.  Some 6,000 persons on the live register have been interviewed.  A review of this operation is at present under way.</P>
    <P>The problem of personation and multiple claiming is also being tackled by having more secure signing cards issued to unemployment claimants.  It is planned that these cards will be introduced in the near future at a Dublin exchange on a pilot basis in the first instance.  The experiment can be evaluated in the light of experience before any decision is made about proceeding further.</P>
    <P>The special investigation unit, which carries out investigations into cases of suspected fraudulent claiming of unemployment benefit and assistance has been strengthened by the provision of six additional posts.  As a result the level of investigation will be stepped up considerably. In all some 100 additional staff have been assigned for control purposes at a cost of £900,000 per annum.</P>
    <P>The consultancy firm of Craig Gardner and Company have been appointed to examine the problem of social welfare fraud.  The terms of reference are: to carry out an assessment of the public perception of fraud and of the actual level of fraud, to review the controls and systems used to qualify and pay claimants, and to make recommendations for cost-effective improvements in controls and systems.  The first phase of the review, the assessment of the public perception of fraud and the actual level of fraud has <Col N="2393" /> been completed and I expect to have a report of the findings shortly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>Even though I am glad to see the Minister of State here as he comes from the county in question, I would assume that the Minister for Labour would have come in, in view of the importance of this industry to the area.  Is the Minister aware that the failure to settle this dispute could mean the <Col N="2394" /> risk of closure which would have a disastrous effect on the economy and lives of not only the employees but just as importantly on the farmers in the area? Can I ask him further if he has communicated to the employers his anxiety over what appears to be a lock-out situation? Has he impressed upon them the importance of allowing the workforce to resume work so that direct negotiations can take place in a proper manner?</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Labour is at present at a Cabinet meeting.  He has expressed his concern for this critical issue.  It is a very sensitive problem and, as I said, discussions are due to commence at 4 p.m. this evening.  The Minister has already been in touch with the Labour Court and the machinery and facilities of the State are available should the need arise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>Can I take from that that the Minister has not been directly in contact with either the unions or the employers?  If not, will he immediately do so?  It appears to quite a number of us that there is a tit-for-tat situation which is not conducive to proper negotiations. I ask him to impress on the employers the need to have the workers return to work so that negotiations can take place in a proper and meaningful manner.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>

      <P>Before the Deputy proceeds I suggest in all seriousness that before he makes any pronouncements or passes judgment on it by implication or otherwise he should have a look at the record.

      <P>I am fully aware of what I said this morning.  I indicated that I wish to see a speeding up of the questions being taken during Question Time.  I said that you, a Cheann Comhairle, are the custodian of the House and you should and could use your discretion on certain matters.  There are certain types of questions that require exceptional treatment, you will admit, and we had one of those this afternoon.  I made the point this morning for the record that I felt that Ministers were taking the opportunity of making policy statements when answering questions.  We had a typical example of that this afternoon when the Minister took up a large percentage of time answering questions that had been before the House on a previous occasion.</P>

      <P>I hope the Deputy did not get into trouble, but he said to me this morning that we have to make speed.  I think he referred to the time when he came into the House in 1977 and 40 questions being dealt with then.  I think he exaggerated a little there. He went on to suggest to the Chair &mdash; I welcome his remarks because he was strengthening the Chair's position &mdash; that the Chair might consider curtailing the numbers of supplementaries.  Deputy Vincent Brady and I never lose our cool <Col N="2396" /> with each other.

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>As I stated when speaking before the break for questions, my contribution was by design discursive as the CIE company covered a very wide range of activities in the transport area and even outside it in the State.  Perhaps I could go quickly through the Minister's speech &mdash; it will not take long &mdash; and refer to some points from that speech.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appreciate very much that the Minister <Col N="2420" /> paid a tribute to the planners who originally established CIE.  When I want to get to the sources of planning for transport I go back to the Official Report and read what the then Minister, Deputy Seán Lemass, had to say in this regard.  I appreciate very much what the Minister said by way of compliment to the planners who are planning <i>in vacuo</i> to a great extent in that a good many decisions were taken during the war and the best of guesses of what would happen after the war were not good enough in many economies, let alone ours.</P>
    <P>The Minister touched on the history of CIE and mentioned a time when Dublin buses were paying the bills for the rest of the country.  That is long past as indicated by the figures I read into the record of the House before Question Time.  He mentioned Erskine Childers.  Seán Lemass became Taoiseach and Erskine Childers became President, so the Minsiter, Deputy Mitchell, is allowed a smile when he thinks of his potential future.  He criticises the management and marketing assumptions.  I am not so sure that the criticism is valid on marketing.  I agree with him that the marketing area is important and will be increasingly so.  I have the greatest confidence that Mr. Conlon, chairman and chief executive now, will emphasise marketing in the sense of developmental marketing, not in the sense of restricting activities in any way in order to show a neater profit.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that he has to get the subsidy right, and that is true.  I indicated that I was fully in support of it in so far as any remarks made in this House should try to build up morale in CIE with a view to developing in areas where profits would be made, but I still adhere to my thesis that transparency of accounts is important all around for the House, for CIE themselves, and for the citizens.</P>
    <P>The Minister went on to deal with how CIE developed and took over the Dublin United Tramways Company, and did not even taste badly in the mouths of citizens at the time.  He referred to the major dieselisation programme.  He made the point that CIE are now benefiting by much cheaper fuel.  That should be showing <Col N="2421" /> in the accounts and in increased efficiency for the same expenditure of money.  The long debate that took place about the electrification of the line between Howth and Bray when we were in Government between 1977 and 1981 will always remain with me because Deputy Pádraig Faulkner was then Minister and he was pregnant with this whole electrification programme.  He debated the matter privately with members of Government and in Government for a long time and finally came to a decision which has been criticised by the Minister and presumably by the Taoiseach on occasion, but in my opinion by general acclaim it is very successful indeed.  I know that people are calculating how much per passenger it is costing.  That is inclusive of capital cost.  When we are talking of what a passenger on a bus from Dublin to Kildare costs, we should be considering the road cost as well in that one if we are contemplating carrying out a similar exercise.</P>
    <P>The Minister and I have referred to the capital programme and I appeal to him that he would do for Cavan what I did for Inchicore when I decided to spend £43 million on the carriages when I was Minister for that short period of ten months.</P>
    <P>With regard to the link or interface between CIE and the Departments of Defence, Education and Social Welfare, I have already commented on the education and social welfare schemes.  I regard both of them in their own spheres as highly enlightened schemes as is the one for the Department of Defence. Many writers on social welfare throughout both the US and Britain have been on occasion in praise of those enlightened schemes.  I am glad to claim credit for them on this side of the House for the most part.</P>
    <P>The Galway-Aran ferry service has a subsidy of £0.8 million.  There is a problem there of the provision of a proper boat service and I would like the Minister to call the attention of the CIE board to that fact.  He visited the island of Inis Mór at some stage, and I hope that the provision is being speeded up.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2422" /> On looking through his script I see the word &ldquo;transparency&rdquo;.  I am with him on that.  Our definitions of &ldquo;transparancy&rdquo; may not be the same but I will continue to pursue greater transparancy.  Time and time again in the course of the debate this whole idea of competition between national rail and the provisional bus service will come up.  It is exercising the minds of everybody connected with it.  I am puzzled as to how it will work out. The Minister might well be advised to have another look at it to see his way to maintaining two companies rather than one.  Twice during the course of his speech the Minister mentioned the old CIE commitment to the hotels and their being siphoned off to CERT.  I would like some transparency there too, because CERT are in receipt of Social Fund moneys.  The hotels are being run commercially, I presume.  There is, as far as public funding is concerned, a grey area there and I am putting down a question to the Minister for Labour whose responsibility it is, to see how that funding is going.</P>
    <P>The amendments from the Seanad were obviously designed to strengthen the parts of the Bill dealing with industrial relations, workers' rights and so on and as such they are welcome.  I have a suspicion that they are a sop so far as the trade unions are concerned as they do not consider that the amendment which gave joint directors to the companies and the amendments about industrial relations and so on are adequate.</P>
    <P>In relation to the auditing of CIE accounts, I am pleased that, for example, the 1985 accounts have been available now for some weeks.  I will decide later as to whether I will put down an amendment about fixing the time for the publication of audited accounts.  I am not saying this in reference to CIE, but some of the semi-State companies are very slow in producing accounts.  I was waiting for some time for an account from B &amp; I which is a full State company.  It is a difficult thing with three companies, or two, if the Minister accepts our amendment, and a central parent board to put the accounts in order very quickly but <Col N="2423" /> there is enough expertise to produce the accounts without more than a three month delay.  A three month delay would be an optimum if it could be managed.  I would like the Minister's views when he is replying.</P>
    <P>Iarnród Eireann, Bus Éireann and Bus Átha Cliath are the three suggested names.  It is difficult to find names.  CIE took off wonderfully.  Nowadays nobody would know what one was talking about if one did not use the name Bord na Móna.  The ESB was anglicised and stayed that way although I always pay my cheques to An Bord Soláthair Leictreachais. If we could get a good succinct Irish name for the companies it would be desirable.  When the late Dr. Andrews was chairman he put on a big push for the Irish language inside of CIE and they deserve credit for their efforts in that regard.  There are still people in CIE who are very interested in and have a competence in the Irish language.  It has been a tradition in that company for many years.</P>
    <P>There is an awkward piece of English in section 8 (1) where it says:</P>
    <P>(1)  The principal object of the railway company shall be stated in its memorandum of association to be to provide...</P>
    <P>Some of the draftspeople should improve on that.  I would also like a definition of that part of subsection (3) of the same section which reads:</P>
    <P>The principal object of the Dublin bus company shall be stated in its memorandum of association to be to provide a passenger service by road for the city and county of Dublin and contiguous areas and to provide ancillary services...</P>
    <P>What exactly do we mean by contiguous areas?  Is the Bill meant to cover areas that Dublin city services are covering now or is it the intention to extend the areas that Dublin city services cover?</P>
    <P>The amendments made in the Seanad are interesting.  Subsections (7), (8) and (9) of section 8 reads:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2424" /> (7)  Where any function of the Board is, by virtue of this Act, a function of a company every provision of any enactment relating to the Board shall, in respect of that function and subject to the provisions of this Act, apply to the company as it applies to the Board.</P>
    <P>(8)  Each company shall undertake the functions assigned to it by virtue of this Act in compliance with such directions as the Board may give to the company in writing from time to time.</P>
    <P>(9)  In relation to competition between services of the companies, the companies shall have regard to the overall interest of the Board and in any conflict between the companies the Board shall decide the issue with due regard to its overall interest and the interests of the particular companies concerned.</P>
    <P>I can see the purpose of those provisions. It was to meet some of the criticism of the two companies idea, and the question of competition and its possible deleterious effects.  I would be afraid that the board would become too involved in the minutiae of the provincial bus and rail company because their real function is not that at all.  They are being given powers in the Bill to settle disputes.  They may well end up spending most of their time settling disputes, at least for a number of years if the two-companies idea is put through.  Subsection (10) of section 8 reads:</P>
    <P>(10)  The Board and the companies shall have due regard to the Board's social role and the need to maintain public transport services integrated to the maximum extent possible within the financial resources available to them.</P>
    <P>The social role has been accepted by the Minister, by the Fianna Fáil Party and by most Members of this House.  For most people, the social role would be what they do in regard to school buses, old age pensioners and others and for the former members of the Defence Forces, the old IRA and so on.  It is, as now defined by <Col N="2425" /> the Minister, covering the whole area of the subsidy, whatever that is, and we will be pushing for transparency in that regard also.</P>
    <P>Section 11(2)(c) relates to the problem solving role of the chairman of the board. It reads:</P>
    <P>(c) The Chairman of the Board may, with the consent of the Minister, be appointed on his own nomination to be chairman or a director of the company and may be removed from that office by the Minister;</P>
    <P>In section 11 (2) (f) a piece has been added on in the Seanad to the Bill as initiated.  The original Bill read:</P>
    <P>(f) the company shall, within a period specified by the Board, set up machinery for the purposes of negotiation concerned with the pay and conditions of its staff.</P>
    <P>Added on has been:</P>
    <P>and to this end consult with and make every reasonable endeavour to reach agreement with the trade unions concerned.</P>
    <P>I would have thought that that was self evident philosophy in regard to industrial relations.</P>
    <P>Section 11 (3) is also new and states that the directors to be appointed to each company shall include two persons selected from the members of the board appointed under the Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Act, 1977, provided that such persons are willing to accept office.  Subsection (4) is also new and it says that a majority of the directors of the railway company and the Irish bus company shall be common to both companies. Both those amendments were designed to meet the fears and the objections, especially from trade unionists, of what would happen when the two companies were welded together if the weld did not take too well.  If the Minister accepts my amendment in regard to two companies there will be no need for subsections <Col N="2426" /> (3) and (4) although if the Minister wishes to leave them in I will not object.</P>
    <P>In regard to section 13 which deals with membership of either House of the Oireachtas, I had a chip on my shoulder about this during the years 1973-77 when in Opposition because Members of the Oireachtas were excluded from various offices.  I suppose I have matured a little over the years and I am glad that there is a distinction made between director and employee.  There is provision for the seconding of an employee.  I do not know if that existed before but it is an advance and I commend the Minister for including it.</P>
    <P>Section 14 (5) says that every person who, immediately before the vesting day, is an officer or servant of the board shall not, while in the service of the board or a company, as the case may be, receive a lesser scale of pay or be brought to less beneficial conditions of service than the scale of pay to which he was entitled and the conditions of service to which he was subject immediately before the vesting day.  The information I got in regard to the specific case I mentioned in relation to the switch from Westland Row to the North Wall is an instance of where conditions of service immediately before vesting day will be worse than before. The same applies to subsection (6) which says that the conditions of service, restrictions, requirements and obligations to which they were subject immediately before the vesting day shall continue to apply and may be exercised or imposed by the board.</P>
    <P>I have already spoken about the auditing of accounts.  I will listen to the Minister's reply and I will then decide whether to include a period of three months in my amendment.  Perhaps it will not be possible to audit the accounts within three months, it can be extended to four months if necessary.  Section 25 (1) says that the Minister may, by order, confer on the board such further functions. including functions in relation to the development of the assets of the board, as the Minister thinks proper and specifies in the order.  Subsection (2) says that any <Col N="2427" /> such order may contain such incidental and supplementary provisions as the Minister thinks necessary or expedient for giving full effect to the order.  Subsection (3) says that every order under this section shall be made with the consent of the Minister for Finance.  They are fairly wide ranging powers but perhaps on Committee Stage we will be able to tease out the sections.</P>
    <P>Section 26 (1) says that the Minister may give to the board such directions in writing as to policy in relation to the functions of the board, the companies, or any of them, as he thinks proper.  That is a fairly strong section.  Subsection (2) says that the board shall comply and ensure compliance by the companies with every direction under this section.  In other words, the Minister has the power to direct the board and the board have the power to direct the companies.  Subsection (3) says that a direction under this section shall, if the board so request in writing, be given by the Minister by order.</P>
    <P>The whole Bill is connected with the social scene and the definition of the total subsidy is that it is a social one.  That being the case, this House decides it and I do not know what directions the Minister will give.  However, I am sure the Minister will expand on it.</P>
    <P>I support the Minister in his efforts to improve the morale of CIE and to exploit the full potential of the company.  We agree that there is great potential in their management and workforce whether in Inchicore, on the buses and trains or working as fitters in garages.  I came to that conclusion while studying the calibre of the people taken into it, by specific policies of CIE in the past and by reading their in-house magazines.  I realised what good they can do in the community apart altogether from their transport services. When you have that kind of potential, good leadership, good management and high morale great results can be achieved. I know that cynicism is an animal that grows and that many words spoken here in regard to CIE will be treated cynically. However, the cynic has never achieved <Col N="2428" /> anything and he or she is well defined as someone who knows the cost of everything and the value of nothing.  The House can do something in regard to morale and potential.</P>
    <P>I should also like to refer to transparency. I would like a breakdown of all figures.  I made the point about leaving certificate pupils who in the past were accustomed to sitting examinations for CIE, I said their employment depended on public competitive examinations.  I hope CIE adhere to that arrangement.  I will be putting down a substantial amendment with regard to two companies instead of three because of the various difficulties to which I referred and because too heavy a burden will be placed on the board who will be very busy developing the company and, like the conductor of an orchestra, keeping the three companies, or two as the case may be, going and in tune.</P>
    <P>I am not complaining about CIE's audited accounts this year.  However, I fear that bad habits might develop as has happened in other semi-State bodies and whose accounts when published are out of date.  When that is the case people cannot make any useful contribution in regard to improving the operations of a company.</P>
    <P>I mentioned policy directives from the Department.  I should like to refer also to the European aspect of transport in this country.  CIE are the major transport company but we have not got a transport committee of the House.  Thanks to MEP, Paddy Lawlor, I get literature from the European Parliament when they speak about transport committees.  The House has committees on public expenditure, semi-State bodies and so on and it should certainly also have a committee on transport.</P>
    <P>I am sorry that the Dublin Transport Authority is not the one I envisaged because no one from CIE has been appointed to the new board which the Minister announced.  Someone should have been involved in the transport scene, especially in Dublin city. However, perhaps we will deal with that another day.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to give a qualified welcome to this Bill.  It has many merits, the main one being that it should bring about a great deal of new and fresh thinking, air and light into the organisation and administration of our public transport services.  Many of us have been calling for this for a long time. The McKinsey report focused greater attention on the inadequacies of our public transport system and its inability to meet the needs of modern requirements. I hope this Bill will bring about a vast improvement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The concept of three companies and a single supervising board is a good idea. It will have the advantage of allowing single-minded pursuit in the marketing area.  There should not be any conflict. They could and should complement each other's services.  More attention could have been given to this in the past, particularly so in relation to new urban areas which have gone up in the periphery of Dublin over the past ten to 15 years, but unfortunately it was not.  Over the past <Col N="2430" /> ten to 15 years it would be true to say that we have been generally providing public transport in accordance with the needs that were there in the previous 20 years.  I will have to be extremely critical of the slow manner in which CIE responded to modern demands and needs.</P>
    <P>I have heard that in recent times, and I welcome this, mainline rail reductions have been brought about by allowing CIE to compete with private enterprise at weekends etc.  Why did it take eight or ten years to bring that about?  Surely it must have been obvious for years that that was necessary and desirable.  I would like to see much more of that kind of development under the heading of the legislation we have before us today. Unless there is a dramatic new appraisal of the way we look at transport techniques in this country within the confines of the new companies we will just go through the performance of setting up three new companies and a parent body and achieve nothing.  Surely, we must recognise that we are dealing with vastly different demands from those that prevailed up to now?  If we recognise that and the three new boards recognise that and the parent body of CIE also recognise it the general welcome the Bill has received will be well placed.</P>
    <P>I would also like to refer briefly to the fact that down through the years, particularly over the last ten years, there has been increased criticism from CIE of the damage done to their markets by private enterprise.  This issue was alluded to a couple of occasions today.  The public are not interested in how they receive their services provided that those services meet their demands, provided that they are convenient and provided they are not unnecessarily expensive.  Because there is competition in the market place CIE and we as politicians recognise that there is a need for change.  It has taken a long time to put into operation what was felt for some time to be necessary.  We have to accept that in the present climate the subvention still exists and will exist for some time into the future.  While the public are glad of the services they are <Col N="2431" /> critical of the amount of money which is required to provide the services, be they transport or otherwise.  It would be well for the new revamped transport companies to have regard to the fact that in the future there will be competition of one kind or another.</P>
    <P>Competition is not going to go away. It is going to be much more perceptive in its interpretation of market damands than previously.  For that reason there will always be, regardless of what reorganisations take place, the threat of competition from other areas.  Obviously, this will come from private enterprise.  For that reason, we must keep in mind that we do have subvention which is going to remain in place for some time.  The public are not all that happy about large subventions. Neither should the Government. The public pay for the services by way of their everyday use of the services and by way of subvention but they may well become more critical in the future of the use of their money in that fashion.</P>
    <P>I disagree with my colleague across the floor, Deputy Wilson, with regard to the two versus three companies.  As I mentioned a moment ago, the provision of these new structures will give greater time and scope and make for greater energy to be devoted to the three separate agencies than would otherwise be the case if we divided CIE up into two companies instead of three as was suggested by Deputy Wilson.  They are three separate areas.  There are the city bus services, there are the provincial bus services and there are the railway services. There should be no difficulty whatever in having those three services dovetail their efforts to provide a good, sound and reasonably priced transport service to the people of the country.</P>
    <P>They can do that in a number of ways. One of the ways they cannot do it is to retire into some kind of a cocoon where they will feel they will be protected from outside forces and can object to any kind of competition.  That is the wrong way to go about it.  The obvious thing to do is to encourage healthy competition between each other but not to the extent of damaging <Col N="2432" /> each other's prospects.  They should keep each other on their toes in the market and be aware and alert to market requirements.  They can also assist each other by laying on services that will enhance the services offered by the other. It is generally accepted that that was the original proposal.</P>
    <P>If they follow that course they can provide a new transport policy for the country which will bring with it public contentment and an awareness of the transport system that never existed.  We have all heard stories of the public not wishing to use the public transport system and that in other countries citizens use the public transport system to a greater extent than they do here.  Why is that so? I do not think it is because people in those countries are paid more.  It is my view that the companies operating in those countries are more sensitive to market needs than CIE have been.  The services that the public want are provided by those transport companies.</P>
    <P>In the last ten years it has become obvious that the transport services offered to the public, with the exception of the rail service, are totally inadequate to meet the requirements of an expanding population.  For that reason the slack is being taken up by private operators.  Had the challenge not come from that quarter the company may not have embarked on any change of policy and that would not have been to the benefit of the country. I hope that the reorganisation proposed will result in an improvement in the morale of the workers and an efficiency in the national transport services.  There should be an improvement in industrial relations and the division of time by staff should allow for greater accessibility by the workforce to management than under the present system.  The company are too large, too cumbersome and too difficult to operate.</P>
    <P>A service that satisfied demands some years ago is no longer acceptable.  People may have tolerated having to wait at bus stops that did not have shelters some years ago but that is not acceptable today. Some years ago people would walk up to two miles to a centre of population to get <Col N="2433" /> a bus but that is not good enough today. Competition has meant that the public are being offered a better service.  The public, who are the customers of CIE, should not be expected to wait in cold, windswept and rain washed open spaces without a modicum of comfort for a bus to arrive.  The glass shelters erected by the company do not last long and are not suitable.  It is important that the company do everything possible to make the passengers who use their services more comfortable.  They should be made feel that they are wanted and are part and parcel of what keeps the company going. People in other countries travel in greater comfort than bus passengers here.</P>
    <P>I hope the new companies that will be established following the passage of this legislation will respond more positively to the demands of the public.  Some time ago I had occasion to make a simple request for an extension of a service to a big centre of population, Leixlip in County Kildare.  The demand has been there for that service for many years.  I accept that there were technical reasons for not extending this service but it is amazing how technical reasons can be overcome elsewhere.  Finally, it has been decided to carry out a survey to ascertain if the people in the area want an extension of the service.  There are 3,000 houses in the area and the nearest bus service is almost two miles away.  The nearest rail service is two and a half miles away.  The new companies will have to provide a better service for that town.  Where towns can prove that there is a demand for a bus service the new companies should give them sympathetic consideration.</P>
    <P>I hope that under the new proposals there will be a greater recognition of the role that should be played in the future by the rail service.  Questions about the viability of the rail service have been raised and we have heard that the existing services are not as profitable as they should be but it is important to remember that the basic structure is in existence. Other countries have managed to expand their rail services and it is amazing that <Col N="2434" /> here we have an awful habit of dismantling services that have been operating efficiently and replacing them with something more modern or better looking. In the urban areas that are not expected to get the electric train service a better and more competitive urban rail service should be provided.  I cannot see any reason for the diesel train service not being extended.  I am aware of the controversy that went on in regard to the introduction of the DART service on the Bray-Howth line.</P>
    <P>Particularly in my area of north Kildare, there is ample scope for the provision of far greater services than exist at present, even within the limitations of the diesel sevices.  There are new towns growing and expanding all the time. There are greater demands by the public as to the time at which they want to be at work in the mornings and for later and longer services in the evening.  It is up to the rail transport service to provide them with something to meet their requirements, otherwise alternative means will be found and there will be no use in saying afterwards that this is unfair competition. Admittedly, it cannot and will not be provided within the rail service, but it will be provided by somebody who will see the need to fill the market void regarding road services.  As I have mentioned on numerous occasions, if it is not done one way it will be done in another, simply because the people do not particularly mind who provides the services so long as they are efficient, reasonably priced and good.  With relation to transport services, it is most important that companies involved change with the times.  If they do not, events will overtake them and pass them by and after a while existing criteria becomes irrelevant.</P>
    <P>I would hope that under this new reorganisation we will see the development of a new way of thinking and a new perception that will involve a much more dramatic response to the needs and demands of the public and that that new thinking will extend to recognition of the fact that unless the public needs are met somebody somewhere else will have the right to fill that void.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2435" /> I would ask the Minister to use his good offices with CIE to try to have services, particularly bus services, for the area I mentioned, Leixlip in County Kildare, provided as soon as possible.  I know that there have been technical reasons for not providing the services, but these were overcome in Cork and other areas so why can they not be overcome in Kildare?  I ask the Minister not necessarily to wait until the reorganisation takes place to provide new bus services.  I hope that under the new reorganised system trains will appear on schedule, not like the West Clare Railway, particularly in relation to the western suburban line to Maynooth, where it is not at all unusual for a train not to appear, with very few apologies made.  That is not the way to operate. The public will not accept that any more. With the division of responsibilities as well as the division of services, I hope we will see a totally different attitude in relation to such matters.</P>
    <P>We hope, in the future, under the proposals set out in this legislation, to see three companies operating under a parent body who will be able to give much more of their individual time, both in terms of the company and the management within each company, to the demands and requirements of the public. If that does not happen, the companies will be serving no useful purpose at all.  I should hate to think that we might produce three companies three times as cumbersome as previously.  When we are introducing this legislation I hope the Minister and the House will ensure, by the various guidelines to be issued, that that will be made quite clear to everybody.</P>
    <P>Reorganisation of this company is long overdue and should have come several years ago.  It should have come gradually in line with the changing climate and the changing times.  The reorganisation will be successful, provided that those responsible remain sensitive to the fact that there will always be changing demands and changing tastes.  Transport companies, whether road or rail, must accept that their future and their success or failure <Col N="2436" /> will depend entirely on their ability to meet the customers' requirements, at the same time having regard to the fact that they are at all times open to competition from one source or another.  The public who pay as subventors on the one hand and as fare paying customers on the other will always be hard to please and rightly so.  The person who pays the piper should call the tune.  We hope that these new companies will determine the basis for a grand new transport service that will become self reliant and self efficient and that as a result the public will receive a far better service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisFoley" hpid="Mr. Foley Mr. Foley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foley</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity of contributing to this very important Bill.  It is very comprehensive and important legislation and I believe that it requires a full debate in this House.  For many years, CIE have been subjected to much criticism, but over the years they have served the country well in producing an excellent range of services which have been instrumental in creating worthwhile employment in many areas throughout rural Ireland.  With the spin-off in purchasing materials, etc., they have spent massive sums of money and for this reason major changes could have far reaching effects.  I understand it is estimated that up to 50 per cent of the present subvention to CIE &mdash; that would be in excess of £50 million last year &mdash; went towards goods and services provided by outside contractors such as tyre manufacturers, caterers, etc.  CIE have had many business interests here in one way or another.  They have had to build them into viable concerns and these, in turn, have provided excellent employment as a result of the financial input from CIE.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recently received correspondence from the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union in relation to this Bill. Many excellent points have been made by the union.  I was disappointed to be told, not by that union but by many workers attached to CIE, that the union did not have a major input into this very important legislation, especially so since CIE have at this moment over 14,000 <Col N="2437" /> workers on their pay roll.  Most of these &mdash; and I speak with particular emphasis in regard to Kerry &mdash; are very concerned. I share their concern.  What does the future hold for them?  I know the Minister means well but will the present conditions of service they enjoy be maintained?  Will employees in the more viable operations have better conditions?  Many of the workers have given long years of dedicated service.</P>
    <P>This Bill has major consequences for future transport policy.  We must do what is best as regards having an effective transport policy.  Many CIE workers have expressed their concern regarding the future.  CIE are good employers in Tralee.  There are 170 people in full time employment.  There is also an excellent school transport scheme.  There are 41 part-time drivers and over 100 private contractors.  CIE workers in Tralee as elsewhere are dedicated, courteous and most efficient.  Over the years they have taken a personal pride in their work.  The wage bill for Tralee is £1.5 million and the school transport bill is just under £1 million.</P>
    <P>Tremendous strides have been made in the mainline service from Tralee to Dublin.  I hope this will be maintained if not improved.  One cannot help but think that this Bill is based on the McKinsey report under a different heading.  The explanatory memorandum states that it is a Bill to implement the Government decision on the re-organisation of CIE as published in the national plan <i>Building on Reality</i> and provides for CIE being retained as the parent company to three operating subsidiaries to be formed by the board of CIE and registered under the Companies Acts.  This Bill sets out the principal objectives of the company and provides for the assignment of staff to them.</P>
    <P>It is well known that the Government wish to hive off the school bus scheme to private operators.  This is one of the profit making sections of CIE and if this proposal is implemented it will have far-reaching effects for every CIE garage and for the staff involved in the scheme.  They <Col N="2438" /> are very worried and would like clarification of their position.  As the school transport system is a viable proposition it should be retained by CIE.  In Tralee the scheme is run by a small number of staff who are very efficient and caring about their work.</P>
    <P>Over the past six years CIE have replaced much of their fleet.  I understand this entailed an expenditure of over £100 million for 800 buses and 50 new tourist coaches.  Unfortunately the tourist season was not a good one but this was a good investment.  CIE have played an important role with regard to tourism especially in the Cork and Kerry region. There was always an excellent bus service to meet the trains and ferry people to outlying areas.  Will the same facilities be available when this Bill is passed?</P>
    <P>CIE provincial rail and bus services should be amalgamated into one company. In that way the present facilities could be guaranteed.  If not, competition will set in between both companies and this would mean that the bus company would not co-operate with the rail company.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that the board of CIE will still retain their powers and responsibilities.  I hope he will clarify the position regarding the holding company. It is not clear from the Bill what function it will have except that it will be a controlling company.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>Like previous speakers I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  The Minister outlined in detail the progress made by CIE since this Government came to power.  He outlined the means he has adopted to see that this company are put on a firm footing which will enable them to provide the services required by the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Initially CIE were considered to be a thorn in the side of the taxpayer and one which would never be relieved.  The economic situation which resulted from what was considered to be bad financial management of the company was such that there were horror headlines about CIE's deficit.  I am glad the Minister was able to come to the House and point out <Col N="2439" /> the change which has taken place.  That is to the credit not only of the Minister but of the board and management of CIE and of all the workers in the company. As the previous speaker pointed out, CIE are substantial employers.  For a company to continue their social responsibility and try to meet their economic targets under present financial constraints is a major achievement.  The Minister was right to praise CIE.</P>
    <P>I have noticed a change of management in the mid-west region where younger people are joining the company.  People who work for CIE always give an out-going presentation of themselves and while Deputy Durkan might not be happy with the service I have seen at first hand a great improvement in the quality of the service in the rail, bus and catering areas. The company have moved into the tourist market in the mid-west region.  Tourist coaches have been seen to advantage in that region.  I regret that the coaches were not manufactured here.  I had hoped CIE would place the order with GAC in Shannon. However, this was not to be and the company decided to buy abroad.  I appeal to CIE to reconsider their position in the Irish market and set about manufacturing here if that is possible.</P>

      <P>I thank you for the opportunity of raising this extremely important matter on the Adjournment this evening.  The Minister indicated that there are 17,000 families who will be affected by the cuts in social welfare as a result of the manner in which this legislation is being implemented.</P>
      <P>I had a question down to the Minister today, No. 18, requesting information on her proposals in regard to her promise in this House a week ago that special arrangements would be made under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme to assist certain categories of families who would be affected.  In view of the fact that payments under this scheme are to take effect from next Monday, 17 November, whatever arrangements are being made should have been in place by now.  According to the Minister's written reply, no arrangements have been made in relation to this matter.  The Minister said that discussions were at present taking place between officials of her Department and the health boards on this matter and she was not therefore in a position to give a firm indication of the final outcome.  If that is the position today, how does she expect such a scheme will be in place next Monday when the cuts apply?  I have grave doubts whether she will be able to achieve any such arrangements with the health boards.</P>
      <P>I raised the matter myself with the Eastern Health Board and was informed by the programme manager that he considered that what the Minister said she intended doing was legally impossible because it would result in further discrimination against other families who were not affected by this scheme but who would be on lower income than those the Minister was proposing to assist.  Further anomalies are being introduced into this scheme as a result of what the Minister is proposing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as I am concerned the way in which this is being introduced is an <Col N="2441" /> obscene abuse of the term &ldquo;equality&rdquo;. Not only will it result in a massive drop in the income of many thousands of families but it will also discriminate directly against women who, we are told, this equality legislation has been introduced to assist.  Because of the £50 ceiling on gross earnings the reality is that thousands of women will be forced out of employment and into the black economy. They will be forced to do part-time work, where they will have no protection under labour legislation and they will only have minimal social welfare protection.  This is an obscenity so far as it relates to equality.</P>
    <P>Last week the Minister made an announcement about a supplementary welfare allowance scheme.  It was clearly, and I pointed it out at the time, an attempt to get the Labour Party off the hook because they were having some difficulty supporting the Government on the Private Members' motion.  In effect, it was a confidence trick, not only on this House but on the people who will be affected by the cuts next week.</P>
    <P>I challenge the Minister to try to live on £100 a week for the next year, the amount the majority of people whose social welfare payments will be cut from next week will have to survive on.  I can guarantee that she will not be able to do that.  If she were living on £100 a week I have no doubt she would introduce a postponement of this scheme.  If she fully understood the hardship which thousands of families will face over the next few months as a result of the implementation of this scheme.  I have no doubt she would agree that this scheme should be postponed indefinitely, at least until a proper phasing in of equalisation has been achieved, so that no one will suffer a net loss of income as a result of this measure, and that the six years it took to introduce the legislation would be extended by a further six years so that this equalisation would be phased in over the next six years, as was supposed to happen over the last six years.  This would be a great benefit to the families who will be affected by the cutbacks.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2442" /> No doubt the Minister will quote statistics that the people who will be affected are not the worst off, and that there are 150,000 other families worse off, and that is true, but that does not make it any easier on the families whose incomes will be cut.  It does not make it any easier for them to meet their rents, pay their mortgage, feed their families, get in food for Christmas, buy school books, clothes and so on.  The reality is that the vast majority of people affected by these cutbacks are those who are already on the verge of the poverty line.  In the majority of cases those whose incomes will be cut back are the people who are forced to work for a pittance &mdash; women who are working for the lowest wages.</P>
    <P>When this Bill was going through I proposed, and I proposed last week also, that the gross income ceiling be increased to £100 a week.  If that were done, it would still be less than half the average industrial wage, but it would make it possible for these families to survive, for many women who are working at present to keep food on the table and make it possible for these women to continue in work.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to come off the hobby horse of statistics that in some way she is being true to some philosophy of equality when the effect of what she is doing is directly discriminating against women and some of the poorest families in our society.  I urge her to take immediate steps to postpone the implementation of this scheme and to ensure that next week families will not suffer the major losses which face them.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that there will be utter chaos next week if this scheme goes ahead, both administratively and otherwise. Again I appeal to the Minister to postpone the scheme and to introduce a proper phasing in of it so that families who will be affected by it will not suffer any loss.</P>
    <P>I have agreed to give some of the time available to me to Deputy Tomás Mac Giolla to speak on the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I was absolutely disgusted this afternoon listening to the <Col N="2443" /> replies of the Minister for Social Welfare, for example, when a question was raised in regard to the effects of the equalisation proposals on up to 20,000 families.  I think the Minister corrected that figure to 17,000 families.  But whether it be 20,000 or 17,000 families my disgust is with the manner in which she and her predecessor have handled this matter, which was drawn to their attention when the relevant Bill was introduced.  We supported the equalisation proposal but pointed out the dangers inherent in it and the manner in which it could affect many thousands of families whose incomes would be reduced.  Neither the Minister nor her predecessor paid any attention whatsoever although they have had the last six years in which to work out a method of introducing a fair system of equality legislation.  What really disgusted me this afternoon was the arrogant manner in which the Minister tried to divide the poverty-striken people into two separate categories &mdash; those on the lowest level of poverty, suffering from malnutrition, and those who happen to have enough to eat at present, who are not regarded as being badly off at all because they can eat but who probably cannot even clothe themselves properly.  They are still poverty-striken people.  The Minister was endeavouring to say that they were not too badly off although up to 150,000 of them are suffering from malnutrition.  A further 20,000, or 17,000, as the Minister says, are being driven down to that level. This will be remembered of this Minister long after the shilling taken off the old age pension has been forgotten although that stigma lasted for the best part of 50 years.  This Government will be remembered as being worse than that Cumann na Gael Government for the manner in which they have treated people on the lowest income levels in our society, people who are already suffering grave hardship, who are unable to live.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will give the Minister a couple of examples.  Take the case of a young family, a husband and wife with two children under five years of age.  The husband had been receiving unemployment assistance <Col N="2444" /> of £81.75, which included allowance for the children, and the wife was in receipt of a disability benefit of £41.10, making a total of £122.85.  The husband's unemployment assistance has now been reduced to £36.55: the wife receives an increase, including allowance for a child giving her a total of £51.10 which, with the Minister's famous cushion of £10, makes a total of £97.65.  This constitutes a loss to the family of over £25.  That family pay £50 a week by way of mortgage payments to purchase their home.  If one deducts that £50 per week from the £97.65 that means a husband, wife and two children are expected to live on the remaining £47.65.  This means they will be unable to pay the £50 per week which, in turn, means they will lose their home. But the Minister does not care.</P>
    <P>Another example I might cite is that of an elderly couple, with no children, no dependants.  The husband had been receiving unemployment assistance of £63.15 and the wife was in receipt of disability benefit of £41.10.  The husband's income is now reduced to £26.60. Yet, in accordance with the Minister's own regulations, the lowest amount he should have been receiving was the maximum personal rate, that is, £36.70, but his entitlement has been reduced to £26.60, £10 less than her Department say is the personal rate he should have been receiving.  The Minister deducts £10 and then adds the £10 cushion.  Certainly there is no £10 cushion for that man.</P>
    <P>The third example I will give is that of a woman working whose gross weekly earnings amount to £58.42.  She works for 33 weeks of the year only.  Her earnings average out much less than £50 per week. That woman does not draw any benefit for the remainder of the year.  Therefore she should be regarded as being in receipt of less than £50 per week but the Minister will not regard her position as such.</P>
    <P>I would remind the Minister that this is the position in the very week in which she is cutting back payments to those 17,000 or 20,000 people, anything from £26 to £40 per week, driving them further into the poverty trap and preventing them purchasing their homes by way of mortgage <Col N="2445" /> repayments.  But if they are paying rents on corporation dwellings &mdash; as probably most of them are &mdash; last week many of those rents were doubled.  Certainly all of them have been increased, many having risen from approximately £7 to approximately £13 while others have risen to £16 and more.</P>
    <P>This means that there are simultaneously within this Government two Ministers endeavouring to bring people on the lowest level in our society down even further.  The Minister should realise what the position is like on the ground. As Deputy De Rossa asked: does the Minister have any conception of what is happening on the ground, or what is the level of poverty?  There is no point in talking about combating poverty when we have a Minister for Social Welfare who has no intention of combating poverty, who says that people on the poverty line should consider themselves lucky because there are others lower down the line than they.  Why does she not pluck the money from the people at the top of the heap rather than taking it from the people at the bottom, which is precisely what she is doing?  There have been six years in which successive Governments could have considered how best to introduce this equality legislation without causing any hardship.  But they delayed its implementation.  I must blame Fianna Fáil in this regard also because such legislation could have been introduced within the term of office of the last Fianna Fáil Government.  Instead successive Governments have left it to the last possible minute until the European Court would be liable to take a case against them for not introducing the equality legislation. Certainly, they did not give consideration to its effects on the people on the ground. The Minister should examine the situation obtaining on the ground, look at the poverty she is creating, acknowledge the fact that she has passed it off by saying that they can get supplementary benefit. They cannot get supplementary benefit because the Minister has not increased the staffing or money available to do so.</P>
    <P>In reply to a further question today <Col N="2446" /> from Deputy De Rossa the Minister indicated that she had done nothing about this although she made the announcement in this Chamber that she was arranging to make supplementary welfare allowances available so that everybody who was being deprived could go along and beg for the money &mdash; as they have to do &mdash; for clothes, shoes, food or to pay their electricity charges.  Certainly they will not get anything to pay their mortgage repayments.  The Minister does not take the latter into account at all.</P>
    <P>The Minister has done absolutely nothing on that line.  She has not made the money or staffing available so that people could receive the benefits to which they are entitled if they are to be allowed continue to live, to have some element of comfort, at least food, clothing and shelter.</P>
    <P>As well as driving women out of the workforce, the Minister is driving people out of their homes.  This will mean that either the Minister or one of her colleagues will be forced to house people who have been driven out of their homes. As I pointed out, there was the case of the young family expected to live on £47.65 a week having paid their £50 mortgage repayment, a figure which will probably increase.  These repayments are not taken into consideration.  Yet that family will receive nothing by way of supplementary welfare benefits to assist them in paying their mortgage.  These are the actual effects of the use which the Minister has made of this equality directive. It was pointed out to her predecessor, Deputy Barry Desmond, 12 months ago and nothing has been done in the meantime to implement it.  The Minister must move very rapidly to prevent an extraordinary eruption next week which is what will occur when those people get the money into their hands. They will see how badly off they will be.</P>

      <P>In all our discussions in the House on this issue, of which there have been several and on which there have been a great many explanations given, <Col N="2447" /> we are inclined to entirely ignore the fact that for very many years married women who worked were discriminated against financially in the matter of social welfare entitlements.  Families were getting less money into their hands because the person who happened to be in receipt of the social welfare payment was a married woman.  I did not notice continual Private Members' motions, adjournment debates or questions on that issue during all those years.  I noticed the terminology used in a discussion on this issue when we were talking about families who would lose under the equality directive and married women who would gain.  I deplore that use of terminology.  The 46,000 families who gained last May have gained considerably and have been at least given the justice that they should have had.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of the implementation of the equality directive bore out the fact that there were a great many people in the Irish social welfare system who were in receipt of double payments.  These were only men because women were never entitled to those double payments. A man in receipt of a social welfare payment was getting an adult dependency allowance for his spouse irrespective of the status of that spouse, whether she was working or in receipt of a social welfare payment.  Under the equality directive we were therefore faced, as was explained at great length in the Dáil last year, with a situation where we either gave all women adult dependency allowances and therefore one couple would get four payments from the social welfare system, two single rates and two adult dependency rates or we would have to make an arrangement to equalise the position by taking away the adult dependency rate from a person who was getting it in respect of another adult who was not a dependant.  Deputies cannot have it both ways.  They seem to be inferring that we want to have equal treatment for 46,000 families where the married woman was heretofore discriminated against but we do not want to have equal treatment for families where <Col N="2448" /> there is a double payment going into the house.</P>

      <P>I resent and reject the suggestion of a confidence trick.  This was made perfectly clear in this House in July 1985.  There can be no question of any attempt whatsoever to hide any effects of this implementation.  Because the Government realised that the necessity to follow the EC directive would impose hardship on certain groups, we introduced, at a cost of an extra £9 million to the taxpayer, alleviating measures to cushion the effect of the loss of the double payments that individuals were receiving. We did that in what we considered to be the most equitable manner possible.  I stand firmly by the fact that that was and remains a generous entitlement and a generous attempt to alleviate the effects of equality on that small number of families who lose compared to the considerable number, 46,000, who gain.</P>
      <P>I also reject the inference that I used the expression that families should count themselves lucky because they are not as poor as other families.  That is an absolute untruth.  It was never said in this House by me and never would be said by me under any circumstances.  I also want to make it quite clear that in regard to the people on the lowest rate of social welfare this Government over the last four years improved in real terms the position of the social welfare recipients at the lowest level well beyond any increases received by people at work and well beyond the increases in the cost of living.  We stand absolutely firm on our record of improvements in the social welfare system over the years.  This year we are putting an extra £18 million into the hands of social welfare recipients with the introduction of equal treatment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I announced in the Dáil on 29 October <Col N="2449" /> my intention to introduce further alleviating measures for a particular group of people who were dependent on social welfare payments only.  The £10 which they were receiving might not be adequate because of particular financial commitments which they had.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I withdraw it.  On 29 October I said in the House that I was particularly concerned about those families totally dependent on social welfare payments where both spouses were receiving a payment in their own right.  I would reiterate that the vast majority of social welfare recipients, 150,000 families, are unaffected by this directive.  I would be sorry to think that any Deputy deplored the fact that we were attempting to introduce an extra alleviating measure. I got an impression that they deplored the fact that we were making a further attempt at alleviation as a result of the real concerns expressed by Deputies to us and as a result of the information which we have in the Department.  In those cases the wife was treated as a dependant of the husband who received an increase of benefit for her even though she was receiving the personal rate of her own payment.  With equal treatment the husband loses the increase for his wife.  That was one thing under this directive which we were concerned to further alleviate. The situation where a spouse is entitled to benefit in his or her own right while the partner is also being paid a dependant's increase is inconsistent, and must be seen logically as inconsistent, with equal treatment. Under the equality directive each beneficiary should be entitled to be paid an increase for the other.  I think people will recognise that this would be unreasonable as well as being extremely costly.  The only solution to this problem is to cease to regard a spouse in receipt <Col N="2450" /> of benefit as a dependant of the other.</P>
      <P>It was recognised that the loss of the adult dependant increase for existing beneficiaries could cause financial difficulties. To provide for this situation an additional transitional payment of £10 weekly was proposed for 52 weeks or for as long as the two claims lasted.  It was also recognised that some families in this category might have entered into commitments which they might find it difficult to meet.  To provide for these cases I proposed that additional assistance be given through the supplementary welfare allowance scheme and that we would, and I said this quite clearly, discuss the necessary measures with the health boards which are responsible for administering that service.  Discussions have taken place and are still under consideration. They have not been finalised so that I am not in a position to give details at present.  The form the measures would take would be payment of weekly supplements for rent and mortgage interest or other similar outgoings by way of relaxed eligibility criteria which would enable these families to qualify for a supplement or for a higher amount than they would be entitled to at present.  This, as I pointed out in the Dáil, would be a transitional arrangement because under the criteria of equal treatment and the directive it has to be a transitional arrangement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from relaxation of the means conditions for supplements, the administration and application procedures would be similar to those existing at present.  I am concerned, as the Deputies are, that we will arrive at a situation where we will be able to have these conditions in operation so that people will be able to make application.  There is no question of not making available the necessary finance for this work. The question is a complex one.  I count on the goodwill of all the people concerned in my own Department, the community welfare officers' department and also in the Department of Health that we will be able to genuinely help these people about whom we are all concerned. I hope, and I am quite sure, that we will <Col N="2451" /> be able to reach that agreement and make that arrangement so that the extra measures I have introduced will be brought into play.</P>

      <P>The additional alleviating measures which I announced on 29 October are intended to provide further assistance in certain circumstances to those families dependent on social welfare payments where both spouses are entitled to a payment in their own right and the man loses the adult dependant allowance as a result of equal treatment.

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2399" /> Employment under the social employment scheme is insurable for occupational injuries benefit only and is therefore liable for a Class J rate of PRSI contribution of 2.43 per cent made up of 2 per cent from the employee and 0.43 per cent from the employer.  In the case of a current medical service card holder, however, the employer is liable for the full amount.  The person concerned falls into this category and consequently he was not liable for any payment arising from his employment by the board which commenced on 1 December 1985.</P>
    <P>I understand that contributions at the higher Class A rate of PRSI contributions were deducted in error in the case of some 12 persons employed by the health board under the social employment scheme.  Refunds are being made in these cases also.</P>

      <P>There are two fuel schemes at present.  The national scheme applies generally but under this scheme persons receiving unemployment assistance are not eligible for fuel vouchers.  The urban scheme applies to eligible persons resident in certain urban districts or to eligible persons rehoused by those local authorities outside their areas.  This scheme includes unemployment assistance applicants with dependants.  The person referred to by the Deputy does not, however, reside in the functional area of Dublin Corporation and does not accordingly qualify for a fuel allowance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I said in reply to another question that, pending the outcome of court proceedings in relation to the national fuel scheme, it is proposed to continue the <Col N="2400" /> fuel schemes in their present form for the 1986-87 heating season and to examine the question of providing a single uniform scheme for the whole country from October 1987 onwards.</P>
    <P>As regards unemployment assistance, under the legislation, applicants who reside in certain urban areas qualify for assistance at a rate which is higher than the basic rate of unemployment assistance which applies elsewhere.  The person concerned was assessed with means of £0.20 per week, derived from capital.  He is, accordingly, in receipt of £61.10 weekly which is the rate payable in his case of £61.30 less means of £0.20. This rate of payment is the appropriate rate payable in his case having regard to his place of residence.</P>
    <P>Equalising the basic rates of unemployment assistance would have significant cost implications.

      <P>Following a reinvestigation of her circumstances on 19 August 1986 the means of the person concerned derived from a farm holding and a small amount of capital were assessed at £53.10 a week. This exceeds the limit of £48 a week applicable to her as a widow under 66 years of age with no qualified children. She appealed against this decision but the appeal was disallowed by an appeals officer on 17 October 1986.  On 3 November 1986 the widow forwarded a letter from her solicitor indicating that she had transferred her farm to her son. A social welfare supervisor later confirmed that the deed was acceptable as proof that the widow had divested herself of her farm.</P>

      <P>(b)  The budget for financing the board's mariculture grants scheme in 1986 is IR£500,000.  Salmon projects compete on their merits for finance from this scheme.  Grants are also available from Údarás na Gaeltachta for suitable projects in Gaeltacht areas.</P>

The current EC structures regime which expires on 31 December 1986 provides the sum of 34 million ECU for such projects in all member states and Irish projects compete on their merits with all other Community projects.  Grants of up to 50 per cent are available to Irish projects approved by the EC Commission.

      <P>Before a Road Freight Certificate is granted to a person or firm setting up a road haulage business, on or after 1 January, 1978, applicants must satisfy the EC requirements of good repute, sound financial standing and professional competence. The Regulations (S.I.

    </Speaker>
    <P>In determining good repute, account is taken of any convictions which an applicant <Col N="2409" /> may have had in the three years preceding the date of application for certain offences as set out in Article 5 (17) of the Regulations and as substituted by Article 6 (f) of S.I. No. 431 of 1981.</P>
    <P>Financial standing is determined by an applicant furnishing a Statutory Declaration that he is not an undischarged bankrupt and proving the availability of vehicles or sufficient resources to ensure the establishment and proper administration of the business.  Articles 5 (13) (14) and (15) of the Regulations refer.</P>
    <P>Applicants may satisfy the requirement as to professional competence by acquiring a Certificate of Professional Competence which may be obtained as set out below or by designating a professionally competent person, within his company, to undertake the continuous and effective management of the business:</P>
    <P>(i)  passing an examination;</P>
    <P>(ii)  proving experience as the operator or manager of a lawfully established merchandise road transport business prior to 1 January 1975;</P>
    <P>(iii)  having three years experience as the operator or manager of a lawfully established merchandise road transport business between 1 January, 1975 and before 1 January, 1980 (applications under this clause not accepted after 31 December, 1979);</P>

    <P>Non-Merchandise Licence holders who were engaged in haulage prior to 1 January, 1975, outside of the exempted areas, were not granted Road Freight Certificates.</P>
    <P>3.  <i>Non-Merchandise Licence Holders who first commenced Haulage in an Exempted Area between</i> 1 <i>January</i>, 1975 <Col N="2410" /><i>and</i> 31 <i>December</i>, 1977 <i>(Part (F) of Question)</i></P>
    <P>Persons or firms who entered the road haulage industry between 1 January, 1975 and 31 December, 1977, were granted International Road Freight Certificates subject to proving professional competence by 31 December, 1979 &mdash; Article 5 (5) of the Regulations refers.</P>
    <P>4.  <i>Non-Merchandise Licence Holders who first engaged in Haulage in an Exempted Area after</i> 1 <i>January</i>, 1978 <i>(Part (G) of Question)</i></P>

      <P>In the examples given it is assumed that the Deputy is referring to vehicles imported from another EC country.  Customs duty may also be payable on vehicles imported from non-EC countries. The reference in the details supplied by the Deputy to CIF price is taken to mean a reference to the import value for Customs purposes.</P>
      <P>The information requested is as follows:</P>
      <P>(a)  New vehicle, with an import value of £3,500, whether imported by a main distributor or a private person:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Excise Duty (assuming a recommended retail sale price for the vehicle in the State of £10,000 and that the engine capacity is not more than 2012 c.c.) = 21.7% of £10,000 = £2,170 VAT on importation &mdash; 25% of the sum of the import value and the excise <Col N="2412" /> duty (viz. £5,670) = £1,417.50; Total = £3,587.50.  Additional VAT would be payable on subsequent sale transactions in the State by a trader.</P>
    <P>(b)  Secondhand standard model Mercedes 200 motor car.  (Assumed to have been first registered in mid-1982): (1)  imported by a main distributor with an import value of £6,087 (assumed to have been bought net of VAT) &mdash; Excise duty &mdash; 21.7 per cent of the current recommended retail sale price (viz. £27,425) less 60 per cent depreciation = £2,380.49; VAT on importation [calculated as in example (a)] = £2,116.87; Total = £4,497.36.</P>
    <P>Additional VAT would be payable on subsequent sale transactions in the State by a trader.</P>
    <P>(2)  With an import value of £7,000 which includes residual VAT of £913, imported by a private person.  (It is assumed that the Deputy has in mind a person entitled to VAT relief under the terms of the European Court of Justice decisions 15/81 and 47/84. Under the terms of those decisions, a secondhand motor vehicle acquired from a person in another member state of the EEC who is not entitled under the VAT laws of that state to deduction or refund of the tax thereon, may qualify for credit at importation in respect of the residual part of the last value-added tax paid in the exporting member state which is still contained in the value of the vehicle at importation. The grant of such credit is subject to production, by the importer, of adequate documentary proof (i.e. original invoice or a copy thereof) showing the last levy of VAT on the vehicle in the member state of exportation.  The amount of credit, if allowable, may not exceed the original VAT paid.  The amount allowable is deductible (a) from the value at importation for VAT purposes and (b) from the actual charge to VAT at importation) &mdash; Excise duty [as in example (b) (1)] = £2,380.49; VAT (see calculation <Col N="2413" /> below) = £1,203.87; Total = £3,584.36.</P>
    <P>Calculation of VAT in example (b) (2) Import Value = £7,000; Less residual VAT content, (£913) = £6,087; Excise duty [as in example (b) (1)] = £2,380.49; Value for VAT purposes = £8,467.49; VAT @ 25% = £2,116.87; Deduct residual VAT = £913; Net VAT payable = £1,203.87.</P>

      <P>Following reinvestigation of the unemployment assistance claim of the person concerned, he was assessed with means of £32.35 weekly, effective from 22 October 1986, derived from benefit from his wife's earnings.  He is, accordingly, currently in receipt of unemployment assistance of £39.50 weekly being the appropriate maximum rate payable in his case, of £71.85 less means of £32.35.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Social Welfare (No. 2) Act, 1985, provides for equal treatment for men and women in matters of social welfare.  It includes a revised definition of the term &ldquo;adult dependant&rdquo; and gives men and women an equal right to claim increases for child dependants.  In accordance with regulations under the Act, a claimant's spouse who is in insurable employment and earning more than £50 weekly will not be admitted as a dependant of the claimant and the increase in respect of child dependants will be paid at half the appropriate rate.  Where an adult dependant allowance is not payable, half of the joint means of the claimant and <Col N="2415" /> spouse will be assessed against the claimant.</P>
    <P>The person concerned is a married man claiming increases of unemployment assistance in respect of an adult dependant and one child dependant.  In a reply to a questionnaire issued by the Department to enable his entitlement under the new provisions to be determined from 19 November 1986, he has indicated that his wife is insurably employed and earning more than £50 weekly.  Accordingly, from 19 November, he will not be entitled to an adult dependant allowance and he will be entitled to half the child dependant rate only.  Half of their joint means will be assessed against him.  His weekly rate of payment from 19 November will be £24.85, comprising his personal rate of £36.70 and a child dependant increase of £4.35, less half the joint means, £16.20.</P>

      <P>Entitlement to unemployment benefit is subject to the condition that a claimant must have at least 26 contributions paid or credited at the appropriate rate in the contribution year which governs the claim.  The person concerned claimed unemployment benefit from 7 August 1986.  His claim was disallowed on the grounds that he had insufficient contributions paid or credited during the contribution year 6 April 1984 to 5 April 1985 which governed his claim.  According to the records of the Department he had 18 Class A contributions and three credited contributions, a total of 21, in that period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He claimed unemployment assistance and his claim was referred to a social welfare officer for investigation.  Inquiries were recently completed and it has been established that he is entitled to unemployment assistance of £1.60 weekly, being the appropriate maximum <Col N="2416" /> rate payable in his case of £56.95, less means of £55.35.  His means are derived from his wife's earnings and from the profit from his holding.  All arrears of unemployment assistance due will be paid to him next week.</P>

      <P>Following reinvestigation of the unemployment assistance claim of the person concerned, he has been assessed with means of £33 weekly, derived from the value of board and lodgings on his father's holding for the period 6 June 1986 to 28 September 1986.  On 29 September 1986, his father's holding was transferred to him and his claim has be disallowed from that date on the grounds that his means, derived from the profit from his holding, exceed the statutory limit.</P>
      <P>The assessment entitles him to unemployment assistance from 6 June 1986 at £25.35 weekly, being the appropriate maximum rate payable to a married person and his wife of £58.35 less means of £33.  This rate was increased to £28.30 from 9 July 1986 in accordance with increases awarded in the 1986 budget. Arrears for the period 6 June 1986 to 28 September 1986 will be paid to him this week.  He is not entitled to unemployment assistance from 29 September 1986.  If the person concerned is dissatisfied with the amount of means assessed against him it is open to him to appeal and have his case determined by an appeals officer.  A form for this purpose may be obtained at his local office.</P>

      <P>The person concerned was in <Col N="2417" /> receipt of an old age contributory pension which included an increase for an adult dependant in respect of his wife.  A supplementary book containing orders payable at £5.55 per week was issued to him to cover the increase in the rate of adult dependant's allowance which is payable when the dependant reaches age 66.</P>
      <P>His wife was awarded an old age contributory pension in her own right from 9 May 1986.  He was asked to return his pension books for adjustment as his entitlement to an allowance for his wife ceased when she was awarded her own pension.  He returned his increased rate pension book but did not return the supplementary book even when he was further requested to do so on 30 May 1986 and 10 June 1986.  Instead he cashed the orders in this book together with his revised personal rate book.  Since he is not entitled to any increase in pension in respect of his wife the supplementary book was not renewed when the general issue of new pension books took place at the end of September 1986.  An Post has been asked to confirm the total number of orders at £5.55 which were cashed by him.  He will be required to repay the amount involved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mrs. Hussey) Gemma Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mrs. Hussey)</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising from the EC directive on equal treatment for men and women in social welfare matters, the conditions under which a person can be regarded as an adult dependant for social welfare purposes are being changed.  Under the new arrangements an increase in pension in respect of an adult dependant will be payable to men and women on an equal <Col N="2418" /> basis.  The spouse of a claimant will not be regarded as an adult dependant, however, if he or she is in receipt of an independent income of more than £50 per week or is in receipt of a social welfare benefit or assistance payment in his or her own right.</P>
      <P>The spouse of the pensioner concerned is in receipt of disability benefit at £41.10 weekly in her own right and the increase in her husband's pension in respect of her will, therefore, cease with effect from 20 November 1986.  The pensioner will, however, be allowed a special payment of £10 per week.  This will continue to be paid to him for up to 52 weeks or until his spouse ceases to claim disability benefit, whichever is the earlier.</P>
      <P>In any case where the withdrawal of the increase for an adult dependant would impose severe hardship because of, for example, high rent or mortgage payment, the person concerned may qualify for a supplementary welfare allowance.  Any application for this allowance should be made to the local community welfare officer.</P>
